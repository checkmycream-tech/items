            <li>I Love it!</li>
            <li>But I still buy it again because it is the MOST WATERPROOF OUT THERE!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just amazing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice for just thickening the look of your lash line.</li>
            <li>Liked this a lot</li>
            <li>Works good, easy to use if you&#x27;re accustomed to wearing liner.</li>
            <li>The liner is good but the packaging has a HUGE flaw.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think I am able to do eyeliner on my own.  </li>
            <li>This eyeliner was so easy to put on!  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this liner!  </li>
            <li>I am completely in love with this eye liner.</li>
            <li>I love this lining.  </li>
            <li>Holy grail item now for sure.</li>
            <li>Love this....</li>
            <li>I use this under the eyelashes for more depth.</li>
            <li>I get get my lines thinner and sleeker, and I have a lot more control.</li>
            <li>Love the company</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not my favorite.</li>
            <li>This is a great concept but the execution left a good deal to be desired.</li>
            <li>I love how the tip is.</li>
            <li>This product was okay.</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I used the eyeliner and practiced at home</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE  </li>
            <li>I was very excited about this product</li>
            <li>great product for the older woman who doesn&#x27;t want tons of eyeliner on lids.  </li>
            <li>But sometimes it&#x27;s just nice to have sweet, close lines to emphasize your eyes.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product and loved for the first two days</li>
            <li>I love this liner because it is really easy to use for a liquid liner.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of this eyeliner, since I have light lashes and dotting the ink in between them makes my eyes look fuller.</li>
            <li>and it was getting great reviews; but it was completely out of stock everywhere.  </li>
            <li>So easy to use, even I can do &amp;#34;cat eyes!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>So easy to apply and for a smoky effect</li>
            <li>So easy to use for person who just learns to make up.</li>
            <li>So easy.</li>
            <li>easy to use</li>
            <li>Makes it so easy</li>
            <li>easy to apply and lasts longer than eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for dotting between lashes, and when used as a regular liner it is easy and gives a lovely fine line.</li>
            <li>I still find Benefit&#x27;s Push Up Liner to be the darkest pigmented black and have the best all-day staying power for oily lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it effortlessly put a nice straight line on so fine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it every which way and can&#x27;t get a smooth line.  </li>
            <li>this eyeliner is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Too Faced Eyeliner because of the unique point.</li>
            <li>Defiantly worth the price!</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this and plan on continuing to buy more.</li>
            <li>so they look super full.</li>
            <li>Exact and easy to use.</li>
            <li>For the first week this is a 5 star item, BUT I&#x27;d dries out extremely quickly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never lined my eyes so quickly.  </li>
            <li>But so is anything that&#x27;s a new, innovative product.</li>
            <li>Goes on extremely easily and is very controllable.</li>
            <li>I use it for tight lining and it works great.</li>
            <li>I am sure in the proper hands, it works fine.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be more careful with the cap and making sure</li>
            <li>I can just dot dot dot to make it more natural.  </li>
            <li>then it was worth.</li>
            <li>It does tend to dry up quickly, which I don&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li>Other than that, love it!</li>
            <li>This will not typically last you more than a month.</li>
            <li>My favorite way to apply eyeline, especially a winged liner is with a gel liner and a angled brush.</li>
            <li>I cant say enough about how much I love this product....</li>
            <li>The 3 tips are interesting, though not completely necessary.  </li>
            <li>I found this similar product from too faced (at a more reasonable price as well) and ordered it right away.  </li>
            <li>and I really can&#x27;t put it on right</li>
            <li>I have tried tons of different eyeliners of all kinds and this is by far my favorite!  </li>
            <li>Very cool, and will take getting used to for proper application.</li>
            <li>It also looked as if my eyes were very smudged but not on purpose, more like the makeup had been on my face for way too long (even if just applied).  </li>
            <li>I have tried for a long time to find a good easy to put on long lasting ( will not flake) eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It really is waterproof and is still on when I wake up in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I have to really scrub my eyes with makeup remover to get it all off.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really make much of a difference.</li>
            <li>This is so much easier for me than using a brush and gel liner, so I hope</li>
            <li>i am very particular/</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>While putting it back into my travel bag, I must not have placed the cap on securely and it came off.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pigmented.</li>
            <li>This product worked really well fora out 5 uses.</li>
            <li>Better eye-liner than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely perfect for creating a dark black line directly on my lash line, the result being very noticeable yet still very natural like I prefer.</li>
            <li>Goes on so nice and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Putting my eyeliner on with this is so much easier than with normal cauldron and brush or paint on liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It was marketed as a whole new approach to applying eyeliner</li>
            <li>I love how black the liner is</li>
            <li>This is one of the most waterproof liners (liquid or pencil) that I have found, and when it does come off it doesn&#x27;t leave permanent black shadows under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Decent pigment, decent staying power.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I tried re-moisturizing it wil water for a few days, but nothing was able to fix it.</li>
            <li>It ended up being more trouble</li>
            <li>But it dried out so quickly it wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>New look is tightlining.</li>
            <li>This is a very cool little eye liner.</li>
            <li>For those who have a hard time making a straight line, the tips allow you to dot it along first and then follow with a clean line.</li>
            <li>Tight lining has become so easy for me with this pen.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that you can line in 3 different ways...especially under the last line, which is what I do to make my eyes look larger.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s a unique idea that works... just not enough to overshadow my regular go-to liner.</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re going to purchase this product be VERY careful how you keep it to make sure the cap stays on, or else you will have a $30 piece of trash shortly after you buy it.</li>
            <li>The three pointed applicator makes it so easy to place the little dots of liner between your lashes.</li>
            <li>my only issue is it is kind of small.</li>
            <li>Now I have scotch tape around the cap to secure it tightly.</li>
            <li>I used to use those with a small brush, but this one has three small, lined-up tips at the end that allows for great control and even line.</li>
            <li>Atop of that, it was very very difficult to use as a regular eyeliner (ie: I was only successful using it to draw fillers between my eyelashes because I couldn&#x27;t make a smooth line).</li>
            <li>I had wanted this product the moment I learned of it when it came out as new from a different manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>The only cons are that I have had 2 of these so far where the cap has popped off in my makeup bag.  </li>
            <li>It barely lasted me a month.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more natural than a typical eye liner, and when I use it as a base layer with gel liner and a brush, it looks amazing.</li>
            <li>But as long as you&#x27;re careful and don&#x27;t mind a little work removing it, this is a fantastic eyeliner!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good second if the Push Up Liner is sold out and you&#x27;re in desperate need of something else.</li>
            <li>I can make the look more extreme by making thick lines or</li>
            <li>My one complaint, and manufacturers please pay attention, is that it dries out too quickly.</li>
            <li>I usually draw in the dots, then wiggle the applicator very slightly to &amp;#34;connect the dots&amp;#34; and make a more solid line.</li>

            <li> I have tried for a long time to find a good easy to put on long lasting ( will not flake) eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It really is waterproof and is still on when I wake up in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I have to really scrub my eyes with makeup remover to get it all off.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really make much of a difference.</li>
            <li> This is so much easier for me than using a brush and gel liner, so I hope</li>
            <li> i am very particular/</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> While putting it back into my travel bag, I must not have placed the cap on securely and it came off.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pigmented.</li>
            <li> This product worked really well fora out 5 uses.</li>
            <li> Better eye-liner than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely perfect for creating a dark black line directly on my lash line, the result being very noticeable yet still very natural like I prefer.</li>
            <li> Goes on so nice and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Putting my eyeliner on with this is so much easier than with normal cauldron and brush or paint on liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It was marketed as a whole new approach to applying eyeliner</li>
            <li> I love how black the liner is</li>
            <li> This is one of the most waterproof liners (liquid or pencil) that I have found, and when it does come off it doesn&#x27;t leave permanent black shadows under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Decent pigment, decent staying power.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I tried re-moisturizing it wil water for a few days, but nothing was able to fix it.</li>
            <li> It ended up being more trouble</li>
            <li> But it dried out so quickly it wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> New look is tightlining.</li>
            <li> This is a very cool little eye liner.</li>
            <li> For those who have a hard time making a straight line, the tips allow you to dot it along first and then follow with a clean line.</li>
            <li> Tight lining has become so easy for me with this pen.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you can line in 3 different ways...especially under the last line, which is what I do to make my eyes look larger.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s a unique idea that works... just not enough to overshadow my regular go-to liner.</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re going to purchase this product be VERY careful how you keep it to make sure the cap stays on, or else you will have a $30 piece of trash shortly after you buy it.</li>
            <li> The three pointed applicator makes it so easy to place the little dots of liner between your lashes.</li>
            <li> my only issue is it is kind of small.</li>
            <li> Now I have scotch tape around the cap to secure it tightly.</li>
            <li> I used to use those with a small brush, but this one has three small, lined-up tips at the end that allows for great control and even line.</li>
            <li> Atop of that, it was very very difficult to use as a regular eyeliner (ie: I was only successful using it to draw fillers between my eyelashes because I couldn&#x27;t make a smooth line).</li>
            <li> I had wanted this product the moment I learned of it when it came out as new from a different manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> The only cons are that I have had 2 of these so far where the cap has popped off in my makeup bag.  </li>
            <li> It barely lasted me a month.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more natural than a typical eye liner, and when I use it as a base layer with gel liner and a brush, it looks amazing.</li>
            <li> But as long as you&#x27;re careful and don&#x27;t mind a little work removing it, this is a fantastic eyeliner!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a good second if the Push Up Liner is sold out and you&#x27;re in desperate need of something else.</li>
            <li> I can make the look more extreme by making thick lines or</li>
            <li> My one complaint, and manufacturers please pay attention, is that it dries out too quickly.</li>
            <li> I usually draw in the dots, then wiggle the applicator very slightly to &amp;#34;connect the dots&amp;#34; and make a more solid line.</li>
            <li> It is more subtle than the stark line across the lid which you can also do with this tool.  </li>
            <li> The black is so dark and pretty,</li>
            <li> You can use it flat against the lash line, and curl lashes, mascara...</li>
            <li> (They last a long time!)</li>
            <li> It is hard to use and no matter how much I practice</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it&#x27;s kind of difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Product also distributes evenly and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I also have very long lashes to begin with</li>
            <li> It will irreversibly dry out.</li>
            <li> The cap came off in my makeup bag which caused the liner to completely dry up.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to go from thin to thick in seconds !</li>
            <li> One small complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t travel well - if the cap comes off it dries out quickly.  </li>
            <li> The only down fall</li>
            <li> Once I noticed it a few hours later the eyeliner was completely dry.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and can make it as thick or thin you eant</li>
            <li> My cap came off the day after I bought it and the entire product dried up.</li>
            <li> My cap is always securely closed.</li>
            <li> it only comes in black!</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews that say it dries out because you don&#x27;t click the cap closed.</li>
            <li> It beats all the other liquid liner&#x27;s I have tried.</li>
            <li> a cat eye/winged look easily, due to the thickness of the three prongs if used sideways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At that pint it was difficult to consistently get liner on the brush.</li>
            <li> It became so dry it was not usalble after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It fills in places that typically are neglected by other products.</li>
            <li> I am terrible with liquid eye liner and this makes it very easy to apply!</li>
            <li> I use it daily to tight line my eyes for a low maintanance look, but can also create dramatic cat-eye look, as well.</li>
            <li> I have even tried storing it tip down to lengthen time of usage.</li>
            <li> Dark black, doesnt smudge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it has to be matt black and not flake or smudge off during the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to get a thin line with the prongs but not impossible.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It causes uneven application after.</li>
            <li> Then the cap accidentally came off another one while in my drawer, and again, dried out.</li>
            <li> Waste of $20...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one ladies.</li>
            <li> but I disliked the product.</li>
            <li> One of the few that does not end up under my eyes at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t get it thin enough to be how I like it.  </li>
            <li> I curl my lashes and apply one maybe two coats of mascara (in very black) maximum because anymore</li>
            <li> So each time I put it on, I just looked as if I had way too much makeup on and that the makeup was put on badly.  </li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look really thick.</li>
            <li> so I am not a fan of big smudgy eyes at all, I have always felt they looked overdone and bad.  </li>
            <li> and you can adjust the line to thick or thin</li>
            <li> This is also a pain if you smudge your liner while applying it because it&#x27;s tough to fix.</li>
            <li> Even when I do that it&#x27;s still a very subtle effect.</li>
            <li> So, it can be expensive if you are going through one a month like I have been.  </li>
            <li> I have tried extremely expensive brands (after being schooled by the folks who sell it) and the drugstore brands</li>
            <li> and my lashes look too fake, so</li>
            <li> and I am very bad at applying eyeliner well.  </li>
            <li> I hate it!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this stuff!  One small complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t travel well - if the cap comes off it dries out quickly.  Other than that, love it!</li>
            <li> I am completely in love with this eye liner. Tight lining has become so easy for me with this pen. The black is so dark and pretty, just the way I like it. Definitely recommend to all.</li>
            <li> Goes on so nice and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it every which way and can&#x27;t get a smooth line.  Does fill in lash line but that&#x27;s it.  A waste of money.  Won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this eyeliner, since I have light lashes and dotting the ink in between them makes my eyes look fuller. It&#x27;s more natural than a typical eye liner, and when I use it as a base layer with gel liner and a brush, it looks amazing. There&#x27;s no gap between my eyelid and my lashes so they look super full. It does tend to dry up quickly, which I don&#x27;t love. It causes uneven application after. This is my second purchase of the eyeliner, and I can&#x27;t decide if I&#x27;m going for a third time.</li>
            <li> I love this lining.  It&#x27;s  perfect for me.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner was so easy to put on!  It stays on where I put it, too.  It really is waterproof and is still on when I wake up in the morning.  There was no smudging.  The three &amp;#34;prongs&amp;#34; are great if you just want to leave dots of eyeliner between lashes.  It is more subtle than the stark line across the lid which you can also do with this tool.  Either way, it is a good eyeliner, and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is the best method I&#x27;ve found for tightlining. The three pointed applicator makes it so easy to place the little dots of liner between your lashes. I usually draw in the dots, then wiggle the applicator very slightly to &amp;#34;connect the dots&amp;#34; and make a more solid line. Even when I do that it&#x27;s still a very subtle effect. My only complaint is it&#x27;s kind of difficult to remove. I have to really scrub my eyes with makeup remover to get it all off. This is also a pain if you smudge your liner while applying it because it&#x27;s tough to fix. But as long as you&#x27;re careful and don&#x27;t mind a little work removing it, this is a fantastic eyeliner!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!  Great liner and met all my expectations!</li>
            <li> Better eye-liner than any other I&#x27;ve tried. My one complaint, and manufacturers please pay attention, is that it dries out too quickly. And don&#x27;t ever forget to put the cap back on. It will irreversibly dry out. Some how cap came off during travel, and after 3 hour trip, the eyeliner was gone, no longer usable. Then the cap accidentally came off another one while in my drawer, and again, dried out. Lost two eyeliners in one week. Now I have scotch tape around the cap to secure it tightly. Great product. Casing no so good.</li>
            <li> Best felt tip eyeliner... Easy to apply and can make it as thick or thin you eant</li>
            <li> The cap doesn&#x27;t stay on well. My cap came off the day after I bought it and the entire product dried up. I didn&#x27;t even get to try the eyeliner. Waste of $20...</li>
            <li> This eye liner works wonders. I am terrible with liquid eye liner and this makes it very easy to apply!</li>
            <li> For the first week this is a 5 star item, BUT I&#x27;d dries out extremely quickly! This will not typically last you more than a month. I have read other reviews that say it dries out because you don&#x27;t click the cap closed. My cap is always securely closed. I have even tried storing it tip down to lengthen time of usage. Didn&#x27;t really make much of a difference. For a price point over 20 dollars this item squeaks by with three stars!</li>
            <li> The liner is good but the packaging has a HUGE flaw. The cap came off in my makeup bag which caused the liner to completely dry up. Ive had it for about 3 weeks and it might as well be trash now. I&#x27;m not the only person who has had this problem either so if you&#x27;re going to purchase this product be VERY careful how you keep it to make sure the cap stays on, or else you will have a $30 piece of trash shortly after you buy it.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner! Easy to control and best liquid eyeliner out there. I used to use those with a small brush, but this one has three small, lined-up tips at the end that allows for great control and even line. For those who have a hard time making a straight line, the tips allow you to dot it along first and then follow with a clean line. Product also distributes evenly and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Where to start on this one....I hate it! It is hard to use and no matter how much I practice I don&#x27;t get results like Too Faced claim. I love how black the liner is but that&#x27;s about it. My favorite way to apply eyeline, especially a winged liner is with a gel liner and a angled brush. I will be sticking with that technique. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one ladies.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this liner!  It stays put and looks great.  So easy to use, even I can do &amp;#34;cat eyes!&amp;#34;  But sometimes it&#x27;s just nice to have sweet, close lines to emphasize your eyes.  Buying a second one now!  (They last a long time!)</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner I have every used.  I love the fact that you can line in 3 different ways...especially under the last line, which is what I do to make my eyes look larger.  Doesn&#x27;t smear, either.</li>
            <li> This is incredibly awesome!!!  I line the inside of my upper lid at the lash line as well as over the lid at the lash line. Helps makes my lashes look longer and fuller. So easy to apply and for a smoky effect I just smudge shadow over it. Awesome!</li>
            <li> I cant say enough about how much I love this product....I have tried tons of different eyeliners of all kinds and this is by far my favorite!  The only down fall it only comes in black!</li>
            <li> I am beyond in love with this lining tool! It is absolutely perfect for creating a dark black line directly on my lash line, the result being very noticeable yet still very natural like I prefer. Lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge or transfer. This is so much easier for me than using a brush and gel liner, so I hope Too Faced never stops carrying this 3-Way Lash Lining Tool! Holy grail item now for sure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for dotting between lashes, and when used as a regular liner it is easy and gives a lovely fine line.</li>
            <li> I Love it! So easy to use for person who just learns to make up. I have recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> So easy. Makes my lashes look really thick. You can use it flat against the lash line, and curl lashes, mascara...your eyes look amazing!  And it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I have tried for a long time to find a good easy to put on long lasting ( will not flake) eyeliner. I saw this on one of my tv shows then I saw it in my style magazine so I thought I would give it a try. OMG - this is a great product. I even pinned it on my Pinterest board!</li>
            <li> i am very particular/picky about eyeliners.&lt;br /&gt;it has to be matt black and not flake or smudge off during the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is everything i wanted it to be. i would definitely recommend this product and repurchase when i run out.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever had.  Bought 3 of them.  Great for trips, easy to use and you can adjust the line to thick or thin and it effortlessly put a nice straight line on so fine that sometimes I have to go back over it to make it a bit thicker.  It&#x27;s just amazing.  I&#x27;ve never lined my eyes so quickly.  Did I say, &amp;#34;A Must Have&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> This applies very differently than regular eyeliner. It fills in places that typically are neglected by other products. I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for eyeliner. Exact and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love this.... New look is tightlining. Makes it so easy and you can use it traditionally too.</li>
            <li> I really like this Too Faced Eyeliner because of the unique point. It is versatile to dot the upper eyelash or to draw a line.</li>
            <li> good product.  easy to apply and lasts longer than eyeliner.  great product for the older woman who doesn&#x27;t want tons of eyeliner on lids.  I use this under the eyelashes for more depth.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to say that this eyeliner is AWESOME. It beats all the other liquid liner&#x27;s I have tried. Defiantly worth the price!</li>
            <li> Putting my eyeliner on with this is so much easier than with normal cauldron and brush or paint on liquid eyeliner. I get get my lines thinner and sleeker, and I have a lot more control. It&#x27;s also nice for just thickening the look of your lash line. This has become a staple in my makeup routine.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and loved for the first two days I had it. While putting it back into my travel bag, I must not have placed the cap on securely and it came off. Once I noticed it a few hours later the eyeliner was completely dry. I tried re-moisturizing it wil water for a few days, but nothing was able to fix it. I&#x27;m now buying it again and I&#x27;ll be more careful with the cap and making sure I hear it \\&quot;click\\&quot; shut.</li>
            <li> This is a very cool little eye liner. I use it to fill in the spots that eyelashes are sparse. Works good and does the job. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I swim daily, and have tried over 20 &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; eyeliners (from drugstore brands to just about every line that Sephora carries.)  This is one of the most waterproof liners (liquid or pencil) that I have found, and when it does come off it doesn&#x27;t leave permanent black shadows under my eyes.  The 3 tips are interesting, though not completely necessary.  The only cons are that I have had 2 of these so far where the cap has popped off in my makeup bag.  Once this happens, there is no using the product again.  The tip dries out almost instantly, and no soaking or attempts to fix it will work.  So, it can be expensive if you are going through one a month like I have been.  But I still buy it again because it is the MOST WATERPROOF OUT THERE!</li>
            <li> Love the company but I disliked the product. I&#x27;d become a panda within an hour! I tried everything from primers to setting it with powder but it didn&#x27;t work. Atop of that, it was very very difficult to use as a regular eyeliner (ie: I was only successful using it to draw fillers between my eyelashes because I couldn&#x27;t make a smooth line). I&#x27;d pass on this one.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing creation!!! I&#x27;m so impressed. I would absolutely recommend this and plan on continuing to buy more.</li>
            <li> smudges a lot..  I don&#x27;t recommend it to people who don&#x27;t like to fix their makeup all the time. t</li>
            <li> This tool is so versatile. I use it daily to tight line my eyes for a low maintanance look, but can also create dramatic cat-eye look, as well. I also use it to tightline in combination with brown eye pencils. Great tool!</li>
            <li> Works good, easy to use if you&#x27;re accustomed to wearing liner. Dark black, doesnt smudge. Will definitely buy again. Thanks</li>
            <li> I love this liner because it is really easy to use for a liquid liner.  I can make the look more extreme by making thick lines or I can just dot dot dot to make it more natural.  Only downside is that if you ever forget to cap it (or the cap comes off in your purse) then the product dries up overnight and it is unusable.</li>
            <li> Awesome eyeliner. It&#x27;s very pigmented. I use it for tight lining and it works great. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use.  Even my unsteady hand turned out a good look.  I will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> One of the few that does not end up under my eyes at the end of the day. Goes on extremely easily and is very controllable.</li>
            <li> Liked this a lot but it&#x27;s not my favorite. I still find Benefit&#x27;s Push Up Liner to be the darkest pigmented black and have the best all-day staying power for oily lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good second if the Push Up Liner is sold out and you&#x27;re in desperate need of something else. Decent pigment, decent staying power. It&#x27;s difficult to get a thin line with the prongs but not impossible. I like that it allows you to &amp;#34;fill in&amp;#34; a cat eye/winged look easily, due to the thickness of the three prongs if used sideways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a unique idea that works... just not enough to overshadow my regular go-to liner.</li>
            <li> This product worked really well fora out 5 uses. At that pint it was difficult to consistently get liner on the brush. It ended up being more trouble then it was worth. This is a great concept but the execution left a good deal to be desired. Sticking with smudge pots.</li>
            <li> I love how the tip is. It is very easy to go from thin to thick in seconds !</li>
            <li> This product was okay. The eyeliner worked great and stayed on all day. But it dried out so quickly it wasn&#x27;t worth the money. It barely lasted me a month. And the cap was kept on it. It became so dry it was not usalble after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> this eyeliner is fantastic. its great because you can do so many things with it. my only issue is it is kind of small.</li>
            <li> I had wanted this product the moment I learned of it when it came out as new from a different manufacturer.  It was marketed as a whole new approach to applying eyeliner and I am very bad at applying eyeliner well.  I thought that this would be perfect for me and it was getting great reviews; but it was completely out of stock everywhere.  I found this similar product from too faced (at a more reasonable price as well) and ordered it right away.  No matter how many times I used the eyeliner and practiced at home, I couldn&#x27;t get it thin enough to be how I like it.  So each time I put it on, I just looked as if I had way too much makeup on and that the makeup was put on badly.  It also looked as if my eyes were very smudged but not on purpose, more like the makeup had been on my face for way too long (even if just applied).  I was very excited about this product and it&#x27;s price.  I am sure in the proper hands, it works fine.  I just don&#x27;t think I am able to do eyeliner on my own.  I have tried extremely expensive brands (after being schooled by the folks who sell it) and the drugstore brands and I really can&#x27;t put it on right or maybe I just don&#x27;t like how it looks on me.  I also have very long lashes to begin with so I am not a fan of big smudgy eyes at all, I have always felt they looked overdone and bad.  I curl my lashes and apply one maybe two coats of mascara (in very black) maximum because anymore and my lashes look too fake, so keep that in mind also when reviewing my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll tell you why I like this stuff... It&#x27;s different than regular eyeliner pencil. There&#x27;s no line that screams, \\&quot;Hey! I&#x27;m wearing eyeliner!\\&quot; It does what eyeliner was MEANT to do, which is give the illusion of fuller lashes. Very cool, and will take getting used to for proper application. But so is anything that&#x27;s a new, innovative product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE  this eyeliner. I will never use another. It goes on so smoothly and lasts all day. I</li>
