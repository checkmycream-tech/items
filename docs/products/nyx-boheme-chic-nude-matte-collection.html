            <li>This is great.  </li>
            <li>I got two of these pallets and are great.</li>
            <li>This collection is great.</li>
            <li>The mirror is great for travel.</li>
            <li>All neutral colors in matte finish which is great on \\&quot;mature\\&quot; skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this is a great palette for the money.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and packaging was great.</li>
            <li>NYX eye shadow has great pigmentation and wear</li>
            <li>It arrived in one piece, great condition, no breakage or cracking of the powder or case.  </li>
            <li>I find that the pigment in these eyeshadows isn&#x27;t that great.  </li>
            <li>but the eye shadows are great.</li>
            <li>The pallet is matte and the pigment is great.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s box, packaged very nicely for travel.  </li>
            <li>The blushes are both beautiful bright mattes.  </li>
            <li>Perfect neutrals, the blush is adorable, great pigmentation.</li>
            <li>use it mostly for work and the shadows have very good staying power!</li>
            <li>The NYX jumbo pencil also comes in deeper shades that might work well as a good base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But finding out about nyx from youtube videos of gorgeous women who showed applications and reviews, I decided to try this.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m giving it a fair 4 stars.</li>
            <li>so I cannot comment if they are good colors or not</li>
            <li>All in all, I think it is a very lovely palette</li>
            <li>color choice is great, and I love that everything is MATTE.  </li>
            <li>Bought this palette after reading a review from a woman with crepe-y eyes, ME TOO... great finish, smooth application and wears all day!</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and it shows nicely on my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I love this matte palette!</li>
            <li>Love the colors!</li>
            <li>These are beautiful and richly pigmented.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat NYX&#x27;s prices for nice quality makeup.</li>
            <li>but I am thrilled I did.</li>
            <li>There are some beautiful shadows that work really well for my coloring, which is pinky fair.</li>
            <li>The colors are absolutely gorgeous but they require a really good eye shadow primer to get the full effect of the colors on darker skin tones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s suitable for all but the fairest and darkest skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still love it because of the variety of the colors, just have to kind of watch</li>
            <li>I took this with me on vacation because it has many eyeshadow colors and nice cheek colors that are blendable.  </li>
            <li>but I recently have been hearing that nyx makeup is a great product with a great price</li>
            <li>I love ALL the colors and am so happy I found cheap &amp;#34;Not cheaply made&amp;#34; but affordable makeup to buy.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and for a great price.  </li>
            <li>and this is just perfect and such a bargain also.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for an all matte quality product that did not cost more than my budget would allow.</li>
            <li>I really love this palette.  </li>
            <li>and you can create so many looks with it.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I love all of the colors included in this palette.</li>
            <li>Love NYX and all of their products</li>
            <li>This is a great palette with good color for a low cost.</li>
            <li>Sure, it has something like 24 colors plus a couple of blushes, but here are my grumbles, in order of their importance to me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love NYX and thought I&#x27;d try this.</li>
            <li>If you like Matte eye shadows you should love this palette.  </li>
            <li>I love the colors.  </li>
            <li>I love this palette.</li>
            <li>I really, really love this pallet.</li>
            <li>Exceptionally satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Love,  love LOVE nyx eye shadows.</li>
            <li>I love the color choices in here.</li>
            <li>Very lovely more colorful shades to be used as accents to the neutrals.  </li>
            <li>The colors are pretty and will be good for all eye colors.</li>
            <li>Wow you can keep it light or darken it and the mattes are gorgeous!</li>
            <li>It will work on only some people with very fair complexions.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the two bright cheek colors.</li>
            <li>It feels natural and stays great looking all day.</li>
            <li>I really like this palette because it gives you very pretty matte colors and the blushes are great too.&lt;br /&gt;Its compact</li>
            <li>Matte shadows have not been easy to find</li>
            <li>This was easily remedied by purchasing a travel set of cosmetic brushes.  </li>
            <li>so its easy to travel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is so compact so its easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>Beautiful for blue eyed babes</li>
            <li>I love this NYX pallet because I usually prefer matte shades, not to mention the price is a steal and the quality is excellent.  </li>
            <li>Great even color, with a wide variety of warm and cool nudes/naturals.</li>
            <li>Great for travel, I use this primarily for short trips because of it&#x27;s compact size.</li>
            <li>the mirror feels securely attached.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>They stay looking freshly applied most of the day</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows go on so smoothly and did not crease.  </li>
            <li>but I really wanted to love it more than I do.</li>
            <li>Now I get it, but the top cover is still fiddly, and I always have to pick the thing up and catch the lid in just the right place.  </li>
            <li>- looks very fresh on cheeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my opinion that NYX has some of the most lovely shades of super blendable matte eyeshadows around and they&#x27;re reasonably priced also.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to see this offered.</li>
            <li>So many looks too, great all year round.</li>
            <li>and I have been looking for a matte eyeshadow kit and this one offers many colors that I love.</li>
            <li>YOu can do everything with it from a clean day</li>
            <li>I have found it to be true.</li>
            <li>Works good for brown and blue eyes.  </li>
            <li>The packaging it arrived in was elegant and absolutely gift-</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience with makeup, but I really love this.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not a bad product either,</li>
            <li>Most shadows are too shimmery for older ladies like myself.</li>
            <li>I apply it on top of concealer and natural Maybelline color tattoo, and it looks fantastic with it.</li>
            <li>The two cakes of blush and the more vibrant eyeshadow selections are bonuses.  </li>
            <li>Like any other palette, there are some colors that I like more than others as well as a mix of cool and warm shades.</li>
            <li>I like this palette very much!  </li>
            <li>So, I can&#x27;t speak with expertise, but I think even a darker skin tone could enjoy these shades if you use a primer first.  </li>
            <li>The added blush is a bonus and those colors are very pretty as well.</li>
            <li>This is a great eye shadow palette; has everything I need and would definitely recommend to everyone; will not be sorry they chose this wonderful find</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and the price.  </li>
            <li>Their is absolutely no shine and the colors are really nice!</li>
            <li>I like these eye shadows very much, however I do not use the blushes too much because I already have my favorite blush to use.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>The colors adhere very nicely and last pretty much all day.</li>
            <li>For a low cost eye shadow palette this collection is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The palette is worth buying for that alone.  </li>
            <li>The colors all seem pretty true to pan...</li>
            <li>There are also some lovely shadows that don&#x27;t work as well on me (but would probably work well for someone with olive tones or darker coloring) so there are a few really well loved shadows, and some are basically untouched.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has a great variety of colors, all matte, however, they are very powdery, so you have to be careful especially with the darker ones, when you put them on, the powder will be kind of everywhere.  </li>
            <li>As far as palettes go this one has the most usable options for me.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would like the orangy blush on the right</li>
            <li>but its quite pretty and creates a fresh, brightening look when applied.</li>
            <li>with every kind of eye shadow, wearing an eye shadow primer goes a long way towards keeping everything in its place and longevity.  </li>
            <li>I love mattes as of late and wanted to have a nice neutral palette of them for day time.  </li>
            <li>Good mattes are difficult to find, so I was thrilled to find this palette.</li>
            <li>also use a gel liner (I like Maybelline Lasting Drama) then use some of the darker bolder eyeshadow from the bottom tray right on top of the gel liner before it sets.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s quite a good purchase, though at this price one can find smth with more colours for a bright crazy make-up</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and not too pigmented so that the looks can be subtle or smoked out.</li>
            <li>The matte shades can be used to create a nice look on their own, or they can be used to blend out deeper colors from other palettes or single shadows.</li>
            <li>only received top part not at all what I thought .Was</li>
            <li>But it isn&#x27;t exactly nude.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better used as regular eyeshadow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many of the colors can also be purchased as individual size eye shadows if you find yourself with favorites.  </li>
            <li>IMO they could have left the blush out and instead offered more show colors or additional brushes.  </li>
            <li>The pigmentation level is not overwhelming, which actually makes it perfect because this is supposed to be a bohemian, not sophisticate, palette.</li>
            <li>With the right eyeshadow base/primer, the product stays on pretty much all day, even in the hot sun in Aruba.  </li>
            <li>Nice palette, the upper level colours are all useful for day make-up, from the lower one I use only purple-like colour.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use the bottom row much at all, although the blushes are both quite nice, and I do use the black shadow on the bottom row.  </li>
            <li>(I use Stila primer and Urban Decay &amp;#34;all-nighter&amp;#34; setting spray so staying power isn&#x27;t usually a huge problem with any brand).  </li>
            <li>Loads of shades in one container, for a very affordable price.  </li>
            <li>It has a variety of colors and goes on very well.</li>
            <li>The colors in this palette all go very well together and blend well</li>
            <li>This really works very well.  </li>
            <li>The shadows apply smoothly and last through out the day.</li>
            <li>Got here so fast.</li>
            <li>The palette really does have all matte finish shadows--and it&#x27;s under $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a matte palette that wasn&#x27;t too much.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t really wear it</li>
            <li>how many $ I have spent on &amp;#34;higher end&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I like the pallet so much I am contemplating on making another purchase for myself.</li>
            <li>I love this palette soooo much that when it was stolen along with my other makeup when my house was burglarized (the bag probably looked like a jewelry bag)</li>
            <li>Most of the shades can be used as eyeliner, but the purple does not go on as dark as it appears in the palette.  </li>
            <li>I have several high end palettes but really wanted to try this one because it can be difficult to find true MATTE palettes and the price was too great not to try.  </li>
            <li>How many times have you bought palettes only to find you use only one or two shades?  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a matte palette I highly recommend this one</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this NYX eye shadow collection.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this palette.  </li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with the dark plum shadow in the brighter portion of the palette!  </li>
            <li>And I also like the light pink shade</li>
            <li>There are three that could lean olive toned, some that lean pink toned, and a whole lot of other nice neutrals.  </li>
            <li>I only wear matte eyeshadow, so these were right up my alley.</li>
            <li>Who sells a new car with bald tires?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>husband bought this for me and it came brand new</li>
            <li>The colors in the drawer are quite pigmented and are not colors that I would have chosen ordinarily but after experimenting with them I really do love some of them.  </li>
            <li>I mixed them and was so pretty.  </li>
            <li>The colors for eyeshadow that I have used so far last a long time and go on easy.</li>
            <li>As long as you use with a primer, this is a decent palate, but not really very impressive - without primer, even less impressive - very faded, non-pigmented colors.</li>
            <li>Then the liner really lasts all day and does not smudge on to my upper eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>stay on for much longer than regular shadows.</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t buy this kit again, but then, I&#x27;m 62 years old, and will be nursing-home material before I&#x27;m done with it.</li>
            <li>From natural look to a smokey eye</li>
            <li>I was also surprised at the variety of shades.  </li>
            <li>I spent a lot of $$ on Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked Pallet but the UD is mostly shimmer shadows.  </li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a good Matte Palette (except for the weird bruise colors on the bottom)</li>
            <li>The 6 shades in the bottom with the blushes are certainly not nudes but they&#x27;re fun pops.</li>
            <li>There are just a few that are not matte, but the majority are so it was worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>I find myself using it for subtle daytime looks most often.</li>
            <li>It has just enough of a variety of colors, finishes and blushes so that I can come up with decent looks.</li>
            <li>There are no hidden glitter in any of them.</li>
            <li>It is true that it is a little bit powdery.  </li>
            <li>We older women are being told by the beauty experts that we matte shadows are more flattering to our less than tight eyelids.</li>
            <li>However, per advice from some other reviews I first apply NYX HD eyeshadow primer and then NYX jumbo eye pencil in milk.  </li>
            <li>NYX is generally a winner in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like all palettes with many, many shades, each little pot is small and right up against the ones next door, so it&#x27;s difficult to work with one without fluffing powder into the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Usually I&#x27;m not interested in these large palettes, but couldn&#x27;t walk away from this one.  </li>
            <li>the one on the right is a pale peachy shade I simply can&#x27;t wear.  </li>
            <li>The blushes are nice too, but it&#x27;s hard just to swipe my brush on on the blush without getting some of the side eyeshadows on it, so you may want to dab a sponge on it or use a small contour brush to get only the color you want.</li>

            <li> There are some beautiful shadows that work really well for my coloring, which is pinky fair.</li>
            <li> The colors are absolutely gorgeous but they require a really good eye shadow primer to get the full effect of the colors on darker skin tones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s suitable for all but the fairest and darkest skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still love it because of the variety of the colors, just have to kind of watch</li>
            <li> I took this with me on vacation because it has many eyeshadow colors and nice cheek colors that are blendable.  </li>
            <li> but I recently have been hearing that nyx makeup is a great product with a great price</li>
            <li> I love ALL the colors and am so happy I found cheap &amp;#34;Not cheaply made&amp;#34; but affordable makeup to buy.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and for a great price.  </li>
            <li> and this is just perfect and such a bargain also.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for an all matte quality product that did not cost more than my budget would allow.</li>
            <li> I really love this palette.  </li>
            <li> and you can create so many looks with it.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> I love all of the colors included in this palette.</li>
            <li> Love NYX and all of their products</li>
            <li> This is a great palette with good color for a low cost.</li>
            <li> Sure, it has something like 24 colors plus a couple of blushes, but here are my grumbles, in order of their importance to me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love NYX and thought I&#x27;d try this.</li>
            <li> If you like Matte eye shadows you should love this palette.  </li>
            <li> I love the colors.  </li>
            <li> I love this palette.</li>
            <li> I really, really love this pallet.</li>
            <li> Exceptionally satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love,  love LOVE nyx eye shadows.</li>
            <li> I love the color choices in here.</li>
            <li> Very lovely more colorful shades to be used as accents to the neutrals.  </li>
            <li> The colors are pretty and will be good for all eye colors.</li>
            <li> Wow you can keep it light or darken it and the mattes are gorgeous!</li>
            <li> It will work on only some people with very fair complexions.  </li>
            <li> I also really like the two bright cheek colors.</li>
            <li> It feels natural and stays great looking all day.</li>
            <li> I really like this palette because it gives you very pretty matte colors and the blushes are great too.&lt;br /&gt;Its compact</li>
            <li> Matte shadows have not been easy to find</li>
            <li> This was easily remedied by purchasing a travel set of cosmetic brushes.  </li>
            <li> so its easy to travel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is so compact so its easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Beautiful for blue eyed babes</li>
            <li> I love this NYX pallet because I usually prefer matte shades, not to mention the price is a steal and the quality is excellent.  </li>
            <li> Great even color, with a wide variety of warm and cool nudes/naturals.</li>
            <li> Great for travel, I use this primarily for short trips because of it&#x27;s compact size.</li>
            <li> the mirror feels securely attached.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> They stay looking freshly applied most of the day</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows go on so smoothly and did not crease.  </li>
            <li> but I really wanted to love it more than I do.</li>
            <li> Now I get it, but the top cover is still fiddly, and I always have to pick the thing up and catch the lid in just the right place.  </li>
            <li> - looks very fresh on cheeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my opinion that NYX has some of the most lovely shades of super blendable matte eyeshadows around and they&#x27;re reasonably priced also.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to see this offered.</li>
            <li> So many looks too, great all year round.</li>
            <li> and I have been looking for a matte eyeshadow kit and this one offers many colors that I love.</li>
            <li> YOu can do everything with it from a clean day</li>
            <li> I have found it to be true.</li>
            <li> Works good for brown and blue eyes.  </li>
            <li> The packaging it arrived in was elegant and absolutely gift-</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with makeup, but I really love this.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a bad product either,</li>
            <li> Most shadows are too shimmery for older ladies like myself.</li>
            <li> I apply it on top of concealer and natural Maybelline color tattoo, and it looks fantastic with it.</li>
            <li> The two cakes of blush and the more vibrant eyeshadow selections are bonuses.  </li>
            <li> Like any other palette, there are some colors that I like more than others as well as a mix of cool and warm shades.</li>
            <li> I like this palette very much!  </li>
            <li> So, I can&#x27;t speak with expertise, but I think even a darker skin tone could enjoy these shades if you use a primer first.  </li>
            <li> The added blush is a bonus and those colors are very pretty as well.</li>
            <li> This is a great eye shadow palette; has everything I need and would definitely recommend to everyone; will not be sorry they chose this wonderful find</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and the price.  </li>
            <li> Their is absolutely no shine and the colors are really nice!</li>
            <li> I like these eye shadows very much, however I do not use the blushes too much because I already have my favorite blush to use.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> The colors adhere very nicely and last pretty much all day.</li>
            <li> For a low cost eye shadow palette this collection is amazing.  </li>
            <li> The palette is worth buying for that alone.  </li>
            <li> The colors all seem pretty true to pan...</li>
            <li> There are also some lovely shadows that don&#x27;t work as well on me (but would probably work well for someone with olive tones or darker coloring) so there are a few really well loved shadows, and some are basically untouched.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has a great variety of colors, all matte, however, they are very powdery, so you have to be careful especially with the darker ones, when you put them on, the powder will be kind of everywhere.  </li>
            <li> As far as palettes go this one has the most usable options for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would like the orangy blush on the right</li>
            <li> but its quite pretty and creates a fresh, brightening look when applied.</li>
            <li> with every kind of eye shadow, wearing an eye shadow primer goes a long way towards keeping everything in its place and longevity.  </li>
            <li> I love mattes as of late and wanted to have a nice neutral palette of them for day time.  </li>
            <li> Good mattes are difficult to find, so I was thrilled to find this palette.</li>
            <li> also use a gel liner (I like Maybelline Lasting Drama) then use some of the darker bolder eyeshadow from the bottom tray right on top of the gel liner before it sets.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s quite a good purchase, though at this price one can find smth with more colours for a bright crazy make-up</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and not too pigmented so that the looks can be subtle or smoked out.</li>
            <li> The matte shades can be used to create a nice look on their own, or they can be used to blend out deeper colors from other palettes or single shadows.</li>
            <li> only received top part not at all what I thought .Was</li>
            <li> But it isn&#x27;t exactly nude.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better used as regular eyeshadow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many of the colors can also be purchased as individual size eye shadows if you find yourself with favorites.  </li>
            <li> IMO they could have left the blush out and instead offered more show colors or additional brushes.  </li>
            <li> The pigmentation level is not overwhelming, which actually makes it perfect because this is supposed to be a bohemian, not sophisticate, palette.</li>
            <li> With the right eyeshadow base/primer, the product stays on pretty much all day, even in the hot sun in Aruba.  </li>
            <li> Nice palette, the upper level colours are all useful for day make-up, from the lower one I use only purple-like colour.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use the bottom row much at all, although the blushes are both quite nice, and I do use the black shadow on the bottom row.  </li>
            <li> (I use Stila primer and Urban Decay &amp;#34;all-nighter&amp;#34; setting spray so staying power isn&#x27;t usually a huge problem with any brand).  </li>
            <li> Loads of shades in one container, for a very affordable price.  </li>
            <li> It has a variety of colors and goes on very well.</li>
            <li> The colors in this palette all go very well together and blend well</li>
            <li> This really works very well.  </li>
            <li> The shadows apply smoothly and last through out the day.</li>
            <li> Got here so fast.</li>
            <li> The palette really does have all matte finish shadows--and it&#x27;s under $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a matte palette that wasn&#x27;t too much.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t really wear it</li>
            <li> how many $ I have spent on &amp;#34;higher end&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I like the pallet so much I am contemplating on making another purchase for myself.</li>
            <li> I love this palette soooo much that when it was stolen along with my other makeup when my house was burglarized (the bag probably looked like a jewelry bag)</li>
            <li> Most of the shades can be used as eyeliner, but the purple does not go on as dark as it appears in the palette.  </li>
            <li> I have several high end palettes but really wanted to try this one because it can be difficult to find true MATTE palettes and the price was too great not to try.  </li>
            <li> How many times have you bought palettes only to find you use only one or two shades?  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a matte palette I highly recommend this one</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this NYX eye shadow collection.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this palette.  </li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with the dark plum shadow in the brighter portion of the palette!  </li>
            <li> And I also like the light pink shade</li>
            <li> There are three that could lean olive toned, some that lean pink toned, and a whole lot of other nice neutrals.  </li>
            <li> I only wear matte eyeshadow, so these were right up my alley.</li>
            <li> Who sells a new car with bald tires?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> husband bought this for me and it came brand new</li>
            <li> The colors in the drawer are quite pigmented and are not colors that I would have chosen ordinarily but after experimenting with them I really do love some of them.  </li>
            <li> I mixed them and was so pretty.  </li>
            <li> The colors for eyeshadow that I have used so far last a long time and go on easy.</li>
            <li> As long as you use with a primer, this is a decent palate, but not really very impressive - without primer, even less impressive - very faded, non-pigmented colors.</li>
            <li> Then the liner really lasts all day and does not smudge on to my upper eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> stay on for much longer than regular shadows.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t buy this kit again, but then, I&#x27;m 62 years old, and will be nursing-home material before I&#x27;m done with it.</li>
            <li> From natural look to a smokey eye</li>
            <li> I was also surprised at the variety of shades.  </li>
            <li> I spent a lot of $$ on Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked Pallet but the UD is mostly shimmer shadows.  </li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a good Matte Palette (except for the weird bruise colors on the bottom)</li>
            <li> The 6 shades in the bottom with the blushes are certainly not nudes but they&#x27;re fun pops.</li>
            <li> There are just a few that are not matte, but the majority are so it was worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> I find myself using it for subtle daytime looks most often.</li>
            <li> It has just enough of a variety of colors, finishes and blushes so that I can come up with decent looks.</li>
            <li> There are no hidden glitter in any of them.</li>
            <li> It is true that it is a little bit powdery.  </li>
            <li> We older women are being told by the beauty experts that we matte shadows are more flattering to our less than tight eyelids.</li>
            <li> However, per advice from some other reviews I first apply NYX HD eyeshadow primer and then NYX jumbo eye pencil in milk.  </li>
            <li> NYX is generally a winner in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like all palettes with many, many shades, each little pot is small and right up against the ones next door, so it&#x27;s difficult to work with one without fluffing powder into the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;m not interested in these large palettes, but couldn&#x27;t walk away from this one.  </li>
            <li> the one on the right is a pale peachy shade I simply can&#x27;t wear.  </li>
            <li> The blushes are nice too, but it&#x27;s hard just to swipe my brush on on the blush without getting some of the side eyeshadows on it, so you may want to dab a sponge on it or use a small contour brush to get only the color you want.</li>
            <li> I liked the shadows, and it is very difficult to find matte shadows.</li>
            <li> the shadows in the top compartment are pretty neutral and work well together, I have not used the shadows on the bottom due to their being very dark, I do not often go for the dramatic look of dark shadows.</li>
            <li> These colors are matte which is something I&#x27;ve been looking for for a long time.</li>
            <li> As far as I know, this is one of the few packages of shadow--including all the palettes, quads, trios, and duos out there, by all companies--that is 100% matte finish, and says so.  </li>
            <li> I discovered that you can wet the powder and get some actual moxie out of them that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> not really wow&#x27;d by any of it,</li>
            <li> But in general, I find the packaging slightly bulky since I don&#x27;t use that bottom row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t consider that a deterrent unless you were hell-bent against even a single bit of shimmer.</li>
            <li> I never liked using cheap makeup for fear of creasing, fading and well just not good product.</li>
            <li> like the colors of the shadows, a little to loose, but color does last.. blushes are meh...</li>
            <li> The only negative I would say is, it only comes with one applicator.  </li>
            <li> Those two are very simple non complex shades.</li>
            <li> Love Matt colors hate shimmer</li>
            <li> In the bottom compartment, the eyeshadows are a mix of non-neutral shades and black.  </li>
            <li> I use the black as powder eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> like a little case of sample makeup</li>
            <li> I have traveled with it a few times, and I had no problems, but I don&#x27;t find myself traveling with it</li>
            <li> Purchased for teen daughter, who finally tired of glitter shadow.</li>
            <li> She uses it everyday and never leaves home without it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too pale to serve as blush, and for my complexion, too peachy to use as highlighter.  </li>
            <li> It might be just me, but the thing is difficult to open.  </li>
            <li> It is my everyday eyeliner lately.  </li>
            <li> , I worry about breakage when traveling, as the packaging is hard plastic.  </li>
            <li> There is a little fallout when applying dry but not too bad.  </li>
            <li> However, the blushes are not good at all.</li>
            <li> I usually buy expensive makeup</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very subtle and may appear as a satin or semi-matte finish once on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Mediocre pigmentation.  </li>
            <li> cosmetic brands and been disappointed.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> only received top part not at all what I thought .Was like a little case of sample makeup</li>
            <li> This palette doesn&#x27;t have one bit of sparkle in it.  But it isn&#x27;t exactly nude.  Every pan is well-pigmented.  The shadows and blushes do not flake, nor appear too powdery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every eyeshadow in the upper compartment is a neutral shade.  The palette is worth buying for that alone.  In the bottom compartment, the eyeshadows are a mix of non-neutral shades and black.  I use the black as powder eyeliner.  I&#x27;ve used all the shades in the bottom compartment.  It&#x27;s possible to add a tiny pop of color to a daytime look since they are matte.  Most of the shades can be used as eyeliner, but the purple does not go on as dark as it appears in the palette.  It&#x27;s better used as regular eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the two blushes, the one on the right is a pale peachy shade I simply can&#x27;t wear.  It will work on only some people with very fair complexions.  It&#x27;s too pale to serve as blush, and for my complexion, too peachy to use as highlighter.  The blush on the left is a lot like NYX&#x27;s blush shade \\&quot;Pinched\\&quot;, but deeper.  It isn&#x27;t as deep as \\&quot;Desert Rose.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s suitable for all but the fairest and darkest skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This palette is heaven for makeup lovers.  I don&#x27;t want to wear the same shades of eyeshadow every day.  I like to mix it up.  This is great.  Loads of shades in one container, for a very affordable price.  Even if you don&#x27;t like all the shades, there are plenty you&#x27;ll find you do like.  And isn&#x27;t that enough to recommend it?  How many times have you bought palettes only to find you use only one or two shades?  This time, there may be one or two shades you don&#x27;t use.  That&#x27;s a hit.</li>
            <li> Great for travel, I use this primarily for short trips because of it&#x27;s compact size. It has just enough of a variety of colors, finishes and blushes so that I can come up with decent looks.</li>
            <li> Great even color, with a wide variety of warm and cool nudes/naturals. The 6 shades in the bottom with the blushes are certainly not nudes but they&#x27;re fun pops. The case, while a bit rattle-y because of the slide out drawer, feels well made and durable and unlike a lot of palettes the mirror feels securely attached.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would point out is that some of these shades aren&#x27;t matte. A few of the darker naturals and some of the colors have shimmer in them, though it is very sparse. I wouldn&#x27;t consider that a deterrent unless you were hell-bent against even a single bit of shimmer.</li>
            <li> I got two of these pallets and are great.</li>
            <li> Matte shadows have not been easy to find so I was excited to see this offered. We older women are being told by the beauty experts that we matte shadows are more flattering to our less than tight eyelids. I have found it to be true. This collection is great. It has a variety of colors and goes on very well. There are just a few that are not matte, but the majority are so it was worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Colors are beautiful and matte which I have been looking for. Most shadows are too shimmery for older ladies like myself. I&#x27;m 52 and this is just perfect and such a bargain also. Can&#x27;t beat NYX&#x27;s prices for nice quality makeup.</li>
            <li> This was so gorgeous I bought 2! I bought for a friend but had to have one for myself. Perfect for traveling, which I do a lot of with work. Nyx rocks!</li>
            <li> Perfect neutrals, the blush is adorable, great pigmentation. Not powdery like cheaper brands. The mirror is great for travel. Sleek design. So many looks too, great all year round.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this palette online but I am thrilled I did. I have been searching for an all matte quality product that did not cost more than my budget would allow. I will be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> I really love this palette.  I have several high end palettes but really wanted to try this one because it can be difficult to find true MATTE palettes and the price was too great not to try.  The colors in the drawer are quite pigmented and are not colors that I would have chosen ordinarily but after experimenting with them I really do love some of them.  The colors in this palette all go very well together and blend well and you can create so many looks with it.  The colors all seem pretty true to pan... They stay looking freshly applied most of the day (I use Stila primer and Urban Decay &amp;#34;all-nighter&amp;#34; setting spray so staying power isn&#x27;t usually a huge problem with any brand).  There is a little fallout when applying dry but not too bad.  I didn&#x27;t think I would like the orangy blush on the right but its quite pretty and creates a fresh, brightening look when applied.</li>
            <li> These colors are matte which is something I&#x27;ve been looking for for a long time. There are no sheer/shimmer colors in this collection. The colors are beautiful and not too pigmented so that the looks can be subtle or smoked out.</li>
            <li> I like this palette very much!  All neutral colors in matte finish which is great on \\&quot;mature\\&quot; skin.  It is true that it is a little bit powdery.  Perhaps that&#x27;s just how matte shadows are - don&#x27;t know.  However, per advice from some other reviews I first apply NYX HD eyeshadow primer and then NYX jumbo eye pencil in milk.  This really works very well.  The colors adhere very nicely and last pretty much all day. Since it is a bit powdery I also have found that it is easier to apply with a regular old-fashioned sponge applicator then blend with my nicer brush.  I can&#x27;t figure out how to apply with the brush without sprinkling powder all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the amount of pigment.  I am fair skinned and it shows nicely on my skin tone.  I&#x27;m not any sort of makeup artist.  So, I can&#x27;t speak with expertise, but I think even a darker skin tone could enjoy these shades if you use a primer first.  The NYX jumbo pencil also comes in deeper shades that might work well as a good base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use a gel liner (I like Maybelline Lasting Drama) then use some of the darker bolder eyeshadow from the bottom tray right on top of the gel liner before it sets.  Then the liner really lasts all day and does not smudge on to my upper eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the blush yet just because I tend not to wear blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good-sized kit that travels well too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this palette about a year ago. I find myself using it for subtle daytime looks most often. There are some beautiful shadows that work really well for my coloring, which is pinky fair. There are also some lovely shadows that don&#x27;t work as well on me (but would probably work well for someone with olive tones or darker coloring) so there are a few really well loved shadows, and some are basically untouched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the bottom row much at all, although the blushes are both quite nice, and I do use the black shadow on the bottom row.  But in general, I find the packaging slightly bulky since I don&#x27;t use that bottom row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I worry about breakage when traveling, as the packaging is hard plastic.  I have traveled with it a few times, and I had no problems, but I don&#x27;t find myself traveling with it often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a great palette for the money. The matte shades can be used to create a nice look on their own, or they can be used to blend out deeper colors from other palettes or single shadows.</li>
            <li> I went with this product because of the price and the reviews. I LOVE it! They are all truly matte. There are no hidden glitter in any of them. The colors are pretty and will be good for all eye colors. The added blush is a bonus and those colors are very pretty as well. I recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> This is a great eye shadow palette; has everything I need and would definitely recommend to everyone; will not be sorry they chose this wonderful find</li>
            <li> This has a great variety of colors, all matte, however, they are very powdery, so you have to be careful especially with the darker ones, when you put them on, the powder will be kind of everywhere.  I still love it because of the variety of the colors, just have to kind of watch that when wearing them.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  The colors are a perfect mix.  The shadows apply smoothly and last through out the day. I will order continue to use these cosmetics as they are quality at a value.</li>
            <li> I love all of the colors included in this palette. I have oily skin and the matte shadows stay on for much longer than regular shadows. Love NYX and all of their products</li>
            <li> I usually buy expensive makeup but I recently have been hearing that nyx makeup is a great product with a great price so I decided to try it and I have been looking for a matte eyeshadow kit and this one offers many colors that I love. I also like that it comes with blushes.</li>
            <li> Got here so fast. Bought for my girl and she loves it</li>
            <li> The colors are absolutely gorgeous but they require a really good eye shadow primer to get the full effect of the colors on darker skin tones. I only wear matte eyeshadow, so these were right up my alley. I wouldn&#x27;t use the blushes because they aren&#x27;t flattering on my skin tone, and I wish I had the option of switching them out for additional eyeshadow colors, buuuut since I didn&#x27;t have that option, what can you do? All in all, I think it is a very lovely palette and I would order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> for just under 20 bucks you can&#x27;t beat this. I never liked using cheap makeup for fear of creasing, fading and well just not good product. But finding out about nyx from youtube videos of gorgeous women who showed applications and reviews, I decided to try this. Wow you can keep it light or darken it and the mattes are gorgeous! The blushes are nice too, but it&#x27;s hard just to swipe my brush on on the blush without getting some of the side eyeshadows on it, so you may want to dab a sponge on it or use a small contour brush to get only the color you want. I love ALL the colors and am so happy I found cheap &amp;#34;Not cheaply made&amp;#34; but affordable makeup to buy. Nyx is now my go too instead of MAC.</li>
            <li> This is a great palette with good color for a low cost. Now I only need to take this palette when I travel.</li>
            <li> I took this with me on vacation because it has many eyeshadow colors and nice cheek colors that are blendable.  With the right eyeshadow base/primer, the product stays on pretty much all day, even in the hot sun in Aruba.  The only negative I would say is, it only comes with one applicator.  This was easily remedied by purchasing a travel set of cosmetic brushes.  Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and the price.  Works good for brown and blue eyes.  Arrived on time and packaging was great.</li>
            <li> like the colors of the shadows, a little to loose, but color does last.. blushes are meh...</li>
            <li> As far as I know, this is one of the few packages of shadow--including all the palettes, quads, trios, and duos out there, by all companies--that is 100% matte finish, and says so.  Usually I&#x27;m not interested in these large palettes, but couldn&#x27;t walk away from this one.  And now that I&#x27;ve been using it for two or three weeks, I have to give it a &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;.  Sure, it has something like 24 colors plus a couple of blushes, but here are my grumbles, in order of their importance to me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Mediocre pigmentation.  Is there any point to that?  Who sells a new car with bald tires?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Like all palettes with many, many shades, each little pot is small and right up against the ones next door, so it&#x27;s difficult to work with one without fluffing powder into the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  There are two or three that may as well be the same shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  It might be just me, but the thing is difficult to open.  I could NOT figure out the bottom tray, and finally had to ask my husband to give it a try.  Now I get it, but the top cover is still fiddly, and I always have to pick the thing up and catch the lid in just the right place.  Just a petty annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have some plusses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  I discovered that you can wet the powder and get some actual moxie out of them that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  If you travel with the kit, it is not going to flop open on you nohow.  (Suddenly that flaw becomes a feature!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  NYX doesn&#x27;t test on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  The packaging it arrived in was elegant and absolutely gift-worthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  The palette really does have all matte finish shadows--and it&#x27;s under $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy this kit again, but then, I&#x27;m 62 years old, and will be nursing-home material before I&#x27;m done with it.</li>
            <li> I love this matte palette! I&#x27;ve been looking for a matte palette for quite sometime and this was definitely it for me. Their is absolutely no shine and the colors are really nice! If you&#x27;re looking for a matte palette I highly recommend this one</li>
            <li> Love Matt colors hate shimmer so this was perfect!!! Great quality great pigmentation! From natural look to a smokey eye this pallet is the best!</li>
            <li> As long as you use with a primer, this is a decent palate, but not really very impressive - without primer, even less impressive - very faded, non-pigmented colors.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a matte palette that wasn&#x27;t too much. I love NYX and thought I&#x27;d try this. It didn&#x27;t disappoint. I also really like the two bright cheek colors.</li>
            <li> I love this palette soooo much that when it was stolen along with my other makeup when my house was burglarized (the bag probably looked like a jewelry bag) this was one of the only specific things I repurchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color choice is great, and I love that everything is MATTE.  NYX eye shadow has great pigmentation and wear time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like with every kind of eye shadow, wearing an eye shadow primer goes a long way towards keeping everything in its place and longevity.  I use Elf&#x27;s eye shadow primer.</li>
            <li> I love mattes as of late and wanted to have a nice neutral palette of them for day time.  This fits the bill.  YOu can do everything with it from a clean day look to a neutral smokey eye.  I was also surprised at the variety of shades.  There are three that could lean olive toned, some that lean pink toned, and a whole lot of other nice neutrals.  The bottom tray is just a bonus in my opinion.  Very lovely more colorful shades to be used as accents to the neutrals.  The bottom palette eyeshades do appear to have some sort of shimmer in them.  It&#x27;s very subtle and may appear as a satin or semi-matte finish once on the skin.  The blushes are both beautiful bright mattes.  A berry and a coral.  Those two are very simple non complex shades. &amp;#34;Berry&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;coral&amp;#34; define them perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband bought this for me and it came brand new it it&#x27;s box, packaged very nicely for travel.  It arrived in one piece, great condition, no breakage or cracking of the powder or case.  Perfect, and I&#x27;m so glad to have this!</li>
            <li> If you like Matte eye shadows you should love this palette.  Many of the colors can also be purchased as individual size eye shadows if you find yourself with favorites.  IMO they could have left the blush out and instead offered more show colors or additional brushes.  I haven&#x27;t used the blush as the colors are not to my taste.  I would buy this again and have purchased some of the individual shades separately after using this palette.</li>
            <li> I really like this palette because it gives you very pretty matte colors and the blushes are great too.&lt;br /&gt;Its compact so its easy to travel.&lt;br /&gt;I use it mostly for work and the shadows have very good staying power!</li>
            <li> I love the colors.  They are absolutely perfect.  Exactly what I wanted and for a great price.  It is so compact so its easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful and richly pigmented.  Last all day.  The blushes also lasted all day.  I mixed them and was so pretty.  The eyeshadows go on so smoothly and did not crease.  I love this palette.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this NYX eye shadow collection.  I find that the pigment in these eyeshadows isn&#x27;t that great.  I am keeping it and will use here and there - but I really wanted to love it more than I do.</li>
            <li> I really, really love this pallet. I spent a lot of $$ on Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked Pallet but the UD is mostly shimmer shadows.  I love this NYX pallet because I usually prefer matte shades, not to mention the price is a steal and the quality is excellent.  NYX is generally a winner in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth it!</li>
            <li> As far as palettes go this one has the most usable options for me. Definitely a good Matte Palette (except for the weird bruise colors on the bottom) I also like the color blush for the apples of my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really wow&#x27;d by any of it, but it&#x27;s not a bad product either, so I&#x27;m giving it a fair 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Good mattes are difficult to find, so I was thrilled to find this palette. Like any other palette, there are some colors that I like more than others as well as a mix of cool and warm shades. The pigmentation level is not overwhelming, which actually makes it perfect because this is supposed to be a bohemian, not sophisticate, palette. The case is sturdy and sleek. Also, the size of each tin is big enough for my brushes if I put the brush at an angle. Exceptionally satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great Pigments! Love the colors! I have not tried the blush, I don&#x27;t really wear it so I cannot comment if they are good colors or not but the eye shadows are great.</li>
            <li> Love,  love LOVE nyx eye shadows. Bought this palette after reading a review from a woman with crepe-y eyes, ME TOO... great finish, smooth application and wears all day!</li>
            <li> Beautiful for blue eyed babes</li>
            <li> Beautiful selection. I love the color choices in here. The colors for eyeshadow that I have used so far last a long time and go on easy. I dont recommend the brush that comes in kit though.</li>
            <li> Nice palette, the upper level colours are all useful for day make-up, from the lower one I use only purple-like colour. And I also like the light pink shade - looks very fresh on cheeks. Overall, it&#x27;s quite a good purchase, though at this price one can find smth with more colours for a bright crazy make-up</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I liked the shadows, and it is very difficult to find matte shadows. However, the blushes are not good at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with makeup, but I really love this. When I apply it, it gives me the perfect amount of color. It feels natural and stays great looking all day. I apply it on top of concealer and natural Maybelline color tattoo, and it looks fantastic with it. It stays on all day.</li>
            <li> For a low cost eye shadow palette this collection is amazing.  I have not used all the colors yet but, the pigmentation is very good with the ones I have tried and it stays in place...wears well.  I am pleasantly surprised.  Cannot tell you how many $ I have spent on &amp;#34;higher end&amp;#34; cosmetic brands and been disappointed.  I have fallen in love with the dark plum shadow in the brighter portion of the palette!  It is my everyday eyeliner lately.  I highly recommend this palette.  I only wear matte eye makeup anymore.  No shimmer or glitter with this collection!</li>
            <li> I like these eye shadows very much, however I do not use the blushes too much because I already have my favorite blush to use. the shadows in the top compartment are pretty neutral and work well together, I have not used the shadows on the bottom due to their being very dark, I do not often go for the dramatic look of dark shadows.</li>
            <li> Purchased for teen daughter, who finally tired of glitter shadow. The pallet is matte and the pigment is great. She uses it everyday and never leaves home without it.  I like the pallet so much I am contemplating on making another purchase for myself.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for the collection of neutral matte eyeshadows.  The two cakes of blush and the more vibrant eyeshadow selections are bonuses.  It&#x27;s my opinion that NYX has some of the most lovely shades of super blendable matte eyeshadows around and they&#x27;re reasonably priced also.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of natural color combos that can be created from this palette as well as a few WOW colors on the bottom.</li>
