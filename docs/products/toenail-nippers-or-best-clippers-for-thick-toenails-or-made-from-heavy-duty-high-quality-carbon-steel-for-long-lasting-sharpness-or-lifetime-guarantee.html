            <li>Nice to have these nippers.</li>
            <li>I received this product through a promotion for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>I tend to use them more on my fingernails though.</li>
            <li>Would be better if it had rubber on the grips.</li>
            <li>In fact, when I received them I was pleased at how sturdy and well made they appeared.  </li>
            <li>They are nail clippers, what more can I say</li>
            <li>i wanted the clippers mostly to cute off the callouses on my feet that i get from wearing flip flops all the time and from dancing.</li>
            <li>As long as your toenails have been soaked to soften the clipper works wonderful!</li>
            <li>The grip and slip problem makes accurate, safe clipping an impossibility for me.  </li>
            <li>Great Clippers easir to use than my old ones</li>
            <li>Does the job, good quality and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Sharp and perfect cut every time.</li>
            <li>OK but nothing special.</li>
            <li>Work fine.</li>
            <li>but Iguess they are fine</li>
            <li>They look fine.  </li>
            <li>I could cut my fingernails just fine with it</li>
            <li>Service was fine.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t get a strong, secure grip with the handles and a couple of times they have slipped during clipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The difference in the mechanical advantage between the two pairs of nippers is huge.  </li>
            <li>Work great, may buy a second one</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re simply great on regular toenails as well.</li>
            <li>They always clip my nails in a nice straight line.</li>
            <li>I just like how quick and easy it is to use them.</li>
            <li>good buy , fast ship , thanks</li>
            <li>Awesome for my husband and his thick toes</li>
            <li>Lucky them.</li>
            <li>These work great for thick toenails and collapses easily for travel or storage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 55 years old so have bought many of these type of clippers over the years,</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish for is some kind of grip on handles.</li>
            <li>and I would return them if it was economically feasible to do so.</li>
            <li>Nippers arrived on time, packaging was just right in size.</li>
            <li>Strong clippers, much better than the other one I had.  </li>
            <li>And the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>and this is a first for me.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Very effective and this clippers gets into hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Of course if you have strong enough hands these will do it, no problem.</li>
            <li>These are very sharp and give my nails a nice straight cut.</li>
            <li>High quality clippers!</li>
            <li>It takes a lot of pressure to cut nails, and they are very slippery.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really work that well.</li>
            <li>They are not broken.  </li>
            <li>They are not broken.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Very well built...</li>
            <li>The long handles making clipping toenails easy experience.</li>
            <li>Nicely made, will probably last a long time.</li>
            <li>These are high quality stainless steel Toe nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought a pair of clippers that turned out to be completely unusable.  </li>
            <li>These nippers have such a sharp point on the end that it is impossible to use them without poking yourself even when taking great care... they would work great to stab someone.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am Very Happy--these are STRONG, sharp, can cut my toenails with no problem!</li>
            <li>These nippers need a larger and more flatly beveled inside edge to be effective on thick toenails.  </li>
            <li>Both the cuticle and toenail nippers are sharp, easy to hold and work with.</li>
            <li>The metal broke in two just as I was starting to cut my first toenail.</li>
            <li>And just to be clear, I have normal toenails.  </li>
            <li>Works well, was exactly what I ordered, except we had to change the spring that makes it open and close.</li>
            <li>Sharp, durable, long lasting, great spring, comfortable handles; perfect for nipping plastic, cutting bits off from awkward positions, removing excess soldering material, and it is good for thick toenails.</li>
            <li>Unless you are very young, with soft nails--or presoak in a tub of dish detergent--these are NOT the shears for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sharp, and easy to cut with especially around edges.</li>
            <li>These clippers work great and don&#x27;t slip out of your hands while cutting with them.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look as heavy-duty as they actually are, but they really do the job.  </li>
            <li>It really helps when you have that pesky ingrown toenail that don&#x27;t want to come out with regular toenail clippers.</li>
            <li>They seem very well made and solid.  </li>
            <li>I really regret not sending them back.</li>
            <li>unlike my old nippers, these do not cut the callouses but pinch the skin instead.</li>
            <li>I actually blamed myself at first, thinking I just had to get used to the different feel of a new pair of clippers.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t imagine there could be huge differences in such mundane tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and then some.</li>
            <li>The new, bulky, ones will not even cut my thumb nail unless I make smaller cuts at a time--USELESS!  </li>
            <li>Earlier I had said there was no spring action, but now there is,</li>
            <li>One handle broke in half while squeezing together when I used it the first time.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how small they are, but they really work!  </li>
            <li>They are certainly not worth the price even though it was not that much.</li>
            <li>For tough, curled and thick nails you really need a better handle-to-cutting edge ratio for leverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> For tough, curled and thick nails you really need a better handle-to-cutting edge ratio for leverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good and sharp so you don&#x27;t have to struggle with cutting.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve now had these long enough and tried to use them often enough to know that it is a design flaw in the handles.  </li>
            <li> Some of them didn&#x27;t last as long as I thought they should.  </li>
            <li> Everyday I am finding a new use for them.</li>
            <li> Much more than a disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> I simply can&#x27;t imagine how anyone with thick nails, or poor hand strength is able to use these.  </li>
            <li> It was definitely not sharp enough nor rugged enough for thick toenails.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone back to my old, dull clippers until I can find a replacement from some jeweler supply company or whatever...</li>
            <li> Heavier and thicker than I expected, I was afraid that I&#x27;d cut more than the nail, so I put them aside.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick and nothing was wrong during the delivery process .</li>
            <li> , the last time I used these I did end up with a little cut.  </li>
            <li> Functioned as I expected</li>
            <li> not as sharp and forceful as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, sharp.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t as sharp ask I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> different brands, usually from drug stores.</li>
            <li> I use these a lot, still sharp, cut well.</li>
            <li> The do seem to be sharp</li>
            <li> Its efficient, definitely sharp and DOES THE JOB</li>
            <li> Does not grip well in your hand, but the nippers are sharp</li>
            <li> I am going to say defective because they are dull and only cut a slight portion of the nail and not completely through it.  </li>
            <li> the slipping problem with the very sharp edges and well</li>
            <li> The business end (the shears) is too long to facilitate the necessary leverage to cut through tough, gnarly nails.  </li>
            <li> When I have a professional mani/pedi there is usually a comment on how hard my nails are.</li>
            <li> It took so much grip strength to cut my toe nail that the product failed.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend these clippers for anyone who has thick toenails - and for anyone who doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I do still need some extra strength for thick toenails but they do cut well.</li>
            <li> But, it simply did not cut my thick big-toe nails.  </li>
            <li> Cut my pedicure time down by half.  </li>
            <li> They are very, very sharp.  </li>
            <li> All they did was get my money and go to the trash in less than 1 minute.</li>
            <li> it does the job like i had hoped, it had a pretty noticeable &amp;#34;nick&amp;#34; on one of the cutting blades as well as along one handle.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m still looking, as the new clippers are useless).  </li>
            <li> They had a little heft in the hand and were probably the sharpest clippers I&#x27;d ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you just cannot get enough leverage to cut tough toenails.</li>
            <li> I have very thick toenails that a regular toenail clipper wouldn&#x27;t cut.  </li>
            <li> It is so bad that it makes clipping unnecessarily uncomfortable and hazardous.  </li>
            <li> I received it a few days after I ordered it</li>
            <li> I guess they were just initially a little stiff or something.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is between having the lever up or keeping it down.</li>
            <li> Have to use extreme force to cut thick toenails.</li>
            <li> Nippers are a little small for my hands but worked well.</li>
            <li> Nipper blades are small with very little beveled edge and they can only take very small pieces off a thick nail.  </li>
            <li> Just on normal nails, the amount of pressure I have to apply to the handles to make them clip is very, very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> example, my old jeweler&#x27;s sheers have a 3-in handle, with the cutting edges just 1/2 inch.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed because they really don&#x27;t cut the nail as described.</li>
            <li> NO MORE THICK  </li>
            <li> hard for me to hold.</li>
            <li> I found them to actually be dull</li>
            <li> Either the lever would eventually break, they would become too dull, or even one time a pair broke apart at the jaws.  </li>
            <li> And not because they are flimsy or dull.</li>
            <li> I can cut through my hard toenails</li>
            <li> I bought &#x27;em to replace a worn out pair of jeweler sheers, purchased years ago--which are hard to find today</li>
            <li> It was still hard to cut those really thick toe nails</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the cutting edge design and construction are totally ineffective on thick toe nails.</li>
            <li> Did not work .Nail too thick .</li>
            <li> If you have thick problem toenails, these aren&#x27;t the nippers for you.  </li>
            <li> But I have to go with the reviews that said this doesn&#x27;t work on thick nails.  </li>
            <li> Nails very difficult to cut with regular toenail clippers.</li>
            <li> The people who like it for thick nails must not have very thick nails.  </li>
            <li> To handle really tough nails the handles may need to be a bit longer.  </li>
            <li> Do not buy these clippers for tough time-cut toenails.</li>
            <li> Also a bad back which makes it difficult to bend over.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend these for anybody with thick toenails that are difficult to cut.  </li>
            <li> They were poor quality according to the person I purchased them for.</li>
            <li> This was the one sorry purchase.</li>
            <li> It was put in the wrong way.</li>
            <li> I found these clippers to be very poor.  </li>
            <li> I have had these for 3 1/2 months and this morning, while cutting my fingernails, the spring broke and hit me in the face.  </li>
            <li> the cutting edges are a cumbersome 3/4 inch in length.  </li>
            <li> Very inconvenient to use and has a defect.</li>

            <li> Work great, may buy a second one</li>
            <li> Did not work .Nail too thick .</li>
            <li> These toenail clippers work beautifully and easily even on the thickest ingrown toenails.  They don&#x27;t look as heavy-duty as they actually are, but they really do the job.  They&#x27;re good and sharp so you don&#x27;t have to struggle with cutting.  I definitely recommend these clippers for anyone who has thick toenails - and for anyone who doesn&#x27;t.  They&#x27;re simply great on regular toenails as well.</li>
            <li> as my husbands toenails go flying, I am planning what to wear to the funeral</li>
            <li> These toenail nippers are one the best ones I ever used. It really helps when you have that pesky ingrown toenail that don&#x27;t want to come out with regular toenail clippers. Also these are made of durable stainlees steel. The shipping was quick and nothing was wrong during the delivery process .</li>
            <li> High quality clippers! These are very sharp and give my nails a nice straight cut. I do still need some extra strength for thick toenails but they do cut well. These clippers work great for your fingernails and toenails. I tend to use them more on my fingernails though. I just like how quick and easy it is to use them. They always clip my nails in a nice straight line. I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is between having the lever up or keeping it down. Haven&#x27;t figured that one out yet.  I received this product through a promotion for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> not as sharp and forceful as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how small they are, but they really work!  To handle really tough nails the handles may need to be a bit longer.  Of course if you have strong enough hands these will do it, no problem.</li>
            <li> hard for me to hold. Slips. Would be better if it had rubber on the grips.</li>
            <li> Sharp and perfect cut every time. Very effective and this clippers gets into hard to reach places. The long handles making clipping toenails easy experience. It&#x27;s the perfect size for medium size hands and fits perfectly in travel case. I definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer - Received this product through a promotion for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Nippers are a little small for my hands but worked well. Nice to have these nippers.</li>
            <li> good buy , fast ship , thanks</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great so far I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, sharp. Work fine. I would have preferred that they were easier to hold, with  and not so &amp;#34;slippery.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t as sharp ask I thought they would be. It was still hard to cut those really thick toe nails but Iguess they are fine</li>
            <li> Great Product and Outstanding service.  Nippers arrived on time, packaging was just right in size. Product arrived in perfect condition. Used these already and just loved them.  Cut my pedicure time down by half.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have very thick toenails that a regular toenail clipper wouldn&#x27;t cut.  Also a bad back which makes it difficult to bend over.  These worked perfectly for me and are an ergonomic fit for my condition.  They seem very well made and solid.  I would recommend these for anybody with thick toenails that are difficult to cut.  And the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Maybe its me, but I found these clippers to be very poor.  It takes a lot of pressure to cut nails, and they are very slippery.  I know I will just retire these to the toolbox for who knows what.</li>
            <li> Does the job, good quality and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This was the one sorry purchase. The metal broke in two just as I was starting to cut my first toenail. I would call this a total 100% was of money. All they did was get my money and go to the trash in less than 1 minute. Much more than a disappointing purchase. TRUELY DISAPPIONTING!!!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because they really don&#x27;t cut the nail as described. I found them to actually be dull</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really work that well. Smaller than I expected. Have to use extreme force to cut thick toenails. Fells like not enough leverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55 years old so have bought many of these type of clippers over the years, different brands, usually from drug stores. Some of them didn&#x27;t last as long as I thought they should.  Either the lever would eventually break, they would become too dull, or even one time a pair broke apart at the jaws.  But while I had them, they got regular use and they did the job without difficulty or fuss.  I didn&#x27;t imagine there could be huge differences in such mundane tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I bought these and this is a first for me.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought a pair of clippers that turned out to be completely unusable.  And not because they are flimsy or dull. They are not broken.  They look fine.  In fact, when I received them I was pleased at how sturdy and well made they appeared.  They had a little heft in the hand and were probably the sharpest clippers I&#x27;d ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem for me is the design of the handles.  It is so bad that it makes clipping unnecessarily uncomfortable and hazardous.  And just to be clear, I have normal toenails.  Nothing thickened or overgrown.  I simply can&#x27;t imagine how anyone with thick nails, or poor hand strength is able to use these.  Just on normal nails, the amount of pressure I have to apply to the handles to make them clip is very, very uncomfortable.  I actually blamed myself at first, thinking I just had to get used to the different feel of a new pair of clippers.  But I&#x27;ve now had these long enough and tried to use them often enough to know that it is a design flaw in the handles.  I just can&#x27;t get a strong, secure grip with the handles and a couple of times they have slipped during clipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combine the slipping problem with the very sharp edges and well, the last time I used these I did end up with a little cut.  I won&#x27;t be using them again. The grip and slip problem makes accurate, safe clipping an impossibility for me.  I&#x27;m giving 2 stars to be fair, since these do appear well made.  They are not broken.  They are very, very sharp.  I just can&#x27;t use them.  I really regret not sending them back.</li>
            <li> They are nail clippers, what more can I say</li>
            <li> This is a well made, quality instrument</li>
            <li> I have had these for 3 1/2 months and this morning, while cutting my fingernails, the spring broke and hit me in the face.  Do not buy these!</li>
            <li> They were poor quality according to the person I purchased them for.</li>
            <li> I am Very Happy--these are STRONG, sharp, can cut my toenails with no problem! When I have a professional mani/pedi there is usually a comment on how hard my nails are. Earlier I had said there was no spring action, but now there is, I guess they were just initially a little stiff or something. They work great. I can cut through my hard toenails so I am very happy with them. And they come with a lifetime guarantee. I use these a lot, still sharp, cut well.</li>
            <li> As long as your toenails have been soaked to soften the clipper works wonderful!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. The only thing I wish for is some kind of grip on handles.</li>
            <li> Great clippers.  Cuts my thickest nails with ease.</li>
            <li> Awesome for my husband and his thick toes</li>
            <li> Works well, was exactly what I ordered, except we had to change the spring that makes it open and close. It was put in the wrong way.</li>
            <li> Very inconvenient to use and has a defect. Not going to use but don&#x27;t feel like messing with sending it back. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Worst clippers. I could cut my fingernails just fine with it but I did not buy it for fingernails. The do seem to be sharp but you just cannot get enough leverage to cut tough toenails. I will be sending these back. They are certainly not worth the price even though it was not that much.</li>
            <li> Works well - only used one time.</li>
            <li> I have &amp;#34;crooked&amp;#34; toe nails from years of various sports related feet injuries. Nails very difficult to cut with regular toenail clippers. These clippers work great and don&#x27;t slip out of your hands while cutting with them.</li>
            <li> I received it a few days after I ordered it and I ABSOLUTELY,POSITIVELY LOVED IT.. Its efficient, definitely sharp and DOES THE JOB WELL.. NO MORE THICK  TOE NAILS................................ thanks</li>
            <li> Very good. Sharp, and easy to cut with especially around edges.</li>
            <li> Great Clippers easir to use than my old ones</li>
            <li> One handle broke in half while squeezing together when I used it the first time.  It was definitely not sharp enough nor rugged enough for thick toenails.  It took so much grip strength to cut my toe nail that the product failed.  My grip should not be able to fail a handle.</li>
            <li> Functioned as I expected</li>
            <li> Excellent product, timely service.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any information about this clipper , even I don&#x27;t see made in where ? there is no box or printed manual</li>
            <li> i wanted the clippers mostly to cute off the callouses on my feet that i get from wearing flip flops all the time and from dancing. unlike my old nippers, these do not cut the callouses but pinch the skin instead. and they don&#x27;t work well for toe nails either.</li>
            <li> it does the job like i had hoped, it had a pretty noticeable &amp;#34;nick&amp;#34; on one of the cutting blades as well as along one handle. Each &amp;#34;nick&amp;#34; looks as if it was just buffed with a polisher or something over and then called good.... Meh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I needed&lt;br /&gt;Works great</li>
            <li> These work great for thick toenails and collapses easily for travel or storage.</li>
            <li> Nicely made, will probably last a long time.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and then some. Both the cuticle and toenail nippers are sharp, easy to hold and work with. Very reasonably priced and fast delivery. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Everything was excellent.</li>
            <li> Sharp, durable, long lasting, great spring, comfortable handles; perfect for nipping plastic, cutting bits off from awkward positions, removing excess soldering material, and it is good for thick toenails. Everyday I am finding a new use for them. I received this product through a promotion for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> These nippers have such a sharp point on the end that it is impossible to use them without poking yourself even when taking great care... they would work great to stab someone.  Nipper blades are small with very little beveled edge and they can only take very small pieces off a thick nail.  These nippers need a larger and more flatly beveled inside edge to be effective on thick toenails.  I definitly would NOT recommend these and I would return them if it was economically feasible to do so.</li>
            <li> Do not buy these clippers for tough time-cut toenails. Looks good.  Feels good in hand.  But, it simply did not cut my thick big-toe nails.  In my opinion, the cutting edge design and construction are totally ineffective on thick toe nails.</li>
            <li> Does not grip well in your hand, but the nippers are sharp</li>
            <li> My husband either has the thickest toe nails on planet earth or these are defective.  I am going to say defective because they are dull and only cut a slight portion of the nail and not completely through it.  I am reporting this to Amazon for a return.</li>
            <li> OK but nothing special.</li>
            <li> My podiatrist recommended that I buy something like this instead of using scissors. Heavier and thicker than I expected, I was afraid that I&#x27;d cut more than the nail, so I put them aside. Should have returned them but no time to spare.</li>
            <li> If you have thick problem toenails, these aren&#x27;t the nippers for you.  The business end (the shears) is too long to facilitate the necessary leverage to cut through tough, gnarly nails.  I bought &#x27;em to replace a worn out pair of jeweler sheers, purchased years ago--which are hard to find today (I&#x27;m still looking, as the new clippers are useless).  For tough, curled and thick nails you really need a better handle-to-cutting edge ratio for leverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, my old jeweler&#x27;s sheers have a 3-in handle, with the cutting edges just 1/2 inch.  These &amp;#34;Best Clippers&amp;#34; from Amazon have 3 1/2&amp;#34; handles, but the cutting edges are a cumbersome 3/4 inch in length.  The difference in the mechanical advantage between the two pairs of nippers is huge.  The new, bulky, ones will not even cut my thumb nail unless I make smaller cuts at a time--USELESS!  Unless you are very young, with soft nails--or presoak in a tub of dish detergent--these are NOT the shears for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone back to my old, dull clippers until I can find a replacement from some jeweler supply company or whatever...</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These are high quality stainless steel Toe nail clippers.  I was extremely impressed with the quality.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very well built...I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> Service was fine.  But I have to go with the reviews that said this doesn&#x27;t work on thick nails.  The people who like it for thick nails must not have very thick nails.  Lucky them.</li>
            <li> Strong clippers, much better than the other one I had.  Works very nice.</li>
