            <li> This is not designed for an adult unless she is the size of a 9 year old.  The clasp would not stay shut either.  Very disappointed...but then again, it was cheap...so I guess you get what you pay for.  Had to wait WEEKS for it.  Would like to return it but not sure it&#x27;s worth the trouble.  I do not recommend this to anyone unless it&#x27;s for a small child.</li>
            <li> first, NOT a one size fits all. Will fit someone petite. Material is scratchy and when they shipped it, i had to use scissors to open it and the fabric was right up to the edges of the package and I cut it.</li>
