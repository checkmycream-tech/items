    <ol>
            <li>EFFECTIVE!!!!!</li>
            <li>Good stuff!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great scent that&#x27;s not overly flowery or baby powder-y, and whenever I get a hug</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>awhile lol.</li>
            <li>Long-lasting with a great scent.  </li>
            <li>48-hour protection is a plus and the scent is great.</li>
            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes people even ask what kind of perfume I&#x27;m wearing!  </li>
            <li>Good job, Degree.</li>
            <li>This may not be the best for people who are primarily concerned with reducing perspiration.  </li>
            <li>It used to smell soooo good.  </li>
            <li>I guess they discontinued the good stuff</li>
            <li>recommendation: If you are absolutely sure about the ingredients of what you are purchasing online, maybe you are good.</li>
            <li>A number of people have commented on how nice I smell, thinking I was wearing perfume.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant does more than that - I can go do intense cardio and weight lifting and still smell delicious!  </li>
            <li>I love all the scents it comes in, but the Sexy Intrigue is definitely my favorite!</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It smells ok by itself but something about my smell and this deodorant smell doesn&#x27;t mix well.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m wearing a non-breathable top.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>And this situation makes me feel even more uneasier.</li>
            <li>The deodorant sent to me is the Degree EXPERT PROTECTION sexy intrigue anti-perspirant and deodorant which is NOT in the picture shown.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>you can see I used to love this scent</li>
            <li>I just perspire more than most, I suppose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s girly, but not overly potent or floral.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They should delete all the reviews for this since most were for the older GOOD product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; it is the new deodorant !!!!!</li>
            <li>The scent could be a little stronger, but otherwise its great!</li>
            <li>I definitely sweat while wearing this, but as I said, you still smell great.  </li>
            <li>But same great product.</li>
            <li>And it does all of this with a fantastic scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all of the various scents and they are all great.</li>
            <li>Very nice simple scent.</li>
            <li>Do not buy if you liked the older version.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I LOVE the strong smell of Degree FINE FRAGRANCE sexy intrigue anti-perspirant and deodorant, the product I have does not perform the same as the product pictured.</li>
            <li>it was such a good price.  </li>
            <li>This is the only deodorant that works for me and smells good.</li>
            <li>I used Ban for several years and I am now switching to Degree, especially Sexy Intrigue since Ban always left me that armpit smell.</li>
            <li>I thought it was my chemistry, but no, it really did have a strong scent for a deodorant.</li>
            <li>From now on, I am going to rely on drug-store purchases, as I can go back and check on things and make returns more easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always struggled to find a deodorant that kept me smelling fresh throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Degree keeps me smelling fresh all day.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re complimenting, but just smile and thank them.</li>
            <li>For some reason, I am clearly having strong allergic reactions to the sticks that I purchased online.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even a person that needs to wear deodorant unless it&#x27;s hot and humid</li>
            <li>This is the deodorant that I always used, and the first time I bought this online</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewers who liked it before they changed the formula.  </li>
            <li>The scent of this deodorant is barely noticeable compared to the fine fragrance.</li>
            <li>Not only does it provide long-lasting protection, but the scent is heavenly...subtle, not too strong.  </li>
            <li>I can smell it throughout the day and it really keeps on working.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and well packaged.</li>
            <li>Not so much now.  </li>
            <li>Also it is not invisible, as no deodorant really ever is.</li>
            <li>I WILL BE ORDERING AGAIN VERY SOON.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Before I switched to Degree MotionSense Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant, I had to carry a thing of deodorant with me wherever I went and re-apply it several times a day to stay fresh.</li>
            <li>However, as it was in my case, the same brand with the same product can turn out to be different, and I will not even be able to know why as the packaging is gone.</li>
            <li>It not only does it&#x27;s job of keeping you dry and smelling fresh, but does it for 2 whole days!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to switch to something natural.</li>
            <li>people are still selling the old stuff</li>
            <li>I tried this one and fell in love with the subtle scent...not to mention it does the job.  </li>
            <li>This has such a great fragrance, works like crazy and doesn&#x27;t irritate my freakishly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>As I trashed the ingredients list along with the packaging which hold the two deodorants together, and as the individual containers do not have the ingredients on them, I cannot now go back and check if there is something different in these particular sticks.</li>

            <li> Product was basically what I ordered, but the scent was a little different than usual.</li>
            <li> After a few hours this deodorant smells like BO.</li>
            <li> Even if it is a few cents, I still save.</li>
            <li> Some times it is hard to find....</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so expensive and just not worth it</li>
            <li> cause the new edition is crap.</li>
            <li> Oh, I was wrong...</li>
            <li> This deodorant is so bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> arrived in a timely fashion... of course, this is another one of those things that I start to use and the stores discontinue it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, of course, looked on Amazon and here it was.  I bought a 6 pack, to last for a while.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell of this deodorant and eventually threw it out. Sometimes it would not last all day. I was not the problem. I have been using products like this my entire life. The scent of the deodorant was not very pleasing. I thought it was my chemistry, but no, it really did have a strong scent for a deodorant. If you moved your arms you would smell nothing but deodorant. I eventually went and purchased something different.</li>
            <li> This deodorant lasts me ALL DAY and I love it. I can smell it throughout the day and it really keeps on working. Good job, Degree.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled to find a deodorant that kept me smelling fresh throughout the day.  This deodorant does more than that - I can go do intense cardio and weight lifting and still smell delicious!  You never have to worry about reapplication with this.  It&#x27;s a great scent that&#x27;s not overly flowery or baby powder-y, and whenever I get a hug I get complimented on the way I smell (and this deodorant is the only scent I have on me).  This may not be the best for people who are primarily concerned with reducing perspiration.  I definitely sweat while wearing this, but as I said, you still smell great.  Buy it!  I hope Degree never stops making this product!</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding this scent where I live, so I bought a bunch online. Arrived fast and well packaged. The scent could be a little stronger, but otherwise its great!</li>
            <li> I started using degree a few years back. I&#x27;m really happy with the results.  I&#x27;m a truck driver and I have to load and unload my trailer some times. In the summer being in the trailer is like being in a oven. Degree keeps me smelling fresh all day.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t order it again.  I agree with the other reviewers who liked it before they changed the formula.  It used to smell soooo good.  Not so much now.  It also doesn&#x27;t seem to stop wetness as well.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is so bad. It smells ok by itself but something about my smell and this deodorant smell doesn&#x27;t mix well. After a few hours this deodorant smells like BO. I&#x27;m not even a person that needs to wear deodorant unless it&#x27;s hot and humid and I&#x27;m wearing a non-breathable top. So this isn&#x27;t worth wearing for me because it makes me smell worse than wearing nothing. Also it is not invisible, as no deodorant really ever is. I still have to be careful putting on shirts. I&#x27;m going to switch to something natural.</li>
            <li> Product was basically what I ordered, but the scent was a little different than usual. But same great product. I will order again</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this deodorant. It not only does it&#x27;s job of keeping you dry and smelling fresh, but does it for 2 whole days! Cause everyone forgets to apply every once in awhile lol. And it does all of this with a fantastic scent. I&#x27;ve tried all of the various scents and they are all great. Sometimes people even ask what kind of perfume I&#x27;m wearing!  And finally,  you can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon!! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand and this specific antiperspirant from the drug store for years now. I decided that purchasing it in bulk will help my budget as I keep using the same thing. Oh, I was wrong... For some reason, I am clearly having strong allergic reactions to the sticks that I purchased online. As I trashed the ingredients list along with the packaging which hold the two deodorants together, and as the individual containers do not have the ingredients on them, I cannot now go back and check if there is something different in these particular sticks. And this situation makes me feel even more uneasier. Also, it turns out that the returning policy limits my refund now, and it is another task to sit down and figure out how to do it, go to the post office, and get back only a partial fund, if it is accepted.&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation: If you are absolutely sure about the ingredients of what you are purchasing online, maybe you are good. However, as it was in my case, the same brand with the same product can turn out to be different, and I will not even be able to know why as the packaging is gone. From now on, I am going to rely on drug-store purchases, as I can go back and check on things and make returns more easily. It will help improve your health and your budget.</li>
            <li> This is the deodorant that I always used, and the first time I bought this online it was such a good price.  It seems to have gone up in price, but I still save money.  Even if it is a few cents, I still save.</li>
            <li> I literally just realized that the product advertised is not the product I received. I ordered this because I LOVE the strong smell of Degree FINE FRAGRANCE sexy intrigue anti-perspirant and deodorant, the product I have does not perform the same as the product pictured. The scent of this deodorant is barely noticeable compared to the fine fragrance. The deodorant sent to me is the Degree EXPERT PROTECTION sexy intrigue anti-perspirant and deodorant which is NOT in the picture shown. The product packaging of the advertised product and the one I received is slightly different, if you do not have them side by side you really can&#x27;t tell that something is missing.  I wish I could send it back but I already started to use one.</li>
            <li> .... I love this scent. Doesn&#x27;t smell girly. Very nice simple scent. Musky. Lasts all day. Some times it is hard to find....Some times I find it and it will come with a little spray of the same scent. I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it. I wish they would make this as a baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT EDIT : 9/13/13&lt;br /&gt;As you can see I used to love this scent but they changed it to \\&quot;motionSENSE\\&quot;. I guess they discontinued the good stuff cause the new edition is crap. It doesn&#x27;t smell the same and it doesn&#x27;t last. Way did they change it ? I have no idea. Will never use again.&lt;br /&gt;Some people are still selling the old stuff but it&#x27;s so expensive and just not worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They should delete all the reviews for this since most were for the older GOOD product.&lt;br /&gt;If it says \\&quot;motionSENSE\\&quot; it is the new deodorant !!!!! Do not buy if you liked the older version.</li>
            <li> This has such a great fragrance, works like crazy and doesn&#x27;t irritate my freakishly sensitive skin. I only wish that Degree hadn&#x27;t discontinued the body spray of the same scent!</li>
            <li> Long-lasting with a great scent.  I switched from Dove to this product and have been using it for a year now.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant that works for me and smells good. I tend to switch it every 3-4 months so my body doesnt get used to it.</li>
            <li> Before I switched to Degree MotionSense Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant, I had to carry a thing of deodorant with me wherever I went and re-apply it several times a day to stay fresh. I just perspire more than most, I suppose. However, I&#x27;m finding with the Degree MotionSense deodorants, I only need to apply it once in the morning and I can confidently go about my day without having to worry about whether I smell bad or not. I love all the scents it comes in, but the Sexy Intrigue is definitely my favorite! It&#x27;s girly, but not overly potent or floral. Just enough to keep me smelling like a lady should!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Not only does it provide long-lasting protection, but the scent is heavenly...subtle, not too strong.  A number of people have commented on how nice I smell, thinking I was wearing perfume.  I don&#x27;t tell them it&#x27;s my deoderant they&#x27;re complimenting, but just smile and thank them.</li>
            <li> I used Ban for several years and I am now switching to Degree, especially Sexy Intrigue since Ban always left me that armpit smell. Degree solved the problem. 48-hour protection is a plus and the scent is great.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I once used Dove Cashmere scent until it was discontinued in stores.  (Can you believe I didn&#x27;t think to look on Amazon??) I tried this one and fell in love with the subtle scent...not to mention it does the job.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I ORDERED FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER. SHE LOVES THE SMELL AND WORKS GREAT.VERY EFFECTIVE!!!!! I WILL BE ORDERING AGAIN VERY SOON. FAST SHIPPING!!!!</li>
