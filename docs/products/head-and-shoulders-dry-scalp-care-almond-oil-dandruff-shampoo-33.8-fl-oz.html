            <li>Thought it was origial scent which it almond, fast shipping, great quality.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite head &amp; shoulders.</li>
            <li>It got rid of most of my dandruff</li>
            <li>We will surely be purchasing more.  </li>
            <li>I love this product but when I received it the container was broke and it had leaked all over inside the box and is unusable</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this and the Amazon price is excellent compared to local sources.</li>
            <li>and I am sure you can find a product that fits you as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- I love it.</li>
            <li>also love the scent.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>A family favorite.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Helps ease my itchy scalp, but tends to make my hair more oily.</li>
            <li>The pump is way more efficient, which should be taken into consideration when calculating it&#x27;s cost.</li>
            <li>I will buy it again because with it&#x27;s efficiency it is a much better deal.</li>
            <li>Good value coconut not my favorite but worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;they love it&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, I love the pump on the bottle.</li>

            <li>i love head and shoulders.  </li>
            <li>so i just threw it away to make sure i didn&#x27;t try it \\&quot;once more\\&quot; and put my scalp through that pain again..</li>
            <li>love how my hair feels after using.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>Heed allergy warnings if you have a nut allergy but producers, please don&#x27;t change the ingredients that have made my life better, I am asking you.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair hydrated and smooth!</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s kinda no wonder that I grabbed this shampoo because it was all there was (borrowed it) after running out of my more for glamorous shampoo.</li>
            <li>Now my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>I always love this shampoo, from time to time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied like before.</li>
            <li>I have been using Head &amp; Shoulders for a long time and this with the Almond Oil is the BEST.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful shampoo for dry hair..</li>
            <li>The good: Good bargain and will last for a while&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love free shipping, I love to order products.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft and smelling great.  </li>
            <li>Large bottle for a good price.</li>
            <li>maybe they have changed the formula since i last used it, but the scalp pain/soreness i experienced was really unbearable :p</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still full!</li>
            <li>A very mild tingling that seemed almost spa-like!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a special treat for when you rinse most of your skin receives the benefit of the almond oil.</li>
            <li>It is noticeably more relaxed and full after the 3 months of usage.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dandruff/dry scalp issues and purchased this product solely because I loved the almond scent and needed a new shampoo.</li>
            <li>I like it fine.</li>
            <li>Totally fine product.</li>
            <li>The almond oil h&amp;s makes my hair super greasy!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair silky smooth and keeps my scalp soothed as well.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo, it actually works.</li>
            <li>but id try it again 7 years later (now lol) and the weirdest thing happened-</li>
            <li>Last forever at a great price.</li>
            <li>BUT, with that said, I still stand by the fact that H&amp;S has so many different products that there is sure to be something for your head of hair!</li>
            <li>Prefer the Original formula, something about the almond oil i can put my finger on it.</li>
            <li>Also love the large size and the pump dispenser.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone specially men&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I have always used H&amp;S products since they help keep my dandruff at bay, and if you think about the Dry Scalp issue, which is the root cause of dandruff, the more moisture, the better!</li>
            <li>The pump makes washing my hair more convenient and quicker rather than stopping, picking up a whole bottle and squeezing.</li>
            <li>Love this product as cleans hair really well</li>
            <li>It works- tried and true like ALL Head &amp; Shoulder&#x27;s shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>For the price, I cannot imagine finding such a good product anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had any luck with the regular Head and Shoulders and some good results with the &#x27;Clinical Strength&#x27; / selenium sulfide based Head and Shoulders.  </li>
            <li>The boyfriend claims that it smells too sweet...</li>
            <li>Almond is definitely my favorite flavor by far (for foods and this smell is great) and it&#x27;s relaxing actually as a scent.</li>
            <li>pump doesn&#x27;t work at all and the product it self is not as good as regular head and shoulders.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it everyday just like the bottle  says, but I notice thinking to myself that if I want a good hair day I&#x27;ll use this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start getting mild dandruff days after stopping Head and shoulders use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just to be sure it was this shampoo, I started using it again and sure enough the burning returned.  </li>
            <li>Then I found this product and was so excited to begin use right away.</li>
            <li>I am happy also that the conditioner helps defrizz my hair that gets frizzed out daily in our high humidity weather.  </li>
            <li>First, there are 18!</li>
            <li>The almond scent is a bit more pleasant to smell on my little girl than the classic scent.</li>
            <li>The cost of the Nutrogena dandruff shampoo (while highly effective) is enough to keep it on the luxury items list indefinitely in my household.  </li>
            <li>Simple and effective.</li>
            <li>Head &amp; Shoulders Dry Scalp Care Dandruff Shampoo has always been an excellent shampoo for my hair and dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>I read some positive reviews of this type of H &amp; S and so far it my all time favorite for not only reducing scale but also making your scalp more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>H&amp;S. It works good, as usual, and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>I had dry scalp and dandruff and works amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice pump bottle, but the almond oil leaves scalp and hair a bit too oily and heavy for my light weight caucasian hair.</li>
            <li>B000GCUTKI Head &amp; Shoulders Classic Clean 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo And Conditioner With Pump 33.8 Fl Oz]]&lt;br</li>
            <li>ok, I am a rough tuff guy, no doubt about it---but this shampoo is gentle, smells good and can be used daily</li>
            <li>This is amazing, it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes like the regular head and shoulders classic.</li>
            <li>VERY economical compared to many as you can see if you are using any other specialty dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li>the first time i bought it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Conditioner shouldn&#x27;t touch scalp in the first place.</li>
            <li>The product is just as advertised and does exactly what shampoo is supposed to do in a convenient pump bottle.</li>
            <li>Chances are, this isn&#x27;t your first encounter with it.</li>
            <li>I bought it the first time because  price per ounce what better than in my local store.</li>
            <li>Second, every person&#x27;s body is unique and will have a unique reaction to any hair product.</li>
            <li>First, it works for me.</li>
            <li>*)</li>
            <li>First, it works for me.</li>
            <li>*)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>When I first used it I didn&#x27;t even make the connection between the shampoo and my hair.</li>
            <li>and I definitely will be ordering more.  </li>
            <li>Now I only use it about biweekly to make sure the flakes and itchiness stays</li>
            <li>Remember that commercial with the stunning soap opera star?</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the only shampoo I can use for my exzema laden hair.</li>
            <li>Not because I have a very dry scalp but because it keeps my hair clean, smells good, and I don&#x27;t feel like having 10 different shampoo&#x27;s in my shower.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff, especially if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li>It really helps us with our dry scalps and smells and feels nice.</li>
            <li>and I got something else, I had forgotten what clean, soft hair felt like.</li>
            <li>i love head and shoulders shampoo--it keeps my hair soft and shiny and moisturizes my scalp--and completely eliminates any dandruff.  </li>
            <li>This is the long time favorite in our house.  </li>
            <li>I really like the subtle fragrance of this product (expecially compared to the original H&amp;S formula), and I find that it works well and am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>my scalp feels a lot better and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry anymore after getting out of the shower</li>
            <li>Fructis Dry Scalp - Love the smell, somewhat helpful,</li>
            <li>While those reviews may be totally valid, I would like to point out that consistent use, EVERY DAY, is really important.</li>
            <li>While those reviews may be totally valid, I would like to point out that consistent use, EVERY DAY, is really important.</li>
            <li>So naturally, with head and shoulders taking care of my dandruff, I was able yo not scratch my head and not make new wounds and reopen old ones</li>
            <li>have color treated hair because, well, I am older and graying!</li>
            <li>love head and shoulders---and very hard to find shampoo with a pump top on anymore---</li>
            <li>Fast Ship.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than in the stores.  </li>
            <li>This would make it much easier for people suffering from ailments that may inhibit them.</li>
            <li>I have never noticed any quicker fading of the color or brassiness or anything else unusual.</li>
            <li>With the bottles, I end up using way too much</li>
            <li>This product had me 100% flake free after only a week of using the product!</li>
            <li>I feel like it works for me, but it does not foam up quite as much as I like</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell much of a difference.</li>
            <li>My fault, really - didn&#x27;t realize this had Almond extract everywhere.  </li>
            <li>It took many weeks also, so be careful if you have allergies.</li>
            <li>hair soft and smell FRESH</li>
            <li>it made my scalp VERY sore...</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>It was just too much for my hair.</li>
            <li>Of all the shampoos available, how is it that H&amp;S could possibly be known for beauty too?</li>
            <li>Thank you for your things very well</li>
            <li>Unlike some of those other shampoos that seem to knock others over when you exit the bathroom, Head &amp; Shoulderd has a beautifully clean &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; smell that is mild and not bothersome to others.</li>
            <li>and I particularly have some trouble to deal with that kind of lid.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, on to Head &amp; Shoulders varieties that I have tried but do not like as much as this one.&lt;br /&gt;Classic Clean - This is a close 2nd.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both love this product and use it every other days.</li>
            <li>Strength - Similar to Classic Clean.</li>
            <li>Strength - Similar to Classic Clean.</li>
            <li>Because back in the day a girl from school would use this brand of shampoos &amp; she had shiny black gorgeous looking hair, always.</li>
            <li>i first used this stuff when i was young maybe like</li>
            <li>With such a large bottle, it is worth this money.</li>
            <li>I have dry scalp and normal (fine) hair.</li>
            <li>12 or 13- no problem worked decent...</li>
            <li>The classic works for some but this works for me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>

            <li>*high fives self</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly if it works for you.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>Great product, unfortunately I am scared to think what would happen to my skin if I were to use this product for an extended period of time.  </li>
            <li>I swear, I can&#x27;t use any normal shampoo even if I try to find the quality brands.</li>
            <li>I think my problems are more dry scalp than dandruff (I guess there is a difference) since regular head&amp;shoulders (and generics) did not work for me.  </li>
            <li>I realized then that it was my new shampoo and after discontinuing its use my hair has returned to its normal state.</li>
            <li>This may be right for you as a last resort.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately I quickly became allergic to this shampoo and conditioner in one, necessitating a long trip to the doctor&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that this shampoo also makes my hair look super straight after I style it compared to my experience with other shampoos.</li>
            <li>I should have been more careful using it as it contains enough Almond Oil to cause an allergic reaction for me.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>Makes your hair very soft...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try to use other shampoos but I suffer a lot from dry scalp and this is the only one that helps me with that, smells good too</li>
            <li>So far this product is decent but is far from my expectation.</li>
            <li>At first, right after the usage wet hair seems to be very oily or have some residue on it, when the hair is dry it goes away and hair looks alright.</li>
            <li>I have a few patches of very mild psoriasis and it helps control that too and completely removes the treatment products I use on my scalp.</li>
            <li>The large bottle size dispenser that I now leave in the shower is a big plus</li>
            <li>Maybe it doesn&#x27;t rinse out well when you have soft water.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when searching Amazon and discovered this product.</li>
            <li>So, my personal experience with the product may be very dissimilar to your experience with it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell and oddly enough</li>
            <li>I wash my hair daily because it is very oily</li>
            <li>it probably would&#x27;ve completely got rid of it for me if it wasn&#x27;t for the weirdest side effect it gave me</li>
            <li>anyway, this will probably work for you if your scalp isn&#x27;t extremely sensitive loll...</li>
            <li>Gentle enough to use every 3 days.</li>
            <li>This so far has done nothing for our itchy and flaky scalp.</li>
            <li>and I started using a natural soap to wash my hair.  </li>
            <li>Every bit of the burning completely went away.  </li>
            <li>My daughter was born with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I also like the way it comes out of the bottle,  more like a foam and not like a thick liquid.  </li>
            <li>If you have dry scalp and/or mild to moderate dandruff (two mutually exclusive conditions)</li>
            <li>It looked the way very greasy hair does when it lies flat against a scalp, except that it didnt look greasy.</li>
            <li>and I can confidently go out in public without fear of being ridiculed because of my excessive dandruff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather order something that costs the same or less online (free shipping with prime account) than go to the store.</li>
            <li>I normally add tea tree oil into regular shampoo to moisturize scalp and to get rid of dandruff.</li>
            <li>However I did not see how much it change my dry hair.</li>
            <li>the way, I used Sulfur 8 products, Queen Helene deep conditioner, and Head and Shoulders Dry treatment in addition to this shampoo during the first week to treat my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>He uses other products, but says &amp;#34;head &amp; shoulders dry scalp care with almond oil,&amp;#34; soothes his scalp does not smell, and is easy to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I have extremely thick hair so only those shampoos clean really well can meet my standard.</li>
            <li>When the bottle gets low I simply add water to it and set it next to my sink and use it as hand soap which is also very affective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I was trying a bunch of different shampoos for my new found psoriasis on the back of my head.</li>
            <li>I have a dry scalp but normal hair.</li>
            <li>If you have any questions, I usually respond quickly.</li>
            <li>If you have any questions, I usually respond quickly.</li>
            <li>and then I  was thinking that head and shoulders is for dry scalps, or to be exact a dry skin</li>
            <li>This may work well for people who have dandruff/dry scalp issues, but I would definitely stay clear of it if you&#x27;re similar to me.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as described and packaged securely, so no explosions or spilled product on arrival.</li>
            <li>/&gt;effect so far as diminishing dry scalp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, as far as the Head &amp; Shoulders Dry Scalp Care, Almond Oil,</li>
            <li>The Head &amp; Shoulders product offers the same level of effectiveness at a fraction of the price AND keeps my scalp from getting dry and itchy after washing.  </li>
            <li>I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t clean my very long, thick hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Helps ease my itchy scalp, but tends to make my hair more oily.</li>
            <li> The pump is way more efficient, which should be taken into consideration when calculating it&#x27;s cost.</li>
            <li> I will buy it again because with it&#x27;s efficiency it is a much better deal.</li>

            <li> so i just threw it away to make sure i didn&#x27;t try it \\&quot;once more\\&quot; and put my scalp through that pain again..</li>
            <li> love how my hair feels after using.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> Heed allergy warnings if you have a nut allergy but producers, please don&#x27;t change the ingredients that have made my life better, I am asking you.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair hydrated and smooth!</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s kinda no wonder that I grabbed this shampoo because it was all there was (borrowed it) after running out of my more for glamorous shampoo.</li>
            <li> Now my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> I always love this shampoo, from time to time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied like before.</li>
            <li> I have been using Head &amp; Shoulders for a long time and this with the Almond Oil is the BEST.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful shampoo for dry hair..</li>
            <li> The good: Good bargain and will last for a while&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love free shipping, I love to order products.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very soft and smelling great.  </li>
            <li> Large bottle for a good price.</li>
            <li> maybe they have changed the formula since i last used it, but the scalp pain/soreness i experienced was really unbearable :p</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still full!</li>
            <li> A very mild tingling that seemed almost spa-like!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a special treat for when you rinse most of your skin receives the benefit of the almond oil.</li>
            <li> It is noticeably more relaxed and full after the 3 months of usage.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff/dry scalp issues and purchased this product solely because I loved the almond scent and needed a new shampoo.</li>
            <li> I like it fine.</li>
            <li> Totally fine product.</li>
            <li> The almond oil h&amp;s makes my hair super greasy!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair silky smooth and keeps my scalp soothed as well.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, it actually works.</li>
            <li> but id try it again 7 years later (now lol) and the weirdest thing happened-</li>
            <li> Last forever at a great price.</li>
            <li> BUT, with that said, I still stand by the fact that H&amp;S has so many different products that there is sure to be something for your head of hair!</li>
            <li> Prefer the Original formula, something about the almond oil i can put my finger on it.</li>
            <li> Also love the large size and the pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone specially men&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have always used H&amp;S products since they help keep my dandruff at bay, and if you think about the Dry Scalp issue, which is the root cause of dandruff, the more moisture, the better!</li>
            <li> The pump makes washing my hair more convenient and quicker rather than stopping, picking up a whole bottle and squeezing.</li>
            <li> Love this product as cleans hair really well</li>
            <li> It works- tried and true like ALL Head &amp; Shoulder&#x27;s shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> For the price, I cannot imagine finding such a good product anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any luck with the regular Head and Shoulders and some good results with the &#x27;Clinical Strength&#x27; / selenium sulfide based Head and Shoulders.  </li>
            <li> The boyfriend claims that it smells too sweet...</li>
            <li> Almond is definitely my favorite flavor by far (for foods and this smell is great) and it&#x27;s relaxing actually as a scent.</li>
            <li> pump doesn&#x27;t work at all and the product it self is not as good as regular head and shoulders.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday just like the bottle  says, but I notice thinking to myself that if I want a good hair day I&#x27;ll use this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start getting mild dandruff days after stopping Head and shoulders use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just to be sure it was this shampoo, I started using it again and sure enough the burning returned.  </li>
            <li> Then I found this product and was so excited to begin use right away.</li>
            <li> I am happy also that the conditioner helps defrizz my hair that gets frizzed out daily in our high humidity weather.  </li>
            <li> First, there are 18!</li>
            <li> The almond scent is a bit more pleasant to smell on my little girl than the classic scent.</li>
            <li> The cost of the Nutrogena dandruff shampoo (while highly effective) is enough to keep it on the luxury items list indefinitely in my household.  </li>
            <li> Simple and effective.</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders Dry Scalp Care Dandruff Shampoo has always been an excellent shampoo for my hair and dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> I read some positive reviews of this type of H &amp; S and so far it my all time favorite for not only reducing scale but also making your scalp more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> H&amp;S. It works good, as usual, and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I had dry scalp and dandruff and works amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice pump bottle, but the almond oil leaves scalp and hair a bit too oily and heavy for my light weight caucasian hair.</li>
            <li> B000GCUTKI Head &amp; Shoulders Classic Clean 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo And Conditioner With Pump 33.8 Fl Oz]]&lt;br</li>
            <li> ok, I am a rough tuff guy, no doubt about it---but this shampoo is gentle, smells good and can be used daily</li>
            <li> This is amazing, it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes like the regular head and shoulders classic.</li>
            <li> VERY economical compared to many as you can see if you are using any other specialty dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> the first time i bought it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Conditioner shouldn&#x27;t touch scalp in the first place.</li>
            <li> The product is just as advertised and does exactly what shampoo is supposed to do in a convenient pump bottle.</li>
            <li> Chances are, this isn&#x27;t your first encounter with it.</li>
            <li> I bought it the first time because  price per ounce what better than in my local store.</li>
            <li> Second, every person&#x27;s body is unique and will have a unique reaction to any hair product.</li>
            <li> First, it works for me.</li>
            <li> *)</li>
            <li> First, it works for me.</li>
            <li> *)</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> When I first used it I didn&#x27;t even make the connection between the shampoo and my hair.</li>
            <li> and I definitely will be ordering more.  </li>
            <li> Now I only use it about biweekly to make sure the flakes and itchiness stays</li>
            <li> Remember that commercial with the stunning soap opera star?</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the only shampoo I can use for my exzema laden hair.</li>
            <li> Not because I have a very dry scalp but because it keeps my hair clean, smells good, and I don&#x27;t feel like having 10 different shampoo&#x27;s in my shower.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, especially if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li> It really helps us with our dry scalps and smells and feels nice.</li>
            <li> and I got something else, I had forgotten what clean, soft hair felt like.</li>
            <li> i love head and shoulders shampoo--it keeps my hair soft and shiny and moisturizes my scalp--and completely eliminates any dandruff.  </li>
            <li> This is the long time favorite in our house.  </li>
            <li> I really like the subtle fragrance of this product (expecially compared to the original H&amp;S formula), and I find that it works well and am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> my scalp feels a lot better and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry anymore after getting out of the shower</li>
            <li> Fructis Dry Scalp - Love the smell, somewhat helpful,</li>
            <li> While those reviews may be totally valid, I would like to point out that consistent use, EVERY DAY, is really important.</li>
            <li> While those reviews may be totally valid, I would like to point out that consistent use, EVERY DAY, is really important.</li>
            <li> So naturally, with head and shoulders taking care of my dandruff, I was able yo not scratch my head and not make new wounds and reopen old ones</li>
            <li> have color treated hair because, well, I am older and graying!</li>
            <li> love head and shoulders---and very hard to find shampoo with a pump top on anymore---</li>
            <li> Fast Ship.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than in the stores.  </li>
            <li> This would make it much easier for people suffering from ailments that may inhibit them.</li>
            <li> I have never noticed any quicker fading of the color or brassiness or anything else unusual.</li>
            <li> With the bottles, I end up using way too much</li>
            <li> This product had me 100% flake free after only a week of using the product!</li>
            <li> I feel like it works for me, but it does not foam up quite as much as I like</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell much of a difference.</li>
            <li> My fault, really - didn&#x27;t realize this had Almond extract everywhere.  </li>
            <li> It took many weeks also, so be careful if you have allergies.</li>
            <li> hair soft and smell FRESH</li>
            <li> it made my scalp VERY sore...</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> It was just too much for my hair.</li>
            <li> Of all the shampoos available, how is it that H&amp;S could possibly be known for beauty too?</li>
            <li> Thank you for your things very well</li>
            <li> Unlike some of those other shampoos that seem to knock others over when you exit the bathroom, Head &amp; Shoulderd has a beautifully clean &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; smell that is mild and not bothersome to others.</li>
            <li> and I particularly have some trouble to deal with that kind of lid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, on to Head &amp; Shoulders varieties that I have tried but do not like as much as this one.&lt;br /&gt;Classic Clean - This is a close 2nd.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love this product and use it every other days.</li>
            <li> Strength - Similar to Classic Clean.</li>
            <li> Strength - Similar to Classic Clean.</li>
            <li> Because back in the day a girl from school would use this brand of shampoos &amp; she had shiny black gorgeous looking hair, always.</li>
            <li> i first used this stuff when i was young maybe like</li>
            <li> With such a large bottle, it is worth this money.</li>
            <li> I have dry scalp and normal (fine) hair.</li>
            <li> 12 or 13- no problem worked decent...</li>
            <li> The classic works for some but this works for me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> *high fives self</li>
            <li> *high fives self</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly if it works for you.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> Great product, unfortunately I am scared to think what would happen to my skin if I were to use this product for an extended period of time.  </li>
            <li> I swear, I can&#x27;t use any normal shampoo even if I try to find the quality brands.</li>
            <li> I think my problems are more dry scalp than dandruff (I guess there is a difference) since regular head&amp;shoulders (and generics) did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> I realized then that it was my new shampoo and after discontinuing its use my hair has returned to its normal state.</li>
            <li> This may be right for you as a last resort.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately I quickly became allergic to this shampoo and conditioner in one, necessitating a long trip to the doctor&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that this shampoo also makes my hair look super straight after I style it compared to my experience with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I should have been more careful using it as it contains enough Almond Oil to cause an allergic reaction for me.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> Makes your hair very soft...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to use other shampoos but I suffer a lot from dry scalp and this is the only one that helps me with that, smells good too</li>
            <li> So far this product is decent but is far from my expectation.</li>
            <li> At first, right after the usage wet hair seems to be very oily or have some residue on it, when the hair is dry it goes away and hair looks alright.</li>
            <li> I have a few patches of very mild psoriasis and it helps control that too and completely removes the treatment products I use on my scalp.</li>
            <li> The large bottle size dispenser that I now leave in the shower is a big plus</li>
            <li> Maybe it doesn&#x27;t rinse out well when you have soft water.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when searching Amazon and discovered this product.</li>
            <li> So, my personal experience with the product may be very dissimilar to your experience with it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell and oddly enough</li>
            <li> I wash my hair daily because it is very oily</li>
            <li> it probably would&#x27;ve completely got rid of it for me if it wasn&#x27;t for the weirdest side effect it gave me</li>
            <li> anyway, this will probably work for you if your scalp isn&#x27;t extremely sensitive loll...</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to use every 3 days.</li>
            <li> This so far has done nothing for our itchy and flaky scalp.</li>
            <li> and I started using a natural soap to wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> Every bit of the burning completely went away.  </li>
            <li> My daughter was born with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I also like the way it comes out of the bottle,  more like a foam and not like a thick liquid.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry scalp and/or mild to moderate dandruff (two mutually exclusive conditions)</li>
            <li> It looked the way very greasy hair does when it lies flat against a scalp, except that it didnt look greasy.</li>
            <li> and I can confidently go out in public without fear of being ridiculed because of my excessive dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather order something that costs the same or less online (free shipping with prime account) than go to the store.</li>
            <li> I normally add tea tree oil into regular shampoo to moisturize scalp and to get rid of dandruff.</li>
            <li> However I did not see how much it change my dry hair.</li>
            <li> the way, I used Sulfur 8 products, Queen Helene deep conditioner, and Head and Shoulders Dry treatment in addition to this shampoo during the first week to treat my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> He uses other products, but says &amp;#34;head &amp; shoulders dry scalp care with almond oil,&amp;#34; soothes his scalp does not smell, and is easy to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair so only those shampoos clean really well can meet my standard.</li>
            <li> When the bottle gets low I simply add water to it and set it next to my sink and use it as hand soap which is also very affective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I was trying a bunch of different shampoos for my new found psoriasis on the back of my head.</li>
            <li> I have a dry scalp but normal hair.</li>
            <li> If you have any questions, I usually respond quickly.</li>
            <li> If you have any questions, I usually respond quickly.</li>
            <li> and then I  was thinking that head and shoulders is for dry scalps, or to be exact a dry skin</li>
            <li> This may work well for people who have dandruff/dry scalp issues, but I would definitely stay clear of it if you&#x27;re similar to me.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described and packaged securely, so no explosions or spilled product on arrival.</li>
            <li> /&gt;effect so far as diminishing dry scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, as far as the Head &amp; Shoulders Dry Scalp Care, Almond Oil,</li>
            <li> The Head &amp; Shoulders product offers the same level of effectiveness at a fraction of the price AND keeps my scalp from getting dry and itchy after washing.  </li>
            <li> I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t clean my very long, thick hair</li>
            <li> The classic burned my eyes and dried my hair</li>
            <li> let see how long it last.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that three days on my hair continued to lay flat.</li>
            <li> It was so flat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wasted so much money on other shampoos, but I always go back to this one.</li>
            <li> This works though, so I suppose the Almond Oil for dry scalp actually has some additional benefit for me.</li>
            <li> The only shampoo I use along with Head &amp; Shoulders Dry Scalp Care Dandruff Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to anyone suffering from dry scalp.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair like the regular.</li>
            <li> I have tried other high-end brands that get the job done, but at this price its a small sacrifice i am willing to make.</li>
            <li> started using head and shoulders almond a few years ago after a recommendation from a chic that does much research into makeup and other skin</li>
            <li> And i actually have eczema on my scalp so it is VERY dry.</li>
            <li> That was a long couple of months.</li>
            <li> If you are missing days, the shampoo is not going to be nearly as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That was a long couple of months.</li>
            <li> If you are missing days, the shampoo is not going to be nearly as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so i put it in the back of my bathroom closet and came back like 2 months later and tried it again to see if maybe my scalp was just being weird or whatever the first time i tried it...</li>
            <li> This product was as I expected it to be, we use it daily in my house and it lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Add in different water conditions and other environmental factors and any review just starts to look like a shot in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this is, but it&#x27;s my little known secret! :)</li>
            <li> After trying several other options for shampoos , I decided to try Head &amp; Shoulders Dry Scalp Care shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have battled with severe dry scalp for quite sometime.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed that my dry scalp has reduced significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product seems to help the dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I have dry scalp and powdery dandruff.</li>
            <li> This shampoo also doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> My step mom gave me some almond oil for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> If you have a dry scalp like me, i know the feeling.</li>
            <li> and it leaves my hair and scalp too dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, on to what I like about Dry Scalp Care with Almond Oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, on to what I like about Dry Scalp Care with Almond Oil.</li>
            <li> i get dandruff intermittently when my scalp is really dry</li>
            <li> It also takes care of my previously dry scalp and works well on my dyed hair.</li>
            <li> I had REALLY dry scalp+cradle cap.</li>
            <li> I learned that eczema is dry skin</li>
            <li> Also it clears dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;For severe dandruff, you want a coal tar based shampoo which should be limited to twice.</li>
            <li> I have very long, straight, thin hair and after using this product my hair laid flat on my head and had no volume.</li>
            <li> But in my personal experience i still notice some dryness in my scalp that leaves me slightly unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> Never really had dandruff problems but thought could not hurt during dry winter months.</li>
            <li> and it actually leaves my hair softer and less frizzy than 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioners.</li>
            <li> So be careful.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> This made my hair extremely oily.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t why it works sometimes but doesn&#x27;t work as well on other days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will start with a list of shampoos (other than Head &amp; Shoulders) that I have tried and rejected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I see in some other reviews people</li>
            <li> I see in some other reviews people</li>
            <li> now before I get to the weird part, I first want to say that this does help some with dandruff..</li>
            <li> and my scalp became extremely sore after shampooing...</li>
            <li> So, not recommended for Psoriasis but might work on other scalp problems.</li>
            <li> My wife has also had a noticeable reduction in dry and itchy scalp and she hails from Morocco where hair is thick, long, and untamed.</li>
            <li> Use daily and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my thick hair!  </li>
            <li> Only negative it makes the shower floor slippery.</li>
            <li> We have tried other brands, but they don&#x27;t compare to head n shoulders!</li>
            <li> No more dry scalp</li>
            <li> I will also use a bit of separate conditioner to make my hair softer &amp; less tangled (from the OGX organix line).</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s broke out is weird red pumps and we switched back to the orginal.</li>
            <li> Garnier Fructis Dry Scalp Shampoo Anti-dandruff, 25.40-Fluid Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;Nizoral - HARD CORE.</li>
            <li> My hair was never clean after using, and it didn&#x27;t do anything else that it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo for a little over 3 months I have seen a drastic improvement as it relates to my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried other H&amp;S Shampoos/Conditioners in the past and haven&#x27;t had a problem.</li>
            <li> My guess is that the Almond Oil is just too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> Since using this product I have not had any trouble with itching</li>
            <li> B006MRPMPI Head &amp; Shoulders Green Apple Dandruff Shampoo</li>
            <li> B006MRPMPI Head &amp; Shoulders Green Apple Dandruff Shampoo</li>
            <li> If you have trouble in scalp, take this -</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel striped and dried after use.</li>
            <li> It only made the itching worse.</li>
            <li> I say previously dried scalp because it cured mine.</li>
            <li> On the other hand Nizoral shampoo is head and shoulders above both but is rather expensive.</li>
            <li> I will put this plainly...</li>
            <li> My dandruff really bad when I started using this two weeks ago, but I&#x27;ve seen much improvement since.</li>
            <li> ugly: there&#x27;s so much of it, ahhhhh.</li>
            <li> am not sure why, is it the Almond oil...</li>
            <li> but I guess it might contain some chemical that can make your hair feel silly but can actually block your pore and cause hair loss.</li>
            <li> I often by dandruff shampoo because I get flakes in my hair, but I usually still seem to have flakes.</li>
            <li> In the past I have not cared for Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo because of the odor.  </li>
            <li> what a difference it made after the first use, no more itch, no more annoying dandruff from the dryness.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t help me wit my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this one I have noticed that I hardly ever have flakes.</li>
            <li> have complained that the shampoo did not help with the dandruff.</li>
            <li> have complained that the shampoo did not help with the dandruff.</li>
            <li> It made it greasy and heavy and, as I&#x27;ve already said, made the itching worse.</li>
            <li> It felt cleaned and moisturized and no more itchiness!</li>
            <li> What do I mean by neutral?</li>
            <li> What do I mean by neutral?</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean that it won&#x27;t work for garden variety dandruff.</li>
            <li> It made it look dirty and weighed down my hair, destroyed what little volume I have.</li>
            <li> I tried the classic Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo and after the age of 1 she began to get eczema and would battle cradle crap as an infant.  </li>
            <li> As of recent years I get dry scalp all the time, its very annoying because it gets itchy.</li>
            <li> Throw in all the other varieties of shampoo and selecting just one for you seems impossible.</li>
            <li> use this approximately 2-3 times a week</li>
            <li> The itch and flakes have dramatically decreased.</li>
            <li> The pump was broken, some shampoo was spilled</li>
            <li> just not totally happy with it.</li>
            <li> For the past year I&#x27;ve had an extremely bad burning feeling on the insides of my eye lids.  </li>
            <li> Received the item today and such a worst packing...</li>
            <li> I had awful scalp problem, its the 2nd week</li>
            <li> It works, but god is it expensive.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis on my scalp and expensive cement shampoos don&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> Even my girlfriend has been using it over her expensive stuff</li>
            <li> This item is not good makes my head burn and smells bad</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t want to  think im crazy</li>
            <li> but it hurt even worse this time!!</li>
            <li> Very careless packing...</li>
            <li> Very difficult to release the pump from lock state.</li>
            <li> Bad:  </li>
            <li> I just assumed that I had a one-off bad hair day.</li>
            <li> Sometimes my eyes would have these \\&quot;episodes\\&quot; of extremely bad burning and watering.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is atrocious, I&#x27;ve rinsed my hair 5 times and this garbage still won&#x27;t get out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with the packing</li>
            <li> and it looked so horrible that I had to wear it up in a ponytail.</li>
            <li> it hurt so bad!!...</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible product.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love it. I had dry scalp and dandruff and works amazing.</li>
            <li> Like the product except when rinsing I have to be extra thorough,&lt;br /&gt;and can&#x27;t use without conditioner after.  It seems to have a mild&lt;br /&gt;effect so far as diminishing dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product.  Fast Ship.  A+++!!</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders Dry Scalp Care Dandruff Shampoo has always been an excellent shampoo for my hair and dry scalp.  I have a few patches of very mild psoriasis and it helps control that too and completely removes the treatment products I use on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I will put this plainly...If you have dry scalp and/or mild to moderate dandruff (two mutually exclusive conditions) this is the product for you!  The cost of the Nutrogena dandruff shampoo (while highly effective) is enough to keep it on the luxury items list indefinitely in my household.  The Head &amp; Shoulders product offers the same level of effectiveness at a fraction of the price AND keeps my scalp from getting dry and itchy after washing.  My wife has also had a noticeable reduction in dry and itchy scalp and she hails from Morocco where hair is thick, long, and untamed.</li>
            <li> my aunt loved this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I have battled with severe dry scalp for quite sometime. After using this shampoo for a little over 3 months I have seen a drastic improvement as it relates to my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I use this approximately 2-3 times a week and I have noticed that my dry scalp has reduced significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product was as I expected it to be, we use it daily in my house and it lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Makes my hair silky smooth and keeps my scalp soothed as well. Great product! Also love the large size and the pump dispenser. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Made my hair SO greasy. I have dry scalp and normal (fine) hair. Would not recommend. I have tried other H&amp;S Shampoos/Conditioners in the past and haven&#x27;t had a problem. My guess is that the Almond Oil is just too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> You cannot beat quality and convenience.  This shampoo is quality, and Amazon is convenience.  They two are unbeatable winners.</li>
            <li> Do not buy!!..&lt;br /&gt;I have always used different types of H&amp;S. I always buy from Wmart, CVS etc.&lt;br /&gt;For the first time i bought it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I started feeling itchy on my face, head, neck area but didnt know why.&lt;br /&gt;I didnt suspect H&amp;S at all because always used it. So i changed my blade, cream, shaving gel etc.&lt;br /&gt;The itchyness would still not go away. Until I had travelled for 1 month forgetting this H&amp;S at home and used a friends shampoo there. I didnt realize my itchyness actually stopped for a month until I came back and used this 1 again.&lt;br /&gt;The itchyness happens the next day around 12 hrs later.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure why, is it the Almond oil... I bought it in March 2013, realized the itchyness is caused by this shampoo in Aug 2013 (it took a while coz i didnt realize it would be this). The expiry is 1/2015.&lt;br /&gt;So Goodluck if you buy or maybe just get it from a store.</li>
            <li> Awesome for the hair and body wash.</li>
            <li> This product seems to help the dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Use daily and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my thick hair!  Keeps my scalp from flaking in winter!</li>
            <li> we like this head n shoulder shampoo cause it smells great and my husband&#x27;s dandraft eliminates.I would recommend this product to anyone specially men&#x27;s.Also the price is really low compare to store..That&#x27;s why Love subscribe and save here...</li>
            <li> My new favorite shampoo!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice Tahir Khan love it .</li>
            <li> I like that it moisturize my hairl!</li>
            <li> love head and shoulders---and very hard to find shampoo with a pump top on anymore---this does the job and the price was great and shipping was fantastic--bottles are wrapped in plastic so if a bottle should leak it wont be a thru the shipping box---none of mine leaked but the plastic was a nice thing to see----i will be buying this again</li>
            <li> I have dry scalp and powdery dandruff. I normally add tea tree oil into regular shampoo to moisturize scalp and to get rid of dandruff. I decided to try this shampoo instead. After two days of usage, the dandruff was back. It didn&#x27;t work for me at all. The shampoo smells very nice. At first, right after the usage wet hair seems to be very oily or have some residue on it, when the hair is dry it goes away and hair looks alright. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t help me wit my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Head and shoulders is great for my hair and scalp. My scalp is always hurting because of the dandruff and my tendency to scratch it til it gets wounded. So naturally, with head and shoulders taking care of my dandruff, I was able yo not scratch my head and not make new wounds and reopen old ones</li>
            <li> I have a dry scalp but normal hair. This made my hair extremely oily. It made it look dirty and weighed down my hair, destroyed what little volume I have. I prefer the regular H&amp;S to this almond oil one.</li>
            <li> This one smells good, does it job. let see how long it last.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than in the stores.  Great product as always</li>
            <li> my scalp feels a lot better and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry anymore after getting out of the shower</li>
            <li> Received the item today and such a worst packing... All the shampoo is spilled out... Very careless packing... I&#x27;m very disappointed with the packing</li>
            <li> Started off with just me buying this product for myself (no I dont have dandruff) but I like the shampoo.  When the bottle gets low I simply add water to it and set it next to my sink and use it as hand soap which is also very affective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the entire family is using it.</li>
            <li> Thought it was origial scent which it almond, fast shipping, great quality.</li>
            <li> Stops the dandruff. I swear, I can&#x27;t use any normal shampoo even if I try to find the quality brands. I&#x27;ll start getting mild dandruff days after stopping Head and shoulders use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Head and Shoulders: you have my business for life.</li>
            <li> I think my problems are more dry scalp than dandruff (I guess there is a difference) since regular head&amp;shoulders (and generics) did not work for me.  This works though, so I suppose the Almond Oil for dry scalp actually has some additional benefit for me.</li>
            <li> Nice pump bottle, but the almond oil leaves scalp and hair a bit too oily and heavy for my light weight caucasian hair.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. I had awful scalp problem, its the 2nd week and they are almost gone.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo have been using it for years now works great</li>
            <li> The almond oil h&amp;s makes my hair super greasy! Maybe it doesn&#x27;t rinse out well when you have soft water. Doesn&#x27;t help flakes. Not my favorite head &amp; shoulders.</li>
            <li> It does what it says but i think it leaves my hair oily, and the smell is a bit suffocating to me, but I love the way my hair feels just after.</li>
            <li> Great scent and good on hair</li>
            <li> The Product Works Great.  It got rid of most of my dandruff and I can confidently go out in public without fear of being ridiculed because of my excessive dandruff.  My only gripe with this product is that the product leaves my skin feeling burned, especially on the face.  Great product, unfortunately I am scared to think what would happen to my skin if I were to use this product for an extended period of time.  Try a different Dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> The pump makes washing my hair more convenient and quicker rather than stopping, picking up a whole bottle and squeezing. This would make it much easier for people suffering from ailments that may inhibit them. This shampoo also doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. Guess It might have something to do with the almond oil. My dandruff really bad when I started using this two weeks ago, but I&#x27;ve seen much improvement since.</li>
            <li> Good value size, and pump is handy; does well to hydrate scalp.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair so only those shampoos clean really well can meet my standard. So far this product is decent but is far from my expectation. The product itself is like a mix of shampoo and conditioner and makes my hair feel greasy. I guess this is probably because it&#x27;s 2 in 1. I didn&#x27;t check ingredients but I guess it might contain some chemical that can make your hair feel silly but can actually block your pore and cause hair loss. So be careful. I&#x27;m not a big fan of 2 in 1. Conditioner shouldn&#x27;t touch scalp in the first place.</li>
            <li> We have tried other brands, but they don&#x27;t compare to head n shoulders! The itch and flakes have dramatically decreased. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this product as cleans hair really well</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend who uses H&amp;S.  I must admit I gave it a try one day in the shower because of the Almond Oil.  Don&#x27;t tell him, but I have been using it daily.  Leaves my hair very soft and manageable.  We will surely be purchasing more.  (Sooner than he thinks!)</li>
            <li> The product is just as advertised and does exactly what shampoo is supposed to do in a convenient pump bottle.</li>
            <li> It seems to me that this stuff may actually work. I often by dandruff shampoo because I get flakes in my hair, but I usually still seem to have flakes. Since I started using this one I have noticed that I hardly ever have flakes. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I always seem to come back to H&amp;S shampoo.  I like the way it foams up on my hair and I use it as a shaving foam on face, for shaving.  So, I get the almond oil on both head and face.  I also like the way it comes out of the bottle,  more like a foam and not like a thick liquid.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I love this product but when I received it the container was broke and it had leaked all over inside the box and is unusable</li>
            <li> Very good , I had bought this product from 4 months and still not finish yet ...</li>
            <li> Product works great and it was so convenient to have it delivered to my home.  Made life simple and my husband had what he needed.</li>
            <li> I really like the subtle fragrance of this product (expecially compared to the original H&amp;S formula), and I find that it works well and am very satisfied.  I will continue to use this and the Amazon price is excellent compared to local sources.</li>
            <li> My family loves the Head &amp; Shoulders line of shampoos and conditioners. There seems to be something for everyone, so to speak - and I am sure you can find a product that fits you as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is different - and your head/hair will react differently to products as compared to how I react. BUT, with that said, I still stand by the fact that H&amp;S has so many different products that there is sure to be something for your head of hair! LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as far as the Head &amp; Shoulders Dry Scalp Care, Almond Oil, Dandruff Shampoo - I love it. I was fully prepared to give it the two-weeks trial to see if it was the &amp;#34;one for me&amp;#34; - but it did not even take two days! After one use - one day - my scalp felt healthier! It felt cleaned and moisturized and no more itchiness! The &amp;#34;in-shower&amp;#34; experience was awesome! A very mild tingling that seemed almost spa-like!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have color treated hair because, well, I am older and graying! LOL! But this H &amp; S product - as well as all of their products - treats my coloring with respect! I have never noticed any quicker fading of the color or brassiness or anything else unusual. Just good clean hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the scent. Unlike some of those other shampoos that seem to knock others over when you exit the bathroom, Head &amp; Shoulderd has a beautifully clean &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; smell that is mild and not bothersome to others.</li>
            <li> In the past I have not cared for Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo because of the odor.  I love this shampoo!!  My scalp was constantly itching and bother me.  Since using this product I have not had any trouble with itching and I love the smell.  It leaves my hair very soft and smelling great.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> A family favorite. It was a nice change to have the pump dispenser--saved struggling with the lid in the shower! I&#x27;m definitely buying this from Amazon on a regular basis. I love having it delivered to my door!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. And the fact that it comes in a pump bottle is the biggest plus!</li>
            <li> The pump was broken, some shampoo was spilled</li>
            <li> I guess it isn&#x27;t quite the shampoos fault but I don&#x27;t why it works sometimes but doesn&#x27;t work as well on other days.</li>
            <li> This is what i wanted.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s shampoo&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s in a big bottle&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cost effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Nothing- because it&#x27;s shampoo&lt;br /&gt;I guess if you wanted to travel with this, it would take up a lot of luggage space.</li>
            <li> I use H&amp;S shampoo daily. Not because I have a very dry scalp but because it keeps my hair clean, smells good, and I don&#x27;t feel like having 10 different shampoo&#x27;s in my shower. What I do notice is that if I run out and don&#x27;t use head and shoulders shampoo for a week or so, I will get some flakes or notice an itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why switch when it works great. I buy in bulk and ensure that I never run out.</li>
            <li> Large bottle for a good price. Helps ease my itchy scalp, but tends to make my hair more oily.</li>
            <li> This product really is great and helped my scalp after one use!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This is a great produce and you should try it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s head and shoulders. Chances are, this isn&#x27;t your first encounter with it. It works or it doesn&#x27;t. For me, it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this so cool is that the pump allows you the perfect amount of shampoo. With the bottles, I end up using way too much and it&#x27;s not like you can put it in the bottle. The pump is way more efficient, which should be taken into consideration when calculating it&#x27;s cost. I bought it the first time because  price per ounce what better than in my local store. I will buy it again because with it&#x27;s efficiency it is a much better deal.</li>
            <li> Quite bigger than what I thought and I particularly have some trouble to deal with that kind of lid. My fault about the lid.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when searching Amazon and discovered this product. My step mom gave me some almond oil for my dry skin. I gave myself a scalp treatment.Then I found this product and was so excited to begin use right away.This is a special treat for when you rinse most of your skin receives the benefit of the almond oil.</li>
            <li> makes my hair feel good and smells great</li>
            <li> If you have a dry scalp like me, i know the feeling. This product had me 100% flake free after only a week of using the product! And i actually have eczema on my scalp so it is VERY dry. But this product it amazing and cleared it all away!</li>
            <li> ok, I am a rough tuff guy, no doubt about it---but this shampoo is gentle, smells good and can be used daily Also it clears dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;For severe dandruff, you want a coal tar based shampoo which should be limited to twice. A week.  On the other hand Nizoral shampoo is head and shoulders above both but is rather expensive.</li>
            <li> Delivered what said. Good value coconut not my favorite but worth the price.</li>
            <li> Was bought for the kids for daily use&lt;br /&gt;they love it&lt;br /&gt;it is a quality product&lt;br /&gt;and yes, it controls Dandruff</li>
            <li> I struggled with how to attack this review for two reasons. First, there are 18! different kinds of Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo, 18! Throw in all the other varieties of shampoo and selecting just one for you seems impossible. Second, every person&#x27;s body is unique and will have a unique reaction to any hair product. So, my personal experience with the product may be very dissimilar to your experience with it. Add in different water conditions and other environmental factors and any review just starts to look like a shot in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, with all of that in mind, I will share my personal shampoo journey with you. Maybe you will find it helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will start with a list of shampoos (other than Head &amp; Shoulders) that I have tried and rejected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Selsun Blue - It just didn&#x27;t work for me. -&gt; [[ASIN:B001UGL84U Selsun Blue Medicated Maximum Strength Dandruff Shampoo, 11 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena T/Gel - Couldn&#x27;t get around the smell of this stuff. -&gt; [[ASIN:B000052XZQ Neutrogena T-Gel Therapeutic Shampoo, Extra Strength, 6 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;Garnier Fructis Dry Scalp - Love the smell, somewhat helpful, just not totally happy with it. -&gt; [[ASIN:B003QU8WWY Garnier Fructis Dry Scalp Shampoo Anti-dandruff, 25.40-Fluid Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;Nizoral - HARD CORE. Not for me. It works, but god is it expensive. This may be right for you as a last resort. -&gt; [[ASIN:B0000Y3CRY Nizoral Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, 4 oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, on to Head &amp; Shoulders varieties that I have tried but do not like as much as this one.&lt;br /&gt;Classic Clean - This is a close 2nd. I like it fine. I feel like it works for me, but it does not foam up quite as much as I like and it leaves my hair and scalp too dry. -&gt; [[ASIN:B000GCUTKI Head &amp; Shoulders Classic Clean 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo And Conditioner With Pump 33.8 Fl Oz]]&lt;br /&gt;Clinical Strength - I don&#x27;t really like the smell and oddly enough I don&#x27;t think it works as well for me. -&gt; [[ASIN:B004H6YKPE Head &amp; Shoulders Shampoo, Clinical Strength, 14.2 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;Extra Strength - Similar to Classic Clean. I can&#x27;t tell much of a difference. -&gt; [[ASIN:B008Q8XJKQ Head &amp; Shoulders Extra Strength For Men Dandruff Shampoo 14.2 Fl Oz]]&lt;br /&gt;Green Apple - I got this accidently one time. I am not a fan of the smell. That was a long couple of months. Lol. -&gt; [[ASIN:B006MRPMPI Head &amp; Shoulders Green Apple Dandruff Shampoo 14.2 Fl Oz (Pack of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, on to what I like about Dry Scalp Care with Almond Oil. First, it works for me. I don&#x27;t have dandruff when I use it on a regular basis. I see in some other reviews people have complained that the shampoo did not help with the dandruff. While those reviews may be totally valid, I would like to point out that consistent use, EVERY DAY, is really important. If you are missing days, the shampoo is not going to be nearly as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, the smell is really nice, as well as being neutral. What do I mean by neutral? One day my wife was in the shower with me, (*high fives self*) and she really liked the smell and started to use it. So, I can confirm that it is pleasant, mild, and gender neutral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panultimately, (word of the day?) this shampoo leaves my skin moist and my scalp feeling good. I have taken to using the shampoo as body wash as well because of how it moisturizes all of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I love the pump on the bottle. It just makes life easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope all of this helps you make a decision. If you have any questions, I usually respond quickly. Good Luck, hope you like it.h, 14.2 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;Extra Strength - Similar to Classic Clean.

            <li> Great seller! On time and just as described! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very nice shampoo. I will probably use this all the time now.</li>
            <li> My fault, really - didn&#x27;t realize this had Almond extract everywhere.  As someone who&#x27;s allergic to nuts, I&#x27;d give it a pass.</li>
            <li> I have been using Head &amp; Shoulders for a long time and this with the Almond Oil is the BEST.  Keeps away dandruff and itchy scalp while leaving my hair feeling great.</li>
            <li> Totally fine product.</li>
            <li> The good: Good bargain and will last for a while&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:  Smells like processed plastic and leaves my hair feeling oily and glazed.  I&#x27;m not getting any almond smell with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ugly: there&#x27;s so much of it, ahhhhh.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!</li>
            <li> This thing is fantastic! It works- tried and true like ALL Head &amp; Shoulder&#x27;s shampoo&#x27;s. But man, it smells fantastic! May be the Almond Oil but it&#x27;s a great shampoo and I will be using it forever and ever.</li>
            <li> This is the long time favorite in our house.  It moisturizes the scalp, gets rid of the dandruff and no burning or irritation.</li>
            <li> helped fix our dandruff problem!</li>
            <li> shampoo, does what it says it does.....</li>
            <li> If you have trouble in scalp, take this -</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff/dry scalp issues and purchased this product solely because I loved the almond scent and needed a new shampoo. I have very long, straight, thin hair and after using this product my hair laid flat on my head and had no volume. It looked the way very greasy hair does when it lies flat against a scalp, except that it didnt look greasy. When I first used it I didn&#x27;t even make the connection between the shampoo and my hair. I just assumed that I had a one-off bad hair day. I wash my hair daily because it is very oily and I noticed that three days on my hair continued to lay flat. It was so flat and it looked so horrible that I had to wear it up in a ponytail. I realized then that it was my new shampoo and after discontinuing its use my hair has returned to its normal state. This may work well for people who have dandruff/dry scalp issues, but I would definitely stay clear of it if you&#x27;re similar to me.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, especially if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this shampoo!</li>
            <li> good deal and treats my itchy scalp</li>
            <li> smell good. feel good.</li>
            <li> i love head and shoulders shampoo--it keeps my hair soft and shiny and moisturizes my scalp--and completely eliminates any dandruff.  i get dandruff intermittently when my scalp is really dry and it flakes.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, it actually works. Awesome smell.  The only shampoo I use along with Head &amp; Shoulders Dry Scalp Care Dandruff Conditioner. Love the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this shampoo since they came out and have been loving it ever since. I hope they never stop making this!</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders makes great shampoo and this one is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize this H&amp;S product was a 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner.  I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t clean my very long, thick hair well and/or possibly leave a residue.  Instead, it really helped with my itching and prevented any flakes for a few days between washings.  I am happy also that the conditioner helps defrizz my hair that gets frizzed out daily in our high humidity weather.  For the price, I cannot imagine finding such a good product anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I quickly became allergic to this shampoo and conditioner in one, necessitating a long trip to the doctor&#x27;s office.  I should have been more careful using it as it contains enough Almond Oil to cause an allergic reaction for me.  It took many weeks also, so be careful if you have allergies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any luck with the regular Head and Shoulders and some good results with the &#x27;Clinical Strength&#x27; / selenium sulfide based Head and Shoulders.  I read some positive reviews of this type of H &amp; S and so far it my all time favorite for not only reducing scale but also making your scalp more comfortable.  The large bottle size dispenser that I now leave in the shower is a big plus and I definitely will be ordering more.  VERY economical compared to many as you can see if you are using any other specialty dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> I do not have to use daily this as the directions seem to imply.  Quantity is the key.  It gives you a lot for your buck.</li>
            <li> Love it, smells amazing and tingles as you use it, so refreshing</li>
            <li> Using this along with 2 minute moisturizer..1st time i.ve found products that cure dandruff.</li>
            <li> Have never had a bottle this big of H&amp;S. It works good, as usual, and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> The pump has design some problem. Very difficult to release the pump from lock state. I have to disassemble the pump before I can use pliers to turn the pump to unlock state.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bottle of Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> The boyfriend claims that it smells too sweet... well I got it because it was cheap guy!</li>
            <li> I rely in head and shoulders. I have psoriasis on my scalp and expensive cement shampoos don&#x27;t do it for me. Head and shoulders releives the itch if used daily for my condition. Great scent great product.</li>
            <li> Great smell. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel striped and dried after use. No more dry scalp</li>

            <li> Simple and effective. Been looking for years for a shampoo that would help dryness and itchy scalp, this is it.</li>
            <li> i love head and shoulders.  hair soft and smell FRESH</li>
            <li> this is good one..recevied on time and as mentioned it order..i would recomand to friends ..i am happy with it</li>
            <li> the only reason i gave this 3 stars is because it didnt work for me..but id give the product itself 4 or 5 stars...now before I get to the weird part, I first want to say that this does help some with dandruff..it probably would&#x27;ve completely got rid of it for me if it wasn&#x27;t for the weirdest side effect it gave me lol.... i first used this stuff when i was young maybe like 12 or 13- no problem worked decent...but id try it again 7 years later (now lol) and the weirdest thing happened- it made my scalp VERY sore...maybe im just a freak haha but i used it only once and my scalp became extremely sore after shampooing...maybe they have changed the formula since i last used it, but the scalp pain/soreness i experienced was really unbearable :p it hurt so bad!!...so i put it in the back of my bathroom closet and came back like 2 months later and tried it again to see if maybe my scalp was just being weird or whatever the first time i tried it...so i try it again..same thing!!! but it hurt even worse this time!! so i just threw it away to make sure i didn&#x27;t try it \\&quot;once more\\&quot; and put my scalp through that pain again.. anyway, this will probably work for you if your scalp isn&#x27;t extremely sensitive loll...but please, if anyone out there reads this and has had the same experience, please let me know! i don&#x27;t want to  think im crazy loll</li>
            <li> This is a very good product that without a doubt removes all your dandruff within days. But in my personal experience i still notice some dryness in my scalp that leaves me slightly unsatisfied. I have tried other high-end brands that get the job done, but at this price its a small sacrifice i am willing to make.</li>
            <li> But I was trying a bunch of different shampoos for my new found psoriasis on the back of my head. It only made the itching worse. Terrible. That doesn&#x27;t mean that it won&#x27;t work for garden variety dandruff. It was just too much for my hair. It made it greasy and heavy and, as I&#x27;ve already said, made the itching worse. So, not recommended for Psoriasis but might work on other scalp problems.</li>
            <li> Never really had dandruff problems but thought could not hurt during dry winter months. This stuff is great as my wife loves the smell and it actually leaves my hair softer and less frizzy than 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioners. No dandruff or itchy scalp is an added bonus as I will be buying this from now on.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shampoo for dry hair..love how my hair feels after using. Awesome price..Smiles</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this shampoo/conditioner. Works well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dandruff anymore. What else do you need to hear?</li>
            <li> started using head and shoulders almond a few years ago after a recommendation from a chic that does much research into makeup and other skin products.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the product itself. As well as the fact that amazon has it in pump form.</li>
            <li> H&amp;S for the Win again, great smell, works incredible to keep moisture retention in my hair. It is noticeably more relaxed and full after the 3 months of usage. I have always used H&amp;S products since they help keep my dandruff at bay, and if you think about the Dry Scalp issue, which is the root cause of dandruff, the more moisture, the better! Almond is definitely my favorite flavor by far (for foods and this smell is great) and it&#x27;s relaxing actually as a scent.</li>
            <li> As of recent years I get dry scalp all the time, its very annoying because it gets itchy. After trying several other options for shampoos , I decided to try Head &amp; Shoulders Dry Scalp Care shampoo. WOW!! what a difference it made after the first use, no more itch, no more annoying dandruff from the dryness. I definitely recommend this to anyone suffering from dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible product. My hair was never clean after using, and it didn&#x27;t do anything else that it was supposed to. By the time the bottle was out and I got something else, I had forgotten what clean, soft hair felt like.</li>
            <li> This is amazing, it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes like the regular head and shoulders classic. It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair like the regular. Heed allergy warnings if you have a nut allergy but producers, please don&#x27;t change the ingredients that have made my life better, I am asking you. The classic burned my eyes and dried my hair and I had to stop buying it. This one works for me. It also takes care of my previously dry scalp and works well on my dyed hair. I love it. I say previously dried scalp because it cured mine. The classic works for some but this works for me. I don&#x27;t want this product to change because I have tried everything else and nothing else worked for me. Finally a good dandruff and scalp caretaker. Please producers listen and don&#x27;t change a thing. It doesn&#x27;t work for some but it has made my problem history. I recommend it highly if it works for you. Try it, but you can&#x27;t please everyone. The regular works for some, this works for me. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love this product and use it every other days. It really helps us with our dry scalps and smells and feels nice.</li>
            <li> Prefer the Original formula, something about the almond oil i can put my finger on it.</li>
            <li> love that I could purchase it with this inexpensive price&lt;br /&gt;You can use it almost for a year, maybe more than a year!!</li>
            <li> Used by the entire family. Gentle enough to use every 3 days. Priced well. No issues. Happy with purchase. Works as expected. Smells great too. Have purchased before. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This so far has done nothing for our itchy and flaky scalp.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair hydrated and smooth!</li>
            <li> Came perfectly packaged. Same big bottle you buy at Costco. Last forever at a great price. Would purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> My son has psoriasis. He uses other products, but says &amp;#34;head &amp; shoulders dry scalp care with almond oil,&amp;#34; soothes his scalp does not smell, and is easy to use on a daily basis. I love free shipping, I love to order products. I&#x27;d rather order something that costs the same or less online (free shipping with prime account) than go to the store. My teens can and do add items to my bag and I just click and send as needed. This product is great. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Smells great and my hair and scalp look good!</li>
            <li> Smells good (mild) and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband since he has a dandruff problem and he loves it. He likes the smell and the fact that is does help with the dandruff.</li>
            <li> I thought that I would have to get checked out by a dermatologist for severe dandruff before I bought this. I had REALLY dry scalp+cradle cap. I started washing my hair and letting the shampoo soak for a bit about 3-5 times a week. All of my flakes were gone by the middle of the second week. Now I only use it about biweekly to make sure the flakes and itchiness stays away.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I used Sulfur 8 products, Queen Helene deep conditioner, and Head and Shoulders Dry treatment in addition to this shampoo during the first week to treat my scalp and hair. My scalp has never been healthier.</li>
            <li> I used to like this shampoo because it moisturized my hair so well.  For the past year I&#x27;ve had an extremely bad burning feeling on the insides of my eye lids.  My eye doctor said it was allergies/irritation.  Sometimes my eyes would have these \\&quot;episodes\\&quot; of extremely bad burning and watering.  It also happened every time I showered.  I thought it was just chlorinated water.  I finally started suspecting this shampoo and I started using a natural soap to wash my hair.  Every bit of the burning completely went away.  Just to be sure it was this shampoo, I started using it again and sure enough the burning returned.  I&#x27;m throwing this away and I will never use it again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that I don&#x27;t have a dandruff problem. So why do I use this shampoo? Because back in the day a girl from school would use this brand of shampoos &amp; she had shiny black gorgeous looking hair, always. &amp; I remembered that because she had no dandruff! Of all the shampoos available, how is it that H&amp;S could possibly be known for beauty too? Remember that commercial with the stunning soap opera star? I do! So it&#x27;s kinda no wonder that I grabbed this shampoo because it was all there was (borrowed it) after running out of my more for glamorous shampoo. As soon as I lather it, it feels so silky on my hair. Because it&#x27;s medicated I don&#x27;t use it everyday just like the bottle  says, but I notice thinking to myself that if I want a good hair day I&#x27;ll use this! It feels like it locks in moisture. I will also use a bit of separate conditioner to make my hair softer &amp; less tangled (from the OGX organix line). I also noticed that this shampoo also makes my hair look super straight after I style it compared to my experience with other shampoos. I don&#x27;t know why this is, but it&#x27;s my little known secret! :)</li>
            <li> I am nothing without my head and shoulders shampoo. Product was exactly as described and packaged securely, so no explosions or spilled product on arrival. Love the smell and the only shampoo I can use for my exzema laden hair. Extremely effective.</li>
            <li> All the benefits of Head &amp; Shoulders without the smell.</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent. Effective at preventing dandruff.</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders is the only brand my boyfriend uses! I have tried different kinds of head and shoulders for him and he never complains!</li>
            <li> Bought it on a whim (the Almond Oil version).  Works like any of their products, and the scent is a very pleasant change from tropical-this and fresh-that.</li>
            <li> Thank you for your things very well</li>
            <li> Now my favorite shampoo. Even my girlfriend has been using it over her expensive stuff</li>
            <li> great product great price</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s broke out is weird red pumps and we switched back to the orginal.</li>
            <li> pump doesn&#x27;t work at all and the product it self is not as good as regular head and shoulders. i feel like it&#x27;s faked one</li>
            <li> I always love this shampoo, from time to time I&#x27;ll try to use other shampoos but I suffer a lot from dry scalp and this is the only one that helps me with that, smells good too</li>
            <li> Accutane user approved.</li>
            <li> This is very great shampoo and smells great!! Great price as well with Amazon Mom Subscribe and Save. I would recommend it if you like Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo smells good and it&#x27;s been a month and it&#x27;s still full!</li>
            <li> Good value and seems to work well.</li>
            <li> This item is not good makes my head burn and smells bad</li>
            <li> With such a large bottle, it is worth this money. However I did not see how much it change my dry hair.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair very soft...oooooo!</li>
            <li> This is a reliable product, delivered on schedule</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied like before. I&#x27;m Head&amp;Shoulder addict .</li>
            <li> this works and is easier on yours eyes if soap gets in them.</li>
            <li> Only negative it makes the shower floor slippery. Have to watch that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wasted so much money on other shampoos, but I always go back to this one. It works.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has changed my life.</li>
            <li> Horrible! My hair is plastered to my head! This stuff is atrocious, I&#x27;ve rinsed my hair 5 times and this garbage still won&#x27;t get out! 8 dollar bottle in the garbage! Good riddance!</li>
            <li> My daughter was born with extremely sensitive skin. I tried the classic Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo and after the age of 1 she began to get eczema and would battle cradle crap as an infant.  I learned that eczema is dry skin and then I  was thinking that head and shoulders is for dry scalps, or to be exact a dry skin so I decided to bath my daughter with the shampoo as a body wash and a shampoo.  IT WORKED!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head and shoulders eliminated her skin from being itchy and irritated and she did not have anymore cradle cap as a baby!  The almond scent is a bit more pleasant to smell on my little girl than the classic scent.</li>
            <li> Smells great, keeps the flakes at bay, good value.  I use this daily.</li>
