            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I have it on now and love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite polishes for spring/summer.</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did</li>
            <li>This color is cute but not for anyone over the age of 18.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite colors.</li>
            <li>I love hot pinks and fuchsias, so good on my very light, pinky toned skin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite color of all times!!</li>
            <li>So happy I ordered this particular shade.</li>
            <li>Excellent- fast shipping &amp; product exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I love the sparkle in the polish and love it that the nail polish is smooth to the touch when it is applied to the nail unlike a lot of polishes with glitter in it.</li>
            <li>This color is a perfect darker pink with shimmer.</li>
            <li>this is the most prettiest most beautiful pink I have ever seen in a Polish</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the perfect pink!</li>
            <li>It has incredible tiny glitter in the completely smooth formula, that looks to be inside, giving depth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The little bit of sparkle is perfect.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>I do not agree with another reviewer that this is only good on people 18 and under.</li>
            <li>this color is beautiful specially if you pair it with the black cracle....</li>
            <li>The color is exactly what i was looking for and i appreciate that it was sent so quickly as we&#x27;ll.&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
            <li>The new colors are good but not for every day on a old lady!!</li>
            <li>it really has personality!!  </li>
            <li>I liked the last time I got my toes done</li>
            <li>definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite colors from OPI so far.</li>
            <li>bright, hot pink with glass flecks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as pretty in the picture, but then it rarely is.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this color to anyone that love pink :)</li>
            <li>I bought the only two they had because I love the color.</li>
            <li>Received two compliments first day</li>
            <li>The finish is what I guess would be called a foil, but not like old, cheap looking metallics.</li>
            <li>My husband, always complimentary, really, really did like this</li>
            <li>I love the color, especially for summertime.</li>
            <li>I love it so much, I just ordered OPI&#x27;s Come to Poppy, a coral color with the same characteristics.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a color to be noticed, and it certainly was.</li>
            <li>This color is so vibrant and pretty against tan skin, I get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li>it is very thick and has great coverage.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>And I get the most compliments when using this color than any other color I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty young, too.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so vibrant and shiny</li>
            <li>and i didn&#x27;t have to drive around looking for new colors</li>
            <li>reapplied my quick-dry topcoat over the new layer of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>color is such a vibrant, bright hot pink, with a very slight fuchsia tint.</li>
            <li>I recently went back in for a mani/pedi, and put this on my fingers (and a purple on my toes), and I&#x27;m still liking the pink better.</li>
            <li>What an exciting shade of fushia pink!</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and the shipping came quicker then expected.</li>
            <li>Even the girl in the salon complimented this color - it&#x27;s a really vibrant, shimmery pink that stands out without looking gaudy.  </li>
            <li>(Which is a little unusual for nail polish).</li>

            <li> It is quality and long lasting.</li>
            <li> About day 8 I applied another coat, to fill in new growth and cover the slight, expected tip wear.</li>

            <li> Holy cow.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement since it was a previous line.</li>
            <li> little bikini&#x27;s</li>
            <li> With a little shimmer!  </li>
            <li> I had one small chip too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not your ordinary color.</li>
            <li> This is a discontinued polish and hard to find.  </li>
            <li> and I was just bored</li>
            <li> my opinion.but trust me if you&#x27;re wary about it</li>

            <li> What an exciting shade of fushia pink! So happy I ordered this particular shade. I liked it so much that I ordered an additional bottle and gave it to my daughter and she loved it,too. It&#x27;s a great shade for &amp;#34;party&amp;#34; colors for your nails for summer. A &amp;#34;punch&amp;#34; of color and it&#x27;s not gaudy,but lots of beautiful color. Try &amp;#34;Be a dahlia won&#x27;t you&amp;#34;,on your toes as well. Not only awesome and amazing for your hands,but so cute on your toes,too! Try it you&#x27;ll see and it&#x27;s useful for more than one use of a great color.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this color yet but have bought several other colors from O.P.I.  The polish is top notch and stays on forever.  No chipping.  Love all of the 5 colors I purchased.  Plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> this color is beautiful specially if you pair it with the black cracle....i highly recommend this color to anyone that love pink :)</li>
            <li> I have worn this color for many years.  And I get the most compliments when using this color than any other color I have ever used.  There is not another color that come close to ,Be a Dahlia Won&#x27;t You.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a purple I liked the last time I got my toes done (I always do purple), so I went out on a limb and picked this color at the salon.  Holy cow.  I am never going back.  I recently went back in for a mani/pedi, and put this on my fingers (and a purple on my toes), and I&#x27;m still liking the pink better. Even the girl in the salon complimented this color - it&#x27;s a really vibrant, shimmery pink that stands out without looking gaudy.  I love it so much.</li>
            <li> I had used this polish before and they had stopped making it and when I found it on Amazon.com I bought the only two they had because I love the color.</li>
            <li> This is a discontinued polish and hard to find.  I was delighted to get it since it is my favorite color.  The little bit of sparkle is perfect.</li>
            <li> Love the product. The color is exactly what i was looking for and i appreciate that it was sent so quickly as we&#x27;ll.&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Love the product.</li>
            <li> Love the color!! Received two compliments first day</li>
            <li> Wish I could biuy all the colors. I have it on now and love it.&lt;br /&gt;My grandaughter&#x27;s had them get me one also. They went to&lt;br /&gt;Florida and put it on Nails &amp; Toes before they left. Matches&lt;br /&gt;their little bikini&#x27;s over 20 yrs. I always buy them OPI as well&lt;br /&gt;other brands I use. OPI is Great !&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of OPI nail polish. It is quality and long lasting. This color is a perfect darker pink with shimmer. Great for anytime of year!</li>
            <li> Excellent- fast shipping &amp; product exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite polishes for spring/summer. It&#x27;s a bright, foil-ish, glittery, fuchsia. Nice as a manicure or pedicure. I do not agree with another reviewer that this is only good on people 18 and under. It makes a great pedicure for any age and is defiantly an appropriate manicure color for someone well into their 30s or even 40s. I love it and always get compliments!</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite color of all times!! I love the sparkle in the polish and love it that the nail polish is smooth to the touch when it is applied to the nail unlike a lot of polishes with glitter in it.Fabulous!! I always receive compliments when wearing it!!</li>
            <li> I got this because Seventeen magazine rated it the best nail color and I was just bored I guess. I love the color, I get compliments on it all the time because it is fun and bright and OPI nail polish is a good brand</li>
            <li> not the best bargain i&#x27;ve gotten online for OPI polish, but this color is soooo pretty!! definitely worth it. and i didn&#x27;t have to drive around looking for new colors</li>
            <li> Just as you would expect from OPI... A vibant color! With a little shimmer!  One of my favorite colors from OPI so far.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect summer color...bright, hot pink with glass flecks! I love it so much, I just ordered OPI&#x27;s Come to Poppy, a coral color with the same characteristics. Can&#x27;t wait to receive it!</li>
            <li> it is a great spring/summer time shade.  it really has personality!!  the quality is o.p.i. of  course.  it is very thick and has great coverage.</li>
            <li> I love this color! I&#x27;m not into pink polishes but  thought I&#x27;d add some to my Polish collection and I&#x27;m so glad I did this is the most prettiest most beautiful pink I have ever seen in a Polish it&#x27;s so vibrant and shiny it&#x27;s the perfect pink! But then again that is just my opinion.but trust me if you&#x27;re wary about it just try it it&#x27;s worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s reviews made me think this was a beautiful color! It&#x27;s not as pretty in the picture, but then it rarely is. To me, it makes my nails look like a little six year old girl. I&#x27;m pretty young, too. This color is cute but not for anyone over the age of 18.</li>
            <li> I love hot pinks and fuchsias, so good on my very light, pinky toned skin.&lt;br /&gt;This polish goes on like a dream, thin enough but doesn&#x27;t run and has good coverage with just 2 coats over my base coat. I added a great topcoat, and this manicure lasted 13 days. About day 8 I applied another coat, to fill in new growth and cover the slight, expected tip wear. I had one small chip too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reapplied my quick-dry topcoat over the new layer of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color is such a vibrant, bright hot pink, with a very slight fuchsia tint. The finish is what I guess would be called a foil, but not like old, cheap looking metallics. It is not a frost. It has incredible tiny glitter in the completely smooth formula, that looks to be inside, giving depth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a color to be noticed, and it certainly was. My husband, always complimentary, really, really did like this and so did our daughter and other women.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colors.</li>
            <li> This color is so vibrant and pretty against tan skin, I get compliments every time I wear it. (Which is a little unusual for nail polish). I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not your ordinary color. The metallic flakes make the color Pink pop! So don&#x27;t wait until it&#x27;s gone. The price was reasonable and the shipping came quicker then expected.</li>
            <li> Great color and coverage!!!</li>
            <li> I was happy to discover there were still some bottles of this out there.  I love the color, especially for summertime. The girl doing my pedicures spilled the bottle I had brought and I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement since it was a previous line.The product arrived quickly and in good shape.</li>
            <li> I used this at nail salon several months ago and it&#x27;s the only color I like in the spring/ summer...tried others but keep going back...get compliments all the time</li>
            <li> I am having trouble finding pinks in various shades so I am so excited to find this outlet!! The new colors are good but not for every day on a old lady!!</li>
