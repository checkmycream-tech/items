            <li>amazon is a great place to shop and buy.</li>
            <li>but it works awesome and dries my hair quickly!</li>
            <li>The color and the quality is really really good...</li>

            <li>All three are great dryers and aptly sized for their intended use.</li>

            <li>But of course I should know better than to question all the great reviews I read about products I buy from Amazon.</li>
            <li>B0047WX5B8 Babyliss BABNT150S Nano Titanium Curling Iron]] and I LOVE THEM!   </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Thank goodness it wasn&#x27;t too many, but ouch!</li>
            <li>Nice size.</li>
            <li>works just as good or even better because you have more control where you are drying.</li>
            <li>Compact, powerful and works great.</li>
            <li>The cool shot button is a bonus &amp; the price is too good to believe.</li>
            <li>It is very light.  </li>
            <li>she love it as well.</li>
            <li>I wanted a travel dryer and this one is so cute.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer better than&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>And we have been pleased with the dryer.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and it works perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I use this on low with a diffuser (yes my diffuser fits just perfectly).  </li>
            <li>so the low wattage is perfect.  </li>
            <li>It appears to have a hinged top, so it can bend.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>If not, I&#x27;d go for something with more power.</li>
            <li>Very light weight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Very light weight and so easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>It is so very light, yet powerful!</li>
            <li>Sure it&#x27;s a bit noisy, but it is very powerful for its size.  </li>
            <li>to travel with, but also easy for every-day use.  </li>
            <li>I also liked that it had a cool button, because I always use the cool shot at the end of drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Our Babyliss Nano travel dryer with folding handle, however,  is still going strong after two years of continuous use.</li>
            <li>This little blow dryer gives you the best bang for your buck.  </li>
            <li>The hair looked silky and smooth without any gel used.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this buy snd would definitely reccomend it!</li>
            <li>B0048NUT1K Enjoy Sulfate Free Shampoo]]</li>
            <li>I did like this hair dryer for its light weight and compactness.  </li>
            <li>I just confirmed with BaByliss that there is nothing they can do.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>it for a few weeks now and very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Light weight.  </li>
            <li>First, I own a full sized Babyliss dryer called the Voltare.</li>
            <li>I was glad it didn&#x27;t get too hot though, because I don&#x27;t want burnt hair.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to upgrade my hair dryer, and I ended up buying this based off the brand&#x27;s reputation.</li>
            <li>I got this baby for travel, cute, hot, works on short hair , good,  </li>
            <li>I ordered this specifically looking for a travel dryer with a cool shot button ( my 10 yr.</li>
            <li>I push the cool shot button.  </li>
            <li>It does have a cool shot button, and a diffuser included in the package.</li>
            <li>it is small, easy to travel with and works great.  </li>
            <li>All so works great on long hair dogs at dog shows where electricity is at a minimum and does not take up to much room in the tack box.</li>
            <li>It works great and does not get super hot like my other blower.</li>
            <li>as well (bottle with a blue star) and my hair has never looked better!</li>
            <li>This dryer was the right size but it over heats quickly.</li>
            <li>What a great little dryer.</li>
            <li>powerful</li>
            <li>I loved  the other one</li>
            <li>Not getting fried by powerful hot settings.  </li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews prior to buying this, and most were very positive.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just smooth... AND SOFT!</li>
            <li>I like it to be very fast and go.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li>my first return to Amazon.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really tell the difference between a large dryer and this baby!</li>
            <li>the ONLY way I see this being good for anyone is if you have SHORT hair</li>
            <li>I had to use the &#x27;cool&#x27; button frequently.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it would be better for someone with fine to medium thick hair.</li>
            <li>This dryer works pretty well, but maybe my expectations were too high.</li>
            <li>So much lighter and plenty of power.  </li>
            <li>Instead, there is TOO MUCH HEAT.</li>
            <li>The picture is very deceiving.</li>
            <li>Very powerful, especially for the size.</li>
            <li>this little guy is very powerful and gets pretty hot.</li>
            <li>It is a higher end and professional quality dryer with a lot of power.</li>
            <li>However, this morning (after a few weeks of erratically varying power), it glowed bright red inside and began to smoke.  </li>
            <li>Dries my hair quickly even on low.  </li>
            <li>It SCREAMS at high pitch.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shortly after falling in love with the Nano pro flat iron.  </li>
            <li>great purchase, i sugest every womany with difficult hair purchase this dryer, i also have the babyliss pro nano Iron</li>
            <li>:) I have had it for a few months now</li>
            <li>I think that this dryer is more for travel than everyday use.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as the larger ones, but does the job.</li>
            <li>It comes out very powerful but not very hot.</li>
            <li>It does blow VERY hot air, though, and tends to dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li>This one seemed okay for the size, but took a long time to dry my hair.</li>
            <li>small in size, 100 percent better than hotel dryers.</li>
            <li>Fresh out of the box and within 1 minute of turning it on the first time, this little monster  sucked up my hair into the intake.  </li>
            <li>This dryer did a nice job as far as the condition it left my hair in, but took too long to dry.  </li>
            <li>It pulls less current than most dryers.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this dryer earlier this summer, and gave it to a friend who was traveling overseas, but missed it too much</li>
            <li>old one</li>
            <li>Very small and very light.</li>
            <li>I like the small size as it easy to handle and not HEAVY.</li>
            <li>But those to issues are fair trade offs for a dryer that is not much heavier than my Droid,and does the job in only a few extra minutes .</li>
            <li>I have long, very curly/frizzy hair, and a lot of it.</li>
            <li>It would also be worth checking out the Babylisspro TT Tourmaline Titanium Travel Dryer, which folds up to take up less room in your bag.</li>
            <li>It blows quite hot air, but my hair was not hot at all.</li>
            <li>Powerful little dryer.</li>
            <li>I bought this and the mini flat iron to leave at my new vacation home</li>
            <li>Though it looks very small, its wind is strong.</li>
            <li>the only thing , the apparatus for direct drying keeps falling off.............</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is exactly what I wanted: low watts for thin hair, cool button fits my diffuser.  </li>
            <li>It is hot, but took an really long time to dry my medium thickness hair.</li>
            <li>This dryer is very small, almost weightless, but very powerful and convenient to use.</li>
            <li>Right after I turned the thing on, immediately I put in ear plugs to protect what&#x27;s left of my hearing, and then the Monster wasted no time at all in trying to make me bald.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, as I was drying my hair the first time with this dryer it sucked up a few strands of my hair.</li>
            <li>It also is a  little louder than the bigger dryer as the smaller motor is running at a higher relative speed I suppose.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair</li>
            <li>If you have short or thin hair and want something compact, it should work fine.  </li>
            <li>but it finally died, so I went for a new one despite the other reviews.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Second, as I was drying my hair the first time with this dryer it sucked up a few strands of my hair.</li>
            <li> It also is a  little louder than the bigger dryer as the smaller motor is running at a higher relative speed I suppose.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair</li>
            <li> If you have short or thin hair and want something compact, it should work fine.  </li>
            <li> but it finally died, so I went for a new one despite the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Small enough to fit in your purse, however, this little baby is no baby.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this little dryer.</li>
            <li> I will not give up on it entirely , I will section off my hair as I dry next time to see if that helps.  </li>
            <li> All and all, I am not sure I would recommend this to someone with as much hair as me.</li>
            <li> As I dry on low</li>
            <li> There is now a plug of what WAS my long all-one-length hair that is shorter than the rest of it.  </li>
            <li> It has lost considerable power in just a few months.  </li>
            <li> Each of the dryers come with a concentrator nozzle (it&#x27;s not clear from the picture that the Pro Nano comes with a nozzle, but it does).</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone with very long hair.</li>
            <li> Does it take longer to dry hair than my Babyliss 1875?</li>
            <li> I use it daily and have used it multiple times to dry all of my hair (and I have very thick hair) and it takes no longer than my old full-size conair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how small this hair dryer is, but it works and my wife loves it.  </li>
            <li> But for everyday use, I would recommend for either short or long hair.</li>
            <li> I needed something that took up minimal space</li>
            <li> Now I have to go to the trouble of sending it back.....</li>
            <li> Yes ,but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> This little gem at 1000w works great, is small for traveling, and not too noisy ( hate those dryers that seem to scream in your ear).&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> To the extent this might be helpful when deciding what size to buy: I keep the small Babyliss Pro Nano in my gym bag, the medium-size Babylis Pro BABTT5585 Tourmaline Titanium 3000 Dryer in my carry-on luggage(I travel weekly for work), and the larger BaByliss Pro BABP2800 Porcelain Ceramic 2000-Watt Dryer at home in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> The Babyliss Pro Nano Compact dryer with cool shot button is a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I was very careful</li>
            <li> I would be spending at least an extra 15 minutes drying my hair if I did that.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this dryer whatsoever, and now I&#x27;m skeptical about the brand as a whole.</li>
            <li> Your arm won&#x27;t get tired if you use a round brush to curl, style &amp; then dry at the same time.</li>
            <li> No cool shot button even though it was advertised.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair (long, thick, and wavy), so I need something with a lot of power.</li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a little</li>
            <li> My hair is to my bra strap in the back and thin but a lot of hair</li>
            <li> It takes up very little room.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s really small and compact but it has ALOT of power.  </li>
            <li> When I saw how small it was</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Compact, powerful and works great. I even purchased one for my daughter whose a hairstylist and she love it as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a regular size Babyliss for years and it&#x27;s great. I wanted a travel dryer and this one is so cute. It&#x27;s small and works pretty well. Great for the price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this little dryer. It is a tiny machine but it does a great job! You can&#x27;t really tell the difference between a large dryer and this baby! :) I have had it for a few months now and I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> This dryer is very small, almost weightless, but very powerful and convenient to use. It blows quite hot air, but my hair was not hot at all. The hair looked silky and smooth without any gel used. I am happy with this buy snd would definitely reccomend it!</li>
            <li> Purchased this dryer earlier this summer, and gave it to a friend who was traveling overseas, but missed it too much&lt;br /&gt;to wait for her to get back, so decided to give it to her a gift and order another for myself.  I love this dryer better than&lt;br /&gt;my every-day one.  So much lighter and plenty of power.  Very light weight and easy to use.  Folds to a very small size,&lt;br /&gt;easy to travel with, but also easy for every-day use.  I have very thick hair and it does a very good job in drying quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Best travel AND every day dryer I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> I have long, very curly/frizzy hair, and a lot of it. I bought this Nano dryer along with the curling iron [[ASIN:B0047WX5B8 Babyliss BABNT150S Nano Titanium Curling Iron]] and I LOVE THEM!   I switched my shampoo [[ASIN:B0048NUT1K Enjoy Sulfate Free Shampoo]] as well (bottle with a blue star) and my hair has never looked better! I still have a lot of fullness but no more frizz... it&#x27;s just smooth... AND SOFT! The improvement was immediate. I don&#x27;t even use conditioner anymore. I&#x27;ve always gotten compliments on my hair but this is different.</li>
            <li> Very Quiet but there is NO AIR FLOW. Instead, there is TOO MUCH HEAT.</li>
            <li> This dryer was the right size but it over heats quickly. I had to send it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> Very powerful, especially for the size. I used it during an international trip and had no problems with the use of an adapter.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the mini flat iron to leave at my new vacation home I just bought (did not want to spend a lot$)&lt;br /&gt;It might be my fault, maybe I did not read it close enough but this dryer is a joke!  It&#x27;s like a little toy.&lt;br /&gt;Ok the ONLY way I see this being good for anyone is if you have SHORT hair I mean shoulder length or shorter and thiner hair. My hair is to my bra strap in the back and thin but a lot of hair and I just could not use this. I will not give up on it entirely , I will section off my hair as I dry next time to see if that helps.  I hate drying my hair I like it to be very fast and go.</li>
            <li> I recently went out of the country for a couple of weeks with only a carry on suitcase.  I needed something that took up minimal space and this did the trick but did not slack on power.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my mom for Christmas.  She&#x27;s very happy with it .  It was exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li> We needed a small blow dryer for a trip over seas. We have used this product line before so we felt confortable purchasing this brand. And we have been pleased with the dryer. It is very small and compact. I would recomment this dryer to a friend in a minute.</li>
            <li> My sister had this and recommended I get it.  It&#x27;s really small and compact but it has ALOT of power.  I was amazed.  I ended up getting a larger Babybliss at Sallys Beauty Supply waiting for it to arrive and wish I would have waited as I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased the larger one.</li>
            <li> This travel dryer is great for traveling. It does blow VERY hot air, though, and tends to dry out my hair.  I had to use the &#x27;cool&#x27; button frequently.</li>
            <li> I have bigger dryers. but this one was a surprise. works just as good or even better because you have more control where you are drying. small in size, 100 percent better than hotel dryers. will buy another. All so works great on long hair dogs at dog shows where electricity is at a minimum and does not take up to much room in the tack box.</li>
            <li> I did like this hair dryer for its light weight and compactness.  However, this morning (after a few weeks of erratically varying power), it glowed bright red inside and began to smoke.  I bought it (through Amazon) 15 months ago (March 2013).  The warranty is only 12 months.  I just confirmed with BaByliss that there is nothing they can do.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how small this hair dryer is, but it works and my wife loves it.  It pulls less current than most dryers.  It is very light.  It takes up very little room.  It is perfect for travel, but my wife uses it every day at home too.  She has very thick hair and this little demon does the job for her.</li>
            <li> What a great little dryer. When I saw how small it was I thought oh no my first return to Amazon. But of course I should know better than to question all the great reviews I read about products I buy from Amazon. It works great and does not get super hot like my other blower. I have short hair and it works perfect for me. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone with very long hair. It comes out very powerful but not very hot. Great dryer and so compact. I love it!</li>
            <li> BELIEVE everyone who said this thing pulls your hair out because it sucks your hair into the air intake.  I had one of these before that lasted about 6 yrs.  I loved  the other one but it finally died, so I went for a new one despite the other reviews.  BAD MOVE.  I had never heard of a hair eating hair dryer and never experienced it so I found it impossible to believe.  Some of us learn the hard way.  The rest of you need to BEWARE and BELIEVE! Fresh out of the box and within 1 minute of turning it on the first time, this little monster  sucked up my hair into the intake.  There is now a plug of what WAS my long all-one-length hair that is shorter than the rest of it.  And that was after I had to stop and put in ear plugs.  NOT KIDDING.  I have moderate to severe hearing loss yet I had to put in ear plugs to use this thing.  It SCREAMS at high pitch. SO.  Right after I turned the thing on, immediately I put in ear plugs to protect what&#x27;s left of my hearing, and then the Monster wasted no time at all in trying to make me bald.  It sucked in and ate my hair with a vengeance.</li>
            <li> I got this baby for travel, cute, hot, works on short hair , good,  the only thing , the apparatus for direct drying keeps falling off.............</li>
            <li> Powerful little dryer. I use it everyday and am very happy with it. It is also a breeze to pack.</li>
            <li> this little guy is very powerful and gets pretty hot. but still doesn&#x27;t wake me up in the morning when my husband decides to use it at 6am before going off to work.</li>
            <li> Perfect if you need to travel! The color and the quality is really really good... definitely a good think to buy!</li>
            <li> Very light weight and so easy to handle.  Dries my hair quickly even on low.  Wish its cord was retractable.</li>
            <li> Small enough to fit in your purse, however, this little baby is no baby. Switch on &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; and prepare to literally be blown away!</li>
            <li> I ordered this specifically looking for a travel dryer with a cool shot button ( my 10 yr. old one just bit the dust).  No cool shot button even though it was advertised.  Now I have to go to the trouble of sending it back.....</li>
            <li> I use this on low with a diffuser (yes my diffuser fits just perfectly).  I have thin, fine hair so the low wattage is perfect.  My hair is fuller and healthier.  Not getting fried by powerful hot settings.  As I dry on low I push the cool shot button.  This hair dryer is exactly what I wanted: low watts for thin hair, cool button fits my diffuser.  Only caution is to watch hair doesn&#x27;t fall in front of air intake, it can get pulled in and caught in fan.  I just put may hand around it but not blocking air flow.  Sounds like a problem but it is not.  Not with all the benefits.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shortly after falling in love with the Nano pro flat iron.  I have been very happy-it is small, easy to travel with and works great.  I use it daily and have used it multiple times to dry all of my hair (and I have very thick hair) and it takes no longer than my old full-size conair dryer.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> powerful and i love it, its giving me life !!!! , great purchase, i sugest every womany with difficult hair purchase this dryer, i also have the babyliss pro nano Iron</li>
            <li> lite weight, acceptable noise level, good price, 2 heat settings hi/lo+ air  had not found at any stores. amazon is a great place to shop and buy.</li>
            <li> This dryer works pretty well, but maybe my expectations were too high. I read a lot of reviews prior to buying this, and most were very positive. I don&#x27;t feel it lived up to the hype for me. First, I own a full sized Babyliss dryer called the Voltare. It is a higher end and professional quality dryer with a lot of power. I have a lot of hair (long, thick, and wavy), so I need something with a lot of power. This one seemed okay for the size, but took a long time to dry my hair. I was glad it didn&#x27;t get too hot though, because I don&#x27;t want burnt hair. I also liked that it had a cool button, because I always use the cool shot at the end of drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, as I was drying my hair the first time with this dryer it sucked up a few strands of my hair. I could not uncoil it and had no scissors, so I had to rip them. Thank goodness it wasn&#x27;t too many, but ouch! I was very careful the rest of my trip not repeat that again. All and all, I am not sure I would recommend this to someone with as much hair as me. Perhaps it would be better for someone with fine to medium thick hair. I would not say this would replace my every day dryer as some people have said. I would be spending at least an extra 15 minutes drying my hair if I did that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find a hair dryer with less than 1875w ( which keeps blowing my mobile home fuses!). This little gem at 1000w works great, is small for traveling, and not too noisy ( hate those dryers that seem to scream in your ear).&lt;br /&gt;Used it for a few weeks now and very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to upgrade my hair dryer, and I ended up buying this based off the brand&#x27;s reputation. I am bummed I bought this because it ate my hair repeatedly the only time I used it. Now I&#x27;m too scared to attempt using it again. Unfortunately I bought it from a store I can&#x27;t return to, and now I&#x27;m having a hard time with the Conair/Babybliss customer service responding to my complaint. I do not recommend this dryer whatsoever, and now I&#x27;m skeptical about the brand as a whole.</li>
            <li> To the extent this might be helpful when deciding what size to buy: I keep the small Babyliss Pro Nano in my gym bag, the medium-size Babylis Pro BABTT5585 Tourmaline Titanium 3000 Dryer in my carry-on luggage(I travel weekly for work), and the larger BaByliss Pro BABP2800 Porcelain Ceramic 2000-Watt Dryer at home in my bathroom. All three are great dryers and aptly sized for their intended use. Each of the dryers come with a concentrator nozzle (it&#x27;s not clear from the picture that the Pro Nano comes with a nozzle, but it does). It would also be worth checking out the Babylisspro TT Tourmaline Titanium Travel Dryer, which folds up to take up less room in your bag.</li>
            <li> Very small and very light. Does it take longer to dry hair than my Babyliss 1875? Yes ,but that is to be expected.It also is a  little louder than the bigger dryer as the smaller motor is running at a higher relative speed I suppose. But those to issues are fair trade offs for a dryer that is not much heavier than my Droid,and does the job in only a few extra minutes . And when done ,throw it in the drawer instead of hanging it on a wall or rack. Very good product.&lt;br /&gt;7/29/13 , someone asked-yes it does have a \\&quot;Cool\\&quot; button and it works well.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these while in Florida last year.  I like the small size as it easy to handle and not HEAVY.</li>
            <li> The Babyliss Pro Nano Compact dryer with cool shot button is a disappointment.  It has lost considerable power in just a few months.  Our Babyliss Nano travel dryer with folding handle, however,  is still going strong after two years of continuous use.</li>
            <li> The picture is very deceiving. It appears to have a hinged top, so it can bend. This is an illusion, in case you are looking for a dryer that folds, like i was. Also, THIS DRYER IS BEYOND TINY! The picture and the description say nothing about travel dryer. There is a similar looking dryer that specifies travel dryer. This is probably the same, just without the title \\&quot;travel\\&quot; in the description. I think that this dryer is more for travel than everyday use. It is hot, but took an really long time to dry my medium thickness hair. It does have a cool shot button, and a diffuser included in the package. Not that this is a bad hair dryer, just know all the details about this product and make an informed decision</li>
            <li> works great!  Nice size. Light weight.  perfect!</li>
            <li> This little blow dryer gives you the best bang for your buck.  It has lots of power and you cannot beat this price.</li>
            <li> This dryer will spoil you! It is so very light, yet powerful! It makes all others seem heavy &amp; clunky &amp; hard to handle by comparison. Your arm won&#x27;t get tired if you use a round brush to curl, style &amp; then dry at the same time. The cool shot button is a bonus &amp; the price is too good to believe. Don&#x27;t let its small size fool you because it packs a punch for the price.</li>
            <li> I like this small blower. Not as powerful as the larger ones, but does the job. I only wished there was a cord manager of some sort.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  Sure it&#x27;s a bit noisy, but it is very powerful for its size.  Simple design.  Will it blow the doors off?  No.  But for everyday use, I would recommend for either short or long hair.</li>
            <li> Best blowdryer I&#x27;ve ever had!!! It&#x27;s a tiny travel dryer but it works awesome and dries my hair quickly!</li>
            <li> This is definitely going to be a backup or travel dryer for me, but for the 20 bucks I paid for it I did decide to keep it.  I have very long and thick hair. This dryer did a nice job as far as the condition it left my hair in, but took too long to dry.  If you have short or thin hair and want something compact, it should work fine.  If not, I&#x27;d go for something with more power.</li>
            <li> Though it looks very small, its wind is strong. I think it can be put in the package when I travel.</li>
