            <li>so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, in a bulk pack and at a better price than retail.</li>
            <li>You will get a much better shave with a Pre-Electric shave lotion.</li>

            <li>Also, contrary to my electric shaver&#x27;s manufacturer&#x27;s \\&quot;Braun\\&quot; instructions, I found that shaving after I shower and wash my face provides for the closest and most comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>This preshave keeps whiskers from caking inside the shaver, making it easy to keep the shaver clean.  </li>
            <li>B004GKAKK0 Mennen Afta Pre-electric Shave Lotion with Skin Conditioners, Original, 3-ounces</li>
            <li>I have been using Afta Pre Electric shave lotion for a few years now and find it is a great product.  </li>

            <li>I have real sensitive skin and this never disappoints.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and was what I expected.  </li>
            <li>It seems to do the job, but it it really has a strong smell and it&#x27;s hard to wash off.  </li>
            <li>It is also reasonably priced, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>exactly what I expected</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Tired of looking to find this product. Come to Amazon. I like this Pre-Electric Shave lotion and have used it for years. Will buy again when these 6 containers are empty.</li>
            <li> WORKS JUST GREAT AS A PRE-ELECTRIC SHAVE</li>
            <li> I have been using Afta Pre Electric shave lotion for a few years now and find it is a great product.  My face always feels soothed after shaving.</li>
            <li> nice in humid weather,  no razer burn  love it</li>
            <li> Works good before use of the electric shaver. To give a break from shaving with a blade</li>
            <li> Refreshing and allows the shaver to lift/cut the beard easily. You will get a much better shave with a Pre-Electric shave lotion.</li>
            <li> This is the only pre shave I use and  have used for 30 years. This an Excellent product and works as advertised</li>
            <li> Just got this a couple of days ago. I ordered this due to the good reviews but didn&#x27;t expect much because I have used pre shaves before and they weren&#x27;t all that great. But using this has made me change my mind. I use a foil style shaver that shaves close but this pre shave makes it almost blade close (brand name blade at that). Remember to let it dry before starting. My foil head is close to the end of life but this might delay its replacement by a few months. The shave head mover more smoothly as well as takes fewer strokes to clear the same stubble. Great product!</li>
            <li> This product is my favorite preshave (I also use the after shave).  However, for whatever reason, the local stores no longer stock it, which is why I ordered from Amazon.  This preshave keeps whiskers from caking inside the shaver, making it easy to keep the shaver clean.  It is also reasonably priced, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Received on time and as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is a product i have used in the past. I could no longer find it locally. I came to Amazon to see&lt;br /&gt;if i could still get this item. Low and behold you have it. I am well pleased.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t sell the Pre-Electric in our local stores, only &amp;#34;Lectric Shave.&amp;#34;  Afta Pre-Electric is perfect for sensitive skin &amp; tough whiskers!</li>
            <li> happy with  product and service</li>
            <li> My husband loves this, and it is getting hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> When this product became harder to fond in the stores where else would one look?Amazon of course....and the best stuff according to my husband. The best part is that it came I&#x27;m 2 days.</li>
            <li> Not sure it helps much.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured and as I ordered</li>
            <li> It works great for me, have been using it for years. I now have to buy it in a larger package because the company does not sell individually on the west coast. Lasts longer too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for decades as my pre-shave ritual. I don&#x27;t wash my face beforehand. Just apply this over my face. Wait til it dries and then shave away. I have real sensitive skin and this never disappoints. Close shave with no irritation. I recommend it. Hard to find in any store so I purchase in bulk here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Thank fast deliver and what he wanted</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was what I expected.  Would re-order.</li>
            <li> Shipment arrived quickly as expected.  Quality product!</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> I have used this product for decades as a pre-shave with various electric shavers. It works really, really well but it has become very hard to find in retail stores over the past few years. Can&#x27;t find it in drug stores or grocery stores any more. It does not sting like alcohol-based pre-shaves and it doesn&#x27;t seem to clog the shaver either. Rub a dab on your face. Let it dry for 30 seconds. Shave. Follow up with a dab of Afta after-shave and you&#x27;ll feel great. I&#x27;m glad I can still get this product through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Mennen AFTA Pre-Electric Shave Lotion is very protective for your face before you shave, and it has a great scent and smoothness!!!  You need to try it soon!!!</li>
            <li> AFTA pre electric is a product I have used for years - I really like it....</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find it locally any more and price is competitive.</li>
            <li> Made my skin break out.</li>
            <li> Although it has a strong smell, it is the best pre-shave I have used.  It does not leave an oily residue like other pre-shaving loations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it has become more difficult to find in the retail stores so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, in a bulk pack and at a better price than retail. If you use an electric razor, this product makes shaving more comfortable.</li>
            <li> YES, THIS IS THE PRE ELECTRIC SHAVE.</li>
            <li> Good price for this item.  Can&#x27;t find it in drugstores any more.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product daily for the past ten years or more. It works great and I have less irritation that with a blade</li>
            <li> It seems to do the job, but it it really has a strong smell and it&#x27;s hard to wash off.  I found a much better brand.  I guess I&#x27;ll use this over time, but won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
