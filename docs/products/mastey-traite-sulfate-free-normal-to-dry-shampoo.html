            <li>/&gt;Overall, my wife is happy with it</li>
            <li>I loved the scent and creaminess and my hair always looked great.</li>
            <li>This must have been despatched just minutes after it was ordered as it arrived so quickly and was well packed and matched the description perfectly.</li>
            <li>my hair has never looked better!</li>
            <li>Love the coconut fragrance!  </li>
            <li>and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is simply good, reliable and safe.</li>
            <li>I have found it to treat my hair gently, clean it thoroughly and smell great.</li>
            <li>is nice, and goes away very quickly...</li>
            <li>Women agree; they love the way my hair smells and they love the way my hair feels.  </li>
            <li>Buy from a reputable seller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy again for sure :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years and love it.</li>
            <li>Took this one on the chin and went out and bought two more bottles at the beauty supply store</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this unique smell.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, my processed hair looks shiny and healthy again and best of all, there is barely any loose hair on my comb now!</li>
            <li>I remembered Traite and recalled how great a product it was and but couldn&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
            <li>So the hair loss I was experiencing was from a cheap shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is worth every cent, and more.</li>
            <li>I was impressed at how quickly I received the product  - less that one week.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>it came and was super runny and made a huge lather when using it which sulfate free shampoo doesnt do.</li>
            <li>It is sulfate free, Vegan for those who care, so gentle, it does not dry out your hair and is great for colored and chemically treated hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I do not use shampoo full strength, ever, no matter the</li>
            <li>Its not going to do anything surprising to your hair, but it can be used daily and your hair will grow healthier from using it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and effective, doesn&#x27;t dry out hair, eliminates itchy scalp, and in fact, is effective for babies for cradle cap.</li>
            <li>A great sulfate-free, cone-free shampoo, that while it has a downright decadent texture (think whipped cream, but heavier) and a really yummy fragrance (Pina Colada)... in the end it simply washes your hair gently and thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>I love it for what it is, and I actually use this one as my staple &amp;#34;break&amp;#34; shampoo from my tried and true Biolage Moisturizing Shampoo (see my review).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite her happiness with the affect that this shampoo has on her hair, there are a few downsides to the product that are worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know how I felt about it at first</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty damaged.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I have used Amazon to buy Mastey Traite.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it seems to have a rancid oil smell.(the bottle had a pump and was taking it from the bottom)</li>
            <li>Doing so has educated me on the quality, or lack thereof, of many different hair products.  </li>
            <li>This happened immediately with the first bottle I received.  </li>
            <li>Amazon exchanged it quickly for a new one and halfway through this bottle it started happening again.  </li>
            <li>It has a mild, almost coconut-like fragrance that is completely non-irritating.</li>
            <li>It does not suds up and create lather no matter how much you use.   </li>
            <li>shampoo so gentle you can use it for washing your face (or even a child).</li>
            <li>Add as much water as you want for the desired thickness, and it fixes the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since that time, I have tried other shampoos, even high-priced products from companies like Redken, but I have never found one as good as Traite, so I always have gone back.</li>
            <li>Over the years I used many other types of salon or grocery store type shampoos.</li>
            <li>She contests that this shampoo leaves her hair feeling cleaner and better than any of the previous shampoos that she had used.</li>
            <li>It has a nice subtle coconut tropical scent which I also really like.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive to shampoos, conditioners, and lotions with any allergenic properties including fragrance, and Traite is the one thing I can use that doesn&#x27;t irritate me in any way -- literally that doesn&#x27;t make me break out in a rash or develop eye inflammation.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like shampoos like head and shoulders that strip your color and natural oils!</li>
            <li>A tried and true product that was nice to acquire at a price a few dollars less than local purchase options.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It cleans well and rinses off completely.</li>
            <li>Cleans well but too well for my very curly blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I first used this shampoo back in the mid 1980s.</li>
            <li>For the past several years I noticed more hair in my comb</li>
            <li>I now live in Massachusetts and have not found anyone in the beauty industry who has even heard of this product, so Amazon is the only way I have of buying it.</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo for my wife when she requested a new sulfate-free shampoo for her daily washing.</li>
            <li>This was very watery (almost hard to hold/keep in my hand, it was so watery), did not have the pearlescent appearance that Traite does, and did not smell right.</li>
            <li>It does not smell as &#x27;pretty&#x27; as some of the other shampoos on the market.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The 32oz generally lasts me almost a year.</li>
            <li>My second biggest complaint about this product, and the reason why I deducted one star from it, is that the first half of the bottle comes-out of the bottle just fine.</li>
            <li>The second half of the bottle is a congealed, solid mess at the bottom that is much more viscous.</li>
            <li>This has been the case in all three shipments of this item, so I know it is consistent; however, it can be remedied by just adding a little water to the bottle, and vigorously shaking.</li>
            <li>It is either VERY watered down Traite or something else entirely.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s very sudsy!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m throwing out all my other old shampoos and exclusively using only Traite.</li>
            <li> Now, this isn&#x27;t an unpleasant smell, it is just doesn&#x27;t smell as good as some of the other products on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Traite for a long time now.</li>
            <li> WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO OTHER PEOPLE.</li>
            <li> this is not really Mastey, which I buy all the time and know well.</li>
            <li> so I proceeded to try the other bottle.</li>
            <li> and ive tried all kinds of other shampoos...</li>
            <li> It has absolutely no harshness, and whatever other moisturizing shampoos have claimed, they all have had an alkaline harshness that dried and toughened my hair.</li>
            <li> I believe the shampoo is so thick that it doesn&#x27;t actually &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; to the bottom of the bottle so that the pump straw can pick it up and pump it out.  </li>
            <li> I had previously bleached hair that is now Brown again</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this high quality, creamy, moisturizing shampoo -</li>
            <li> I was a little upset because I had thrown the plastic bag it came in along with all the paper work.</li>
            <li> I just wish they would make it smell a little bit nicer, and fix the congealing-issue at the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> NEED VERY LITTLE EACH TIME</li>
            <li> I usually buy it at.</li>
            <li> just as well as any sulfate shampoo, if not better.  </li>
            <li> It is thin and watery; Traite is thick--it&#x27;s a cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong choosing this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product is fake.</li>
            <li> Too difficult to find in retail stores.  </li>
            <li> This product was FAKE.</li>
            <li> Does not linger (which sometimes makes me sad).</li>
            <li> Very angry and annoyed that now I have to go through the process of a return because of fraudulant product.</li>
            <li> And my hair looked like crap when I used it.  </li>
            <li> (My bad!!!)</li>

            <li> I have been using Traite for 30 years now. I have found it to treat my hair gently, clean it thoroughly and smell great. Women agree; they love the way my hair smells and they love the way my hair feels.  This is NOT Traite; it is a counterfeit product!  It is thin and watery; Traite is thick--it&#x27;s a cream. It smells wrong--not like Traite. It does not suds up and create lather no matter how much you use.   Buy from a reputable seller. DO NOT BUY HERE!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. I didn&#x27;t know how I felt about it at first but I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now and it is amazing. I had previously bleached hair that is now Brown again but it&#x27;s pretty damaged. It makes my hair feel soft and moisturized. It also helped with my itchy scalp problem. I&#x27;m grateful for that cause I don&#x27;t like shampoos like head and shoulders that strip your color and natural oils! It has a nice subtle coconut tropical scent which I also really like. A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s very sudsy! I&#x27;d buy again for sure :)</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo ever!!! I discovered it years ago and that is all I have used since then.&lt;br /&gt;CVS stores used to carry it but now can only find it online.&lt;br /&gt;A shampoo so gentle you can use it for washing your face (or even a child). It is sulfate free, Vegan for those who care, so gentle, it does not dry out your hair and is great for colored and chemically treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;The 32oz generally lasts me almost a year. (I do not use shampoo full strength, ever, no matter the brand)&lt;br /&gt;I hope they never, ever discontinue this shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong choosing this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years, although I can no longer find it locally. It&#x27;s gentle and effective, doesn&#x27;t dry out hair, eliminates itchy scalp, and in fact, is effective for babies for cradle cap. So happy Amazon is carrying it!</li>
            <li> This product is fake. Mastey, the company that manufactures this product doesn&#x27;t know this seller and this seller is not authorized by them to sell on Amazon. I&#x27;ve used Traite for ~30 years and this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I first used this shampoo back in the mid 1980s. I loved the scent and creaminess and my hair always looked great. Over the years I used many other types of salon or grocery store type shampoos. For the past several years I noticed more hair in my comb and I was getting worried. I tried changing my diet, getting vitamins, worried that it was stress causing my hair loss, etc. Someone on line suggested that some shampoos can cause hair loss -and I began to wonder. I tried salon shampoos and it didn&#x27;t make a difference at all. I remembered Traite and recalled how great a product it was and but couldn&#x27;t find it locally. I decided to try it again, and ordered it through Amazon. (Thank you Amazon!!!) Amazingly, my processed hair looks shiny and healthy again and best of all, there is barely any loose hair on my comb now! So the hair loss I was experiencing was from a cheap shampoo. Awesome product and sulfate-free which is superb. My mother loves this shampoo too, so this year I ordered a 32-ounce bottle for each of us. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this high quality, creamy, moisturizing shampoo - my hair has never looked better! I&#x27;m throwing out all my other old shampoos and exclusively using only Traite.</li>
            <li> TRAITE is the best smelling coconut shampoo on Earth! It cleans well and rinses off completely. I love this unique smell.</li>
            <li> great it has saved my hair from falling out</li>
            <li> this is not really Mastey, which I buy all the time and know well. it came and was super runny and made a huge lather when using it which sulfate free shampoo doesnt do. joke&#x27;s on me.</li>
            <li> Its the best shampoo ever!  Love the coconut fragrance!  Too difficult to find in retail stores.  Get it here!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo off and on for over twenty years. Whenever I want a change for change&#x27;s sake, I invariably return to Mastey Traite. It&#x27;s thorough but not drying on my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years and love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since 1988. I have always been very happy with it. I have always had to go to the beauty supply store to purchase it. This was the first time I have used Amazon to buy Mastey Traite. (2 bottles, saved money!) When I opened the bottles it smelled like coconuts! This is what it is supposed to smell like! I was very happy with my purchase.(this was short lived) The first time I used it, it seems to have a rancid oil smell.(the bottle had a pump and was taking it from the bottom) Well, I bought two bottles so I proceeded to try the other bottle. Same results. I was a little upset because I had thrown the plastic bag it came in along with all the paper work. (My bad!!!) Took this one on the chin and went out and bought two more bottles at the beauty supply store I usually buy it at. I don&#x27;t think I will be buying this product, online, anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Amazon before and always been very happy with my purchases.</li>
            <li> My cousin lives in Canada and cannot purchase this shampoo in Canada.  She says this shampoo is wonderful for her hair and would like to continue using this.&lt;br /&gt;I visit the USA in the winter and as a result I could order and have the product delivered to my place in Yuma, Az and bring it back to Canada for her.&lt;br /&gt;I must say, I was impressed at how quickly I received the product  - less that one week.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. My girlfriend is a hairdresser and recommended this as she uses it a lot and now I&#x27;m hooked as well.</li>
            <li> I discovered this shampoo years ago when my hair stylist in Bloomington, Illinois, used it. Since that time, I have tried other shampoos, even high-priced products from companies like Redken, but I have never found one as good as Traite, so I always have gone back. It has absolutely no harshness, and whatever other moisturizing shampoos have claimed, they all have had an alkaline harshness that dried and toughened my hair. My skin is very sensitive to shampoos, conditioners, and lotions with any allergenic properties including fragrance, and Traite is the one thing I can use that doesn&#x27;t irritate me in any way -- literally that doesn&#x27;t make me break out in a rash or develop eye inflammation. It has a mild, almost coconut-like fragrance that is completely non-irritating. I now live in Massachusetts and have not found anyone in the beauty industry who has even heard of this product, so Amazon is the only way I have of buying it. It is worth every cent, and more.</li>
            <li> GREAT HAIR PRODUCT.  SMELLS SO GOOD!  NEED VERY LITTLE EACH TIME YOU SHAMPOO.  WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO OTHER PEOPLE.</li>
            <li> Arrived as stated. Suds alot for a &amp;#34;sulfate free&amp;#34; shampoo.Cleans well but too well for my very curly blonde hair. Would be great for someone with oily hair.</li>
            <li> This product was FAKE. I&#x27;ve used Traite for a long time now. This was very watery (almost hard to hold/keep in my hand, it was so watery), did not have the pearlescent appearance that Traite does, and did not smell right. It is either VERY watered down Traite or something else entirely.  And my hair looked like crap when I used it.  Very angry and annoyed that now I have to go through the process of a return because of fraudulant product.</li>
            <li> This must have been despatched just minutes after it was ordered as it arrived so quickly and was well packed and matched the description perfectly.</li>
            <li> A great sulfate-free, cone-free shampoo, that while it has a downright decadent texture (think whipped cream, but heavier) and a really yummy fragrance (Pina Colada)... in the end it simply washes your hair gently and thoroughly.  Suds up miraculously well... just as well as any sulfate shampoo, if not better.  This shampoo is simply good, reliable and safe. Its not going to do anything surprising to your hair, but it can be used daily and your hair will grow healthier from using it.  I love it for what it is, and I actually use this one as my staple &amp;#34;break&amp;#34; shampoo from my tried and true Biolage Moisturizing Shampoo (see my review).  Ive been using both this, and the Biolage line for 20 years.  I am a product junkie and ive tried all kinds of other shampoos... Doing so has educated me on the quality, or lack thereof, of many different hair products.  This one and Biolage (along with Biolage&#x27;s Conditioning Balm) are my staples,.  They are quality.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is nice, and goes away very quickly... Does not linger (which sometimes makes me sad).</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo that I can use and experience no reaction to my scalp.  Their cream rinse is also VERY good.</li>
            <li> I have twice had issues with this shampoo packaging.  I believe the shampoo is so thick that it doesn&#x27;t actually &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; to the bottom of the bottle so that the pump straw can pick it up and pump it out.  This happened immediately with the first bottle I received.  Amazon exchanged it quickly for a new one and halfway through this bottle it started happening again.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again because of this issue.</li>
            <li> A tried and true product that was nice to acquire at a price a few dollars less than local purchase options.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for my wife when she requested a new sulfate-free shampoo for her daily washing. She contests that this shampoo leaves her hair feeling cleaner and better than any of the previous shampoos that she had used. She used to interchangeably switch from Pantene, to Herbal Essences, to Dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite her happiness with the affect that this shampoo has on her hair, there are a few downsides to the product that are worth mentioning. It does not smell as &#x27;pretty&#x27; as some of the other shampoos on the market. To me, it smells like liquid coconut. Now, this isn&#x27;t an unpleasant smell, it is just doesn&#x27;t smell as good as some of the other products on the market. My second biggest complaint about this product, and the reason why I deducted one star from it, is that the first half of the bottle comes-out of the bottle just fine. The second half of the bottle is a congealed, solid mess at the bottom that is much more viscous. This has been the case in all three shipments of this item, so I know it is consistent; however, it can be remedied by just adding a little water to the bottle, and vigorously shaking. Add as much water as you want for the desired thickness, and it fixes the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my wife is happy with it so I am. I just wish they would make it smell a little bit nicer, and fix the congealing-issue at the bottom of the bottle.</li>
