    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I picked Purple Haze because it was the perfect color purple that i wanted.</li>
            <li>I searched everywhere for the perfect shade, and I thought I had found it in Manic Panic Amplified.  </li>
            <li>loved the color, and i know that&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>My friend uses it and her hair looks beautiful and a rich color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I leave it on over the night, under plastic wrap and a warm hat.</li>
            <li>it is a very rich shade not too bright but definately noticeable.</li>
            <li>but the ideal use for this product is to first bleach the hair with Manic Panic bleach</li>
            <li>In the sun it looks fiery :)</li>
            <li>Use a better quality dye.</li>
            <li>Then I ran a comb through it to make sure that it was distributed</li>
            <li>it has become my favorite color.</li>
            <li>i fell in love.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for intense color without bleach - don&#x27;t buy this you won&#x27;t be happy.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure it will fade soon though.&lt;br</li>
            <li>every shower i took after that for the week after i could just see more and more purple come out.</li>
            <li>Nice stuff, worth the additional money if you&#x27;re planning to have your color in for a while.</li>
            <li>What I was looking for, and easy to apply by myself.</li>
            <li>It worked fine, dyed my hair purple.</li>
            <li>I left the product in my hair for over 6 hours and it came out perfect the first time around.</li>
            <li>the color is bold, i love it - just what i wanted.</li>
            <li>but me personally, am tan complected and it looks great.</li>
            <li>It is good if you only want something temporary like</li>
            <li>This color is my teenagers&#x27; absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>ok i been hit with a recent wave of purple love.</li>
            <li>i had to quickly scrub the calking and grout with bleach as the dye stuck to that too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has only been two more days, I haven&#x27;t washed my hair again, yet SOMEHOW most of the purple is gone.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It made my hair not merely purple, but PURPLE!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s vibrant, strong and lasts for quite a while.</li>
            <li>It was fun while it lasted.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I covered it with a shower cap to help warm it up, and left it on for an hour.</li>
            <li>and it may be my favorite color I have used so far.</li>
            <li>this is useful to somebody</li>
            <li>Not too fond of where it is right now, but I don&#x27;t want to re dye it either.</li>
            <li>Price is the same at Sally&#x27;s, it washes out very easily.</li>
            <li>Definitely brighter and longer-lasting than the original Manic Panic line, but just as easy to use.  </li>
            <li>but it looked really pretty</li>
            <li>Ive used many different colored dyes including manic panic.</li>
            <li>(first time it has EVER been bleached).&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>then brushed through each section of hair to make sure that it foamed up like the directions</li>
            <li>The product I received was not in the jar but in a bottle and it was much darker and more blue than the one in the jar which I have purchased before elsewhere.</li>
            <li>This is a nice, dark purple.</li>
            <li>You need to be very careful, though, while you are applying it - it&#x27;s very easy to stain bathroom surfaces (or clothes).   </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t bleach my hair prior to dying, as I want just strong highlights.</li>
            <li>i really anticipated looking like barney...</li>
            <li>advice is to do the whole process in a backyard and rinse with a gardenhose...or rent a hotel room and let housekeeping deal with it.&lt;br /&gt;hope</li>
            <li>The color did come out really well of course</li>
            <li>I got out and looked, It was already faded to a much duller purple.  </li>
            <li>But here&#x27;s the real kicker:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But i wish that i hadn&#x27;t wasted the time, honestly.</li>
            <li>It definitely turned out as expected and I love it!</li>
            <li>During the first rinse i rinsed until the water was clear but</li>
            <li>, the drugstore stuff doesn&#x27;t go light enough and it washes out so be prepared to reapply it frequently.</li>
            <li>i decided to bleach the top of my head so that the new color would fall over my jet black hair.</li>
            <li>I love the dark purple shade!</li>
            <li>I also love how it doesnt smell, its not so watery, pretty thick liquid</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what I usedon my daughter, and 8 weeks later her blue is still holding strong.</li>
            <li>She tried a few different colors and this one worked the best with very little difference in liquid color to hair color.</li>
            <li>i bought manic panic for the first time recently.  </li>
            <li>this is not the first time i&#x27;ve bought this, but one of the three bottles i&#x27;ve bought wes open...</li>
            <li>and i wanted dark hair that looks purple in the light but not PURPLE PURPLE</li>
            <li>that was disappointing cause at first the solid purple looked great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural Brunette.</li>
            <li>Especially since it only really lasted a couple of days.</li>
            <li>It doesnt fade any quicker than any other color and it soaked in really well with out pre-bleaching.</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work, but it&#x27;s not worth ruining my clothes.</li>

            <li> I held out as long as I possibly could.  </li>
            <li> Although it faded within two weeks to a lavendar, which didn&#x27;t look bad, it looked amazing in the begining.</li>
            <li> only downside is that after having it for one week without washing i noticed that some of the purple has lightened to a shade of pink.</li>
            <li> Five days later I went to wash my hair - using ONLY COLD WATER (the shampoo is sulfate free, and I use a color-lock conditioner that I get at Sally&#x27;s Beauty), and as usual some dye washed down the drain (that&#x27;s normal).  </li>
            <li> Then I used a blow dryer to completely dry it before I washed it</li>
            <li> Half a week after that it looked more of a dirty purplish blonde that wasn&#x27;t appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Right now I have a few streaks of purple and a strange orangey tone left behind on my bleached hair from the Manic Panic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only used about half of the container of dye to saturate my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is medium blonde and a little longer than shoulder length.</li>
            <li> Manic Panic is the only non-permanent dye I am using now, after trying a few.</li>
            <li> It faded in a few weeks, but I&#x27;m hesitant to re-dye because several shirts had dye rub off on the collar area and permanently stained.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I bleached my hair to a pale yellow</li>
            <li> My hair has not been wet, I have been avoiding swimming until I find a bathing cap, because I don&#x27;t want to mess my hair up.  </li>
            <li> We used two bottles to cover my hair, since it is VERY thick and nearly shoulder length.&lt;br /&gt;He</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t enough product for all of my thick hair</li>
            <li> This happened to my shirts even two or three weeks after I had dyed, and washed my hair a few times, it still rubbed off on my shirts.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and the dye washed off too quickly :(</li>
            <li> By the end of the week it had already started to fade to a pale purple.</li>
            <li> The seller should of used the REAL image not this fake picture!</li>
            <li> I used it anyway because I was correcting a previous job that left my hair an unfortunate color</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like false advertising.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s manic panic, even if it was the wrong color...</li>
            <li> I was horribly wrong.  </li>
            <li> washed it out in the sink using completely cold water.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Manic Panic is the only non-permanent dye I am using now, after trying a few. It&#x27;s vibrant, strong and lasts for quite a while. You need to be very careful, though, while you are applying it - it&#x27;s very easy to stain bathroom surfaces (or clothes).   I don&#x27;t bleach my hair prior to dying, as I want just strong highlights. I leave it on over the night, under plastic wrap and a warm hat. I love the dark purple shade! In the sun it looks fiery :)</li>
            <li> Ugh. Faded out in a week. I don&#x27;t use shampoo and I always cold-water rinse, but I was almost back to the bleach underneath. Use a better quality dye.</li>
            <li> Update: the added picture was from 2 weeks later. When I was researching Manic Panic I wanted to see pictures of what it looks like as it fades. Not too fond of where it is right now, but I don&#x27;t want to re dye it either. It was fun while it lasted. It is good if you only want something temporary like I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is only day 2 of using Manic Panic purple haze amplified. It definitely turned out as expected and I love it! My hair is medium blonde with highlights from 6 months ago. I did not bleach it. I haven&#x27;t washed it yet, and I am expecting it to fade with every wash. What I was looking for, and easy to apply by myself.</li>
            <li> My hair is medium blonde and a little longer than shoulder length. I only used about half of the container of dye to saturate my hair. Then I ran a comb through it to make sure that it was distributed evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I covered it with a shower cap to help warm it up, and left it on for an hour. Then I used a blow dryer to completely dry it before I washed it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made my hair not merely purple, but PURPLE! I love it!</li>
            <li> ok i been hit with a recent wave of purple love. it has become my favorite color. i decided to bleach the top of my head so that the new color would fall over my jet black hair. i followed the directions and actually left the manic panic purple haze in for 2 hours.... i really anticipated looking like barney... but i must say the second i washed it out i fell in love. it is a very rich shade not too bright but definately noticeable. i think it would go with anyones skin tone but me personally, am tan complected and it looks great. only downside is that after having it for one week without washing i noticed that some of the purple has lightened to a shade of pink. that was disappointing cause at first the solid purple looked great. i would recommend this product but if you want to keep the color up i suggest using it every week or every two weeks. manic panic rocks!</li>
            <li> Although it faded within two weeks to a lavendar, which didn&#x27;t look bad, it looked amazing in the begining. It&#x27;s alot darker than I thought it would be but it looked really pretty and it may be my favorite color I have used so far. It doesnt fade any quicker than any other color and it soaked in really well with out pre-bleaching.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve bought Manic Panic for several years now. This color is my teenagers&#x27; absolute favorite. Just my two cents but the ideal use for this product is to first bleach the hair with Manic Panic bleach, the drugstore stuff doesn&#x27;t go light enough and it washes out so be prepared to reapply it frequently. My teen touches hers up about every week. If you are looking for intense color without bleach - don&#x27;t buy this you won&#x27;t be happy.</li>
            <li> Definitely brighter and longer-lasting than the original Manic Panic line, but just as easy to use.  Nice stuff, worth the additional money if you&#x27;re planning to have your color in for a while.</li>
            <li> i bought manic panic for the first time recently.  i have been using permanent haircolor for 15 years and my hairdresser recommended using semi permanent color to avoid hair damage.&lt;br /&gt;i applied it according to instructions but left it on for two hours instead of the 15-30 minute suggestion.  the color is bold, i love it - just what i wanted. here&#x27;s the bummers:  it is the messiest stuff i have ever used!  i used vasoline on my hairline and ears and it still dyed them.  my shower curtain liner is now the color of the dye just from rinsing.  i had to quickly scrub the calking and grout with bleach as the dye stuck to that too. my hands are dyed from the rinsing stage, so is my neck. i&#x27;m sure it will fade soon though.&lt;br /&gt;my advice is to do the whole process in a backyard and rinse with a gardenhose...or rent a hotel room and let housekeeping deal with it.&lt;br /&gt;hope this is useful to somebody</li>
            <li> This item DOES NOT look like the picture, it doesn&#x27;t come in the jar but a tube. Price is the same at Sally&#x27;s, it washes out very easily. I will now be switching to Sally&#x27;s product of purple hair day. My friend uses it and her hair looks beautiful and a rich color.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line just go to your local beauty shop. The seller should of used the REAL image not this fake picture!</li>
            <li> I payed for a manic panic amplified purple haze and got a $10.00 jar of regular purple haze.</li>
            <li> this is not the first time i&#x27;ve bought this, but one of the three bottles i&#x27;ve bought wes open... i wonder why!!!</li>
            <li> I did receive amplified purple haze hair dye, but it&#x27;s not the one pictured. The one in the picture is NOT amplified, and while it&#x27;s also called purple haze it&#x27;s a different color. The product I received was not in the jar but in a bottle and it was much darker and more blue than the one in the jar which I have purchased before elsewhere. I used it anyway because I was correcting a previous job that left my hair an unfortunate color and I just didn&#x27;t want to wait for another order or be bothered returning it. The color did come out really well of course, it&#x27;s manic panic, even if it was the wrong color...</li>
            <li> It worked fine, dyed my hair purple. Used the method of applying, dryed to set with hair dryer, put on a shower cap and let sit overnight. It faded in a few weeks, but I&#x27;m hesitant to re-dye because several shirts had dye rub off on the collar area and permanently stained. This happened to my shirts even two or three weeks after I had dyed, and washed my hair a few times, it still rubbed off on my shirts. I really wanted it to work, but it&#x27;s not worth ruining my clothes. Now, I just use clip in purple hair extensions.</li>
            <li> Ive used many different colored dyes including manic panic. This is a nice, dark purple. Unfortunatly i cant tell how well it worked into my hair because i used Garnier nutrisse deep burgandy to blend into.  I did this as an experiment because i  had medium brown hair and i wanted dark hair that looks purple in the light but not PURPLE PURPLE and it actually worked. I also love how it doesnt smell, its not so watery, pretty thick liquid</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural Brunette. I bleached my hair a month earlier so that i could go purple. I picked Purple Haze because it was the perfect color purple that i wanted. I got the amplified, which is supposed to make it last longer and what-not. I left the product in my hair for over 6 hours and it came out perfect the first time around. There wasn&#x27;t enough product for all of my thick hair so i only did the under layer. During the first rinse i rinsed until the water was clear but every shower i took after that for the week after i could just see more and more purple come out. By the end of the week it had already started to fade to a pale purple. Half a week after that it looked more of a dirty purplish blonde that wasn&#x27;t appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the color, and i know that&#x27;s it&#x27;s only temporary. But i wish that i hadn&#x27;t wasted the time, honestly. Or the money. Especially since it only really lasted a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Last week I suddenly wanted to dye my hair purple.  I searched everywhere for the perfect shade, and I thought I had found it in Manic Panic Amplified.  I had assumed it would last longer than it used to. I was horribly wrong.  It&#x27;s not as if I&#x27;m a stranger to dying hair, either.  My daughter is currently rocking a shade of blue by Pravana Chromasilk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the procedure I used:&lt;br /&gt;First, I bleached my hair to a pale yellow (first time it has EVER been bleached).&lt;br /&gt;Then I washed and blow-dried my hair until it was definitely dry.&lt;br /&gt;My husband applied the Manic Panic Amplified - Purple Haze using the brush that came with the Manic Panic kit.  We used two bottles to cover my hair, since it is VERY thick and nearly shoulder length.&lt;br /&gt;He then brushed through each section of hair to make sure that it foamed up like the directions said to.&lt;br /&gt;I left this stuff on for HOURS like recommended, even using heat (blow-dryer) until it was fully dried.&lt;br /&gt;I washed it out in the sink using completely cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is recommended that you don&#x27;t wash your hair for several days, so I didn&#x27;t.  I held out as long as I possibly could.  Five days later I went to wash my hair - using ONLY COLD WATER (the shampoo is sulfate free, and I use a color-lock conditioner that I get at Sally&#x27;s Beauty), and as usual some dye washed down the drain (that&#x27;s normal).  I got out and looked, It was already faded to a much duller purple.  This doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.  But here&#x27;s the real kicker:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has only been two more days, I haven&#x27;t washed my hair again, yet SOMEHOW most of the purple is gone.  Like, where did it even go?  My hair has not been wet, I have been avoiding swimming until I find a bathing cap, because I don&#x27;t want to mess my hair up.  Right now I have a few streaks of purple and a strange orangey tone left behind on my bleached hair from the Manic Panic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I am going to buy Pravana Chromasilk Vivids.  It&#x27;s what I usedon my daughter, and 8 weeks later her blue is still holding strong.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend.  She tried a few different colors and this one worked the best with very little difference in liquid color to hair color.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and the dye washed off too quickly :( One or two washes and that was it. I moved to another brand</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like false advertising. Seller pictured the jar of manic panic color and it was actually the bottle.</li>
