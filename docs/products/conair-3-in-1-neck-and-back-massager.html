            <li>Love it, would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>I got this item because it looked great and seemed like it would fit my needs</li>
            <li>Purchase at your own risk.</li>
            <li>Basically it&#x27;s a really good idea but really needs to be made better..</li>
            <li>(A good suggestion would be to put some kind of wire in the shoulder portion so you could shape it to fit your individual build better and use a better hook method on the elastic portion).</li>
            <li>Great product, I could think of some improvement that they could make, as far as the way it fits the neck, but all in all not bad.</li>
            <li>The ice pack is a huge bonus for neck pain relief!&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>This massager is great for my neck and back.</li>
            <li>I am somewhat happy with this Neck &amp; Back Massager.</li>
            <li>Thats for a great xmas present to myself but would make a great present for anyone.</li>
            <li>It offers a good neck or back massage as well as good support for neck and head.  </li>
            <li>This used to be a good massager for neck and back, and useful for dealing with my inflammation flares.</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about using Batteries.</li>
            <li>It runs on batteries, AA, which should have told me how powerful it would be.</li>
            <li>Apparently quality at Conair isn&#x27;t a concern any more.  </li>
            <li>If you want a good shoulder massage from it, you have to hold the shoulder portion down yourself.  </li>
            <li>First one received had defective motors.</li>
            <li>Vibration is intense and I don&#x27;t do well with vibration at all -- makes me feel motion</li>
            <li>Back massage is fantastic</li>
            <li>works better for the upper back than neck.</li>
            <li>I decided to write a review since there wasn&#x27;t one, while looking for a new one to purchase.</li>
            <li>No other real comment than that.</li>
            <li>First of all; when you lean back on the massager, it doesn&#x27;t sit on your shoulders like it does in the picture.</li>
            <li>So, after receiving it today, it is repackaged and ready to go back to sender tomorrow.</li>

            <li> Just what I wanted-as advertised</li>
            <li> All it does is vibrate, I felt no relaxation, only queasiness. Purchase at your own risk.</li>
            <li> This massager is great for my neck and back. When I feel tense or sore I put this on and sit back and relax.</li>
            <li> Great product, I could think of some improvement that they could make, as far as the way it fits the neck, but all in all not bad.</li>
            <li> I am somewhat happy with this Neck &amp; Back Massager. It helps some. I am not crazy about using Batteries. I thought it was an Electric Massager.  So I am looking now for something like this that is Electric. But this Battery one does not fit the neck very well. Have to hold it in place to feel the massage.</li>
            <li> This item concept is great! The ice pack is a huge bonus for neck pain relief!&lt;br /&gt;For me, I need massage. This is all vibration so it didn&#x27;t work for me. Vibration is intense and I don&#x27;t do well with vibration at all -- makes me feel motion sick.&lt;br /&gt;Good product- but does not &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; it vibrates.</li>
            <li> First one received had defective motors. Replacement has unpleasant neck motor vibration and batteries hard to install or remove (battery holder slightly too small.).  Neck is not soothing vibration.  Apparently quality at Conair isn&#x27;t a concern any more.  This used to be a good massager for neck and back, and useful for dealing with my inflammation flares.</li>
            <li> This massager is so light, it&#x27;s tough to feel anything! It runs on batteries, AA, which should have told me how powerful it would be. Buy something that plugs in and actually massages as opposed to a product that just vibrates.</li>
            <li> works better for the upper back than neck. No other real comment than that. 3 out of 5 stars for me</li>
            <li> This contraption is NOT user-friendly, is apparently made for non-human bodies as it does not touch any part of the neck as it claims, and the on/off buttons are rediculously pathetic. I am NOT happy with the thing and have thrown it in the trash.</li>
            <li> This massager was sent as a present after asking my mother for a massager like the one she owns... It is NOT like the one she owns. Her&#x27;s has little massaging balls that rotate and this one \\&quot;massages\\&quot; with vibration. My husband even tried it and said it was ineffective. So, after receiving it today, it is repackaged and ready to go back to sender tomorrow. I decided to write a review since there wasn&#x27;t one, while looking for a new one to purchase.</li>
            <li> Back massage is fantastic</li>
            <li> I got this item because it looked great and seemed like it would fit my needs.. Well it didn&#x27;t quite do that for me.  First of all; when you lean back on the massager, it doesn&#x27;t sit on your shoulders like it does in the picture. If you want a good shoulder massage from it, you have to hold the shoulder portion down yourself.  The little elastic piece that is supposed to help keep it snug, slips off the knob that it&#x27;s supposed to wraps around.. Basically it&#x27;s a really good idea but really needs to be made better.. I would not recommend this item.  (A good suggestion would be to put some kind of wire in the shoulder portion so you could shape it to fit your individual build better and use a better hook method on the elastic portion).</li>
            <li> Back massagers work well, but the neck massagers could be stronger.</li>
            <li> I purchased this massager after going to the dentist, and they had one.......and let me use it. It work wonderfully and feels awesome on my neck, shoulders and upper back.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Deloris</li>
            <li> Works great! Love it, would recommend to anyone! Thats for a great xmas present to myself but would make a great present for anyone.</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected, it will work for the time being! It seems like it may not last long, poorly constructed!</li>
            <li> This product was returned because it only vibrates and i thought it gave massages. This was just not for me</li>
            <li> It offers a good neck or back massage as well as good support for neck and head.  I use mines constantly.....batteries last long enough, except when it gets left on by mistake.</li>
