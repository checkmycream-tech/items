            <li>These are sturdy, good quality and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Enough reminiscing about another product which was vastly superior to this one.</li>

            <li>I REALLY wish Oral B hadn&#x27;t scrapped the Hummingbird line of flossers, which was the best flossing product ever.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for an amazing, pleasant flossing product, see of you can unearth a Hummingbird and a lifetime worth of replacement heads on ebay or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I love, love, love Reach Access Flossers!  </li>

            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>and I love the minty flosser refills</li>
            <li>it may be the best dental cleaning invention of the last decade.</li>
            <li>Glad I have this.</li>
            <li>It sure takes the work and aggravation out of flossing your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Best product I&#x27;ve found to ease daily flossing.</li>

            <li>more DenTek for me.  </li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>I love the Reach Access.  </li>
            <li>It is supposed to be better than flossing for in between plaque.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I feel its ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never been good at consistently flossing</li>
            <li>I wish this was available at my local pharmacy because this is the best flosser ever.</li>
            <li>the meantime, keep those teeth clean any way you can!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love flossing now, but I can do it every day and not hate myself.</li>
            <li>So far this flosser is working out great for me.</li>
            <li>Makes flossing about as easy as brushing teeth.  </li>
            <li>Easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li>The Reach flosser makes flossing so easy and convenient</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping my dental hygienist will be proud of my healthy gums at my next appointment.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how easy it is with this thing.</li>
            <li>The Reach Access Flosser makes flossing easy.</li>
            <li>The flosser refills are easy to replace on the Flosser.</li>
            <li>Keep looking until you find the original, unflavored Reach Access Flosser refills, and enjoy your clean mouth!  :-)</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Makes flossing easy.</li>
            <li>Makes flossing so easy.</li>
            <li>do damned easily, this could easily be a 4-star product.</li>
            <li>Everything was fine about the order itself.</li>
            <li>I got this set to repace my old one, which is still working just fine, but I wanted a new flosser &amp;#34;just in case.&amp;#34;  I was almost out of the disposable heads, and I thought that this kit was the best value.  </li>
            <li>Makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend you buy one with a smooth plastic handle instead.</li>
            <li>I use this flosser because I have arthritic hands, and i can&#x27;t comfortably manage a length of floss by itself.  </li>
            <li>this item is great for my wife who needs my attention with her personal care.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find these and the extra flosser thrown in was a nice bonus since I had been wanting my wife to try these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the perpendicular orientation of the floss is what originally sold me.</li>
            <li>The mint flavor is pretty strong on the refills, but I like strong mint.  </li>
            <li>Great and as expected.</li>
            <li>Definitely going to stick with regular floss, much more maneuverable, gets out waaaay more gunk, and way more cost effective.</li>
            <li>It is much easier, and I am much more inclined to floss.</li>
            <li>But these mint flavored refills leave an extremely sickly sweet, and somewhat minty, taste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Just be ready to order more before they run out.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I ordered three, one for each kid, and I was very pleased that they all came in different colors.</li>
            <li>Love it - so easy to use and access back of my mouth</li>
            <li>but we&#x27;ll worth it.</li>
            <li>This is very handy instead of using those little floss picks.  </li>
            <li>me, the whole point of flossing is to have a clean, fresh mouth.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get the right product.</li>
            <li>I got this because i had shoulder surgery, and could not use my right arm.  </li>
            <li>Just the right item.  </li>
            <li>The actual floss material is very strong too.</li>
            <li>Now I floss every single day because of how quick and easy this is to use!</li>
            <li>Great for reaching all those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Innovative tool helps with that daily routine of flossing-</li>
            <li>He has mentioned several times how pleased he is with the access flosser.</li>
            <li>Helps taking care of your teeth so much easier!</li>
            <li>Since my local grocery, which used to carry the flosser, but no longer does, having dropped a bunch of national brands in favor of store brands, I am glad to find it here.  </li>
            <li>Recently they have become more</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years and I am pleased.</li>
            <li>It helped me take up flossing as a more regular activity than I ever had before or have since.</li>
            <li>1,000 times better than its competitor (DenTek), whose similar device doesn&#x27;t work well at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, particularly to get to back teeth.</li>
            <li>As much as I dislike all of the plastic and shoving various bits of it into the Earth, this is a small and excellent flosser.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully in those hard to reach places in the back of your mouth.</li>
            <li>oh so easy to get to the back teeth!</li>
            <li>Makes flossing easy... went from dreading flossing to a daily flosser.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable in the hand, it&#x27;s longer body reaches back to the molars  with relative ease and the heads are easily swappable.</li>
            <li>I use the Reach flosser because it cleans between my teeth efficiently and quickly, but also because i have Sjogrens Syndrome, which, among other symptoms, has caused my fingers to become quite sensitive, especially when I must put a good deal of pressure on them.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to floss with</li>
            <li>Really like this flosser</li>
            <li>Buy one, and you will see how much easier and thorough it is tp use.</li>
            <li>I really like the refills, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>would really suggest this to others including my family.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really quite repulsive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These products make flossing so much easier</li>
            <li>We really like REACH - Wonder why J &amp; J discontinued it?</li>
            <li>It makes flossing so much easier than trying to wind floss around your fingers and having it either slip off or cut off circulation.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li>absolutely as advertised.</li>
            <li>It makes flossing so much easier.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The flosser works exceptionally at getting to places I could never get to adequately using my fingers and spooled floss, if I have any complaints it might be that the actual \\&quot;floss\\&quot; which seems to be a woven plastic type floss does not last that long</li>
            <li>Brand new in package and works as supposed to!</li>
            <li>Works exactly as expected, sturdy, easy to exchange tips.</li>
            <li>Had never tried before, so ordered because I am getting paranoid about my teeth as I get older.</li>
            <li>Still prefer regular flossing but my teenage boys love it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>These Reach flossers are marginally more pleasant than using regular floss and cutting off circulation to your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the handle means that your scrubby little mitts wont be touching the inside of your mouth-hole.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy flossing with these, where I never really flossed with the string floss.</li>
            <li>The flosser works fine, but the rubber area gets full of gross black mildew after a while.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get these anywhere near most of my teeth, especially in the back.</li>
            <li>I will admit that refilling the flosser the first time fought me to think three-dimensionally, but really the task is simple.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But, with the Reach Access Flosser, there are no more excuses because this device makes it so easy to floss and reach all those hard-to-reach places!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t explain what&#x27;s different about it, but while I won&#x27;t say I enjoy or look forward to flossing, it&#x27;s become a part of my daily routine just like brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>Have always liked the flosser but was having trouble getting refills in local drug stores.  </li>
            <li>The holder is easy to use and will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for a month and have regularly flossed for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I needed to assist me with regular flossing.  </li>
            <li>I previously posted a review that said the heads didn&#x27;t fit the flosser.  </li>
            <li>When you easily place this between the teeth, as expected you can apply pressure and properly clean between the teeth as you would with any other disposable similar type flosser.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner over the course of the day and especially when I first wake up, compared to only brushing.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t buy just refills in regular stores because they cost too much.</li>
            <li>I actually floss too much now.</li>
            <li>but it does not wear out so fast that I would actually not recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Makes it much easier to reach those back teeth.  </li>
            <li>(something I used to do frequently).</li>
            <li>I am challenged as far as flossing goes.</li>
            <li>My gums never bled because I flossed so frequently.</li>
            <li>The handle make it easy to guide as well as the small head.  </li>
            <li>I spent the first 50 years of my life almost never flossing.  </li>
            <li>This tool makes it easy to reach those hard to reach spots.  </li>
            <li>Those little one use type flossers I see in the store seem to have to real advantage over the fingers/floss since they are so short, the long handle and the ability to actually clean this thing are part of the reason for my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So as you pull the flosser back out from between the teeth you often hit at a high rate of speed the tooth on the opposite side you are flossing.  </li>
            <li>so maybe its better if you have big hands and its hard to floss in the back of your mouth.</li>
            <li>Works very well on my teeth, which are very close together, and my wisdom teeth which are hard to reach.</li>
            <li>easy to use.....and less waste then disposable picks.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s no excuse not to make flossing a daily habit.</li>
            <li>The flossing ends last for quite some time, don&#x27;t break quickly and are very small, thus allowing access into the deepest recesses without getting your fingers mucky.</li>

            <li> I love the Reach Access.  </li>
            <li> It is supposed to be better than flossing for in between plaque.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I feel its ok.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been good at consistently flossing</li>
            <li> I wish this was available at my local pharmacy because this is the best flosser ever.</li>
            <li> the meantime, keep those teeth clean any way you can!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love flossing now, but I can do it every day and not hate myself.</li>
            <li> So far this flosser is working out great for me.</li>
            <li> Makes flossing about as easy as brushing teeth.  </li>
            <li> Easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li> The Reach flosser makes flossing so easy and convenient</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping my dental hygienist will be proud of my healthy gums at my next appointment.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how easy it is with this thing.</li>
            <li> The Reach Access Flosser makes flossing easy.</li>
            <li> The flosser refills are easy to replace on the Flosser.</li>
            <li> Keep looking until you find the original, unflavored Reach Access Flosser refills, and enjoy your clean mouth!  :-)</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Makes flossing easy.</li>
            <li> Makes flossing so easy.</li>
            <li> do damned easily, this could easily be a 4-star product.</li>
            <li> Everything was fine about the order itself.</li>
            <li> I got this set to repace my old one, which is still working just fine, but I wanted a new flosser &amp;#34;just in case.&amp;#34;  I was almost out of the disposable heads, and I thought that this kit was the best value.  </li>
            <li> Makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend you buy one with a smooth plastic handle instead.</li>
            <li> I use this flosser because I have arthritic hands, and i can&#x27;t comfortably manage a length of floss by itself.  </li>
            <li> this item is great for my wife who needs my attention with her personal care.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find these and the extra flosser thrown in was a nice bonus since I had been wanting my wife to try these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the perpendicular orientation of the floss is what originally sold me.</li>
            <li> The mint flavor is pretty strong on the refills, but I like strong mint.  </li>
            <li> Great and as expected.</li>
            <li> Definitely going to stick with regular floss, much more maneuverable, gets out waaaay more gunk, and way more cost effective.</li>
            <li> It is much easier, and I am much more inclined to floss.</li>
            <li> But these mint flavored refills leave an extremely sickly sweet, and somewhat minty, taste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Just be ready to order more before they run out.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I ordered three, one for each kid, and I was very pleased that they all came in different colors.</li>
            <li> Love it - so easy to use and access back of my mouth</li>
            <li> but we&#x27;ll worth it.</li>
            <li> This is very handy instead of using those little floss picks.  </li>
            <li> me, the whole point of flossing is to have a clean, fresh mouth.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get the right product.</li>
            <li> I got this because i had shoulder surgery, and could not use my right arm.  </li>
            <li> Just the right item.  </li>
            <li> The actual floss material is very strong too.</li>
            <li> Now I floss every single day because of how quick and easy this is to use!</li>
            <li> Great for reaching all those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Innovative tool helps with that daily routine of flossing-</li>
            <li> He has mentioned several times how pleased he is with the access flosser.</li>
            <li> Helps taking care of your teeth so much easier!</li>
            <li> Since my local grocery, which used to carry the flosser, but no longer does, having dropped a bunch of national brands in favor of store brands, I am glad to find it here.  </li>
            <li> Recently they have become more</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and I am pleased.</li>
            <li> It helped me take up flossing as a more regular activity than I ever had before or have since.</li>
            <li> 1,000 times better than its competitor (DenTek), whose similar device doesn&#x27;t work well at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, particularly to get to back teeth.</li>
            <li> As much as I dislike all of the plastic and shoving various bits of it into the Earth, this is a small and excellent flosser.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully in those hard to reach places in the back of your mouth.</li>
            <li> oh so easy to get to the back teeth!</li>
            <li> Makes flossing easy... went from dreading flossing to a daily flosser.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable in the hand, it&#x27;s longer body reaches back to the molars  with relative ease and the heads are easily swappable.</li>
            <li> I use the Reach flosser because it cleans between my teeth efficiently and quickly, but also because i have Sjogrens Syndrome, which, among other symptoms, has caused my fingers to become quite sensitive, especially when I must put a good deal of pressure on them.  </li>
            <li> Much easier to floss with</li>
            <li> Really like this flosser</li>
            <li> Buy one, and you will see how much easier and thorough it is tp use.</li>
            <li> I really like the refills, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> would really suggest this to others including my family.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really quite repulsive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These products make flossing so much easier</li>
            <li> We really like REACH - Wonder why J &amp; J discontinued it?</li>
            <li> It makes flossing so much easier than trying to wind floss around your fingers and having it either slip off or cut off circulation.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li> absolutely as advertised.</li>
            <li> It makes flossing so much easier.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The flosser works exceptionally at getting to places I could never get to adequately using my fingers and spooled floss, if I have any complaints it might be that the actual \\&quot;floss\\&quot; which seems to be a woven plastic type floss does not last that long</li>
            <li> Brand new in package and works as supposed to!</li>
            <li> Works exactly as expected, sturdy, easy to exchange tips.</li>
            <li> Had never tried before, so ordered because I am getting paranoid about my teeth as I get older.</li>
            <li> Still prefer regular flossing but my teenage boys love it</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> These Reach flossers are marginally more pleasant than using regular floss and cutting off circulation to your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the handle means that your scrubby little mitts wont be touching the inside of your mouth-hole.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy flossing with these, where I never really flossed with the string floss.</li>
            <li> The flosser works fine, but the rubber area gets full of gross black mildew after a while.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get these anywhere near most of my teeth, especially in the back.</li>
            <li> I will admit that refilling the flosser the first time fought me to think three-dimensionally, but really the task is simple.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But, with the Reach Access Flosser, there are no more excuses because this device makes it so easy to floss and reach all those hard-to-reach places!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t explain what&#x27;s different about it, but while I won&#x27;t say I enjoy or look forward to flossing, it&#x27;s become a part of my daily routine just like brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> Have always liked the flosser but was having trouble getting refills in local drug stores.  </li>
            <li> The holder is easy to use and will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for a month and have regularly flossed for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I needed to assist me with regular flossing.  </li>
            <li> I previously posted a review that said the heads didn&#x27;t fit the flosser.  </li>
            <li> When you easily place this between the teeth, as expected you can apply pressure and properly clean between the teeth as you would with any other disposable similar type flosser.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner over the course of the day and especially when I first wake up, compared to only brushing.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t buy just refills in regular stores because they cost too much.</li>
            <li> I actually floss too much now.</li>
            <li> but it does not wear out so fast that I would actually not recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Makes it much easier to reach those back teeth.  </li>
            <li> (something I used to do frequently).</li>
            <li> I am challenged as far as flossing goes.</li>
            <li> My gums never bled because I flossed so frequently.</li>
            <li> The handle make it easy to guide as well as the small head.  </li>
            <li> I spent the first 50 years of my life almost never flossing.  </li>
            <li> This tool makes it easy to reach those hard to reach spots.  </li>
            <li> Those little one use type flossers I see in the store seem to have to real advantage over the fingers/floss since they are so short, the long handle and the ability to actually clean this thing are part of the reason for my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So as you pull the flosser back out from between the teeth you often hit at a high rate of speed the tooth on the opposite side you are flossing.  </li>
            <li> so maybe its better if you have big hands and its hard to floss in the back of your mouth.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my teeth, which are very close together, and my wisdom teeth which are hard to reach.</li>
            <li> easy to use.....and less waste then disposable picks.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no excuse not to make flossing a daily habit.</li>
            <li> The flossing ends last for quite some time, don&#x27;t break quickly and are very small, thus allowing access into the deepest recesses without getting your fingers mucky.</li>
            <li> The reach is accurately named, becuase it allows you to get to the hard to reach tight gaps in the back of your mouth.</li>
            <li> The bonus mint heads have a small amount of mint paste embedded in the plastic, so it can be really minty or not, depending on how you floss.</li>
            <li> Really hope Oral B either brings it back to market, or that they sell the rights to a company that can manage it and understands the long term potential enough to take the up front loses that must have plagued the Hummingbird originally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The flossing heads are a little tricky to install into the holder at first, but after a few times it becomes second nature.  </li>
            <li> so I give it 4 Stars, not 5 mainly for the need to replace the floss (refill) fairly regularly.  </li>
            <li> The floss is thin but strong and tight.</li>
            <li> I suppose they are made for a one-time use; but if you are careful, you may yet several uses out of each one.  </li>
            <li> I know it is strange)!  </li>
            <li> The flossing heads work well, but if you have very tight teeth or crowns that may have an edge near the gum line, the floss may get caught and might break.  </li>
            <li> the DenTek device, the floss piece attached to the Reach device does NOT come off, doesn&#x27;t get stuck in the teeth; I haven&#x27;t had one single problem with it and have been using for over a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I think of how odd it would be to have a toothbrush that was only a couple inches long where you had to put part of your hand in your mouth to brush your teeth!</li>
            <li> I tight places it breaks or frays and need to use several tops per session.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have very arthritic hands and using normal floss became impossible for me; this solved the problem.  </li>
            <li> In addition to just plain floss, I tried various flossing gizmos, but I&#x27;d stay at it for a day or two then lose interest.  </li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve had trouble finding refills, I&#x27;ve tried other flossers, but they&#x27;re just not the same.  </li>
            <li> I have big hands, this tool lets me get all the way back there to those hard to get wisdom teeth!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would want to use anything other than a Reach Access Flosser, anyway.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why its so hard to find these in pharmacies, I finally just ordered a 4 pack from Amazon.</li>
            <li> A floss head will last 5-7 days and it cost me $23 for 168 heads, so I probably have at least 2.5 year supply.</li>
            <li> He has a smaller mouth and it is difficult for him to use regular floss.  </li>
            <li> and so was less than diligent doing so.  </li>
            <li> Reach product might get the job done, but it is painfully inferior, and I&#x27;m not sure there is a decent current alternative to the Hummingbird.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised, no seller issues, product is just not comfortable to manipulate.</li>
            <li> green tips</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of flossing, and this is a game changer</li>
            <li> As is, though, I sometimes literally have had to go through 3 or 4 heads in a single flossing session, which is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The floss is too narrow and is difficult to reach in the back of the mouth.</li>
            <li> , now I floss regularly everyday!</li>
            <li> i cant stand the flossers you usually see.  </li>
            <li> Was lazy to floss up until I found this product.</li>
            <li> Where this product fails is that the side opposite the flosser is hard plastic.  </li>
            <li> While I have been using this flosser for about 2 years on the advice of my dentist, getting refills was near impossible it seemed.  </li>
            <li> Hard on gums, terible coverage.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores now.</li>
            <li> Had a hard time flossing those rear molars all my life.</li>
            <li> but, amazingly, no place or sticker on racks for  the flosser handles...</li>
            <li> No!  Healthy gums!  </li>
            <li> I like the way you can reach all teeth without putting hands in the mouth BUT am not happy with the breakage of the floss.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a coup[le months or so and haven&#x27;t broken any of the floss strands yet</li>
            <li> Makes flossling less annoying.</li>
            <li> If you think any of that would keep me from using these you are wrong, nothing else works as well IMHO.</li>
            <li> I can always find the replacement heads however, weird.</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to floss.</li>
            <li> I hated sticking my fingers in my mouth to floss</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate flossing now!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Everything was fine about the order itself. I just didn&#x27;t pay attention to the fact that the bonus refills were mint and I am allergic to mint, so can&#x27;t use them! Will try to give them away.</li>
            <li> Makes flossing about as easy as brushing teeth.  My teeth feel much cleaner over the course of the day and especially when I first wake up, compared to only brushing.  A floss head will last 5-7 days and it cost me $23 for 168 heads, so I probably have at least 2.5 year supply.</li>
            <li> perfect for reaching back teeth</li>
            <li> Much easier to floss with</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended this but I&#x27;m not a fan.  It works as advertised, no seller issues, product is just not comfortable to manipulate.</li>
            <li> Great value on this product. And it was delivered in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Understanding that I am reluctant to do flossing with a string of floss, my dental hygienist convinced me to try this.  It is much easier, and I am much more inclined to floss.</li>
            <li> Great flossers!!!!  Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get the right product. We got regular floss instead.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Innovative tool helps with that daily routine of flossing-</li>
            <li> Really like this flosser</li>
            <li> Great and as expected.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Good product.</li>
            <li> My husband uses these faithfully and cannot be without them.  He has a smaller mouth and it is difficult for him to use regular floss.  These are a durable and quality product.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected.  I just needed a second one for my travel case.</li>
            <li> Great for easy flossing.  Item as described and delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> Love it, couldn&#x27;t find it in any store. I am happy</li>
            <li> I got this because i had shoulder surgery, and could not use my right arm.  But, i will use this periodically, as it seems to scrape much better than i can with floss and my hands.</li>
            <li> Awesome product ! None like Reach !</li>
            <li> cuts flossing time to 30 seconds. slam dunk</li>
            <li> I like the way you can reach all teeth without putting hands in the mouth BUT am not happy with the breakage of the floss.  I tight places it breaks or frays and need to use several tops per session.</li>
            <li> The flosser works fine, but the rubber area gets full of gross black mildew after a while. It&#x27;s gross. I would recommend you buy one with a smooth plastic handle instead.</li>
            <li> Packaged well, arrived on time.  Easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li> I got this set to repace my old one, which is still working just fine, but I wanted a new flosser &amp;#34;just in case.&amp;#34;  I was almost out of the disposable heads, and I thought that this kit was the best value.

            <li> much better than flossing&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been good at consistently flossing&lt;br /&gt;now I floss every night now that I have this</li>
            <li> The floss is too narrow and is difficult to reach in the back of the mouth.</li>
            <li> I spent the first 50 years of my life almost never flossing.  My dentist would lecture me on the importance of flossing, my wife would remind me, but I just couldn&#x27;t motivate myself.  In addition to just plain floss, I tried various flossing gizmos, but I&#x27;d stay at it for a day or two then lose interest.  Then I tried the Reach flosser. I can&#x27;t explain what&#x27;s different about it, but while I won&#x27;t say I enjoy or look forward to flossing, it&#x27;s become a part of my daily routine just like brushing my teeth. When I&#x27;ve had trouble finding refills, I&#x27;ve tried other flossers, but they&#x27;re just not the same.  And now that I&#x27;ve found refills on Amazon, I&#x27;ll be staying with Reach indefinitely.</li>
            <li> I hated sticking my fingers in my mouth to floss and so was less than diligent doing so.  The Reach flosser makes flossing so easy and convenient I do it almost every time I go in the bathroom during the day.  I will never be without one.</li>
            <li> I really like the refills, which is what I was looking for. I can&#x27;t buy just refills in regular stores because they cost too much. It&#x27;s cheaper to buy this combo.</li>
            <li> Sore teeth opposite the ones being cleaned.  While this product has a great idea, the execution is off quite a bit.  When you easily place this between the teeth, as expected you can apply pressure and properly clean between the teeth as you would with any other disposable similar type flosser.  Where this product fails is that the side opposite the flosser is hard plastic.  So as you pull the flosser back out from between the teeth you often hit at a high rate of speed the tooth on the opposite side you are flossing.  This impact is great if you have very strong teeth, but if you have any sensitivity at all you are basically hammering your teeth with a slingshot effect trying to dislodge it from between the teeth.  If they made the replacement pieces with a overmolded rubberized piece it would negate some of the smashing effect that occurs to the opposite teeth while taking it back out from between the teeth below.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a month and have regularly flossed for the first time in my life. I&#x27;m hoping my dental hygienist will be proud of my healthy gums at my next appointment.</li>
            <li> used these for a while now. I really enjoy flossing with these, where I never really flossed with the string floss.</li>
            <li> Excellent. I actually floss too much now. that&#x27;s how easy it is with this thing.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully in those hard to reach places in the back of your mouth. More expensive but we&#x27;ll worth it. Got me to floss more often.</li>
            <li> Best flossing system out there</li>
            <li> The Reach Access Flosser makes flossing easy. The flosser refills are easy to replace on the Flosser.</li>
            <li> great works well and makes flossing a lot easier! would really suggest this to others including my family. go get it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a hater - I love, love, love Reach Access Flossers!  But all the local stores quit stocking the regular refills, and started stocking these &amp;#34;mint flavored&amp;#34; refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the whole point of flossing is to have a clean, fresh mouth.  Well, that, and it makes visits to the dentist much more pleasant.  But these mint flavored refills leave an extremely sickly sweet, and somewhat minty, taste in my mouth.  It&#x27;s really quite repulsive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice: move on.  Keep looking until you find the original, unflavored Reach Access Flosser refills, and enjoy your clean mouth!  :-)</li>
            <li> I previously posted a review that said the heads didn&#x27;t fit the flosser.  I was mistaken, and the problem was not the fault of the flosser.  Please change my review.</li>
            <li> Easy to use when flossing teeth!</li>
            <li> These were ordered for my husband&#x27;s use and he is very pleased with them.  He has mentioned several times how pleased he is with the access flosser.</li>
            <li> Now I floss every single day because of how quick and easy this is to use!</li>
            <li> I have big hands, this tool lets me get all the way back there to those hard to get wisdom teeth!</li>
            <li> Just the right item.  Is cheaper in the drug store if they are in stock.</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised. Good flosser.</li>
            <li> These products make flossing so much easier there&#x27;s no excuse not to make flossing a daily habit.</li>
            <li> IT IS A FLOSSER -- IT FLOSSES --. END OF STORY  I HAVE USED FOR YEARS &amp; LOVE IT -</li>
            <li> great product I could not find it in the drugstores</li>
            <li> Sliced bread, the wheel, ice cubes, and &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34;. Love it - I only wish the floss lasted longer on the mint version.</li>
            <li> best/easiest flossers!  Easy to use and you don&#x27;t cut your fingers like with traditional floss.  Helps taking care of your teeth so much easier!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love flossing now, but I can do it every day and not hate myself. It&#x27;s a good thing!</li>
            <li> Been flossing for 60 years - this is the best flosser - the floss doesn&#x27;t break</li>
            <li> While I have been using this flosser for about 2 years on the advice of my dentist, getting refills was near impossible it seemed.  I was thrilled to find these and the extra flosser thrown in was a nice bonus since I had been wanting my wife to try these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flosser works exceptionally at getting to places I could never get to adequately using my fingers and spooled floss, if I have any complaints it might be that the actual \\&quot;floss\\&quot; which seems to be a woven plastic type floss does not last that long but it does not wear out so fast that I would actually not recommend this product.  Those little one use type flossers I see in the store seem to have to real advantage over the fingers/floss since they are so short, the long handle and the ability to actually clean this thing are part of the reason for my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  Great product, acceptable durability (that is why they sell refills), functionality is exceptional so I give it 4 Stars, not 5 mainly for the need to replace the floss (refill) fairly regularly.  If you think any of that would keep me from using these you are wrong, nothing else works as well IMHO.</li>
            <li> We really like REACH - Wonder why J &amp; J discontinued it? Phil &amp; Dawn</li>
            <li> What can I say?  It works as advertised</li>
            <li> Makes it much easier to reach those back teeth.  Makes a huge difference.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This was to replace one of these I&#x27;ve been using for years.  It makes flossing so much easier than trying to wind floss around your fingers and having it either slip off or cut off circulation.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my teeth, which are very close together, and my wisdom teeth which are hard to reach.</li>
            <li> This is very handy instead of using those little floss picks.  It definitely lets you get back further.  The mint flavor is pretty strong on the refills, but I like strong mint.  Some may not like it, however.</li>
            <li> easy to use.....and less waste then disposable picks.</li>
            <li> theonly way  i can floss in the back stocked up here..cant find refills in drugstores</li>
            <li> I have no idea why people like using these. Had never tried before, so ordered because I am getting paranoid about my teeth as I get older. I can&#x27;t get these anywhere near most of my teeth, especially in the back. Most of the time I was just hammering the hell out of my mouth trying to move this thing around. Hard on gums, terible coverage. Definitely going to stick with regular floss, much more maneuverable, gets out waaaay more gunk, and way more cost effective.</li>
            <li> Love it - so easy to use and access back of my mouth</li>
            <li> Makes flossing a lot quicker and easier!</li>
            <li> I wish this was available at my local pharmacy because this is the best flosser ever. It&#x27;s a great design. It is very easy to use, particularly to get to back teeth. The floss is thin but strong and tight. The bonus mint heads have a small amount of mint paste embedded in the plastic, so it can be really minty or not, depending on how you floss.</li>
            <li> I ordered three, one for each kid, and I was very pleased that they all came in different colors.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores now. Great to just go to Amazon to get it. If you or your kids floss only once or twice a week, this will have you flossing every day. Cannot do without it now!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my dad and he loves it!</li>
            <li> I use the Reach flosser because it cleans between my teeth efficiently and quickly, but also because i have Sjogrens Syndrome, which, among other symptoms, has caused my fingers to become quite sensitive, especially when I must put a good deal of pressure on them.  Regular dental floss has become one of those &amp;#34;tools&amp;#34; I sort of heat to use, since it has to be wound around the fingers.  No problems with the Reach.  I will admit that refilling the flosser the first time fought me to think three-dimensionally, but really the task is simple.  Since my local grocery, which used to carry the flosser, but no longer does, having dropped a bunch of national brands in favor of store brands, I am glad to find it here.  BTW Sjogrens increases the need for flossing.</li>
            <li> Makes flossling less annoying.</li>
            <li> The best job of flossing I have ever have  done. I only have the use of one hand and this is perfect. This is the second one I have purchased. They are great!</li>
            <li> So far this flosser is working out great for me. Definitely beats the traditional way. The reach is accurately named, becuase it allows you to get to the hard to reach tight gaps in the back of your mouth. Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as expected, sturdy, easy to exchange tips. Very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The green tips it comes with have a minty taste, love it.</li>
            <li> absolutely as advertised. great since I am a one-armed person. Makes flossing easy. buy it, you&#x27;ll like it</li>
            <li> Brand new in package and works as supposed to!</li>
            <li> this item is great for my wife who needs my attention with her personal care. I could not find this item in any of the local stores even though our dentist had given us some samples.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product.  Best and easiest Flosser I ever used !!!</li>
            <li> I love these and I can not find the reacher in my local stores anywhere. I can always find the replacement heads however, weird. Anyway, one of our reachers got gross from use and so we decided to buy this. It was a great deal and this is really the best and easiest way to floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product.</li>
            <li> Dental hygienist recommended. Stores...had refills...but, amazingly, no place or sticker on racks for  the flosser handles...go figure.....amazon to the rescue and at a great pruce.  Bought 3 ...one for my car.....gross?  No!  Healthy gums!  These are sturdy, good quality and oh so easy to get to the back teeth!</li>
            <li> I neglected flossing until I found the Reach Access Flosser and I love the minty flosser refills, now I floss regularly everyday!</li>
            <li> i cant stand the flossers you usually see.  the perpendicular orientation of the floss is what originally sold me. the handle means that your scrubby little mitts wont be touching the inside of your mouth-hole.</li>
            <li> it may be the best dental cleaning invention of the last decade. Makes flossing so easy. The floss thread keeps its tension while flossing.</li>
            <li> Awesome flosser! I like these because I don&#x27;t have to put my fingers in my mouth when I&#x27;m flossing. I had never thought about this as a problem before. Now I think of how odd it would be to have a toothbrush that was only a couple inches long where you had to put part of your hand in your mouth to brush your teeth! The actual floss material is very strong too. I&#x27;ve been using it for a coup[le months or so and haven&#x27;t broken any of the floss strands yet (something I used to do frequently).</li>
            <li> As much as I dislike all of the plastic and shoving various bits of it into the Earth, this is a small and excellent flosser. The flossing ends last for quite some time, don&#x27;t break quickly and are very small, thus allowing access into the deepest recesses without getting your fingers mucky. This is the best device I have used to date. It is comfortable in the hand, it&#x27;s longer body reaches back to the molars  with relative ease and the heads are easily swappable. Glad I have this.</li>
            <li> Have always liked the flosser but was having trouble getting refills in local drug stores.  Recently they have become more available.&lt;br /&gt;This flosser was bought for someone else.  I used the refills.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Flossing has never been easier...so glad I tried this!! I don&#x27;t hate flossing now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of flossing, and this is a game changer - it makes it almost a no brainer to floss every day now. I don&#x27;t know why its so hard to find these in pharmacies, I finally just ordered a 4 pack from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Was lazy to floss up until I found this product. Now I do floss - every day and with ease</li>
            <li> I am challenged as far as flossing goes. I find it difficult to floss. The Reach Access Flosser is the answer to my problem. It&#x27;s very easy to use, and I use it every day !</li>
            <li> I REALLY wish Oral B hadn&#x27;t scrapped the Hummingbird line of flossers, which was the best flossing product ever. It helped me take up flossing as a more regular activity than I ever had before or have since. My gums never bled because I flossed so frequently. My teeth were never cleaner....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough reminiscing about another product which was vastly superior to this one. These Reach flossers are marginally more pleasant than using regular floss and cutting off circulation to your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the floss refills didn&#x27;t break do damned easily, this could easily be a 4-star product. As is, though, I sometimes literally have had to go through 3 or 4 heads in a single flossing session, which is ridiculous. That&#x27;s just unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an amazing, pleasant flossing product, see of you can unearth a Hummingbird and a lifetime worth of replacement heads on ebay or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Reach product might get the job done, but it is painfully inferior, and I&#x27;m not sure there is a decent current alternative to the Hummingbird. Really hope Oral B either brings it back to market, or that they sell the rights to a company that can manage it and understands the long term potential enough to take the up front loses that must have plagued the Hummingbird originally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, keep those teeth clean any way you can!</li>
            <li> This toll is a must. It makes flossing so much easier.  A friend of mine didn&#x27;t go to the dentist for 3 years( not recommneded) and his report was perfect. He attributes it to this tool!</li>
            <li> It sure takes the work and aggravation out of flossing your teeth.  The holder is easy to use and will last a long time.  The flossing heads are a little tricky to install into the holder at first, but after a few times it becomes second nature.  The flossing heads work well, but if you have very tight teeth or crowns that may have an edge near the gum line, the floss may get caught and might break.  I suppose they are made for a one-time use; but if you are careful, you may yet several uses out of each one.  The set includes 4 packs of heads with 7 in each pack; probably intended to last you one month.  Just be ready to order more before they run out.  I have very arthritic hands and using normal floss became impossible for me; this solved the problem.  I won&#x27;t be going back to regular flossing.</li>
            <li> Great for reaching all those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Great product - have been using this flosser for years.  Best product I&#x27;ve found to ease daily flossing.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I needed to assist me with regular flossing.  Middle-aged now, the old-fashioned way (holding &amp;#34;string&amp;#34; around the fingers) just doesn&#x27;t do the job, isn&#x27;t productive, and most folks just give up and say &amp;#34;forgeddaboutit.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, with the Reach Access Flosser, there are no more excuses because this device makes it so easy to floss and reach all those hard-to-reach places!  1,000 times better than its competitor (DenTek), whose similar device doesn&#x27;t work well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the DenTek device, the floss piece attached to the Reach device does NOT come off, doesn&#x27;t get stuck in the teeth; I haven&#x27;t had one single problem with it and have been using for over a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more DenTek for me.  Reach Access will be what I use in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this.  Had a hard time flossing those rear molars all my life. This tool makes it easy to reach those hard to reach spots.  This is the greatest invention since the wheel.</li>
            <li> Makes flossing easy... went from dreading flossing to a daily flosser.</li>
            <li> I love the Reach Access.  I have a &#x27;thing&#x27; about putting my hands in my mouth (yeah- I know it is strange)!  The handle make it easy to guide as well as the small head.  I recommend!</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended. It is supposed to be better than flossing for in between plaque. I have to get used to it. Still prefer regular flossing but my teenage boys love it so maybe its better if you have big hands and its hard to floss in the back of your mouth. Otherwise I feel its ok.</li>
            <li> Makes flossing a breeze. Try them.</li>
            <li> Its the best you can buy.  Easiest to use.  Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    </ol>
