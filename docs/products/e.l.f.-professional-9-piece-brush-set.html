    <ol>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>Great for makeup beginners!</li>
            <li>excellent article</li>
            <li>Is The Best Part.</li>
            <li>Not the best brushes ever, but content with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Flawless application, and the case the brushes come in is awesome too!  </li>
            <li>great experience</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>Product arrived in immaculate packaging; no shedding of brushes, very smooth, will be very good to start a makeup collection with.</li>
            <li>I was searching for this kind of brush case, and the case is great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for blending but not applying.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>LOVE these brushes!  </li>
            <li>Another AWESOME feature about these is that they are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Good that it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
            <li>But the brush roll (holds brushes) was really nice.</li>
            <li>I love the bag that the brushes came in</li>
            <li>Of course, I was able to fix this with two applications of Gorilla Glue.</li>
            <li>) it is soooo much better, and softer.</li>
            <li>Great gift for my 10 year old daughter who like to play makeup....</li>
            <li>The brushes are great for a beginning makeup wearer and a fairly nice back up brush while washing my higher end brushes.</li>
            <li>There are nice, large, zippered pockets on each side to store your cosmetics when you are traveling.  </li>
            <li>I threw away all but three of the brushes, but my brushes fit in the case, plus my mascara.  </li>
            <li>(If you use a fat tube of mascara, it probably won&#x27;t fit.)  </li>
            <li>They Feel Cheap.</li>
            <li>Not sure how good the quality of the brushes are, but my 16-yr-old niece loved it as part of her b-day gift.</li>
            <li>these are cosmetic brushes, they were new, in perfect shape, enough said.</li>
            <li>, I arrive as expected and good quality, I leave satisfied.</li>
            <li>Other than the fact that the price of this is insanely cheap, the quality is great and you are basically set for life if you buy this</li>
            <li>Overall a good value.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described! ...</li>
            <li>Nice low end brushes.</li>
            <li>the brushes are worth what they cost.</li>
            <li>Just use some soap and the debris comes right off.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the picture shown.</li>
            <li>WRONG they do get the job done perfect!</li>
            <li>(first set was for a friend-</li>
            <li>There was a strong smell of fresh paint odor when opening the package, but no big deal</li>
            <li>and I just wish I&#x27;d spent a little more money to buy something good.</li>
            <li>The case the brushes come in is large and includes two side pockets.</li>
            <li>Expect the size of these to be relatively large.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.....</li>
            <li>Finally I threw it at the trash can in a fit of rage one day and purchased a replacement from Target.</li>
            <li>Brushes Are Very Flimsy.</li>
            <li>Really like the smudge tool and the foundation and face brushes though.</li>
            <li>i would recommend these to a person who doesn&#x27;t care about high quality brushes, someone who is basically looking for cheep brushes...</li>
            <li>and I like the brushes except that they lose some strands a little more than I would like</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice in quality, the only complaint I have is that the very first use of the foundation brush (at the lightest of touches) broke.</li>
            <li>If you are an adult who actually wants to apply makeup I would suggest you look elsewhere for brushes.</li>
            <li>It was ok except for the contour brush and all round face brush</li>
            <li>The handles are pretty gross looking too.</li>
            <li>I would only recommend purchasing these brushes if they are intended for a child or tween who wants to play with makeup.</li>
            <li>The only reason it cost so much is because they are selling you a case for it.</li>
            <li>These brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li>The reason for the 3 stars is that the eye shadow brush is too soft.</li>
            <li>The angel brush is too soft for eyebrows.</li>
            <li>arrived early than expected and they are so soft!</li>

            <li> I LOVE IT! They came in a big pouch that had two pockets on each side. There were no shedding whatsoever. It looks exactly like the picture shown.

Finally I threw it at the trash can in a fit of rage one day and purchased a replacement from Target. The rest of the brushes are passable and vary in their quality. I am still using those for the time being, but I haven&#x27;t even had these for a year and I just wish I&#x27;d spent a little more money to buy something good.
