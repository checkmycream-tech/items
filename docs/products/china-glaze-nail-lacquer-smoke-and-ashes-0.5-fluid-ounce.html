            <li>It looked great, like embers and flames.</li>
            <li>The color is great.</li>
            <li>a beautiful gorgeous color&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li>Nice color!</li>
            <li>I really liked this color!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice that it turned out to be a quality polish (not chips and goes on great).</li>
            <li>I loved the color.</li>
            <li>and I am happy to say I will be purchasing more.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this color!</li>
            <li>I bought this polish the day it came out, and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It was very nice and clean!</li>
            <li>But Smoke and Ashes looks really great in the sun light.</li>
            <li>and I have a feeling it will look amazing when I wear it.</li>
            <li>The packaging was amazing, and I would order again</li>
            <li>Loving this brand.</li>
            <li>Its great as a full manicure color or just an accent nail or even to decorate a nail or two with a design.</li>
            <li>One coating looks amazing, but two is even better.</li>
            <li>I shall definitely enjoy it being in my collection and use it fairly often, so it still rates a 4 in spite of the picture being somewhat deceiving.</li>
            <li>Riveting surprising doesn&#x27;t chip quickly and when I wore it</li>
            <li>I love the color and how well it covers.</li>
            <li>This nail polish is one of my many favs from China</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>Well, China Glaze doesn&#x27;t disappoint :)</li>
            <li>It is a very interesting and cool color.</li>
            <li>Smoke and Ashes is my all-time favorite nail color.</li>
            <li>The color is fantastic!</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite polishes from the Hunger Games collection.</li>
            <li>It arrived on the monday after Easter, and I honestly love it. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s multidimensional and is so unique!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite things about this color is that it&#x27;s easy to remove.</li>
            <li>And the quality is really good also it goes on really well</li>
            <li>I mostly bought this because it looked awesome with it&#x27;s smokey black glitter</li>
            <li>but it actually went on beautifully.</li>
            <li>but if you put a cotton swab over it with remover quickly the paint lightens and more glitter shows through</li>
            <li>China Glaze in general is a very nice quality brand of nail polish and this did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>The color has a blue tint to it and looks great in the sun.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and stays on.</li>
            <li>And when light hits it, the sparkles look blue-green.</li>
            <li>I bought this the minute I saw it, the color is gorgeous and looks great especially when outside in the sunlight.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s kinda cool.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this nail color...</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love it so much</li>
            <li>Beautiful black polish.</li>
            <li>will definitely order more. :)</li>
            <li>I currently have Smoke &amp; Ashes, Fast Track, and Riveting, and I absolutely LOVE them!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and if your a Hunger Games fan you will really love it because you can see why it&#x27;s named after District 12 once you put it on.</li>
            <li>pretty with the light hitting the color</li>
            <li>We bought this last week and love it!  </li>
            <li>oh my goodness, it was so pretty!</li>
            <li>Fast Track is my favorite, I just love the way the gold flecks sparkle in the sun and the back color seems to blend into my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Other reviews have recommended not using a quick dry top coat as that affects the glitter; even doing this the glitter does not stand out greatly.</li>
            <li>had the glitter been more apparent.</li>
            <li>This is a nice, rich, sort of sparkly black.</li>
            <li>I bought Electrify and Smoke and ashes, and my favorite is definitely Electrify.</li>
            <li>This is a really pretty polish.</li>
            <li>I wear it a lot than I should, haha!</li>
            <li>Fast shipment!</li>
            <li>The color looks pretty in the bottle</li>
            <li>From the product picture I was expecting the micro glitter to show up a wee bit more when on my nails, plus be a different color.</li>
            <li>This is a first time purchase of China Glaze</li>
            <li>When not in the sunlight it pretty much looks black, but it is lovely in the right light.</li>
            <li>Goes on SUPER smooth and one coat might even be considered opaque on short nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has great color and a subtle sparkle.</li>
            <li>It looked really bright in the bottle, but on my fingers it seemed pretty toned down next to my light tan skin, which made me enjoy wearing such a daring color.</li>
            <li>It looks very vibrant.</li>
            <li>A beautiful color, but not in the deep green family.</li>
            <li>This color is a great alternative to just traditional black and dresses up any outfit.</li>
            <li>The color inside isn&#x27;t too great, a few flecks of sparkle here and there, but outside,</li>
            <li>so you cant really see the glitter</li>
            <li>More of a shimmering black.</li>
            <li>I got it mainly because it was from the Hunger Games collection</li>
            <li>The actual pieces of glitter are also tiny, so it comes off as more of a metallic than a glitter based color.</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish, It dried fast, and lasted awhile.</li>
            <li>There is just a hint of GREEN sparkle when the light hits it just right, NOT the silvery-gray-purpley that the picture shows.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too dark for daily wear (probably because I&#x27;m so pale, also), but perfect for a night out!</li>
            <li>It is such a pretty color!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very dark color, but when the light hits the glitter it really brightens it up!</li>
            <li>Overall, I did enjoy the nail polish, but next time I&#x27;ll purchase a lighter color.</li>
            <li>While I like the polish well enough, I wish that the glitter would have been a bit larger as it is barely noticeable unless in direct light.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve worn my colors sooo much already, I&#x27;m currently waiting for Luxe &amp; Lush to come in!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to get this nail polish at my local beauty store, but they were completely out.</li>
            <li>This is not green in any way.</li>
            <li>I used China Glaze Luxe and Lush over it to create a Hunger Games nail for Halloween.</li>
            <li>Its has nice little bits of sparkly, green and blue glass in it.</li>
            <li>it is pretty dark</li>
            <li>I love wearing it with some distressed jeans and t shirt during the day, or a little black dress at night.</li>
            <li>It is pretty to look at, and who doesn&#x27;t like a black with a wee hint of some sparkle, it&#x27;s just not quite what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also very subtle so most of the time</li>
            <li>Smoke &amp; Ashes I was at first iffy about, I&#x27;m not big on painting black on my nails myself</li>
            <li>Little flecks of silver and blue shimmering about on my nails kept gaining my attention the whole time I wore it.</li>

            <li> It is such a pretty color!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very dark color, but when the light hits the glitter it really brightens it up!</li>
            <li> Overall, I did enjoy the nail polish, but next time I&#x27;ll purchase a lighter color.</li>
            <li> While I like the polish well enough, I wish that the glitter would have been a bit larger as it is barely noticeable unless in direct light.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve worn my colors sooo much already, I&#x27;m currently waiting for Luxe &amp; Lush to come in!</li>

            <li> This is not green in any way.</li>
            <li> I used China Glaze Luxe and Lush over it to create a Hunger Games nail for Halloween.</li>
            <li> Its has nice little bits of sparkly, green and blue glass in it.</li>
            <li> it is pretty dark</li>
            <li> I love wearing it with some distressed jeans and t shirt during the day, or a little black dress at night.</li>
            <li> It is pretty to look at, and who doesn&#x27;t like a black with a wee hint of some sparkle, it&#x27;s just not quite what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also very subtle so most of the time</li>
            <li> Smoke &amp; Ashes I was at first iffy about, I&#x27;m not big on painting black on my nails myself</li>
            <li> Little flecks of silver and blue shimmering about on my nails kept gaining my attention the whole time I wore it.</li>
            <li> I found the color Smoke and Ashes a little bit dark for my taste, but very pretty.</li>
            <li> From far away, it looks like a glossy black, but when you get closer you can see the blue sparkles.</li>
            <li> The color shown looks like a deep green.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of dark polishes, and this one had the added bonus of having green glitter in it.</li>
            <li> It almost has a green sparkle tint to it, making it not as harsh a solid color as black.</li>
            <li> For me, who has never been into dark polishes, this was the changer.</li>
            <li> I am just not so fond of black nail polish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not just your typical black go-to.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d never owned a black nail polish.</li>
            <li> it just looks like I&#x27;m wearing black nail polish...</li>
            <li> The color is either black or very very dark green with lighter silvery/green sparkles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me a little while to figure out what the color reminded me of</li>
            <li> What knocks this down a few stars is what an unbelievable pain it is to take it off; the little glitters get all over my fingers.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this polish, but the sparkles didn&#x27;t show up, it was too dark in a bad way (this is coming from a goth who dresses in dark colors all the time), it just looked &amp;#34;dull&amp;#34; and sort of &amp;#34;dirty,&amp;#34; it also didn&#x27;t make it through a day without chipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already got quite a few compliments.</li>
            <li> but when I put it on the flecks are green NOT silvery like in the picture.</li>
            <li> the glitter is a little hard to get off.</li>
            <li> A very Dark Color with sparkle!</li>
            <li> The green glitter of this polish is subtle.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a black base with tiny bluish green glitter in it.</li>
            <li> The nail polish is a black base with a green sparkle to it, which is a little difficult to see from the picture.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The color shown looks like a deep green. This is not green in any way. More of a shimmering black. A beautiful color, but not in the deep green family.</li>
            <li> I bought Electrify and Smoke and ashes, and my favorite is definitely Electrify. It looks very vibrant. But Smoke and Ashes looks really great in the sun light. I am just not so fond of black nail polish.</li>
            <li> I bought this the minute I saw it, the color is gorgeous and looks great especially when outside in the sunlight. I&#x27;ve already got quite a few compliments. And the quality is really good also it goes on really well I highly recommend this and if your a Hunger Games fan you will really love it because you can see why it&#x27;s named after District 12 once you put it on.</li>
            <li> We bought this last week and love it!  The color has a blue tint to it and looks great in the sun.  Since we HAD to have the District 12 color... it&#x27;s nice that it turned out to be a quality polish (not chips and goes on great).</li>
            <li> This is a really pretty polish. I love the color and how well it covers. China Glaze makes wonderful polishes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color! It&#x27;s a very dark color, but when the light hits the glitter it really brightens it up! A must buy, especially for Hunger Games fans!</li>
            <li> The color is either black or very very dark green with lighter silvery/green sparkles. For me it took two coats to get the opacity I wanted. When not in the sunlight it pretty much looks black, but it is lovely in the right light. What knocks this down a few stars is what an unbelievable pain it is to take it off; the little glitters get all over my fingers. Still, it&#x27;s kinda cool.</li>
            <li> I bought this polish the day it came out, and I love it! It was an awesome buy... I wear it all the time! The color looks great and it looks just like District 12! I recommend this product for every Hunger Games fan!!!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to get this nail polish at my local beauty store, but they were completely out. And I now know why. This color is so awesome! It&#x27;s multidimensional and is so unique! There are teals, greens, navy blues, blacks and even sparkles. This color is a great alternative to just traditional black and dresses up any outfit. One of my favorite things about this color is that it&#x27;s easy to remove. A lot of times I find that colors with sparkles in them take forever to get all of it off, but with the color, the color and sparkles came off with just polish! Definitely a recommend!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is one of my many favs from China Glaze.&lt;br /&gt;The price is AWESOME too.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely order more. :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this nail polish. It&#x27;s not just your typical black go-to. It almost has a green sparkle tint to it, making it not as harsh a solid color as black. It goes with anything. Daytime or night. I love wearing it with some distressed jeans and t shirt during the day, or a little black dress at night. One coating looks amazing, but two is even better.</li>
            <li> Great polish but the glitter is a little hard to get off. I wear it a lot than I should, haha!</li>
            <li> The color was what I was expecting and it was just so me. You know how you think the color is going to be perfect but it just isn&#x27;t? Well, China Glaze doesn&#x27;t disappoint :)</li>
            <li> This is a nice, rich, sort of sparkly black. I got it mainly because it was from the Hunger Games collection and I&#x27;d never owned a black nail polish. Its great as a full manicure color or just an accent nail or even to decorate a nail or two with a design. Its has nice little bits of sparkly, green and blue glass in it. Nice color!</li>
            <li> Fast shipment! Purchased the ash color and it&#x27;s a black base with tiny bluish green glitter in it. Beautiful black polish.</li>
            <li> The nail polish is a black base with a green sparkle to it, which is a little difficult to see from the picture. It is a very interesting and cool color. China Glaze in general is a very nice quality brand of nail polish and this did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this polish, but the sparkles didn&#x27;t show up, it was too dark in a bad way (this is coming from a goth who dresses in dark colors all the time), it just looked &amp;#34;dull&amp;#34; and sort of &amp;#34;dirty,&amp;#34; it also didn&#x27;t make it through a day without chipping.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it reminded me of diamonds in coal. Great for district 12. but when I put it on the flecks are green NOT silvery like in the picture. They&#x27;re also very subtle so most of the time it just looks like I&#x27;m wearing black nail polish...I really wanted to love this nail color...but it looks like it&#x27;s going to be put in the halloween box.</li>
            <li> I currently have Smoke &amp; Ashes, Fast Track, and Riveting, and I absolutely LOVE them! Fast Track is my favorite, I just love the way the gold flecks sparkle in the sun and the back color seems to blend into my skin tone. Riveting surprising doesn&#x27;t chip quickly and when I wore it I got a lot of compliments. It looked really bright in the bottle, but on my fingers it seemed pretty toned down next to my light tan skin, which made me enjoy wearing such a daring color. Smoke &amp; Ashes I was at first iffy about, I&#x27;m not big on painting black on my nails myself but it actually went on beautifully. The color inside isn&#x27;t too great, a few flecks of sparkle here and there, but outside, oh my goodness, it was so pretty! Little flecks of silver and blue shimmering about on my nails kept gaining my attention the whole time I wore it. Since I&#x27;ve worn my colors sooo much already, I&#x27;m currently waiting for Luxe &amp; Lush to come in! The color looks pretty in the bottle and I have a feeling it will look amazing when I wear it. Can&#x27;t wait to get it!</li>
            <li> Smoke and Ashes is my all-time favorite nail color. Goes on SUPER smooth and one coat might even be considered opaque on short nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me a little while to figure out what the color reminded me of and I finally figured it out! If you eat sushi then you&#x27;ll understand: it looks JUST like the seaweed wraps! Back with tiny blue/green speckles. Love it!</li>
            <li> I wanted a black/green colour and found this gem.  I wear this colour all the time, especially in summer so the sun reflects off the glitter.  Goes on smooth and stays on.</li>
            <li> a beautiful gorgeous color&lt;br /&gt;its like some one pored the galaxy into the polish bottle&lt;br /&gt;i love it so much</li>
            <li> This is an amazing color&lt;br /&gt;Looks very attractive on your nails</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of dark polishes, and this one had the added bonus of having green glitter in it. While I like the polish well enough, I wish that the glitter would have been a bit larger as it is barely noticeable unless in direct light. The actual pieces of glitter are also tiny, so it comes off as more of a metallic than a glitter based color.</li>
            <li> A very Dark Color with sparkle! I like this color a lot and seems to last. I am a china glaze fan of all the colors they create and the hunger games collection has some great colors, including this one!</li>
            <li> I really liked this color! it is pretty dark so you cant really see the glitter but if you put a cotton swab over it with remover quickly the paint lightens and more glitter shows through</li>
            <li> From the product picture I was expecting the micro glitter to show up a wee bit more when on my nails, plus be a different color. There is just a hint of GREEN sparkle when the light hits it just right, NOT the silvery-gray-purpley that the picture shows. It is pretty to look at, and who doesn&#x27;t like a black with a wee hint of some sparkle, it&#x27;s just not quite what I was hoping for. I shall definitely enjoy it being in my collection and use it fairly often, so it still rates a 4 in spite of the picture being somewhat deceiving.</li>
            <li> I currently have Smoke and Ashes. It is such a pretty color! From far away, it looks like a glossy black, but when you get closer you can see the blue sparkles. And when light hits it, the sparkles look blue-green. The color is fantastic!</li>
            <li> The green glitter of this polish is subtle. I would have rated it 5 had the glitter been more apparent. Other reviews have recommended not using a quick dry top coat as that affects the glitter; even doing this the glitter does not stand out greatly. I used China Glaze Luxe and Lush over it to create a Hunger Games nail for Halloween. It looked great, like embers and flames.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite polishes from the Hunger Games collection. It has great color and a subtle sparkle.</li>
            <li> I mostly bought this because it looked awesome with it&#x27;s smokey black glitter and because it was created with the Hunger Games in mind. It&#x27;s too dark for daily wear (probably because I&#x27;m so pale, also), but perfect for a night out!</li>
            <li> This is a first time purchase of China Glaze and I am happy to say I will be purchasing more.  Goes on beautifully!  Granddaughter loved it too!!</li>
            <li> It arrived on the monday after Easter, and I honestly love it. :)&lt;br /&gt;Its pretty with the light hitting the color and the glitter reflects with the blues and greens. The packaging was amazing, and I would order again</li>
            <li> I found the color Smoke and Ashes a little bit dark for my taste, but very pretty. It almost looks goth, and it wasn&#x27;t as sparkly as I thought it would be. Overall, I did enjoy the nail polish, but next time I&#x27;ll purchase a lighter color.</li>
            <li> Loving this brand. The color is great. For me, who has never been into dark polishes, this was the changer. Looking forward to completing The Hunger Games set!</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish, It dried fast, and lasted awhile. My family and friends always comment on how beautiful the color is.</li>
            <li> I loved the color. It was very nice and clean! May the odds ever be in your favor!! THE HUNGER GAMES!</li>
