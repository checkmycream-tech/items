            <li>Feels good, smells good, looks good.  </li>
            <li>I bought this raspberry lip glaze after being very satisfied with the rosehip lip glaze.  </li>
            <li>love this!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Feels silky smooth!!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>great color, smooth, moist, and non toxic for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like when you eat a lot of cherries and your mouth and tongue are stained.</li>
            <li>Nice if you like darker tinted lip gloss.</li>
            <li>Best natural lip stuff ever!!</li>
            <li>Great moisture, lacking on the color, felt great but looked like clear lip gloss.</li>
            <li>but you get more product.</li>
            <li>What more is there to say?</li>
            <li>Make sure lips are well moisturized before applying</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality of the product is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I am planning to buy more:  </li>
            <li>more colors for me and more of this one as Xmas presents for my girlfriends.  </li>
            <li>I like the safe feeling of healthy cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Nice colour and rich texture</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that as this kind of natural resource cosmetic product becomes more popular it will also become more sophisticated.</li>
            <li>But, on a daily basis, I am using this more just because I feel safe and happy that it is made with fruit dyes.</li>
            <li>It is very translucent and needs to be reapplied fairly often in order to maintain it&#x27;s shine and</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, has a nice color and has ingredients that one is not afraid to apply to lips.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly but its more of a gloss which is fine for me since I prefer light color on my lips.</li>
            <li>But as I&#x27;m wearing it I think the color actually looks very nice and doesn&#x27;t stand out to much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After giving up on lipsticks, I was glad I gave it another try with 100% Pure!</li>
            <li>This is a good product if you want sheer colour and no sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>Also beware that you will use this lip gloss up rather quickly, as it seems to melt away so often you have to keep re applying it.</li>
            <li>The case itself is beautiful and expensive looking, nice detailing on it.</li>
            <li>It smells nice the color is deep</li>
            <li>They use some sort of super shrink wrap, that at first I can&#x27;t even see that it is shrink-wrapped.  </li>
            <li>So happy my teen loves it too and doesn&#x27;t put a bunch of gross chemicals on her mouth.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a sheer, pinkish berry colored lip glaze, then this may be right for you; however, I was hoping the coverage and durability would be more substantial - like the rosehip lip</li>
            <li>One&#x27;s mouth is the entrance to one&#x27;s body and very intimate in terms of health and, truly, in every sense.</li>
            <li>Depending on how much color you want on your lips, you can either apply a little or more, to get more color.</li>
            <li>The case is pretty.</li>
            <li>If you put extra on you can acheive better results.</li>
            <li>This is not lipstick but more of a gloss, so it doesn&#x27;t fade away after short time I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li>Since I needed a dye/preservative free product, I have since found a local health food store that carries the same kind of items but without the hefty shipping charges added on.</li>
            <li>So many lipsticks dry out my lips and make them peel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain I will not use another lip product again.</li>
            <li>I really like 100% pure.</li>
            <li>The color is just a little bit bright, for which I almost gave it just 4 stars because I would like it even better if the color was a little darker.  </li>
            <li>Such a pretty color!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural so it feels better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This little lipstick is the first I&#x27;ve had that I felt free to apply with abandon.</li>
            <li>Always having trouble with lipsticks burning, I was thrilled to have finally found one that gave me no problem.</li>
            <li>Very natural color.</li>
            <li>Its not a full rich color lipstick.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s all natural...</li>
            <li>This product did not irritate my extremely sensitive lips.  </li>
            <li>I wish it were a little more moist and glossy because my lips are on the dry side.</li>
            <li>All together not really a bad product but still not worth what they&#x27;re asking!</li>
            <li>I was all excited about using a natural product, but there is very little color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay if you want to use it over some other lipstick, just not as the only thing unless you really want a slightly tinted sheer look.  </li>

            <li> There is a less generous amount of lipstick than with traditional lipstick/lip gloss.</li>

            <li> Not very pigment heavy.</li>
            <li> i just add a little fill in with a lip liner.  </li>
            <li> It is a little too pinky.</li>
            <li> It is on the delicate side.</li>
            <li> I might have given it an extra star, but the packaging was impossible.  </li>
            <li> I have used and like Clinique&#x27;s Black Honey, which is expensive</li>
            <li> (Seriously, I can only use one type of chapstick or I get a horrible reaction...)  </li>
            <li> The color, unfortunately, does not work for me.  </li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> Or they look terrible or they smell and taste awful.  </li>
            <li> Who needs all the petroleum and nasty chemicals you find in all the department stores!</li>

            <li> I was all excited about using a natural product, but there is very little color and it doesn&#x27;t stay.  I might have given it an extra star, but the packaging was impossible.  They use some sort of super shrink wrap, that at first I can&#x27;t even see that it is shrink-wrapped.  I finally stabbed it with a knife a few times to get it open.  I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this, and for an inexpensive lipstick?  I think I will go back to MAC and Clinique.</li>
            <li> I bought this raspberry lip glaze after being very satisfied with the rosehip lip glaze.  Unfortunately, I was not as satisfied with the raspberry.  It is very translucent and needs to be reapplied fairly often in order to maintain it&#x27;s shine and coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a sheer, pinkish berry colored lip glaze, then this may be right for you; however, I was hoping the coverage and durability would be more substantial - like the rosehip lip glaze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the up side - it does smell nice and fruity!</li>

            <li> love this! great color, smooth, moist, and non toxic for me.</li>
            <li> Yumm! Best natural lip stuff ever!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Pleasant to know that you don&#x27;t have a chemicals in your lips. Very natural color. Would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great moisture, lacking on the color, felt great but looked like clear lip gloss. Smells wonderful</li>

            <li> I really like 100% pure. As a vegetarian I wanted to get away from animal ingredient  in by makeup. The color is amazing and feel so happy it&#x27;s made from fruits/veggies.</li>
            <li> Good product. Definitely a glaze, though. Not very pigment heavy.</li>
            <li> Its good. Its not a full rich color lipstick. If you put extra on you can acheive better results. Nice if you like darker tinted lip gloss. This works well for me.</li>
            <li> Feels good, smells good, looks good.  And it&#x27;s all natural... yay!</li>
            <li> Nice colour and rich texture</li>
            <li> Always having trouble with lipsticks burning, I was thrilled to have finally found one that gave me no problem.

            <li> Make sure lips are well moisturized before applying</li>
            <li> Smells Awesome!!  Feels silky smooth!!  Such a pretty color!!  Semi-sheer and when i want it deeper i just add a little fill in with a lip liner.  So happy my teen loves it too and doesn&#x27;t put a bunch of gross chemicals on her mouth.</li>

It doesn&#x27;t go on thick like some lipsticks and makes my lips feel very moisturized.  However, I can feel that it stays well and doesn&#x27;t just rub off immediately like some moisturizing lip colors.</li>
            <li> So many lipsticks dry out my lips and make them peel.  Or they look terrible or they smell and taste awful.  This one looks great, feels great, moisturizes well.  I am planning to buy more:  more colors for me and more of this one as Xmas presents for my girlfriends.  Who needs all the petroleum and nasty chemicals you find in all the department stores!</li>
            <li> I love it! Smells good. Tastes good. Looks good. I like the safe feeling of healthy cosmetics.</li>
