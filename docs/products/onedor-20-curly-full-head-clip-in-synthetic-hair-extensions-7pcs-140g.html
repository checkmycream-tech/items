            <li>I love this it has really nice curls</li>
            <li>These extensions are so beautiful and very affordable.</li>
            <li>Im buying more</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to order more.  </li>
            <li>and it looks real it also clips in very securely great for the price and shipping</li>
            <li>I will happily buy new ones if needed at this price once a month and still save HUGE!</li>
            <li>Cute for one time use..gets tangled easy.</li>
            <li>I love them they are well worth the money ..</li>
            <li>This is a great brown blonde mix and one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>Perfect color, fast shipment, and definitely a quality product.</li>
            <li>They are heat resistant, but make sure to put your hot tools on a very fairly LOW setting, I straightened them and they came out great.</li>
            <li>They are cool and fun!</li>
            <li>Granted you cannot use the heating styling elements you would be able to with real</li>
            <li>Love it and the shipping was fast</li>
            <li>This brand does tend to tangle and it needs more tender loving care, and very gentle brushing with the occasional clipping of ends, but overall, the clips are good and mostly sturdy, the color isn&#x27;t too shiny, and it is an extremely affordable option for hair extensions.</li>
            <li>Do not look real, very shiny and plastic-looking.</li>
            <li>Came earlier that expected, was as described, very happy.</li>
            <li>once I master putting them in correctly I was have ALOT of fun with these</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t send it back because it was more to return it than to keep it</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just the lighting in the photo, but what I got had a much higher contrast that what&#x27;s pictured.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>They look and feel like REAL hair!</li>
            <li>I have purchased real hair in this quality before for $300 and it lasted maybe 6 months!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m torn on how to review this, because other than the color, it&#x27;s pretty amazing for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have spent 100$ plus on real hair and these are soooo much better!  </li>
            <li>hair is silky, shiny, and not fake looking unless you&#x27;re looking very closely.</li>
            <li>I never leave a review because usually the other reviewers have already said it for me, HOWEVER, I just HAVE to rant and rave about how awesome these extensions are!!</li>
            <li>i want to match my real hair up with this color as close as it can be</li>
            <li>I like them but the color is not what I was expecting and the pieces are not blended very well</li>
            <li>I got them after I cut way too much off my hair</li>
            <li>I really like them and</li>
            <li>was fast.</li>
            <li>When my hair grows back long I think they will work great to give me a highlight look with different styles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for a costume, but DEFINITELY not for regular wear.</li>
            <li>You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>each piece is bits of brown and blonde some more of one or the other.</li>
            <li>Those with less hair may be able to use only one set.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, as far as quality for the price, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>They look so natural...</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend brushing it -- it sheds unless you&#x27;re careful, but gently detangling it with a comb should work.</li>

            <li> The blonde highlights are pretty much platinum, and the base color is much darker than it looks in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just ordered 2 sets of these and they are pretty decent quality for synthetic hair, a little on the thin side though, and shiny but overall</li>
            <li> I use them to do my long side braid.</li>
            <li> They are really long</li>
            <li> A mix up with shipping was frustrating but the situation was handled really well thou.</li>
            <li> Just be careful it gets frizzy if you brush through it.</li>
            <li> so i bought again in black ...</li>
            <li> so I gave it to my little niece to play  with.</li>
            <li> There is a little shine, but that is not a problem.  </li>
            <li> so i cut mine a little</li>
            <li> But the color is misleading, and the color combination is a harsh, fake-looking contrast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy synthetic</li>
            <li> The clips are hard to work with but still doable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sen worse when it comes to synthetic hair..</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s okay for a costume, but DEFINITELY not for regular wear.</li>
            <li> Do not look real, very shiny and plastic-looking. I don&#x27;t usually buy synthetic but I needed them for an event, now I&#x27;m kicking myself.</li>
            <li> i just ordered this and i was wondering about the color,  i want to match my real hair up with this color as close as it can be i just think its beautiful cant wait until i get it in the mail thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I like them but the color is not what I was expecting and the pieces are not blended very well each piece is bits of brown and blonde some more of one or the other. I got them after I cut way too much off my hair so I could have some length back but it&#x27;s not working like I was hoping. When my hair grows back long I think they will work great to give me a highlight look with different styles.</li>
            <li> Came earlier that expected, was as described, very happy.</li>
            <li> This was way off from the picture. I didn&#x27;t send it back because it was more to return it than to keep it so I gave it to my little niece to play  with.</li>
            <li> These extensions are so beautiful and very affordable. They match my hair perfectly! I just ordered two more sets!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m torn on how to review this, because other than the color, it&#x27;s pretty amazing for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair is silky, shiny, and not fake looking unless you&#x27;re looking very closely. The clips stay in even in my super-fine, super-slippery hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend brushing it -- it sheds unless you&#x27;re careful, but gently detangling it with a comb should work. Remember, these are $10 extensions. If the color matched what was pictured, I&#x27;d be ecstatic with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the 27/613 color. Maybe it&#x27;s just the lighting in the photo, but what I got had a much higher contrast that what&#x27;s pictured. The blonde highlights are pretty much platinum, and the base color is much darker than it looks in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as far as quality for the price, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars. But the color is misleading, and the color combination is a harsh, fake-looking contrast.</li>
            <li> I just ordered 2 sets of these and they are pretty decent quality for synthetic hair, a little on the thin side though, and shiny but overall I&#x27;ve sen worse when it comes to synthetic hair.. so that is why I would recommend buying two sets. They are heat resistant, but make sure to put your hot tools on a very fairly LOW setting, I straightened them and they came out great.</li>
            <li> I cut thes to my length and used them to add body. They are cool and fun!</li>
            <li> Great curls got many compliments!!</li>
            <li> If this was curly hair,  then you need glasses!  I only kept because I did not know how to return . Gave it to my niece to put on her doll.</li>
            <li> I love them they are well worth the money ..I paid 3$0+75 for hair that didn&#x27;t look or feel as good as these...Im buying more</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like this nice hair.</li>
            <li> The hair is very nice. I love it. A mix up with shipping was frustrating but the situation was handled really well thou.</li>
            <li> I love this extensions !! They look so natural...i bought before in brown color about 6 months ago and they are still in good condition..now changed my hair color so i bought again in black ...i can put heat on them..these extensions are so great!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome for synthetic! Just be careful it gets frizzy if you brush through it. Hair feels real and looks great!!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this product.  The color matched my hair perfectly.  There is a little shine, but that is not a problem.  You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth.  I would recommend this. The clips are hard to work with but still doable.</li>
            <li> These extenssions are awesome👍 i have got so many compliments that my hair is beautiful. I use them to do my long side braid. However i wouldnt recommend trying to straighted them or curl them because it does not work. They are really long so i cut mine a little</li>
            <li> These are absolutely beautiful. Perfect color, fast shipment, and definitely a quality product. I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> I am still getting use to these. I really like them and once I master putting them in correctly I was have ALOT of fun with these</li>
            <li> This is a great brown blonde mix and one of my favorites. This brand does tend to tangle and it needs more tender loving care, and very gentle brushing with the occasional clipping of ends, but overall, the clips are good and mostly sturdy, the color isn&#x27;t too shiny, and it is an extremely affordable option for hair extensions. I need to use two sets for my hair. Those with less hair may be able to use only one set.</li>
            <li> I love these!  I have spent 100$ plus on real hair and these are soooo much better!  I can&#x27;t wait to order more.  The color is a beautiful mix of blondes.  Amazing deal!</li>
            <li> I love this it has really nice curls and it looks real it also clips in very securely great for the price and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I never leave a review because usually the other reviewers have already said it for me, HOWEVER, I just HAVE to rant and rave about how awesome these extensions are!! They look and feel like REAL hair! Granted you cannot use the heating styling elements you would be able to with real but this is for 1/20th of the price! I have purchased real hair in this quality before for $300 and it lasted maybe 6 months! I will happily buy new ones if needed at this price once a month and still save HUGE! A++</li>
            <li> Love it and the shipping was fast</li>
