            <li>Gift for someone, looks perfect and natural.</li>
            <li>Awesome I got two extensions and they were straight and smooth and unknotted</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>I got it for my younger sister for her 14th birthday and it blends in with her hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok if you don&#x27;t wear it all the time.</li>
            <li>This product may be okay for Halloween, but it comes folded and the creases don&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li>I purchased two and trimmed them to the length I need but will be getting more so that I have longer ones as my hair grows out.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This is synthetic hair so it won&#x27;t be able to curl.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a better quality extension then the ones I was used to seeing.  </li>
            <li>I chose 4 stars because I loved the product, it was the perfect shade of blue, it feels real.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and place in my hair.</li>
            <li>Hair clip is a cheap hair clip and not a claw clip.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, it doesn&#x27;t fall off and it blends well with the real hair.</li>
            <li>Helps them look great for a long time.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get these</li>
            <li>The quality of this really surprised me, now I want more!</li>
            <li>Color true to picture.</li>
            <li>I love them and wear them daily and the company is prompt and so very friendly</li>
            <li>To be honest it&#x27;s not blue.</li>
            <li>The hair is nice and soft and blends well with my hair (since my hair is straight).</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>Very real feel to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very long which is great because my hair is super long...</li>
            <li>They are really pretty and exactly what is shown.</li>
            <li>;P  Just for fun, but you could wear it whenever really...</li>
            <li>glad I only bought</li>
            <li>The color is pretty.</li>
            <li>Fun for hight school rally spirit , and anything really ...</li>
            <li>I love putting these in my hair for extra spice of color.</li>
            <li>Cute, long, arrived as advertised.</li>
            <li>They are super long, which is great, I just wish they were a little thicker.</li>
            <li>This came in the mail super early.</li>
            <li>Clips are secure and strong and have that little no-slip strip inside</li>
            <li>Nice color saturation of a cobalt blue, not too dark, not too light,</li>
            <li>Cant beat the price, doesn&#x27;t look as real as it does in the photo</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have naturally straight hair so for me to use these I have to straighten all of my hair.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Got a picture of him below with another buddy of mine, but check out how real that looks.</li>
            <li>I wear it about every other weak and stuff it in a drawer with a bunch of other stuff, so I doesn&#x27;t really get good care, but it still looks good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more colors in the future.</li>
            <li>The clip is a little wired since unlike most hair clips you see, that have one side that opens, this one is connected at both ends.</li>
            <li>and I got it 2 weeks early.</li>
            <li>For my purposes it has held up well, is as pictured, and quite soft.  </li>
            <li>sister who is a professional hair stylist gave me some tips on how to take care of it</li>
            <li>The clip slides right out of my hair and the strands shed if you so much as look at them harshly.</li>
            <li>The only thing is it loses strand of hair pretty quickly..</li>
            <li>, I should add, I have several different pieces in other colors and what I like to do to insure that the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t fall out easily is, I take clear fingernail polish and dab it along the end sewn to the clip, letting it saturate and dry before using.  </li>
            <li>I will order again from them in the near future</li>
    </ol>

            <li> one&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of months of having this I accidentally left it hanging from the clip and the creases are now gone :) it does look fake and the hair does fall out a little and tangles</li>
            <li> so you can have it for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> Its very long, so I can cut it too my length</li>
            <li> It is not real hair but, looks close to it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t even tell that it&#x27;s not real.</li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve read the reviews on here and saved myself the money I spent on FIVE of these.</li>
            <li> They are thick and soft and well made.  </li>
            <li> used to try to dye my hair a fun color, but it was such high maintenance that it got expensive and tiresome.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t style it, you&#x27;ll burn the hair (it&#x27;s not real) if you want it for curl hair get a curly hair piece not a straight piece!</li>
            <li> I ordered five of these, and they came just as expected!</li>
            <li> and they came in this little envelope</li>
            <li> They arrived in a little over a week and was well</li>
            <li> I WAS SO EXCITED :(</li>
            <li> Waste of time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for costume use, so it has not had to withstand everyday wear.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> and then saw that the comb to put them in your hair is so small that they just will not stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give these a shot and wanted to start with something a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> at least they were cheep.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> it self is poor quality.</li>
            <li> but it does not curl :(</li>
            <li> But the hair fell off the metal clip before I even got to wear it :(</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Cant beat the price, doesn&#x27;t look as real as it does in the photo but I don&#x27;t care!</li>
            <li> I love the color but it does not curl :(</li>
            <li> This came in the mail super early. It was not supposed to come into until May 26th and I got it 2 weeks early. I got it for my younger sister for her 14th birthday and it blends in with her hair perfectly. She loves it. I would definitely recommend this if you want different color highlights in your hair. Plus, the clip is great.</li>
            <li> I love it, I wear it all the time, it&#x27;s very easy to put in and take out to spice up the hair do! I get complimented on it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;I used to try to dye my hair a fun color, but it was such high maintenance that it got expensive and tiresome. I thought I&#x27;d give these a shot and wanted to start with something a little less expensive. The quality of this really surprised me, now I want more!</li>
            <li> The company stated they had shipped my order but it did not even have my color in stock. They offer to replace it with a different color instead of just refunding my money. If I wanted a different color I would have order that color. Order placed on 3/28/14 and should have arrived by 4/2/14 as stated when they said the had shipped it but they had not because they didn&#x27;t even have it.</li>
            <li> Cute, long, arrived as advertised. Sturdy baret. Color true to picture. Nice extension.</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of these to clip into my hair for my wedding. I had no idea until after I bought them and went to use them that you can not do anything with them. They do not curl or krimp or anything. I don&#x27;t even have naturally straight hair so for me to use these I have to straighten all of my hair. They are really pretty and exactly what is shown. I just wish I would have known that I couldn&#x27;t curl them.</li>
            <li> My niece loved it.  When she wears it in the lake I can keep track of her.</li>
            <li> I love them and wear them daily and the company is prompt and so very friendly I will order again from them in the near future as will my daughter i have ordered from here 3 times and have loved every order very good quality and excellent color</li>
            <li> looks like i dyed my hair when i clip it in.  ;P  Just for fun, but you could wear it whenever really...if your job/school isnt strict.</li>
            <li> The clip slides right out of my hair and the strands shed if you so much as look at them harshly. Waste of time.</li>
            <li> My initial review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Do not buy these!&lt;br /&gt;Took over two weeks to receive and they came in this little envelope all folded.the hair has creases and it falls off when I touch it.im glad I only bought one&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of months of having this I accidentally left it hanging from the clip and the creases are now gone :) it does look fake and the hair does fall out a little and tangles but it&#x27;s ok if you don&#x27;t wear it all the time. Might purchase again</li>
            <li> Good quality. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Good quality strong color</li>
            <li> I purchased this for costume use, so it has not had to withstand everyday wear.  For my purposes it has held up well, is as pictured, and quite soft.  Great product and even better price.</li>
            <li> They were just what I though they would be.  Perfect for the wedding.</li>
            <li> This product may be okay for Halloween, but it comes folded and the creases don&#x27;t come out. It is made of plastic. The color is pretty.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  They are thick and soft and well made.  Nice color saturation of a cobalt blue, not too dark, not too light, just right.  Clips are secure and strong and have that little no-slip strip inside so they stay put.  I purchased two and trimmed them to the length I need but will be getting more so that I have longer ones as my hair grows out.  Very pleased with this product.  They arrived in a little over a week and was well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I should add, I have several different pieces in other colors and what I like to do to insure that the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t fall out easily is, I take clear fingernail polish and dab it along the end sewn to the clip, letting it saturate and dry before using.  That way, when I comb them I don&#x27;t end up with strands in my comb or in my hands.  Also, you should use a wide-toothed comb on these to keep them from shredding to &amp;#34;split-ends&amp;#34; or getting frazzled.  Helps them look great for a long time.</li>
            <li> I got the product two weeks before I was supposed to get it which was awesome! It is not real hair but, looks close to it. the color is is perfect! The clip is a little wired since unlike most hair clips you see, that have one side that opens, this one is connected at both ends. So it looks like an eye from a birds eye view.&lt;br /&gt;My sister who is a professional hair stylist gave me some tips on how to take care of it so you can have it for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;1. don&#x27;t wear it in the shower or pool (the chlorine will bleach it)&lt;br /&gt;2.Don&#x27;t wear it to bed&lt;br /&gt;3. When you are not wearing it hang it in a place where it won&#x27;t get tangled (once it&#x27;s tangled you have to get rid of it)&lt;br /&gt;4. Don&#x27;t style it, you&#x27;ll burn the hair (it&#x27;s not real) if you want it for curl hair get a curly hair piece not a straight piece!</li>
            <li> I love this thing! Its very long, so I can cut it too my length and it has lasted me for about a year now! I wear it about every other weak and stuff it in a drawer with a bunch of other stuff, so I doesn&#x27;t really get good care, but it still looks good!</li>
            <li> I love the idea!!! But the hair fell off the metal clip before I even got to wear it :( at least they were cheep.</li>
            <li> Awesome ! Fun for hight school rally spirit , and anything really ... I have long hair and it&#x27;s the perfect size ... Great buy</li>
            <li> These worked great for my daughter&#x27;s peacock Halloween costume and were a great price.</li>
            <li> Awesome I got two extensions and they were straight and smooth and unknotted</li>
            <li> Gift for someone, looks perfect and natural. Very real feel to it. My Mate has white hair and doesn&#x27;t believe in altering the color so we got this for him.  You can&#x27;t even tell that it&#x27;s not real. Got a picture of him below with another buddy of mine, but check out how real that looks. 5 starts no questions.</li>
            <li> Great product! Ordered a different color today!</li>
            <li> I am new to the use of extensions, but have tried them a couple times with great results! I had no idea there was such a difference between 100% human hair extensions and synthetic... You can&#x27;t do a thing with these extensions, except literally clip them in and wear them \\&quot;as is.\\&quot; They do not curl whatsoever. I wish I would&#x27;ve read the reviews on here and saved myself the money I spent on FIVE of these.</li>
            <li> This is not what I was looking for or wanting. To be honest it&#x27;s not blue. It&#x27;s actually purple. Maybe I got purple by accident. Either way. I think I just stick to getting extensions like this at my local hair shop.</li>
            <li> I chose 4 stars because I loved the product, it was the perfect shade of blue, it feels real. I love it. The only thing is it loses strand of hair pretty quickly..</li>
            <li> This came a lot earlier than it said it would. The hair is nice and soft and blends well with my hair (since my hair is straight). This is synthetic hair so it won&#x27;t be able to curl. I&#x27;ll definitely buy more colors in the future.</li>
            <li> I love putting these in my hair for extra spice of color. They are easy to use and place in my hair.</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS WANTED SOMETHING LIKE THIS BUT I NEVER GOT IT UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I WAS SO EXCITED :( PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS AND FIX IT!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these and then saw that the comb to put them in your hair is so small that they just will not stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;I stuck them on a doll since I cannot use them myself.</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier then expected. Very easy to use, it doesn&#x27;t fall off and it blends well with the real hair. I would definitely order it again!</li>
            <li> Brilliant! The best thing ever for a good night out</li>
            <li> Poor quality. Hair clip is a cheap hair clip and not a claw clip. So it doesn&#x27;t stay in hair at all. Hair it self is poor quality. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I ordered five of these, and they came just as expected! They are super long, which is great, I just wish they were a little thicker. Great buy!</li>
            <li> This is definitely a better quality extension then the ones I was used to seeing.  It&#x27;s very long which is great because my hair is super long...the color is shiny and gorgeous!</li>
