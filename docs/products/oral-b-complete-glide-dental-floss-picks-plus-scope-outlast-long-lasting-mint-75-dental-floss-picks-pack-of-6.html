            <li>Excellent string, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I had used the CVS brand &amp;#34;flossers&amp;#34;  and picked these up because Oral B makes good products.</li>
            <li>I guess its good that it comes in a bulk pack of 450 floss picks, that way</li>
            <li>Design is good to hold and the pick works good.</li>
            <li>There are lots of good ones out there.  </li>
            <li>If you want these to help get food out of your teeth, they&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li>They even have the minty scope flavor for good measure.  </li>
            <li>They are so convenient and that causes me to floss more and the tooth pick come in real handy.</li>
            <li>Best device ever to clean in between teeth.</li>
            <li>So for some people like me, these may be great and others may desire a more durable type pick.  </li>
            <li>Doses a great job, much better than the floss you have to unroll.</li>
            <li>gets your teeth free of food stuck between your teeth plus floss!!</li>
            <li>Ok, so it doesn&#x27;t break by just looking at it, but ALMOST!  </li>
            <li>I love these!  </li>
            <li>Much better!</li>
            <li>and you have to go get better floss to get it out!  </li>
            <li>i had no idea floss picks could be so amazing.  </li>
            <li>it is amazing with mint flavor.</li>
            <li>I read some reviews and they seemed to be well liked.  </li>
            <li>My husband tried one the day they arrived and mentioned how much he liked it.  </li>
            <li>i ordered the oral b kind from amazon.  </li>
            <li>They use ribbon floss that glides nicely between your teeth.</li>
            <li>minty ones are nice.</li>
            <li>I stopped by my daughters apt.</li>
            <li>Nice minty flavor.</li>
            <li>They are so nice on your teeth.</li>
            <li>is kind of environmentally unfriendly.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if they were a bit stronger</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that this product made it to production with this kind of problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They have a nice minty taste.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t remember why i chose this particular brand, but they are awesome!!  </li>
            <li>very glad I was able to find them here.</li>
            <li>They break and pull apart very easily.</li>
            <li>The floss part breaks very easily.</li>
            <li>The floss breaks very easily.  </li>
            <li>The floss thread breaks very easily.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Breaks very easily.</li>
            <li>read reviews about the floss breaking and cannot understand what in the world would be happening to cause that, because it&#x27;s very strong floss that I have never had break.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t made right or something!!!</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I have always dreaded flossing, and honestly, skipped it many days.  </li>
            <li>Tastes good, feels good, but breaks easily and doesn&#x27;t clean as well as I would like.  </li>
            <li>The best amongt the floss picks I have tried so far, and I have used a dozen brands.&lt;br /&gt;Pro</li>
            <li>Too good to be true.</li>
            <li>The safeway brand is actually great -- super strong.</li>
            <li>Can´t say much but this floss picks from oral B are perfect to clean what you can´t reach!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: very smooth and can reach every nook and cranny.&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>But this time, so many flosses have defects.</li>
            <li>I use one after eating most food of any type.</li>
            <li>We love these.</li>
            <li>Love this product, no hassle with tearing or breaking floss</li>
            <li>LOVE these picks.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love the flavor.</li>

            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I LOVE using it.  </li>
            <li>I bought like 20 packs of it because I use one or two a day, and plan to have my teeth for many years.</li>
            <li>instead, as they are much more durable.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful way to use floss daily and they travel well.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it prevents more of these from being produced.</li>
            <li>They are Much more convenient than floss and work just as well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely buy them! : )</li>
            <li>There are many better brands out there.</li>
            <li>As a person with a lot of dental work, I love these.  </li>
            <li>I love these and buying them here</li>
            <li>I love the value in this offer.</li>
            <li>Flavorless would be better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of these brands of flossers.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite way to floss.</li>
            <li>I make sure I stock for months ahead because I am always worried I won&#x27;t find them anymore.</li>
            <li>Its better to use a thread instead of buying this product.</li>
            <li>Be sure to remember when ordering this that it comes with</li>
            <li>Have used this floss for a while now, love it.  </li>
            <li>; I purchased a bundle of 6 packs with 75 &amp;#34;picks&amp;#34; in each, and the price was fantastic!</li>
            <li>As this is not the case, I would have to rate the GUM Eez-Thru&#x27;s as the better buy.  </li>
            <li>Favorite floss forever.</li>
            <li>I love these even though they do shred sometimes....</li>
            <li>I am glad these are in the subscribe and save program.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different floss picks and these are the best.</li>
            <li>In short, these are the best floss picks I&#x27;ve ever used!!!</li>
            <li>I love the design and the way they glide between your teeth.  </li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>1 for the top teeth and 1 for the bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>I love flossing.</li>
            <li>I personally love these.  </li>
            <li>I love using this floss since it does not get stuck or break apart in between my teeth.</li>
            <li>Love this design hold</li>
            <li>My family&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li>I love these things.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised there are any good reviews!</li>
            <li>These work good, are pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>If the Glide picks were as stiff as the Eez-Thru picks, they would be a most excellent and effective cleaning tool.  </li>
            <li>I would love these floss picks if they didn&#x27;t break so easily.</li>
            <li>But the floss strip breaks easily, and it took me as many as four picks to finish the job (and to get bits of floss out of my teeth).</li>
            <li>More comfortable than store brands.</li>
            <li>Glad they are available at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great to keep in my purse, I use an old altoids tin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how other people floss their teeth, but these work the best</li>
            <li>They fray and break way too easily.</li>
            <li>Their design makes them easy to use.  </li>
            <li>And, if it does break, you can get it out of your teeth easily.  </li>
            <li>The floss picks make it so easy for me to remember to floss.  </li>
            <li>I have NEVER had one break; they slide easily between my teeth as promised.</li>
            <li>These make flossing so easy.</li>
            <li>There are others out there which are sturdier, but they don&#x27;t glide as easily and hurt my gums.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, minty and even my son who doesn&#x27;t like to floss asks for them.</li>
            <li>It always takes 2 or 3 of these to get all your teeth because they break so easily.  </li>
            <li>Makes flossing easy.</li>
            <li>The floss does break too easy, but the floss is thinner than another product I have tried so it fits easier.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand the store brands I&#x27;ve tried because they break so easily</li>
            <li>Floss breaks easily.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shred easily, or get stuck in between teeth.  </li>
            <li>Durable - doesn&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li>but they break easily</li>
            <li>I almost always use 2 or 3 picks as the floss breaks easily.  </li>
            <li>Now I notice that the picks shred easily and break after two teeth.</li>
            <li>: Easy to break.</li>
            <li>The floss glides easily in between teeth.</li>
            <li>The floss is reasonably strong and so is the pick.  </li>
            <li>The picks are easy to use, durable and do an excellent job in cleaning between the teeth and down to the gum line..</li>
            <li>But this product gives you a fine handle that allows you to use it easily.  </li>
            <li>The mint flavor of these is more sweet, yet still leaves my mouth feeling fresh.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave this item 2 stars because it certainly has the flavor of Scope, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>I am So happy Amazon is such a fantastic company.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the comfort and ease of using these floss picks.</li>
            <li>This is one of those products marketed to make life easier but lends to more hassle than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>They break free at the slightest pressure.</li>
            <li>These work fantastic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The toothpick end is smooth and curved, which could be what some are looking for.</li>
            <li>i used it for the first time and was wowed!!  </li>
            <li>My toofs love them very much indeed.  </li>
            <li>These are my favorite floss picks and I will list out exactly why:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>While Glide floss is great stuff, these flossing picks are a minor disaster.  </li>
            <li>Why were the new style picks all around and not a hint of the kind I wanted.</li>
            <li>is to use a proper floss pick (that God we own so many).  </li>
            <li>Oral B should know better, and clearly needs to a much better job of design and product testing, when it comes to flossing tools.</li>
            <li>This helps clean the teeth and keeps the floss picks from breaking.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to pull out and foot of floss to clean your teeth..</li>
            <li>They truly work hard to keep us Happy!</li>
            <li>The good news is that I ordered 6 bags of these so using two a day will last us.  </li>
            <li>I would say out of a whole package, at the most I have had two break.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>I would estimate about a 10-20% breakage rate, but this will obviously vary based on the individual--in my case the molars are fairly close together.  </li>
            <li>But overall good flossers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Glide picks for years and loved them but these Oral-B ones may have the same logo on them</li>
            <li>For all the claims of extra strong floss, they sure break easily.</li>
            <li>they quickly either (a) break, (b) shred, or (c) pull apart where the floss is attached to the frame.</li>
            <li>They glide easily between teeth without shredding and are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The floss itself is very flimsy and breaks easily.  </li>
            <li>Very frequently, it will fray and leave bits between my teeth, necessitating going through up to four more picks to fish the bits out.  </li>
            <li>you are able to use ordinary dental floss without shredding it, then you may be able to use these dental picks without too many problems.  </li>
            <li>Great for tight teeth.  </li>
            <li>The purpose of floss is to work its way between your teeth to clean in that area, and because this floss tore up immediately within the first use, it did not serve its purpose.  </li>
            <li>By far, these are my favorite dental picks.  </li>
            <li>For me, I rarely have any of these break before I am finished using them.</li>
            <li>I found these a few years ago and liked them the most.</li>
            <li>Makes flossing almost fun.</li>
            <li>but it is a rare occurrence.</li>
            <li>Instead of traditional floss string, it uses a strip, which I thought would be a nice change.</li>
            <li>They end up making you more likely to floss because they are quick and easy to use, and not the more involved ordeal of flossing with regular floss.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other floss picks with different shapes, and these are the best in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The picks were strong and sturdy and were so easy to use that I actually started to floss my teeth twice everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are not that great, the floss is really weak and breaks easily.</li>
            <li>The floss bends right away too</li>
            <li>Fourth, the pick has a fine texture to it (like fine grain sandpaper) and when I rub it in between my teeth it makes me feel like I&#x27;m rubbing off the plaque.</li>
            <li>Flossing is important for the health of your gums and these individual use flossers make it easy.</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t review things unless I love them or can&#x27;t stand them.</li>
            <li>I have lots of problems with some floss catching on my dental work or shredding between my tight teeth, but the OralB floss picks have a smooth ribbon floss that meets the challenge without any problems.</li>
            <li>These picks, while they have some good reviews, have all of the common problems of cheap floss picks and more:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used Plackers floss picks previously but ran out, so I bought these because they were a good price and</li>
            <li>The Floss break far too easily -- it&#x27;s like they want you to use 3-4 picks each time.  </li>
            <li>I have to use 2 or 3 to get my whole teeth flossed if I am lucky.  </li>
            <li>I specifically tracked these down online and was willing to pay for 6 packages of them as I enjoyed how easily they slipped between my teeth.</li>
            <li>Also, the floss is a ribbon instead of a rope - so it fits between tight teeth more easily.  </li>
            <li>My first flossing session with these</li>
            <li>So, you have to use ANOTHER one to get the first one out.</li>
            <li>but that convenience is more than offset by total lack of durability.</li>
            <li>drug stores in my area have replaced this Oral B brand with private label brands, these are much better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had more luck with Walgreens generic brand.</li>
            <li>The first one I put in my mouth broke on the first tooth.  </li>
            <li>They make flossing so much more convenient, that for the first time in my life I actually floss on a regualr basis.</li>
            <li>They arrived on time and were exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>On the up side, I will be through the bag in no time, and can go back to a better brand.</li>
            <li>I have tried many of these and this brand is the only one that fits between my teeth.</li>
            <li>the dentist even told me he&#x27;s happy i am at least doing this.</li>
            <li>While most people measure the &amp;#34;blessings of our deeply incorporated civilizations&amp;#34; through technological complications and convoluted unnatural laws.</li>
            <li>First, they have a minty coating on the floss that makes me feel I am both flossing and eating a breath mint.</li>
            <li>I love the product and always go back to this brand because of the design.  </li>
            <li>I had carpal tunnel surgery and wasn&#x27;t able to grip regular floss, so these saved the day; just one hand, whether it&#x27;s the dominant hand or not, will do the job.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I gave a bag to my younger sibling and it encouranged him to floss more.</li>
            <li>Good ones hold firm and don&#x27;t go slack.  </li>
            <li>With my old Plackers, I could floss an entire week without it breaking or becoming unuseable, (yes, I am cheap).</li>
            <li>So, of course, I wanted to try one myself since he has never said  anything positive about flossing or the flosser.  </li>
            <li>Oral-B usually puts out good products.</li>
            <li>The key to these is that sring is thinso that it slides in easy....</li>
            <li>One thing I notice is the actual floss is strong.</li>
            <li>really wanted the minty flavour my favorite flossers are missing, but I&#x27;m tossing what remains of these and going back to the old but good flossers.</li>
            <li>Second, the string is plenty strong</li>
            <li>The packs of floss is certainly cheapest, but I could never use them well -</li>
            <li>U ll save money too if u order the large packs here</li>
            <li>These use-and-toss flossers are fantastic because it&#x27;s more of a soft ribbon of floss than a tight string.  </li>
            <li>They even have a handy little pick on the opposite end for those who enjoy toothpicks.</li>
            <li>Things I love about these picks: they fit easily between my tightly spaced teeth, they have a tiny burst of mint flavor for the first ten seconds you&#x27;re flossing, and I can keep them in my car and floss when I&#x27;m driving around town</li>
            <li>My teeth are very close together</li>
            <li>Very frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it really does glide (like the name) between my teeth so that I can floss with ease.  </li>
            <li>thanks for reviewing</li>
            <li>and they are very durable.</li>
            <li>Because my teeth are very close together, the floss break.s</li>
            <li>The Glide technology means the slip too much (ask your dentist)</li>
            <li>so it is slack and much easier to break.  </li>
            <li>I buy them all the time my teeth are very close together</li>
            <li>My girlfriend for example has never broken one while flossing, but i have.</li>
            <li>You can hold one of these in your hand and very discreetly dislodge whatever&#x27;s stuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are great, and we have had no problems with broken strings.</li>
            <li>Really makes flossing a breeze.</li>
            <li>We won&#x27;t even consider buying a different kind in the future.</li>
            <li>Having these little babies on hand make flossing quick and easy.</li>
            <li>and I have found that the oral-b advantages are more gentle on my teeth and gums than other type picks.  </li>
            <li>They are not a sting but more of a band, with a sharp edge.</li>
            <li>is so much better than other \\&quot;minty-pick\\&quot; type products.</li>
            <li>I also tried cheap generic brands and was highly disapointed.</li>
            <li>I can even go back and forth on each tooth to clean...</li>
            <li>Ok fine, but at least I can floss with them...wrong!</li>
            <li>Strings break far too easily compared to similar products.</li>
            <li>Ridiculous, when it is soooo easy to make a strong floss.  </li>
            <li>They were far more trouble than they were worth.</li>
            <li>Same thing is true of our kids.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably good to not use the same flosser anyway, but be warned, if you&#x27;re someone who likes to constantly reuse the same pick you won&#x27;t have any luck here.</li>
            <li>Yes, the floss tastes good, but like many other reviewers, I found these floss picks to be of exceptionally poor quality.  </li>
            <li>They also leave the nice taste of Scope in your mouth, although I doubt the amount of Scope is effective for bad breath.</li>
            <li>Break easily under minimal pressure.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t break easy, the fray is also minimal.</li>
            <li>You have to used several of these unless you get lucky with one that doesn&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend over others of it type.</li>
            <li>GIven the brand names involved, I had high expectations for this product.  </li>
            <li>This cuts up my gums frequently, even when other most picks would not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only does it now take 2 or 3 of them to get through a single cleaning, they break so readily they often leave threads stuck in my teeth requiring more flossing to remove.</li>
            <li>The flossers themselves are so fragile that I can clean one, maybe two teeth before they break completely or shred leaving bits of floss between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>The taste is great but the flossers are nearly useless.</li>
            <li>These taste great, but they&#x27;re useless so who cares.</li>
            <li>so I buy this 6 pack every few months and have been nothing but pleased.</li>
            <li>, I usually take two per session but overall a good product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t day much about the shredding because I also use Plackers fine floss for tight teeth</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find them where I live.</li>
            <li>flossing helps you live longer...</li>
            <li>And yes, I use a new pick every time I floss.</li>
            <li>It flows easily between teeth and has a slight taste of mint.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve switched to a different brand which -- though it doesn&#x27;t slide between my teeth with the ease of Glide Picks -- doesn&#x27;t break and requires only one floss pick for my fabulous, freshly-flossed mouth.</li>
            <li>my husband tried them after me and said the exact same thing...</li>
            <li>Most of the other pick&#x27;s floss breaks when doing my back teeth.  </li>
            <li>Had to use 6 or more where other brands would need only one.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOU MONEY!</li>
            <li>The higher star ratings must have been for another, similar Glide product.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t save and reuse the floss picks, and definitely don&#x27;t put used ones back in the bag with the clean</li>
            <li>, it is thin enough to fit between teeth comfortable but strong enough to deal with larger pieces of caught food.</li>
            <li>They may occasionally break, but they are so smooth and gentle compared to all of the other flossers.  </li>
            <li>These picks use a floss that will fit between my tight teeth.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic for tight spaces.</li>
            <li>They fit in the tight gaps too.</li>
            <li>Work great on hard to reach tight spots but the flavor leaves my teeth tasting like plastic.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, these gliders were easy enough to use that I finally started flossing regularly.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little flimsy, but for the overall cost I think it&#x27;s an ok product for the price and quantity</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have stated, the floss loosens and breaks quickly when one uses these.  </li>
            <li>Clearly there is either a design or manufacturing error.</li>
            <li>If even modest sideways pressure is applied against the tooth (which is the point of these, after all)</li>
            <li>The floss breaks completely or pieces come off of them almost every time</li>
            <li>I like this floss because it is soft</li>
            <li>I was surprised since it&#x27;s a brand name.</li>
            <li>As far as cleaning power, I feel like these don&#x27;t get between the gums as well as Plackers...</li>
            <li>My family uses floss picks frequently.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste money buying this cheap product.</li>
            <li>The type of floss used in the Eez-Thru picks, is not as smooth as Glide floss, but the floss does remain quite taught under heavy usage.  </li>
            <li>These work, and are much easier to use than traditional floss.</li>
            <li>Plus there&#x27;s no messy &amp;#34;wrapping of the floss&amp;#34; around your fingers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used floss picks from GUM that last for many floss sessions as opposed to these, which can barely do a few teeth.  </li>
            <li>I would only buy these if they are on sale or if better options are not readily available.</li>
            <li>The floss breaks very easily, and even if you can manage to hit a few teeth without it breaking, it still becomes incredibly loose.</li>
            <li>Other Oral B brand floss picks have worked great, but these are really poorly made.</li>
            <li>Regular floss just doesn&#x27;t fit between all my teeth, or gets stuck, and other floss sticks break almost</li>
            <li>The string is flat as opposed to round and fits better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very surprised that they&#x27;re so bad, since I&#x27;ve had good luck with most other Oral-B products, including their regular Glide dental floss and their electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I cannot conceive that Oral-B tested these properly under realistic conditions.  </li>
            <li>I have (presumably) normally spaced teeth, yet the floss on these picks breaks after the third or forth tooth.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums and the other more durable types of floss picks were not comfortable for me.  </li>
            <li>Often times you end up shredding that one in the same spot and need to try again using just enough pressure to make it between the teeth, but not too much that it leaves another thread stuck there.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I have close contact on several teeth, but I also had a cavity filled recently that left me with a gap big enough to trap everything, so I carry flossers.</li>
            <li>I wrote it off due to the price, but found another source that was cheaper with higher quality.  </li>
            <li>I generally use 3 or 4 every time I floss.  </li>
            <li>The only thing worth a damn with these is the pick on the other end, as is the pick on any other decent flosser.</li>
            <li>Other flossers give me that finger nails down a chalkboard feeling, these are so smooth and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Besides that I have found the end of this toothpick is much slimmer than any other I have tried</li>
            <li>Some reviewers say this does not happen, but it does, and frequently, even if you have only moderately close teeth.</li>
            <li>I measure our progress by how far we&#x27;ve come in terms of simple low tech conveniences.</li>
            <li>They &#x27;glide&#x27; through your teeth much easier than other brands, and especially store brand floss picks.</li>
            <li>have used a variety of floss picks, and these are the first I consider a waste of money.</li>
            <li>the pick is too thick for me compared to many other brands I have used.</li>
            <li>If you push straight down and try and push it in they wont work.  </li>
            <li>The long lasting mint, doesn&#x27;t last long but that really doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>However, within the first few swipes between my back teeth, the floss tore up!  </li>
            <li>These are thin enough to pass through my teeth easily</li>
            <li>And i cannot imagine a time when people had to shove their fingers halfway down their throats to floss your wisdom teeth (if you were able to have them come in), i mean how barbaric.</li>
            <li>I have some teeth that are very close together, and others that are difficult to floss, and require a little more force.  </li>

            <li> Much better!</li>
            <li> and you have to go get better floss to get it out!  </li>
            <li> i had no idea floss picks could be so amazing.  </li>
            <li> it is amazing with mint flavor.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews and they seemed to be well liked.  </li>
            <li> My husband tried one the day they arrived and mentioned how much he liked it.  </li>
            <li> i ordered the oral b kind from amazon.  </li>

            <li> minty ones are nice.</li>
            <li> I stopped by my daughters apt.</li>
            <li> Nice minty flavor.</li>
            <li> They are so nice on your teeth.</li>
            <li> is kind of environmentally unfriendly.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if they were a bit stronger</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that this product made it to production with this kind of problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They have a nice minty taste.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t remember why i chose this particular brand, but they are awesome!!  </li>
            <li> very glad I was able to find them here.</li>
            <li> They break and pull apart very easily.</li>

            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Breaks very easily.</li>
            <li> read reviews about the floss breaking and cannot understand what in the world would be happening to cause that, because it&#x27;s very strong floss that I have never had break.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t made right or something!!!</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I have always dreaded flossing, and honestly, skipped it many days.  </li>
            <li> Tastes good, feels good, but breaks easily and doesn&#x27;t clean as well as I would like.  </li>
            <li> The best amongt the floss picks I have tried so far, and I have used a dozen brands.&lt;br /&gt;Pro</li>
            <li> Too good to be true.</li>
            <li> The safeway brand is actually great -- super strong.</li>
            <li> Can´t say much but this floss picks from oral B are perfect to clean what you can´t reach!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : very smooth and can reach every nook and cranny.&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> But this time, so many flosses have defects.</li>

            <li> I bought like 20 packs of it because I use one or two a day, and plan to have my teeth for many years.</li>
            <li> instead, as they are much more durable.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful way to use floss daily and they travel well.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it prevents more of these from being produced.</li>

            <li> These are my favorite way to floss.</li>
            <li> I make sure I stock for months ahead because I am always worried I won&#x27;t find them anymore.</li>
            <li> Its better to use a thread instead of buying this product.</li>

            <li> As this is not the case, I would have to rate the GUM Eez-Thru&#x27;s as the better buy.  </li>

            <li> My family&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> I love these things.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised there are any good reviews!</li>
            <li> These work good, are pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> If the Glide picks were as stiff as the Eez-Thru picks, they would be a most excellent and effective cleaning tool.  </li>
            <li> I would love these floss picks if they didn&#x27;t break so easily.</li>
            <li> But the floss strip breaks easily, and it took me as many as four picks to finish the job (and to get bits of floss out of my teeth).</li>
            <li> More comfortable than store brands.</li>
            <li> Glad they are available at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great to keep in my purse, I use an old altoids tin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how other people floss their teeth, but these work the best</li>
            <li> They fray and break way too easily.</li>
            <li> Their design makes them easy to use.  </li>
            <li> And, if it does break, you can get it out of your teeth easily.  </li>
            <li> The floss picks make it so easy for me to remember to floss.  </li>
            <li> I have NEVER had one break; they slide easily between my teeth as promised.</li>
            <li> These make flossing so easy.</li>
            <li> There are others out there which are sturdier, but they don&#x27;t glide as easily and hurt my gums.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, minty and even my son who doesn&#x27;t like to floss asks for them.</li>
            <li> It always takes 2 or 3 of these to get all your teeth because they break so easily.  </li>
            <li> Makes flossing easy.</li>
            <li> The floss does break too easy, but the floss is thinner than another product I have tried so it fits easier.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the store brands I&#x27;ve tried because they break so easily</li>
            <li> Floss breaks easily.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shred easily, or get stuck in between teeth.  </li>
            <li> Durable - doesn&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li> but they break easily</li>
            <li> I almost always use 2 or 3 picks as the floss breaks easily.  </li>
            <li> Now I notice that the picks shred easily and break after two teeth.</li>
            <li> : Easy to break.</li>
            <li> The floss glides easily in between teeth.</li>
            <li> The floss is reasonably strong and so is the pick.  </li>
            <li> The picks are easy to use, durable and do an excellent job in cleaning between the teeth and down to the gum line..</li>
            <li> But this product gives you a fine handle that allows you to use it easily.  </li>
            <li> The mint flavor of these is more sweet, yet still leaves my mouth feeling fresh.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave this item 2 stars because it certainly has the flavor of Scope, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> I am So happy Amazon is such a fantastic company.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the comfort and ease of using these floss picks.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products marketed to make life easier but lends to more hassle than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> They break free at the slightest pressure.</li>
            <li> These work fantastic.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The toothpick end is smooth and curved, which could be what some are looking for.</li>
            <li> i used it for the first time and was wowed!!  </li>
            <li> My toofs love them very much indeed.  </li>
            <li> These are my favorite floss picks and I will list out exactly why:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> While Glide floss is great stuff, these flossing picks are a minor disaster.  </li>
            <li> Why were the new style picks all around and not a hint of the kind I wanted.</li>
            <li> is to use a proper floss pick (that God we own so many).  </li>
            <li> Oral B should know better, and clearly needs to a much better job of design and product testing, when it comes to flossing tools.</li>
            <li> This helps clean the teeth and keeps the floss picks from breaking.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to pull out and foot of floss to clean your teeth..</li>
            <li> They truly work hard to keep us Happy!</li>
            <li> The good news is that I ordered 6 bags of these so using two a day will last us.  </li>
            <li> I would say out of a whole package, at the most I have had two break.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I would estimate about a 10-20% breakage rate, but this will obviously vary based on the individual--in my case the molars are fairly close together.  </li>
            <li> But overall good flossers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Glide picks for years and loved them but these Oral-B ones may have the same logo on them</li>
            <li> For all the claims of extra strong floss, they sure break easily.</li>
            <li> they quickly either (a) break, (b) shred, or (c) pull apart where the floss is attached to the frame.</li>
            <li> They glide easily between teeth without shredding and are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The floss itself is very flimsy and breaks easily.  </li>
            <li> Very frequently, it will fray and leave bits between my teeth, necessitating going through up to four more picks to fish the bits out.  </li>
            <li> you are able to use ordinary dental floss without shredding it, then you may be able to use these dental picks without too many problems.  </li>
            <li> Great for tight teeth.  </li>
            <li> The purpose of floss is to work its way between your teeth to clean in that area, and because this floss tore up immediately within the first use, it did not serve its purpose.  </li>
            <li> By far, these are my favorite dental picks.  </li>
            <li> For me, I rarely have any of these break before I am finished using them.</li>
            <li> I found these a few years ago and liked them the most.</li>
            <li> Makes flossing almost fun.</li>
            <li> but it is a rare occurrence.</li>
            <li> Instead of traditional floss string, it uses a strip, which I thought would be a nice change.</li>
            <li> They end up making you more likely to floss because they are quick and easy to use, and not the more involved ordeal of flossing with regular floss.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other floss picks with different shapes, and these are the best in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The picks were strong and sturdy and were so easy to use that I actually started to floss my teeth twice everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are not that great, the floss is really weak and breaks easily.</li>
            <li> The floss bends right away too</li>
            <li> Fourth, the pick has a fine texture to it (like fine grain sandpaper) and when I rub it in between my teeth it makes me feel like I&#x27;m rubbing off the plaque.</li>
            <li> Flossing is important for the health of your gums and these individual use flossers make it easy.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t review things unless I love them or can&#x27;t stand them.</li>
            <li> I have lots of problems with some floss catching on my dental work or shredding between my tight teeth, but the OralB floss picks have a smooth ribbon floss that meets the challenge without any problems.</li>
            <li> These picks, while they have some good reviews, have all of the common problems of cheap floss picks and more:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used Plackers floss picks previously but ran out, so I bought these because they were a good price and</li>
            <li> The Floss break far too easily -- it&#x27;s like they want you to use 3-4 picks each time.  </li>
            <li> I have to use 2 or 3 to get my whole teeth flossed if I am lucky.  </li>
            <li> I specifically tracked these down online and was willing to pay for 6 packages of them as I enjoyed how easily they slipped between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Also, the floss is a ribbon instead of a rope - so it fits between tight teeth more easily.  </li>
            <li> My first flossing session with these</li>
            <li> So, you have to use ANOTHER one to get the first one out.</li>
            <li> but that convenience is more than offset by total lack of durability.</li>
            <li> drug stores in my area have replaced this Oral B brand with private label brands, these are much better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had more luck with Walgreens generic brand.</li>
            <li> The first one I put in my mouth broke on the first tooth.  </li>
            <li> They make flossing so much more convenient, that for the first time in my life I actually floss on a regualr basis.</li>
            <li> They arrived on time and were exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> On the up side, I will be through the bag in no time, and can go back to a better brand.</li>
            <li> I have tried many of these and this brand is the only one that fits between my teeth.</li>
            <li> the dentist even told me he&#x27;s happy i am at least doing this.</li>
            <li> While most people measure the &amp;#34;blessings of our deeply incorporated civilizations&amp;#34; through technological complications and convoluted unnatural laws.</li>
            <li> First, they have a minty coating on the floss that makes me feel I am both flossing and eating a breath mint.</li>
            <li> I love the product and always go back to this brand because of the design.  </li>
            <li> I had carpal tunnel surgery and wasn&#x27;t able to grip regular floss, so these saved the day; just one hand, whether it&#x27;s the dominant hand or not, will do the job.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I gave a bag to my younger sibling and it encouranged him to floss more.</li>
            <li> Good ones hold firm and don&#x27;t go slack.  </li>
            <li> With my old Plackers, I could floss an entire week without it breaking or becoming unuseable, (yes, I am cheap).</li>
            <li> So, of course, I wanted to try one myself since he has never said  anything positive about flossing or the flosser.  </li>
            <li> Oral-B usually puts out good products.</li>
            <li> The key to these is that sring is thinso that it slides in easy....</li>
            <li> One thing I notice is the actual floss is strong.</li>
            <li> really wanted the minty flavour my favorite flossers are missing, but I&#x27;m tossing what remains of these and going back to the old but good flossers.</li>
            <li> Second, the string is plenty strong</li>
            <li> The packs of floss is certainly cheapest, but I could never use them well -</li>
            <li> U ll save money too if u order the large packs here</li>
            <li> These use-and-toss flossers are fantastic because it&#x27;s more of a soft ribbon of floss than a tight string.  </li>
            <li> They even have a handy little pick on the opposite end for those who enjoy toothpicks.</li>
            <li> Things I love about these picks: they fit easily between my tightly spaced teeth, they have a tiny burst of mint flavor for the first ten seconds you&#x27;re flossing, and I can keep them in my car and floss when I&#x27;m driving around town</li>
            <li> My teeth are very close together</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it really does glide (like the name) between my teeth so that I can floss with ease.  </li>
            <li> thanks for reviewing</li>
            <li> and they are very durable.</li>
            <li> Because my teeth are very close together, the floss break.s</li>
            <li> The Glide technology means the slip too much (ask your dentist)</li>
            <li> so it is slack and much easier to break.  </li>
            <li> I buy them all the time my teeth are very close together</li>
            <li> My girlfriend for example has never broken one while flossing, but i have.</li>
            <li> You can hold one of these in your hand and very discreetly dislodge whatever&#x27;s stuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are great, and we have had no problems with broken strings.</li>
            <li> Really makes flossing a breeze.</li>
            <li> We won&#x27;t even consider buying a different kind in the future.</li>
            <li> Having these little babies on hand make flossing quick and easy.</li>
            <li> and I have found that the oral-b advantages are more gentle on my teeth and gums than other type picks.  </li>
            <li> They are not a sting but more of a band, with a sharp edge.</li>
            <li> is so much better than other \\&quot;minty-pick\\&quot; type products.</li>
            <li> I also tried cheap generic brands and was highly disapointed.</li>
            <li> I can even go back and forth on each tooth to clean...</li>
            <li> Ok fine, but at least I can floss with them...wrong!</li>
            <li> Strings break far too easily compared to similar products.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous, when it is soooo easy to make a strong floss.  </li>
            <li> They were far more trouble than they were worth.</li>
            <li> Same thing is true of our kids.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably good to not use the same flosser anyway, but be warned, if you&#x27;re someone who likes to constantly reuse the same pick you won&#x27;t have any luck here.</li>
            <li> Yes, the floss tastes good, but like many other reviewers, I found these floss picks to be of exceptionally poor quality.  </li>
            <li> They also leave the nice taste of Scope in your mouth, although I doubt the amount of Scope is effective for bad breath.</li>
            <li> Break easily under minimal pressure.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t break easy, the fray is also minimal.</li>
            <li> You have to used several of these unless you get lucky with one that doesn&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend over others of it type.</li>
            <li> GIven the brand names involved, I had high expectations for this product.  </li>
            <li> This cuts up my gums frequently, even when other most picks would not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only does it now take 2 or 3 of them to get through a single cleaning, they break so readily they often leave threads stuck in my teeth requiring more flossing to remove.</li>
            <li> The flossers themselves are so fragile that I can clean one, maybe two teeth before they break completely or shred leaving bits of floss between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> The taste is great but the flossers are nearly useless.</li>
            <li> These taste great, but they&#x27;re useless so who cares.</li>
            <li> so I buy this 6 pack every few months and have been nothing but pleased.</li>
            <li> , I usually take two per session but overall a good product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t day much about the shredding because I also use Plackers fine floss for tight teeth</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find them where I live.</li>
            <li> flossing helps you live longer...</li>
            <li> And yes, I use a new pick every time I floss.</li>
            <li> It flows easily between teeth and has a slight taste of mint.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve switched to a different brand which -- though it doesn&#x27;t slide between my teeth with the ease of Glide Picks -- doesn&#x27;t break and requires only one floss pick for my fabulous, freshly-flossed mouth.</li>
            <li> my husband tried them after me and said the exact same thing...</li>
            <li> Most of the other pick&#x27;s floss breaks when doing my back teeth.  </li>
            <li> Had to use 6 or more where other brands would need only one.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOU MONEY!</li>
            <li> The higher star ratings must have been for another, similar Glide product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t save and reuse the floss picks, and definitely don&#x27;t put used ones back in the bag with the clean</li>
            <li> , it is thin enough to fit between teeth comfortable but strong enough to deal with larger pieces of caught food.</li>
            <li> They may occasionally break, but they are so smooth and gentle compared to all of the other flossers.  </li>
            <li> These picks use a floss that will fit between my tight teeth.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic for tight spaces.</li>
            <li> They fit in the tight gaps too.</li>
            <li> Work great on hard to reach tight spots but the flavor leaves my teeth tasting like plastic.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, these gliders were easy enough to use that I finally started flossing regularly.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little flimsy, but for the overall cost I think it&#x27;s an ok product for the price and quantity</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, the floss loosens and breaks quickly when one uses these.  </li>
            <li> Clearly there is either a design or manufacturing error.</li>
            <li> If even modest sideways pressure is applied against the tooth (which is the point of these, after all)</li>
            <li> The floss breaks completely or pieces come off of them almost every time</li>
            <li> I like this floss because it is soft</li>
            <li> I was surprised since it&#x27;s a brand name.</li>
            <li> As far as cleaning power, I feel like these don&#x27;t get between the gums as well as Plackers...</li>
            <li> My family uses floss picks frequently.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money buying this cheap product.</li>
            <li> The type of floss used in the Eez-Thru picks, is not as smooth as Glide floss, but the floss does remain quite taught under heavy usage.  </li>
            <li> These work, and are much easier to use than traditional floss.</li>
            <li> Plus there&#x27;s no messy &amp;#34;wrapping of the floss&amp;#34; around your fingers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used floss picks from GUM that last for many floss sessions as opposed to these, which can barely do a few teeth.  </li>
            <li> I would only buy these if they are on sale or if better options are not readily available.</li>
            <li> The floss breaks very easily, and even if you can manage to hit a few teeth without it breaking, it still becomes incredibly loose.</li>
            <li> Other Oral B brand floss picks have worked great, but these are really poorly made.</li>
            <li> Regular floss just doesn&#x27;t fit between all my teeth, or gets stuck, and other floss sticks break almost</li>
            <li> The string is flat as opposed to round and fits better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very surprised that they&#x27;re so bad, since I&#x27;ve had good luck with most other Oral-B products, including their regular Glide dental floss and their electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I cannot conceive that Oral-B tested these properly under realistic conditions.  </li>
            <li> I have (presumably) normally spaced teeth, yet the floss on these picks breaks after the third or forth tooth.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums and the other more durable types of floss picks were not comfortable for me.  </li>
            <li> Often times you end up shredding that one in the same spot and need to try again using just enough pressure to make it between the teeth, but not too much that it leaves another thread stuck there.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I have close contact on several teeth, but I also had a cavity filled recently that left me with a gap big enough to trap everything, so I carry flossers.</li>
            <li> I wrote it off due to the price, but found another source that was cheaper with higher quality.  </li>
            <li> I generally use 3 or 4 every time I floss.  </li>
            <li> The only thing worth a damn with these is the pick on the other end, as is the pick on any other decent flosser.</li>
            <li> Other flossers give me that finger nails down a chalkboard feeling, these are so smooth and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Besides that I have found the end of this toothpick is much slimmer than any other I have tried</li>
            <li> Some reviewers say this does not happen, but it does, and frequently, even if you have only moderately close teeth.</li>
            <li> I measure our progress by how far we&#x27;ve come in terms of simple low tech conveniences.</li>
            <li> They &#x27;glide&#x27; through your teeth much easier than other brands, and especially store brand floss picks.</li>
            <li> have used a variety of floss picks, and these are the first I consider a waste of money.</li>
            <li> the pick is too thick for me compared to many other brands I have used.</li>
            <li> If you push straight down and try and push it in they wont work.  </li>
            <li> The long lasting mint, doesn&#x27;t last long but that really doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> However, within the first few swipes between my back teeth, the floss tore up!  </li>
            <li> These are thin enough to pass through my teeth easily</li>
            <li> And i cannot imagine a time when people had to shove their fingers halfway down their throats to floss your wisdom teeth (if you were able to have them come in), i mean how barbaric.</li>
            <li> I have some teeth that are very close together, and others that are difficult to floss, and require a little more force.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are very tight and most flosses are too thick to use without pulling at my teeth.</li>
            <li> expected, the Glide floss slides easily in between my teeth, but unfortunately the floss easily becomes loose, and loses tension.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other cheap floss picks, these have another serious problem.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to do a back and forth action with slight pressure.  </li>
            <li> they specifically state \\&quot;long lasting mint\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> After recent dental work and expected future work, I elected to floss as often as possible.  </li>
            <li> I really never write reviews for anything unless the product is either exceptionally good or bad.</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of these primarily because the &amp;#34;long lasting mint.&amp;#34; Sadly, this was not the case.</li>
            <li> I have used these floss picks for three years now because I really grew tired of the old pull and tear floss reels.</li>
            <li> This floss makes it much easier to get between tight teeth and is doesn&#x27;t shred lke other floss.</li>
            <li> pick my mouth with a single generic pick.  </li>
            <li> Finally, they are more expensive than other picks!</li>
            <li> Very poor quality, many of them break and the floss is very loose when they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Third, the plastic pick is thick enough that pieces of it don&#x27;t break off in between your teeth, yet thin enough to easily get at any food stuck in your teeth.</li>
            <li> Also, you don&#x27;t get your hands wet and germy like when using regular floss.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer these picks to the long string floss.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend and I have been using these for a long time now, even before buying them from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> So I have to get out a second one to rescue the first broken bit and try to keep flossing.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re extremely convenient to use with one hand, unlike regular dental</li>
            <li> Every last one broke or came unthreaded after only a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I literally went through that pile in a single sitting.</li>
            <li> now on I will only use Plackers which are very tough and priced right.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re actually doing a good job of cleaning, and the taste is nothing like regular scope - they taste terrible.</li>
            <li> When it does not break it pulls loose from the pick/holder itself.  </li>
            <li> and I used over 20 picks trying to get the loose tape out.</li>
            <li> Amazon offered them for slightly cheaper than my local grocery store.</li>
            <li> But for those with some tight spots, and places that shred regular floss, you may have some problems using these picks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for Glide floss picks, but unfortunately this product has a major issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Regular floss is hard to hold - I have to wrap it around my fingers several times, and it cuts off blood supply to my fingertips!  </li>
            <li> the pick side is so flimsy it is hard to control, and I actually cut my lip pulling it out from between my upper incisors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unless you have abnormally wide gaps between ALL of your teeth, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> For 38 years I flossed only a few weeks out of the year - I just couldn&#x27;t make it a habit.  </li>
            <li> Plus when it gets wet, it is slippery.  </li>
            <li> Not much mint.. .</li>
            <li> The shredding or breakage never begins until I&#x27;m on the last few teeth, so it never bothers me, and I never see myself grabbing another one to finish the job.</li>
            <li> You might want to consider carefully, before buying six packs of these.</li>
            <li> The disadvantage to these are that as some have said, yes, they do tend to break easier than other brands, although Oral B has seemingly improved these in the last few purchases I have made.  </li>
            <li> only time I have a problem with them breaking is when I push down hard when it&#x27;s not lined up properly.  </li>
            <li> These picks are generally not up to the task, as the floss often begins to sag after using the pick on just a few teeth.  </li>
            <li> When they do break the floss often sticks very tightly between your teeth and the only way to get it out</li>
            <li> These are total crap - it says long lasting, but the floss will break upon first use.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to use, the threads wear out easily and is no adequate replacement for ordinary floss.</li>
            <li> Although the name is a bit disgusting, the product is amazing!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The fragility is a shame, because the texture and taste are nicer than other floss picks.</li>
            <li> they glide through your teeth - feeling gentler and fresher than any other brand i&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> The times that I do get through without them breaking, they&#x27;re extremely worn to the point that they&#x27;re about to break.</li>
            <li> As expected!  </li>
            <li> The Glide floss picks aren&#x27;t like any other I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I typically have to use 4 or 5 of these to get through a single flossing!  </li>
            <li> 6) Super expensive!  </li>
            <li> These are worthless flossers as the dental floss breaks so easily or pulls loose from the plastic pick.</li>
            <li> Yet not worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is highly annoying and hurts, but also causes me to use a lot more picks trying to get the stuck pieces out, but those keep breaking as well, etc...</li>
            <li> Where you&#x27;d expect to use one at a time, it took 3 to 4 flossers to complete the job because they were so poorly made.</li>
            <li> Good idea, horrible product.  </li>
            <li> I purchase six packages at a time from Amazon to cut down on the price per pick.</li>
            <li> I have gone through 75 in less than 4 days.  </li>
            <li> dental floss.i just went through half the bag of 75 for all of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Some teeth are just prone to stuck food, which can be uncomfortable and embarrassing especially out in public.</li>
            <li> --so that was pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> I think the compromise is that to do this the material is very thin and thus shreds and breaks after a decent amount of use.</li>
            <li> I never wanted to try these because I thought it was gimmicky, but one day after eating some lunch I needed floss and just happened to pick these up instead of the other type and was so suprised about how well they work!</li>
            <li> These break in tight spots</li>
            <li> I have really tight teeth and have found these to work well.</li>
            <li> I will say that these floss picks work for me but some people may prefer a little tougher floss.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t break as result as some other brands I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Note the quantity because when they arrive and you have 450 of these little guys coming.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need at least 2 or 3 to floss your teeth as the floss comes loose from the plastic holder way too easily.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves these and uses them everyday.</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of comments about people having trouble with them breaking.  </li>
            <li> I wish they would make ones with no mouthwash, just plain.</li>
            <li> I like the taste of the mint scope, but the taste is not strong to me.  </li>
            <li> If there is a lot of food trapped between my teeth, the floss could be quite loose, or perhaps even broken, by the time I am done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very tight spaced teeth</li>
            <li> I have very tight contacts on my teeth to the point where the dentist has issues flossing them during appointments.</li>
            <li> The Quality of the floss is very bad and they break up easily.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very close together, so some floss just doesn&#x27;t work for me or is too painful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how Oral B can put their name to this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Next to useless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think they are the same quality as the drug store variety.  </li>
            <li> I find myself pretty disappointed with these.  </li>
            <li> And these are not cheap, well at least not inexpensive to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Decided to try these because I find flossing with my big hands so difficult.</li>
            <li> and I can usually solve my problems with just the pointy</li>
            <li> I can usually floss/</li>
            <li> that is what I usually buy (GUM brand picks)</li>
            <li> If i where to use regular floss i have to use glide or a very thin floss and even then it breaks too.</li>
            <li> These are the worst floss picks I&#x27;ve used because the string breaks so easily.  </li>
            <li> Terrible quality and break extremely easily.</li>
            <li> the floss would break after going through two or three teeth, and they were so hard to get in between teeth.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> They do tend to shed every not and then, and hardly ever break</li>
            <li> We prefer no flavor, but those are hard to find.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t break on the teeth that are hard to get between, like some floss picks I have used have done.</li>
            <li> and I am surprised  what a bad product this is.  </li>
            <li> and i probably need to use at least 2-3 of them at once.</li>
            <li> and I always have to use at least 3 to get done flossing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even pulled a few out of the bag already broken.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like the thread is too thick or</li>
            <li> I hate using plain old dental floss.  </li>
            <li> Those stupid things broke, one after the other, until I finally gave up and called my dentist.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also like the subtle minty flavor.</li>
            <li> These picks are RIDICULOUSLY flimsy.</li>
            <li> but they are different and definitely the worst.  </li>
            <li> Unless you seriously have a gap between each teeth, the floss will break due to very thin and weak string.  </li>
            <li> Frustrating to say the least.</li>
            <li> The floss stretches and becomes useless after a few teeth and</li>
            <li> When I had run out of the one pack I purchased a while back, I was shocked and abhorred that the &amp;#34;picks&amp;#34; were not on the shelves.</li>
            <li> The floss is extremely weak so it shears</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it disappointed on all possible counts.  </li>
            <li> However, they becomes tough to find.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finished flossing and have a dozen broken sitting on my death.</li>
            <li> Poor quality product.</li>
            <li> And THEN a bit of the broken one gets stuck between my teeth.</li>
            <li> These floss picks are incredibly frustrating, the floss is not anchored in the plastic pick, consequently, upon flossing they break.  </li>
            <li> Unbeleivable poor quality, did they do any testing on these???</li>
            <li> I am addicted to these.</li>
            <li> The dental tape is thin and doesn&#x27;t get stuck between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed that I spent money on them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it does its job but floss itself is very weak</li>
            <li> The worst part, the floss often tares apart in shreds (when it doesn&#x27;t break entirely), leaving threads of this stuff stuck in between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> he purchased a different brand and they were awful.  </li>
            <li> I really hate writing bad reviews, but this is a product that simply shouldn&#x27;t have been made.</li>
            <li> The floss breaks without fail before I finish flossing.  </li>
            <li> But the exceedingly low quality of the floss makes this a horrible purchase.</li>
            <li> If I ever find myself with an annoying &#x27;something&#x27; stuck between my teeth (which I hate), I usually (hopefully) have one of these little things nearby to fix the issue in two seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that observation this product is terrible, with the floss popping off the holder every two or three teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely infuriating.</li>
            <li> and she could tell I was unhappy.</li>
            <li> i was so disappointed and angry.</li>
            <li> These are completely useless!</li>
            <li> I found the \\&quot;d\\&quot; shaped holders very difficult to manuever around the teeth.</li>
            <li> The floss shreds and breaks so badly</li>
            <li> Sometimes you get a bad bag and they break.</li>
            <li> If you care about your teeth, hate to floss or find it difficult, these are a must!</li>
            <li> I am totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worthless.  </li>
            <li> These are really worthless.</li>
            <li> I always hated flossing growing up because the floss hurt my gums</li>
            <li> These are the worst floss picks I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> These are terrible floss picks!  </li>
            <li> These are terrible because they keep breaking!</li>
            <li> these are the worst floss picks I&#x27;ve Ever used.</li>
            <li> This has got to be the worst product I have bought off of Amazon, ever, in any category.  </li>
            <li> And the worst part?  </li>
            <li> These are the worst of all for four reasons.  </li>
            <li> Bought cheaper one, and they were horrible.</li>
            <li> I would have to agree with some people that, for me, these are terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Used to be alright.  But this time, so many flosses have defects.</li>
            <li> These picks, while they have some good reviews, have all of the common problems of cheap floss picks and more:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. They break and pull apart very easily. I finished flossing and have a dozen broken sitting on my death. It looks like a floss pick massacre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Threads break off and get stuck in your teeth. Some reviewers say this does not happen, but it does, and frequently, even if you have only moderately close teeth. This is highly annoying and hurts, but also causes me to use a lot more picks trying to get the stuck pieces out, but those keep breaking as well, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Unlike other cheap floss picks, these have another serious problem. They are not a sting but more of a band, with a sharp edge. This cuts up my gums frequently, even when other most picks would not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Finally, they are more expensive than other picks! Yet not worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to use, the threads wear out easily and is no adequate replacement for ordinary floss. I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have this setup on a 6 month shipment subscribe and save, and it works for me because the family goes through them around that time.</li>
            <li> Strings break far too easily compared to similar products.</li>
            <li> Yes, the floss tastes good, but like many other reviewers, I found these floss picks to be of exceptionally poor quality.  If even modest sideways pressure is applied against the tooth (which is the point of these, after all) they quickly either (a) break, (b) shred, or (c) pull apart where the floss is attached to the frame. I typically have to use 4 or 5 of these to get through a single flossing!  I&#x27;ve used floss picks from GUM that last for many floss sessions as opposed to these, which can barely do a few teeth.  I cannot conceive that Oral-B tested these properly under realistic conditions.  I&#x27;m very surprised that they&#x27;re so bad, since I&#x27;ve had good luck with most other Oral-B products, including their regular Glide dental floss and their electric toothbrush.  AVOID!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the comfort and ease of using these floss picks. I use one after eating most food of any type. More comfortable than store brands.</li>
            <li> My kids will use nothing else. We love these.</li>
            <li> Best device ever to clean in between teeth. Can&#x27;t find them where I live. Glad they are available at Amazon.</li>
            <li> These are great tools for flossing.  Standard dental floss is just too awkward&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subscribe and save makes this a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus flossing helps you live longer... look it up.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item from my local Target.  I gave this item 2 stars because it certainly has the flavor of Scope, which is nice.  However, within the first few swipes between my back teeth, the floss tore up!  The purpose of floss is to work its way between your teeth to clean in that area, and because this floss tore up immediately within the first use, it did not serve its purpose.  I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have never had floss picks break before. My first flossing session with these I broke 8 of them before I completed. Poor quality product.</li>
            <li> Love this product, no hassle with tearing or breaking floss</li>
            <li> These break or come unthreaded from the pick with the tiniest pull. It&#x27;s like flossing with paper. Even before they break, bits fray off and get lodged between your teeth which requires a follow up floss to remove the bits left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragility is a shame, because the texture and taste are nicer than other floss picks. But see the attached image. I literally went through that pile in a single sitting. Every last one broke or came unthreaded after only a few seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you have abnormally wide gaps between ALL of your teeth, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> best toothpick ever! i buy these in bulk! gets your teeth free of food stuck between your teeth plus floss!!</li>
            <li> LOVE these picks.  They may occasionally break, but they are so smooth and gentle compared to all of the other flossers.  My teeth are very close together and most don&#x27;t work for me, but these are great!</li>
            <li> These work great but I don&#x27;t love the flavor. I wish they would make ones with no mouthwash, just plain. But, they are a great alternative to dental floss.</li>
            <li> They fray and break way too easily. I go through about 10 of them just to floss my teeth. The floss is extremely weak so it shears and if that doesn&#x27;t happen the anchor point holding it on to the plastic always comes off on side leaving it unusable. Frustrating to say the least.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I have always dreaded flossing, and honestly, skipped it many days.  We have tried different flossers as well as the packaged string floss.  But nothing changed the dreaded process for us.  I saw these one day while looking for supplements and thought I would order some just to try them.  I read some reviews and they seemed to be well liked.  And I am SO HAPPY that I did order them.  My husband tried one the day they arrived and mentioned how much he liked it.  So, of course, I wanted to try one myself since he has never said  anything positive about flossing or the flosser.  And I have to say that I was hooked.  Now neither of us skip our flossing.  Very good product.  The only regret I have about this product is that I didn&#x27;t discover it years ago.  We won&#x27;t even consider buying a different kind in the future.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love these floss picks.  Their design makes them easy to use.  I&#x27;ve tried other floss picks with different shapes, and these are the best in my opinion.</li>
            <li> By far, these are my favorite dental picks.  I have tried most and these are the best!</li>
            <li> Love these. Can&#x27;t find them in the stores</li>
            <li> For 38 years I flossed only a few weeks out of the year - I just couldn&#x27;t make it a habit.  But this product changed that.  I LOVE using it.  Regular floss is hard to hold - I have to wrap it around my fingers several times, and it cuts off blood supply to my fingertips!  Plus when it gets wet, it is slippery.  But this product gives you a fine handle that allows you to use it easily.  Also, the floss is a ribbon instead of a rope - so it fits between tight teeth more easily.  And, if it does break, you can get it out of your teeth easily.  I bought like 20 packs of it because I use one or two a day, and plan to have my teeth for many years.</li>
            <li> The floss picks make it so easy for me to remember to floss.  I can keep them hand in my purse, buy the TV and in my home office.  I have NEVER had one break; they slide easily between my teeth as promised. I have lots of problems with some floss catching on my dental work or shredding between my tight teeth, but the OralB floss picks have a smooth ribbon floss that meets the challenge without any problems. The pick end works well too, it is thin enough to fit between teeth comfortable but strong enough to deal with larger pieces of caught food. The long lasting mint, doesn&#x27;t last long but that really doesn&#x27;t bother me. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These are the only floss picks I&#x27;ve found that don&#x27;t break when your fishing for food in your teeth. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> These are worthless flossers as the dental floss breaks so easily or pulls loose from the plastic pick.</li>
            <li> The floss stretches and becomes useless after a few teeth and the pick is too thick for me compared to many other brands I have used.</li>
            <li> Ok, so it doesn&#x27;t break by just looking at it, but ALMOST!  Once it goes in your mouth the floss breaks the moment it touches any teeth.  I&#x27;m not sure how Oral B can put their name to this piece of junk. The worst part, the floss often tares apart in shreds (when it doesn&#x27;t break entirely), leaving threads of this stuff stuck in between your teeth.  So, you have to use ANOTHER one to get the first one out. Often times you end up shredding that one in the same spot and need to try again using just enough pressure to make it between the teeth, but not too much that it leaves another thread stuck there.  Very frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plackers are the ONLY ones I&#x27;ve ever used that simply DO NOT BREAK. Although the name is a bit disgusting, the product is amazing!  http://www.amazon.com/Plackers-Micro-Mint-Flossers-Count/dp/B0013NFZQW/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?rps&#x3D;1&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1332738296&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1</li>
            <li> First note: there is a big difference in using these \\&quot;d\\&quot; shaped floss picks, as opposed to the \\&quot;Y\\&quot; shaped ones that I usually use. I found the \\&quot;d\\&quot; shaped holders very difficult to manuever around the teeth. Other than that observation this product is terrible, with the floss popping off the holder every two or three teeth. Next to useless.</li>
            <li> These are the worst floss picks I&#x27;ve used because the string breaks so easily.  Very frequently, it will fray and leave bits between my teeth, necessitating going through up to four more picks to fish the bits out.  The taste is great but the flossers are nearly useless.</li>
            <li> my husband and i both like floss picks over actual dental floss.  he purchased a different brand and they were awful.  the floss would break after going through two or three teeth, and they were so hard to get in between teeth.  i ordered the oral b kind from amazon.  i don&#x27;t remember why i chose this particular brand, but they are awesome!!  i used it for the first time and was wowed!!  i had no idea floss picks could be so amazing.  they glide through your teeth - feeling gentler and fresher than any other brand i&#x27;ve used.  my husband tried them after me and said the exact same thing... they glide through teeth!  definitely recommend these!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves these and uses them everyday. Great price.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, the floss loosens and breaks quickly when one uses these.  Because of this, they are borderline unusable for their intended purpose.  I recommend [[ASIN:B0013NFZQW Plackers Micro Mint Flossers 90 Count]] instead, as they are much more durable.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t review things unless I love them or can&#x27;t stand them. These floss picks fall into the category of the latter. I have (presumably) normally spaced teeth, yet the floss on these picks breaks after the third or forth tooth. Unless you would like to floss your gums, or your teeth have one inch spaces between them, avoid this product.</li>
            <li> These are the worst floss picks I have ever used!  I can do 1 or 2 teeth and then they break.  I have gone through 75 in less than 4 days.  Don&#x27;t buy these!  They aren&#x27;t made right or something!!!</li>
            <li> Using floss has always been a problem for me; my teeth grow so closely together, the floss cuts my fingers.  This is a wonderful way to use floss daily and they travel well.</li>
            <li> These are the best Floss Picks I have ever used.  If you have teeth that are close together or like a minty flavor this is the&lt;br /&gt;pick for you.  I don&#x27;t know how other people floss their teeth, but these work the best and I floss all the time day or night and&lt;br /&gt;these are really great. I have lots of caps and don&#x27;t have any problems what so ever.  Buy them!  Great product.</li>
            <li> I will say that these floss picks work for me but some people may prefer a little tougher floss.  I am one that doesn&#x27;t like the pull the string out of the box type of floss user. These make my after food flossing easier that using that.  I have tried different types of floss picks and I have found that the oral-b advantages are more gentle on my teeth and gums than other type picks.  The disadvantage to these are that as some have said, yes, they do tend to break easier than other brands, although Oral B has seemingly improved these in the last few purchases I have made.  I have sensitive gums and the other more durable types of floss picks were not comfortable for me.  So for some people like me, these may be great and others may desire a more durable type pick.  For me, I rarely have any of these break before I am finished using them.</li>
            <li> I really hate writing bad reviews, but this is a product that simply shouldn&#x27;t have been made. I&#x27;ve used various floss pick brands over the years, this is the only one that I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. Where you&#x27;d expect to use one at a time, it took 3 to 4 flossers to complete the job because they were so poorly made. They were far more trouble than they were worth. Please do the environment a favor and find this review helpful. Hopefully it prevents more of these from being produced.</li>
            <li> These are terrible floss picks!  The floss breaks completely or pieces come off of them almost every time either my spouse or I use one.  Other Oral B brand floss picks have worked great, but these are really poorly made.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as we use these multiple times per day.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think they are the same quality as the drug store variety.  They would break halfway through each use.  I wrote it off due to the price, but found another source that was cheaper with higher quality.  I won&#x27;t buy them online anymore...</li>
            <li> Very poor quality, many of them break and the floss is very loose when they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> these are the best flossers on the market in my opinion. They use ribbon floss that glides nicely between your teeth. They&#x27;re hard to find in stores so I buy this 6 pack every few months and have been nothing but pleased.</li>
            <li> I found these a few years ago and liked them the most. However, they becomes tough to find.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I was able to find them here. The 6 bag deal is great. Now I&#x27;ll never run out.</li>
            <li> Things I love about these picks: they fit easily between my tightly spaced teeth, they have a tiny burst of mint flavor for the first ten seconds you&#x27;re flossing, and I can keep them in my car and floss when I&#x27;m driving around town (yes, I&#x27;m the weirdo next to you flossing at the stop light).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deal breaker: they break ALL THE TIME. Like two of every three break when I&#x27;ve only flossed maybe four teeth. And THEN a bit of the broken one gets stuck between my teeth. So I have to get out a second one to rescue the first broken bit and try to keep flossing. And sometimes the SECOND ONE BREAKS TOO. So then I&#x27;m on to the THIRD one. It&#x27;s completely infuriating. And this happens EVERY TIME I FLOSS WITH THESE SUCKERS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve switched to a different brand which -- though it doesn&#x27;t slide between my teeth with the ease of Glide Picks -- doesn&#x27;t break and requires only one floss pick for my fabulous, freshly-flossed mouth.</li>
            <li> I find myself pretty disappointed with these.  The floss breaks without fail before I finish flossing.  Same thing is true of our kids. The good news is that I ordered 6 bags of these so using two a day will last us.  I will not buy them again.</li>
            <li> I use these every night. I discovered these after years of telling myself I had to floss and doing nothing about it. These make flossing so easy. There are others out there which are sturdier, but they don&#x27;t glide as easily and hurt my gums. Bottom line, these gliders were easy enough to use that I finally started flossing regularly. Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> I love these!  I always order this multi-pack and when I get to the last bag, it&#x27;s time to order them again.  They are Much more convenient than floss and work just as well.  They end up making you more likely to floss because they are quick and easy to use, and not the more involved ordeal of flossing with regular floss.  Also, you don&#x27;t get your hands wet and germy like when using regular floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep a bag in my desk at work and a snack-sized Ziplock of them in the middle console of my car.  If I ever find myself with an annoying &#x27;something&#x27; stuck between my teeth (which I hate), I usually (hopefully) have one of these little things nearby to fix the issue in two seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: I think it&#x27;s obvious, but maybe not.  Use them once and throw it out.  Don&#x27;t save and reuse the floss picks, and definitely don&#x27;t put used ones back in the bag with the clean ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buy them! : )</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of these primarily because the &amp;#34;long lasting mint.&amp;#34; Sadly, this was not the case. By the time I hit the second tooth, flavor is gone. Ok fine, but at least I can floss with them...wrong! The floss breaks very easily, and even if you can manage to hit a few teeth without it breaking, it still becomes incredibly loose. The only thing worth a damn with these is the pick on the other end, as is the pick on any other decent flosser. My go-to is the &amp;#34;Plackers Micro Mint.&amp;#34; Definitely avoid these and get something else...anything else for that matter.</li>
            <li> These floss picks are incredibly frustrating, the floss is not anchored in the plastic pick, consequently, upon flossing they break.  I&#x27;m so disappointed that I spent money on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to get my money back but one has to keep the receipt and send that in with the UPC code.  I feel this product is not as advertised.</li>
            <li> This things work great.  My toofs love them very much indeed.  They want them every night no matter what&#x27;s for dinner.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worthless.  Plackers don&#x27;t break the way these do.  I don&#x27;t know how anyone can put such a piece of junk on the market.</li>
            <li> These are terrible because they keep breaking! There are times where I literally have to use 4 of these to floss my teeth. The times that I do get through without them breaking, they&#x27;re extremely worn to the point that they&#x27;re about to break. And yes, I use a new pick every time I floss.</li>
            <li> The floss part breaks very easily. I had used the CVS brand &amp;#34;flossers&amp;#34;  and picked these up because Oral B makes good products.These break in tight spots and I am surprised  what a bad product this is.  Back to the cheaper CVS brand, and I hope it&#x27;s back to the lab for Oral B.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very close together, so some floss just doesn&#x27;t work for me or is too painful.  I like this floss because it is soft and it really does glide (like the name) between my teeth so that I can floss with ease.  I also like the subtle minty flavor.</li>
            <li> These are really worthless. They do \\&quot;glide\\&quot; between the teeth but that convenience is more than offset by total lack of durability. In my experience the floss detaches from the pick after one or two teeth. There are many better brands out there.</li>
            <li> Doses a great job, much better than the floss you have to unroll. I would highly recommend over others of it type.</li>
            <li> Although these are great flossers...they specifically state \\&quot;long lasting mint\\&quot;...and they don&#x27;t have any minty taste AT ALL--so that was pretty disappointing. That was a big reason I choose this specific flosser over others that are offered--I def. think they are misleading...you think you&#x27;re getting flosser that will have lots of minty-freshness....and there&#x27;s no flavor at all. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy these again.</li>
            <li> As a person with a lot of dental work, I love these.  The Scope Outlast mint is so much better than other \\&quot;minty-pick\\&quot; type products.</li>
            <li> Great for tight teeth.  Most of the other pick&#x27;s floss breaks when doing my back teeth.  These don&#x27;t and they taste great.</li>
            <li> Break easily under minimal pressure. Had to use 6 or more where other brands would need only one. Unbeleivable poor quality, did they do any testing on these???</li>
            <li> drug stores in my area have replaced this Oral B brand with private label brands, these are much better</li>
            <li> I really never write reviews for anything unless the product is either exceptionally good or bad. In this case its the latter. I used Plackers floss picks previously but ran out, so I bought these because they were a good price and Oral-B usually puts out good products. With my old Plackers, I could floss an entire week without it breaking or becoming unuseable, (yes, I am cheap). But with these Oral-B/Glide picks, I go through 2-3 each time I floss! To me that is unacceptable. I understand if they last a couple rounds or just making it through one flossing, but these dont even do that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess its good that it comes in a bulk pack of 450 floss picks, that way it still takes a while to go through all of them. But I will be switching back to Plackers after I burn through these!</li>
            <li> Good idea, horrible product.  I have to say that the pick(s) on the flossers work quite well but that is where it ends.  The flossers themselves are so fragile that I can clean one, maybe two teeth before they break completely or shred leaving bits of floss between the teeth.  And these are not cheap, well at least not inexpensive to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From now on I will only use Plackers which are very tough and priced right.  I believe that the Oral-B flossers are made in China and it shows.  When will these companies learn that by trying to cut costs, they lose customers?</li>
            <li> As expected!  I love these and buying them here saves me a trip to the store!</li>
            <li> these are the worst floss picks I&#x27;ve Ever used. I have used up to 6 in one session because they break so often. They disintegrate as you use them leaving chunks of floss stuck between your teeth in addition to the food/ plaque ypu were attempting to remove. This is one of those products marketed to make life easier but lends to more hassle than it&#x27;s worth. I&#x27;ve had more luck with Walgreens generic brand.</li>
            <li> I bought these and I have to use 3 of  them to get the job done! They constantly break and shread!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, minty and even my son who doesn&#x27;t like to floss asks for them. I prefer these picks to the long string floss.</li>
            <li> it is amazing with mint flavor. Too good to be true. I dont know what should I say. thanks for reviewing</li>
            <li> We have purchased the Glide floss picks for a couple of years but can no longer find them in stores, so we picked up some of the Oral-B Advantage plus Scope.  It always took two or three of these to finish our mouths.  The floss breaks very easily.  I would not recommend these to anyone.  I finally ordered a case of the Glide Floss Picks from one of the Amazon Merchants.  Much better!</li>
            <li> :D  These picks do the job and they are very durable. I love the value in this offer. If you care about your teeth, hate to floss or find it difficult, these are a must!</li>
            <li> These are my favorite floss picks and I will list out exactly why:&lt;br /&gt;1. The flavor. I am not a fan of peppermint as it almost burns my mouth. The mint flavor of these is more sweet, yet still leaves my mouth feeling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;2. They don&#x27;t break as result as some other brands I have tried in the past. I would say out of a whole package, at the most I have had two break.&lt;br /&gt;3. They&#x27;re extremely convenient to use with one hand, unlike regular dental floss.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy these as I feel the value is wonderful and they fit my lifestyle!</li>
            <li> Not a big string floss person but I lke to use after dinner. One thing I notice is the actual floss is strong. I have caps on my teeth that the bottom of the cap catches the floss, it doesn&#x27;t break easy, the fray is also minimal. Design is good to hold and the pick works good. Great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Because my teeth are very close together, the floss break.s</li>
            <li> This has got to be the worst product I have bought off of Amazon, ever, in any category.  And we do a lot of shopping on Amazon.  The first one I put in my mouth broke on the first tooth.  It always takes 2 or 3 of these to get all your teeth because they break so easily.  I&#x27;ve even pulled a few out of the bag already broken.  And the worst part?  Sometimes when the floss breaks it leaves pieces stuck in your teeth and you have to go get better floss to get it out!  They don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re actually doing a good job of cleaning, and the taste is nothing like regular scope - they taste terrible.</li>
            <li> These picks are RIDICULOUSLY flimsy. The floss shreds and breaks so badly, it took me 5 picks to floss my teeth! These taste great, but they&#x27;re useless so who cares. Plackers are great--I&#x27;ll stick with those.</li>
            <li> Great picks.  They do the trick and are flexible enough to get way in the back.  Note the quantity because when they arrive and you have 450 of these little guys coming.</li>
            <li> Work great on hard to reach tight spots but the flavor leaves my teeth tasting like plastic. Flavorless would be better</li>
            <li> Decided to try these because I find flossing with my big hands so difficult. Makes flossing almost fun.</li>
            <li> We have bought 7 or 8 varieties of floss picks.  These are the worst of all for four reasons.  1) The Glide technology means the slip too much (ask your dentist) and so can&#x27;t properly grip.  2) The Floss break far too easily -- it&#x27;s like they want you to use 3-4 picks each time.  Ridiculous, when it is soooo easy to make a strong floss.  3) The floss bends right away too so it is slack and much easier to break.  Good ones hold firm and don&#x27;t go slack.  4) When they do break the floss often sticks very tightly between your teeth and the only way to get it out is to use a proper floss pick (that God we own so many).  5) Not much mint.. . minty ones are nice. 6) Super expensive!  F-.  There are lots of good ones out there.  The safeway brand is actually great -- super strong.</li>
            <li> The floss thread breaks very easily. You have to use 3 or 4 each time you floss.</li>
            <li> These work, floss doesn&#x27;t shred, and stays taught for entire time. Bought cheaper one, and they were horrible. If you don&#x27;t floss because it is a pain to manipulate the string, these are for you, great for the kids too. Makes flossing easy.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find the GUM picks which never break on Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These break after just two teeth.  I&#x27;ve used several. You will need about 5 of these for just one cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve revised my rating for this item. The floss does break too easy, but the floss is thinner than another product I have tried so it fits easier. Besides that I have found the end of this toothpick is much slimmer than any other I have tried and I can usually solve my problems with just the pointy end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So If you want these to help get food out of your teeth, they&#x27;re good. If you want to actually floss with them, then get something else. These are just fancy toothpicks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of these brands of flossers. I can&#x27;t stand the store brands I&#x27;ve tried because they break so easily and so do these! I was surprised since it&#x27;s a brand name. I&#x27;m surprised there are any good reviews! You have to used several of these unless you get lucky with one that doesn&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best brands I have tried are GUM and Plaqers. They don&#x27;t break at all.</li>
            <li> These are total crap - it says long lasting, but the floss will break upon first use. I am totally disappointed. I bought 6 packs and will be throwing them away. I recommend to look for alternative product.</li>
            <li> The packs of floss is certainly cheapest, but I could never use them well - so I just use floss picks instead.  These picks use a floss that will fit between my tight teeth.  I like the taste of the mint scope, but the taste is not strong to me.  These are my favorite way to floss.</li>
            <li> Tastes good, feels good, but breaks easily and doesn&#x27;t clean as well as I would like.  I would estimate about a 10-20% breakage rate, but this will obviously vary based on the individual--in my case the molars are fairly close together.  As far as cleaning power, I feel like these don&#x27;t get between the gums as well as Plackers...it&#x27;s like the thread is too thick or something.  I would only buy these if they are on sale or if better options are not readily available.</li>
            <li> it does its job but floss itself is very weak and i probably need to use at least 2-3 of them at once.</li>
            <li> I prefer the picks to regular floss and these work well.  They glide easily between teeth without shredding and are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Do not buy. I bought these because I like glide dental floss.i just went through half the bag of 75 for all of my teeth. They break free at the slightest pressure. If</li>
            <li> For all the claims of extra strong floss, they sure break easily. It takes 5-10 to get all your teeth.</li>
            <li> My family uses floss picks frequently. These are not that great, the floss is really weak and breaks easily.</li>
            <li> I have used these floss picks for three years now because I really grew tired of the old pull and tear floss reels. They work great. I use them after every meal prior to brushing with SENSODYNE PRONAMEL and gargling with ACT SPEARMINT FLAVOR MOUTH RINSE. I even keep a pack in my vehicle for when I travel. They work great.</li>
            <li> If you have crowns in your mouth, forget it because it will rupture while using it. I end up using 6-7 every time that I have to floss.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to these. I make sure I stock for months ahead because I am always worried I won&#x27;t find them anymore.</li>
            <li> After recent dental work and expected future work, I elected to floss as often as possible.  It is possible to floss anywhere with these floss picks - while driving to work, watching TV, after a meal or working on the computer.  They also leave the nice taste of Scope in your mouth, although I doubt the amount of Scope is effective for bad breath. I purchase six packages at a time from Amazon to cut down on the price per pick.</li>
            <li> Zero stars. Took 1/4 of the bag to get through all my teeth. Yes, I have close contact on several teeth, but I also had a cavity filled recently that left me with a gap big enough to trap everything, so I carry flossers. These can&#x27;t even handle that without breaking!&lt;br /&gt;And the pick side is so flimsy it is hard to control, and I actually cut my lip pulling it out from between my upper incisors.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted the minty flavour my favorite flossers are missing, but I&#x27;m tossing what remains of these and going back to the old but good flossers.</li>
            <li> DNB DO NOT BUY! Floss breaks easily. I don&#x27;t write reviews often. If you bought it, return it.</li>
            <li> The Quality of the floss is very bad and they break up easily. Don&#x27;t waste money buying this cheap product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that effective! Its better to use a thread instead of buying this product. I rate 1 star for this product.</li>
            <li> The picks are easy to use, durable and do an excellent job in cleaning between the teeth and down to the gum line..</li>
            <li> I hate using plain old dental floss.  These Oral-B picks are the best ones I&#x27;ve found yet.  The floss is reasonably strong and so is the pick.  They even have the minty scope flavor for good measure.  Great product.  Be sure to remember when ordering this that it comes with six(6) bags of 75 picks each.</li>
            <li> I never wanted to try these because I thought it was gimmicky, but one day after eating some lunch I needed floss and just happened to pick these up instead of the other type and was so suprised about how well they work! They make flossing so much more convenient, that for the first time in my life I actually floss on a regualr basis. I also tried cheap generic brands and was highly disapointed. I thought all of them would be the same, but they are no. The key to these is that sring is thinso that it slides in easy....</li>
            <li> The Glide floss picks aren&#x27;t like any other I&#x27;ve used.  They &#x27;glide&#x27; through your teeth much easier than other brands, and especially store brand floss picks. They do tend to shed every not and then, and hardly ever break but they do break. The shredding or breakage never begins until I&#x27;m on the last few teeth, so it never bothers me, and I never see myself grabbing another one to finish the job.</li>
            <li> These work fantastic.  I keep them in my purse, car and desk at the office.  My last check up my dentist said whatever you are doing keep doing it.  This is it!</li>
            <li> Have used this floss for a while now, love it.  Probably the best floss around. U ll save money too if u order the large packs here</li>
            <li> These are the Best picks for the teeth that I have ever used. When I had run out of the one pack I purchased a while back, I was shocked and abhorred that the &amp;#34;picks&amp;#34; were not on the shelves. I couldn&#x27;t believe it . . .I was almost in tears. i was so disappointed and angry. Why were the new style picks all around and not a hint of the kind I wanted. I stopped by my daughters apt. and she could tell I was unhappy. I told her that i was going online to AMAZON and find what I want!&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the &amp;#34;picks&amp;#34; online, I danced around the room, laughing and clapping my hands like a &amp;#34;nut.&amp;#34; I purchased a bundle of 6 packs with 75 &amp;#34;picks&amp;#34; in each, and the price was fantastic! What an experience. They arrived on time and were exactly what I wanted. I am So happy Amazon is such a fantastic company. They truly work hard to keep us Happy!</li>
            <li> Oral B&#x27;s Glide floss is a great product.  It doesn&#x27;t shred easily, or get stuck in between teeth.  I had high expectations for Glide floss picks, but unfortunately this product has a major issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As expected, the Glide floss slides easily in between my teeth, but unfortunately the floss easily becomes loose, and loses tension.  I have some teeth that are very close together, and others that are difficult to floss, and require a little more force.  These picks are generally not up to the task, as the floss often begins to sag after using the pick on just a few teeth.  If there is a lot of food trapped between my teeth, the floss could be quite loose, or perhaps even broken, by the time I am done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are able to use ordinary dental floss without shredding it, then you may be able to use these dental picks without too many problems.  But for those with some tight spots, and places that shred regular floss, you may have some problems using these picks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used [[ASIN:B00015XBE6 GUM Eez-Thru Flossers]].  The type of floss used in the Eez-Thru picks, is not as smooth as Glide floss, but the floss does remain quite taught under heavy usage.  If the Glide picks were as stiff as the Eez-Thru picks, they would be a most excellent and effective cleaning tool.  As this is not the case, I would have to rate the GUM Eez-Thru&#x27;s as the better buy.  While Glide floss is great stuff, these flossing picks are a minor disaster.  Oral B should know better, and clearly needs to a much better job of design and product testing, when it comes to flossing tools. You might want to consider carefully, before buying six packs of these.</li>
            <li> Nice minty flavor. Very easy to use. Durable - doesn&#x27;t break easily. Double use - tooth pick and floss. Value for the money.</li>
            <li> These are the only flosser that my husband and me will buy! These are the only ones that don&#x27;t feel like pulling your teeth out. They are so nice on your teeth.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little flimsy, but for the overall cost I think it&#x27;s an ok product for the price and quantity</li>
            <li> GIven the brand names involved, I had high expectations for this product.  Unfortunately, it disappointed on all possible counts.  The floss itself is very flimsy and breaks easily.  When it does not break it pulls loose from the pick/holder itself.  I can usually floss/pick my mouth with a single generic pick.  With the Oral B Glide/Scope pick, I need three or four.  Sometimes I can only floss one or two teeth before the floss breaks or pulls out.  Never again!</li>
            <li> As countless others have said, these flossers break at the drop of a hat...probably faster.  I generally use 3 or 4 every time I floss.  On the up side, I will be through the bag in no time, and can go back to a better brand.</li>
            <li> The very best floss picks.  These are the only picks we use.  Excellent string, easy to use.  We prefer no flavor, but those are hard to find.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for tight spaces. Sometimes you get a bad bag and they break. But overall good flossers.</li>
            <li> Breaks very easily. After just using on one tooth, it broke on the next.  I have to use several to get one job done.  I won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> I buy them all the time my teeth are very close together but they break easily and I always have to use at least 3 to get done flossing</li>
            <li> Favorite floss forever. But the plastic used to allow me grab it is kind of environmentally unfriendly.</li>
            <li> I have tried many of these and this brand is the only one that fits between my teeth. I also like the flavor and that it is as close to actual flossing-which i hate-as you can get. the dentist even told me he&#x27;s happy i am at least doing this.</li>
            <li> I love these even though they do shred sometimes....they are the best I have found.&lt;br /&gt;They last for all my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;They do a great job. I can even go back and forth on each tooth to clean...</li>
            <li> My girlfriend and I have been using these for a long time now, even before buying them from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes i agree, occasionally one will break, but it all depends on how its being used. My girlfriend for example has never broken one while flossing, but i have. I have very tight spaced teeth and these are the only ones that have worked for me. If i where to use regular floss i have to use glide or a very thin floss and even then it breaks too. Regular floss just doesn&#x27;t fit between all my teeth, or gets stuck, and other floss sticks break almost instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are awesome and i will keep purchasing them in bulk from Amazon!</li>
            <li> What was life like before dental sticks? While most people measure the &amp;#34;blessings of our deeply incorporated civilizations&amp;#34; through technological complications and convoluted unnatural laws. I measure our progress by how far we&#x27;ve come in terms of simple low tech conveniences. And i cannot imagine a time when people had to shove their fingers halfway down their throats to floss your wisdom teeth (if you were able to have them come in), i mean how barbaric.</li>
            <li> I have really tight teeth and have found these to work well. The string is flat as opposed to round and fits better. Would be nice if they were a bit stronger, I usually take two per session but overall a good product.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need at least 2 or 3 to floss your teeth as the floss comes loose from the plastic holder way too easily.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended at all. Clearly there is either a design or manufacturing error.</li>
            <li> These Oral -B Floss Picks use &amp;#34;Glide&amp;#34; Floss. This floss makes it much easier to get between tight teeth and is doesn&#x27;t shred lke other floss. These picks are convenient and can be used in a discreet manner.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very tight and most flosses are too thick to use without pulling at my teeth. These are thin enough to pass through my teeth easily and I like the Scope taste to freshen my breath. I can&#x27;t day much about the shredding because I also use Plackers fine floss for tight teeth and they also shred on me. I am glad these are in the subscribe and save program.</li>
            <li> I would have to agree with some people that, for me, these are terrible.  Unless you seriously have a gap between each teeth, the floss will break due to very thin and weak string.  I have to use 2 or 3 to get my whole teeth flossed if I am lucky.  I prefer Dentek.</li>
            <li> These work, and are much easier to use than traditional floss. occasionally one will break in between teeth but it is a rare occurrence.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different floss picks and these are the best. First, they have a minty coating on the floss that makes me feel I am both flossing and eating a breath mint. Second, the string is plenty strong so it doesn&#x27;t break on the teeth that are hard to get between, like some floss picks I have used have done. Third, the plastic pick is thick enough that pieces of it don&#x27;t break off in between your teeth, yet thin enough to easily get at any food stuck in your teeth. Fourth, the pick has a fine texture to it (like fine grain sandpaper) and when I rub it in between my teeth it makes me feel like I&#x27;m rubbing off the plaque. In short, these are the best floss picks I&#x27;ve ever used!!!</li>
            <li> I would love these floss picks if they didn&#x27;t break so easily. I love the design and the way they glide between your teeth.  I love the product and always go back to this brand because of the design.  I almost always use 2 or 3 picks as the floss breaks easily.  I don&#x27;t feel it is my teeth because it happens on my kids and husband as well.</li>
            <li> Two reasons they&#x27;re my rescue flossers:&lt;br /&gt; - It&#x27;s not really possible to use regular floss when one hand is injured.  I had carpal tunnel surgery and wasn&#x27;t able to grip regular floss, so these saved the day; just one hand, whether it&#x27;s the dominant hand or not, will do the job.&lt;br /&gt;- Some teeth are just prone to stuck food, which can be uncomfortable and embarrassing especially out in public. You can hold one of these in your hand and very discreetly dislodge whatever&#x27;s stuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews about the floss breaking and cannot understand what in the world would be happening to cause that, because it&#x27;s very strong floss that I have never had break.</li>
            <li> I always hated flossing growing up because the floss hurt my gums and I never quite figured out the best way to use it.  These use-and-toss flossers are fantastic because it&#x27;s more of a soft ribbon of floss than a tight string.  It flows easily between teeth and has a slight taste of mint.  The only drawback is that on occasion the floss will break between your teeth and you have to use a second one to get any remnants out and finish the job.</li>
            <li> I just went through 5 of these during one cleaning because every time I went to use one it broke. DO NOT WASTE YOU MONEY!</li>
            <li> Can´t say much but this floss picks from oral B are perfect to clean what you can´t reach!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect combo for the cleaning items</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using these for years and I love them.  Other flossers give me that finger nails down a chalkboard feeling, these are so smooth and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only time I have a problem with them breaking is when I push down hard when it&#x27;s not lined up properly.  Entirely my fault.</li>
            <li> These things work great.  I use 2 when flossing my teeth and have never had one break on me. 1 for the top teeth and 1 for the bottom teeth. I saw a lot of comments about people having trouble with them breaking.  You need to floss correctly.  If you push straight down and try and push it in they wont work.  You&#x27;re supposed to do a back and forth action with slight pressure.  This helps clean the teeth and keeps the floss picks from breaking.</li>
            <li> Tried several brands, these are our family go to for flossers</li>
            <li> I purchased a package of 75 of these floss picks from a Walgreen&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a variety of floss picks, and these are the first I consider a waste of money. Instead of traditional floss string, it uses a strip, which I thought would be a nice change. But the floss strip breaks easily, and it took me as many as four picks to finish the job (and to get bits of floss out of my teeth). I can&#x27;t believe that this product made it to production with this kind of problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpick end is smooth and curved, which could be what some are looking for. But the exceedingly low quality of the floss makes this a horrible purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a great purchase. I bought the 6 pack of these and I never miss flossing my teeth. 1 bag in car, 1 in gym bag, 1 at work, and the rest at home. Flossing is important for the health of your gums and these individual use flossers make it easy.</li>
            <li> I love flossing. After every meal and snack. Having these little babies on hand make flossing quick and easy. Plus there&#x27;s no messy &amp;#34;wrapping of the floss&amp;#34; around your fingers. They even have a handy little pick on the opposite end for those who enjoy toothpicks. Great to keep in my purse, I use an old altoids tin so they don&#x27;t roll around in the bottom of my bag.</li>
            <li> I used to swear by these picks. The dental tape is thin and doesn&#x27;t get stuck between my teeth. The picks were strong and sturdy and were so easy to use that I actually started to floss my teeth twice everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I ordered the 6-pack from Amazon with Subscribe and Save. Now I notice that the picks shred easily and break after two teeth. Some of the tape broke off and got stuck between my molars when I was flossing and I used over 20 picks trying to get the loose tape out. Those stupid things broke, one after the other, until I finally gave up and called my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the last shipment I got was all counterfeit picks!!! The logo on the picks DOES NOT match the Oral-B logo. So be warned! These SUCK.</li>
            <li> The best amongt the floss picks I have tried so far, and I have used a dozen brands.&lt;br /&gt;Pro: very smooth and can reach every nook and cranny.&lt;br /&gt;Con: Easy to break. If Oral-B could improve on the strength, it would be a five-star rating</li>
            <li> Floss breaks easily,and the pick side is flemsy, took six picks to finish flossing because the floss would snap. I would not advise anyone to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I personally love these.  They are so convenient and that causes me to floss more and the tooth pick come in real handy.</li>
            <li> Just as described. I love using this floss since it does not get stuck or break apart in between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Glide picks for years and loved them but these Oral-B ones may have the same logo on them but they are different and definitely the worst.  Not only does it now take 2 or 3 of them to get through a single cleaning, they break so readily they often leave threads stuck in my teeth requiring more flossing to remove.</li>
            <li> The best on th market.</li>
            <li> Love this design hold In your hand and you don&#x27;t have to pull out and foot of floss to clean your teeth..</li>
            <li> These suck! Break so eaily you will go thru 3 of them just to floss once.  BUY THE GUM BRAND INSTEAD.- that is what I usually buy (GUM brand picks) and you could reuse the same pick (not that you would) to floss yr entire mouth ten times without the floss breaking.  The Oral B brand of picks SUCK - incl every type they sell such as 3D White, etc.</li>
            <li> The only brand I can find made in the USA!!!&lt;br /&gt;I called the company and they said if it doesn&#x27;t say made in China then it is made in the USA!!!</li>
            <li> I subscribe and save to these. They work great and with the subscribe and save I never run out. These work good, are pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> These seem to be the only floss picks that my fillings don&#x27;t cut to shreds.  They fit in the tight gaps too.</li>
            <li> My family&#x27;s favorite. The floss glides easily in between teeth. They have a nice minty taste. Plus I like the pick at the end for extra cleaning in between teeth.</li>
            <li> I rely on these floss picks. I have very tight contacts on my teeth to the point where the dentist has issues flossing them during appointments. I was unable to floss with traditional flosses, but these picks gave me more leverage and made it possible to floss my rear molars properly. The difference in gum health was noted at the appointment I started using these after. I gave a bag to my younger sibling and it encouranged him to floss more.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality and break extremely easily. The higher star ratings must have been for another, similar Glide product. These are completely useless!</li>
            <li> Have no idea why folks wrote that these picks weren&#x27;t durable.  They are great, and we have had no problems with broken strings.</li>
            <li> I specifically tracked these down online and was willing to pay for 6 packages of them as I enjoyed how easily they slipped between my teeth. Really makes flossing a breeze. I think the compromise is that to do this the material is very thin and thus shreds and breaks after a decent amount of use. It&#x27;s probably good to not use the same flosser anyway, but be warned, if you&#x27;re someone who likes to constantly reuse the same pick you won&#x27;t have any luck here.</li>
            <li> I love these things.  Amazon offered them for slightly cheaper than my local grocery store.</li>
