            <li>but I love this fragrance.  </li>

            <li>My husband of 48 years still tells me you smell so sexy</li>

            <li>I enjoy this cologne!  </li>
            <li>Smells awesome, can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume to wear and my favorite to smell.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li>Not overpowering, warm and absolutely FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>and I love the combination of the sandalwood with the flowery undertones.</li>
            <li>She has been using it for many years.</li>
            <li>This is our favorite perfume</li>
            <li>I have bought a bottle of this in the mall before for more than $50, so this is truly a steal.</li>
            <li>I just have to use more of it and more often then before.  </li>
            <li>always have been and will be my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have allergies, so most parfums give me headaches.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m glad that i went through with it.</li>
            <li>love this.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this perfume.</li>
            <li>she love this perfume</li>
            <li>Forever Elizabeth has been my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite scents, I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li>Works for me! :)</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love her perfume</li>
            <li>and I chose to buy this perfume because I love the smell of it</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>my wife likes it, I even checked and it has a nice smell I recommend this product, it is good and reasonable price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money but, through this company you receive the best prices ever, and I recommend them highly.  </li>
            <li>and you look so pretty, hey women of all ages if you want to smell good and feel sexy buy you some forever by Elizabeth Taylor</li>
            <li>The shipping very fast and good product.</li>
            <li>AND I FEEL IN LOVE WITH ITS CLEAN REFRESHING SCENT.  </li>
            <li>unlike other perfumes that might have a lighter scent, it&#x27;s best to apply this sparingly.</li>
            <li>but it wears off very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It doesnt come across strong, but does stay with you through the day.  </li>
            <li>Every perfume we try from them tested excellent and they smell really good and last long .</li>
            <li>smells that just don&#x27;t fit too well with me.</li>
            <li>If you like extremely light fragrance you&#x27;ll enjoy it .</li>
            <li>Light with a tinge of floral.</li>
            <li>Overall a great scent that can be worn at any time of day.</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery!!!</li>
            <li>It has a light clean scent that doesn&#x27;t jump out at people</li>
            <li>I purchased it retail many years ago for a much higher price.</li>
            <li>It is all well worth it!</li>
            <li>Been looking for this for a long time so happy with it</li>
            <li>Everyone says I smell fresh!</li>
            <li>but overall the perfume is a very good perfume for a woman to where it really attracts people</li>
            <li>Has a clean scent that lasts well.  </li>
            <li>Not to loud... love it!</li>
            <li>This was a great purchase and I received it before the date expected.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume so much I keep buying it again and again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!  :)</li>
            <li>AND IT LASTS FOR HOURS TOO NO BAD ABOUT IT</li>
            <li>At my door step quickly THANK YOU</li>
            <li>more like clear glass that catches a iridescent glow in the light.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume and it normally costs me $45.  </li>
            <li>To me its a sweet but fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Adult yet cute and sexy, sophisticated for any female woman, not strong and over bearing has a  nice and light scent .</li>
            <li>I really enjoy its sweet soft scent.</li>
            <li>I did not like much because the fragrance is going very fast, I think it should be a raplica, the original</li>
            <li>I am personally very picky when it comes to perfumes, but this one is my my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>Very nice fragrance, Not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It is not easy to find but to me it is worth it,I get a lot of comments on how good it smells when I wear it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy again when ever I finish this bottle which might happen real soon!</li>
            <li>Pretty fragrance.</li>
            <li>The bottle isn&#x27;t as pretty as the picture-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to using White Diamonds and love it.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I first came across this perfume as part of a gift box with trial-size perfumes.</li>
            <li>Not as long lasting as Passion but very nice.</li>
            <li>This was for the large bottle also.</li>
            <li>Large bottle...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even really describe how.</li>
            <li>I get stop so much from women and men asking what am I wearing .</li>
            <li>and i guess it does not sell that much and</li>
            <li>This cologne is very costly at high-end stores.  </li>
            <li>The scent really grows on you</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle since I can&#x27;t keep it for my 17 year old daughter uses it more than I do.</li>
            <li>I like that the scent is soft, but it has no personality to it, and doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour on you.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>Classy soft clean yet chic...  </li>
            <li>I have given this item four stars only because I&#x27;m not as familiar with it.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff ,it last a long time and you really cant beat the price at all !</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the real deal not cut with water brand new in box will buy again</li>
            <li>I ordered this eau de parfum because I&#x27;d previously ordered \\&quot;Lavender Eyes\\&quot; by Elizabeth Taylor, and I love that fragrance.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that likes their items on their doorstep quickly, the quality of their items at its highest and everything handled properly.</li>
            <li>Will definitely come back for more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more than eBay</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this perfume and have gotten quite a few compliments about it.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Forever Elizabeth\\&quot; is a lovely scent, but, within a few minutes after I put it on, the fragrance is gone.</li>
            <li>The price was great compared to other stores and other only fragrance shops.</li>
            <li>Got it in 2 days, it was a new bottle, unopened.</li>
            <li>A name associated with mature women but younger girls will be very surprised how soft and sweet this fragrance is.....</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find it in a larger size than usual and at a resonable price.  </li>
            <li>Very soft, sits close to the skin, you&#x27;ve smelled in on a million women over and over again.</li>
            <li>MY DAUGHTERS GAVE THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME LAST YEAR FOR MOTHERS DAY</li>
            <li>:) I usually one use one spray worth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The one minus is it fades quickly</li>
            <li>This is one perfume that surprised me from the start.</li>
            <li>Arrived early.  </li>
            <li>Its an old perfume</li>
            <li>I am still turning heads at 62 years old</li>
            <li>While wearing this soft, earthy, floral scent, I&#x27;ve had people stop me on elevators, in stairs, at work- just to find out what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li>She is 38 years old which may help some of you trying to make a decision on this.</li>
            <li>and I love it and only need to use a small amount.  </li>
            <li>Found out it was discontinued,  found at several stores, but the cost was way to high.  </li>
            <li>Price reasonable as long as she doesn&#x27;t bath in it.  </li>
            <li>I find myself having to spray several times a day for a very minimum scent unlike when it was sold in the retail stores that afford me a longer lasting effect.</li>
            <li>After wearing it for a few weeks, I still love the scent however, the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>but I noticed there was a major difference.</li>
            <li>this is something that came in right on time because i was running low on my other perfumes that i have here in my house.</li>
            <li>Bad decision buying this without smelling it first lmao.</li>
            <li>A well-kept secret:)</li>
            <li>still the second and third bottle smelled old.</li>
            <li>When I got the 3.3 ounce bottle in the mail, I was surprised that the smell was slightly different from the smaller size (a bit sharper, stronger).</li>
            <li>Price has really come down now from it</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering, warm and absolutely FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> and I love the combination of the sandalwood with the flowery undertones.</li>
            <li> She has been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> This is our favorite perfume</li>
            <li> I have bought a bottle of this in the mall before for more than $50, so this is truly a steal.</li>
            <li> I just have to use more of it and more often then before.  </li>
            <li> always have been and will be my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have allergies, so most parfums give me headaches.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m glad that i went through with it.</li>
            <li> love this.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this perfume.</li>

            <li> Forever Elizabeth has been my all time favorite.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents, I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> Works for me! :)</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love her perfume</li>
            <li> and I chose to buy this perfume because I love the smell of it</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> my wife likes it, I even checked and it has a nice smell I recommend this product, it is good and reasonable price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money but, through this company you receive the best prices ever, and I recommend them highly.  </li>
            <li> and you look so pretty, hey women of all ages if you want to smell good and feel sexy buy you some forever by Elizabeth Taylor</li>
            <li> The shipping very fast and good product.</li>
            <li> AND I FEEL IN LOVE WITH ITS CLEAN REFRESHING SCENT.  </li>
            <li> unlike other perfumes that might have a lighter scent, it&#x27;s best to apply this sparingly.</li>
            <li> but it wears off very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt come across strong, but does stay with you through the day.  </li>
            <li> Every perfume we try from them tested excellent and they smell really good and last long .</li>
            <li> smells that just don&#x27;t fit too well with me.</li>
            <li> If you like extremely light fragrance you&#x27;ll enjoy it .</li>
            <li> Light with a tinge of floral.</li>
            <li> Overall a great scent that can be worn at any time of day.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery!!!</li>
            <li> It has a light clean scent that doesn&#x27;t jump out at people</li>
            <li> I purchased it retail many years ago for a much higher price.</li>
            <li> It is all well worth it!</li>
            <li> Been looking for this for a long time so happy with it</li>
            <li> Everyone says I smell fresh!</li>
            <li> but overall the perfume is a very good perfume for a woman to where it really attracts people</li>
            <li> Has a clean scent that lasts well.  </li>
            <li> Not to loud... love it!</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase and I received it before the date expected.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume so much I keep buying it again and again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!  :)</li>
            <li> AND IT LASTS FOR HOURS TOO NO BAD ABOUT IT</li>
            <li> At my door step quickly THANK YOU</li>
            <li> more like clear glass that catches a iridescent glow in the light.  </li>
            <li> I love this perfume and it normally costs me $45.  </li>
            <li> To me its a sweet but fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Adult yet cute and sexy, sophisticated for any female woman, not strong and over bearing has a  nice and light scent .</li>
            <li> I really enjoy its sweet soft scent.</li>
            <li> I did not like much because the fragrance is going very fast, I think it should be a raplica, the original</li>
            <li> I am personally very picky when it comes to perfumes, but this one is my my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance, Not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It is not easy to find but to me it is worth it,I get a lot of comments on how good it smells when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy again when ever I finish this bottle which might happen real soon!</li>
            <li> Pretty fragrance.</li>
            <li> The bottle isn&#x27;t as pretty as the picture-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to using White Diamonds and love it.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I first came across this perfume as part of a gift box with trial-size perfumes.</li>
            <li> Not as long lasting as Passion but very nice.</li>
            <li> This was for the large bottle also.</li>
            <li> Large bottle...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even really describe how.</li>
            <li> I get stop so much from women and men asking what am I wearing .</li>
            <li> and i guess it does not sell that much and</li>
            <li> This cologne is very costly at high-end stores.  </li>
            <li> The scent really grows on you</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle since I can&#x27;t keep it for my 17 year old daughter uses it more than I do.</li>
            <li> I like that the scent is soft, but it has no personality to it, and doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour on you.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> Classy soft clean yet chic...  </li>
            <li> I have given this item four stars only because I&#x27;m not as familiar with it.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff ,it last a long time and you really cant beat the price at all !</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the real deal not cut with water brand new in box will buy again</li>
            <li> I ordered this eau de parfum because I&#x27;d previously ordered \\&quot;Lavender Eyes\\&quot; by Elizabeth Taylor, and I love that fragrance.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that likes their items on their doorstep quickly, the quality of their items at its highest and everything handled properly.</li>
            <li> Will definitely come back for more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more than eBay</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume and have gotten quite a few compliments about it.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Forever Elizabeth\\&quot; is a lovely scent, but, within a few minutes after I put it on, the fragrance is gone.</li>
            <li> The price was great compared to other stores and other only fragrance shops.</li>
            <li> Got it in 2 days, it was a new bottle, unopened.</li>
            <li> A name associated with mature women but younger girls will be very surprised how soft and sweet this fragrance is.....</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find it in a larger size than usual and at a resonable price.  </li>
            <li> Very soft, sits close to the skin, you&#x27;ve smelled in on a million women over and over again.</li>
            <li> MY DAUGHTERS GAVE THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME LAST YEAR FOR MOTHERS DAY</li>
            <li> :) I usually one use one spray worth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one minus is it fades quickly</li>
            <li> This is one perfume that surprised me from the start.</li>
            <li> Arrived early.  </li>
            <li> Its an old perfume</li>
            <li> I am still turning heads at 62 years old</li>
            <li> While wearing this soft, earthy, floral scent, I&#x27;ve had people stop me on elevators, in stairs, at work- just to find out what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> She is 38 years old which may help some of you trying to make a decision on this.</li>
            <li> and I love it and only need to use a small amount.  </li>
            <li> Found out it was discontinued,  found at several stores, but the cost was way to high.  </li>
            <li> Price reasonable as long as she doesn&#x27;t bath in it.  </li>
            <li> I find myself having to spray several times a day for a very minimum scent unlike when it was sold in the retail stores that afford me a longer lasting effect.</li>
            <li> After wearing it for a few weeks, I still love the scent however, the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> but I noticed there was a major difference.</li>
            <li> this is something that came in right on time because i was running low on my other perfumes that i have here in my house.</li>
            <li> Bad decision buying this without smelling it first lmao.</li>
            <li> A well-kept secret:)</li>
            <li> still the second and third bottle smelled old.</li>
            <li> When I got the 3.3 ounce bottle in the mail, I was surprised that the smell was slightly different from the smaller size (a bit sharper, stronger).</li>
            <li> Price has really come down now from it</li>
            <li> I usually dont purchase et&#x27;s fragrance because they are a little strong for me.  </li>
            <li> I guess it might have a hint of old lady and a couple other</li>
            <li> This was larger than expected and the total order of two cost less than one bottle of the smaller size where I would normally buy it.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something that is long lasting but not overpowering, I would recommend forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle and will continue to wear this as long as it&#x27;s being sold.</li>
            <li> The scent last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Not what i expected i have been using this product for years and the scent always last for the entire day and people always ask what are you we wearing.</li>
            <li> The bottle was larger than was expected</li>
            <li> Tried to find this for so long in the Bahamas ,but they discontinue it .</li>
            <li> My wife have been using this for long...</li>
            <li> Fast delivery after a bit of a slow start in shipping.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is mediocre, bottle is pretty tho!</li>
            <li> It was not full strength and the fragrance didn&#x27;t last long on my skin...like it was watered down somewhat.</li>
            <li> It has gotten harder to find.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think one way or the other about it.</li>
            <li> The other review were correct.</li>
            <li> so I am very careful which fragrances I purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought the perfume as a gift for two female friends of mine (both in their late 50&#x27;s/early 60&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the lasting power is next to nothing on me and it vanishes as soon as I spray it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;used to buy it for $ 70 -80 dls and now less than $20 is a gift.</li>
            <li> When I found it on here for less than half the price had to get 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> This is totally different not lasting it think it may be fake.</li>
            <li> that expensive compared to some of those new star name fragrances.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little while to arrive at your home</li>
            <li> This perfume had been given to me as a gift a few years ago and I wanted to give some as a gift to a family member for Christmas</li>
            <li> Came well packed and in within few days.</li>
            <li> It is one of my favorites for everyday.</li>
            <li> very little scent but</li>
            <li> It didnt smell like it usually do</li>
            <li> Usually when greeting someone or saying goodbye with a hug.</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed on how fast this scent disappears.</li>
            <li> It has gotten hard to find.</li>
            <li> Not too overpowering, but not so subtle that it fades immediately.  </li>
            <li> Too bad that it doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> but the seller refused to give me the address to send it back so that is why I am giving this a Bad review</li>
            <li> i been addicted to this perfume sence about 6 years ago and still my faborite.</li>
            <li> Very subtle fragrance, but not wimpy.  </li>
            <li> A very weak immitation scent.</li>
            <li> I received the wrong order</li>
            <li> so unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> Who thinks this smells bad.</li>
            <li> My sweetie didn&#x27;t even compliment me :(  </li>
            <li> You will NOT be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Im quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Love this product.Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, so I was very happy when I saw it at Amazon.Thank you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weaker than the sample I have.</li>
            <li> This was larger than expected and the total order of two cost less than one bottle of the smaller size where I would normally buy it. This was a great purchase and I received it before the date expected.</li>
            <li> this is a Christmas gift</li>
            <li> Espectacular este producto, la fragancia es deliciosa y me llego en perfecto estado, ME SIENTO COMPLACIDA DE HABERLA ADQUIRIDO Y MUY SATISGECHA CON LA COMPRA DE EL.</li>
            <li> I have always purchased my perfume from places like perfumania and the others at a discounted price of 45.00 to 60.00. I recently purchase it from Amazon and only paid 23.00. This was for the large bottle also. I will order it again when needed from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My mother gave me a bottle, tried to find in the stores.  Found out it was discontinued,  found at several stores, but the cost was way to high.  Decided to look on Amazon.  So happy that I was able to find for 1/3 of the cost.  I just love amazon</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product. I bought it for my girlfriend, who&#x27;d just run out. It&#x27;s no longer available in department stores and her excitement and joy in the product made it well worth the money. Thank you. Fast delivery after a bit of a slow start in shipping. Thank you.</li>
            <li> ...Who thinks this smells bad. I can&#x27;t even really describe how. I guess it might have a hint of old lady and a couple other smells that just don&#x27;t fit too well with me. Bad decision buying this without smelling it first lmao. Oh well.</li>
            <li> Great came on time. Very satisfied.</li>

            <li> This is one perfume that surprised me from the start. I did not think I would like anything from her line and this is one I did. It is not easy to find but to me it is worth it,I get a lot of comments on how good it smells when I wear it.</li>
            <li> This product was given to me as a gift years ago.  It has gotten harder to find. I was very pleased to find it in a larger size than usual and at a resonable price.  I always have people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing, even at a drivethru window!  Everyone seems to love it.  It doesnt come across strong, but does stay with you through the day.  I recommend this parfum spray.</li>
            <li> I received the wrong order</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and it normally costs me $45.  This is a great value.</li>

            <li> I smelled this fragrace on a passing customer for two days and I finally asked her what the name of the fragrance is and she told me.  I usually dont purchase et&#x27;s fragrance because they are a little strong for me.  I purchased Forever and I love it and only need to use a small amount.

            <li> Wonderful fragrance in a nice bottle. I really liked Elizabeth Taylor so decided to try it because of the name but will rebuy because of how much I liked it.  It is also a great gift for people who like celebrity products and for those who don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Forever Elizabeth has been my favorite for years.  It has a light clean scent that doesn&#x27;t jump out at people but I always get compliments when I wear it.  Usually when greeting someone or saying goodbye with a hug.</li>
            <li> Great value. Large bottle...great price. I will be looking into purchasing this product again. Thank you for offering a great product.</li>
            <li> This has been my cologne of choice for decades and so happy you all carry it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my mother, who has loved this stuff for a couple of decades now.  I don&#x27;t think one way or the other about it. It doesn&#x27;t hurt my nostrils but would not suggest for the younger women.</li>
            <li> Bought the perfume as a gift for two female friends of mine (both in their late 50&#x27;s/early 60&#x27;s).  They both loved the scent.</li>
            <li> This is a basic and generic floral scent. Very soft, sits close to the skin, you&#x27;ve smelled in on a million women over and over again. Unfortunately the lasting power is next to nothing on me and it vanishes as soon as I spray it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that likes their items on their doorstep quickly, the quality of their items at its highest and everything handled properly. It was awesome. No complaints.</li>
            <li> this is wonderful smelling perfume I was always a White Diamonds girl but I love this fragrance.  It is awsome to be able to swith up between them.</li>
            <li> I smelled this product from a friend AND the perfume that came was not like it. A very weak immitation scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more than eBay but it&#x27;s the real deal not cut with water brand new in box will buy again 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍✌️</li>
            <li> my favorite fragrance! And so affordable through Amazon. I purchased it retail many years ago for a much higher price.</li>
            <li> I HAD DIFFICULTY FINDING THIS PRODUCT IN OUR LOCAL STORES SO I DID A SEARCH AND FOUND IT HERE.  MY DAUGHTERS GAVE THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME LAST YEAR FOR MOTHERS DAY AND I FEEL IN LOVE WITH ITS CLEAN REFRESHING SCENT.  PEOPLE ALWAYS COMPLEMENT ME ON HOW IT SMELL.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is mediocre, bottle is pretty tho!</li>
            <li> It was perfect. Got it in 2 days, it was a new bottle, unopened. Smells awesome!! I will definitely order from here again!</li>
            <li> It was not full strength and the fragrance didn&#x27;t last long on my skin...like it was watered down somewhat.</li>
            <li> I Love looking good and smelling good, I am an 62 year old Nannie and forever Elizabeth is the best smelling perfume I have ever bought, Everyone is always asking me what kind of perfume I am wearing and I tell them they tell me you smell so good, I have two grand children, and three more that is adopted and they always say nannie you smell so good. My husband of 48 years still tells me you smell so sexy and you look so pretty, hey women of all ages if you want to smell good and feel sexy buy you some forever by Elizabeth Taylor I am still turning heads at 62 years old my husband is 68 and I still turn him on. Remember forever  Elizabeth by Elizabeth Taylor  order it on amazon. com. Please keep on making this wonderful perfume I want to smell good forever a fan for life Cathy Claybrook</li>
            <li> ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS YES YES YES AND IT LASTS FOR HOURS TOO NO BAD ABOUT IT</li>
            <li> Great price on a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bottle of Forever Elizabeth because of the price...definitely did not smell like the Forever Elizabeth sprays I&#x27;ve bought at malls</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li> this is excellent, just as I needed it to be. I will be ordering the lotion as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim because of the price, and really love the scent.  Not too overpowering, but not so subtle that it fades immediately.  Really a nice surprise</li>
            <li> Great deal best buy love the perfume.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love... did I mention I love this!</li>
            <li> The shipping very fast and good product.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this cologne!  The colognes fragrance stays with you all day.  It&#x27;s worth the money but, through this company you receive the best prices ever, and I recommend them highly.  This cologne is very costly at high-end stores.  It takes a little while to arrive at your home but, they stay in the date guidelines they tell you it will be delivered in.  It is all well worth it!</li>
            <li> Smells awesome, can&#x27;t get enough of it! I&#x27;d buy again when ever I finish this bottle which might happen real soon!</li>
            <li> my faborite perfume ever. i been addicted to this perfume sence about 6 years ago and still my faborite. i know A LOT of perfumes and still my faborite one.&lt;br /&gt;used to buy it for $ 70 -80 dls and now less than $20 is a gift.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected..will buy again</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume to wear and my favorite to smell. The best perfume created</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes. I really enjoy its sweet soft scent.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and my grandma loved it!</li>
            <li> Compliments on this perfume all the time and at a terrific price. At my door step quickly THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance, Not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The bottle was larger than was expected</li>
            <li> great value for the price</li>
            <li> Gave this to my mom and she love the smell of it!</li>
            <li> While wearing this soft, earthy, floral scent, I&#x27;ve had people stop me on elevators, in stairs, at work- just to find out what I&#x27;m wearing. Not overpowering, warm and absolutely FANTASTIC. A well-kept secret:)</li>
            <li> Excellent Purchase!! Fast Delivery!!!</li>
            <li> Classy soft clean yet chic...  They won&#x27;t forget your scent.... Ever...</li>
            <li> this is something that came in right on time because i was running low on my other perfumes that i have here in my house. i like to wear nice things and this was a great buy for me. i am so happy with this product that some people as me who am i wearing and i just tell them.</li>
            <li> Pretty fragrance. Purposefully ordered parfum so it would be stronger and last longer.  No so unfortunately.  The other review were correct. Have to re-apply every 2 hours, I wear it around the house, use it as a room freshener.  My sweetie didn&#x27;t even compliment me :(  It&#x27;s very pleasant tho&#x27; and good price, but I won&#x27;t re-order.  If you like extremely light fragrance you&#x27;ll enjoy it .</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance!!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites. I&#x27;m on my third bottle and will continue to wear this as long as it&#x27;s being sold.</li>
            <li> The bottle isn&#x27;t as pretty as the picture- more like clear glass that catches a iridescent glow in the light.  The scent really grows on you and I love the combination of the sandalwood with the flowery undertones.</li>
            <li> Excellent value.beautiful bottle.classy scent.my fav!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume and it smells great.  She has been using it for many years. Price has really come down now from it was several years ago.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to order a perfume that I had not tested.  A very nice scent and was glad I took a chance!  Two sprays in the morning and another spray at night if I am going out.  Prompt arrival and well packaged.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have given this item four stars only because I&#x27;m not as familiar with it.  My daughter requested it for Christmas because she says it works so well with her chemistry.  She is 38 years old which may help some of you trying to make a decision on this.</li>
            <li> Looked all over hoping to find it some day and I did.</li>
            <li> Smell so good love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle since I can&#x27;t keep it for my 17 year old daughter uses it more than I do. This is our favorite perfume</li>
            <li> I say it smells really nice. I never thought it would smell that good. You  know when the perferm catches ur clothes and you still smell it after you take it off that the type of perfume it is. It well stay on you forever. Lmao. I</li>
            <li> This fragrance is my most loved choice.Tried to find this for so long in the Bahamas ,but they discontinue it .</li>
            <li> My wife have been using this for long... she loves the aroma of the perfume. Best choice among all in the price range.</li>
            <li> got it for my sister, she loves it</li>
            <li> I have bought a bottle of this in the mall before for more than $50, so this is truly a steal. I love the smell of this perfume and have gotten quite a few compliments about it.</li>
            <li> A name associated with mature women but younger girls will be very surprised how soft and sweet this fragrance is.....and it is&#x27;t that expensive compared to some of those new star name fragrances.  The one minus is it fades quickly</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on this fragrance.  I have been using it for years, it is the only perfume that does not give me a sinus headache. The price was great compared to other stores and other only fragrance shops.</li>
            <li> This perfume is very light and refreshing.  I get lots of compliments when I wear it.  You will NOT be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to using White Diamonds and love it. This was cheaper so I decided to try it. I&#x27;m very disappointed. I like that the scent is soft, but it has no personality to it, and doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour on you.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to my White Diamonds.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best perfume&#x27;s that&#x27;s no longer carried in stores.  I will purchase this again in the future.</li>
            <li> It was delivered on time. It doesn&#x27;t last all day as when I&#x27;ve purchased before it was discontinued on stores.. Overall it&#x27;s okay I just have to use more of it and more often then before.  Before I used it in the morning and it last all day.. I will continue to buy though</li>
            <li> always have been and will be my favorite. Adult yet cute and sexy, sophisticated for any female woman, not strong and over bearing has a  nice and light scent .</li>
            <li> I ordered this eau de parfum because I&#x27;d previously ordered \\&quot;Lavender Eyes\\&quot; by Elizabeth Taylor, and I love that fragrance. \\&quot;Forever Elizabeth\\&quot; is a lovely scent, but, within a few minutes after I put it on, the fragrance is gone. Too bad that it doesn&#x27;t last - that&#x27;s why I gave it only 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I have allergies, so most parfums give me headaches. But, this fragrance is very nice and not too powerful. I have been wearing it for years and people always ask me what Im wearing. very nice.</li>
            <li> Been looking for this for a long time so happy with it and I love the sent! Highly recommend this product!  :)</li>
            <li> I did not like much because the fragrance is going very fast, I think it should be a raplica, the original</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. This perfume had been given to me as a gift a few years ago and I wanted to give some as a gift to a family member for Christmas this year.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a huge bottle!! I was surprised!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great smelling perfume. Light with a tinge of floral. I&#x27;ve worn it in the day when meeting friends and I&#x27;ve worn it at night when meeting friends! It&#x27;s one of those perfumes that you can wear to any occasion without it being overbearing, that is unless you cover yourself with it!! :) I usually one use one spray worth.&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived quickly.&lt;br /&gt;No damage because of good packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Huge amount for the price.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent. I am personally very picky when it comes to perfumes, but this one is my my favorite so far. Very pleased with shipping. Came well packed and in within few days. Thank you guys. Will definitely come back for more.</li>
            <li> I would say this is her best. The scent last a very long time. I am ask what type I am wearing.  And I have to tell the FOREVER. Several people have went and purchased some</li>
            <li> this was a good buy and i&#x27;m glad that i went through with it. very happy with the good price.</li>
            <li> love this. only one I use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wear the soften and I love it. I would recommend to others</li>
            <li> It is one of my favorites for everyday.</li>
            <li> smell incredibly tasty, thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this perfume.Love it!</li>
            <li> I buy it for my sister she love this perfume</li>
            <li> was a gift and she loves it</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed on how fast this scent disappears. Forever Elizabeth has been my all time favorite. I ordered two bottles thinking this would be the same I&#x27;ve always bought. The scent is the same but it wears off very quickly.  I Can&#x27;t say Im happy with my pyrchase. Im quite disappointed. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> She loves the stuff.  Scored mucho points.  Price reasonable as long as she doesn&#x27;t bath in it.  I even like the scent.</li>
            <li> Beautiful! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents, I get compliments all the time. Everyone says I smell fresh! Works for me! :)</li>
            <li> I have been using Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s perfume for years and I absolutely love her perfume and I chose to buy this perfume because I love the smell of it but the seller sold me a perfume that did not spray out so now I had to send it back but the seller refused to give me the address to send it back so that is why I am giving this a Bad review but overall the perfume is a very good perfume for a woman to where it really attracts people</li>
            <li> very little scent but what there is is nice.</li>
            <li> I first came across this perfume as part of a gift box with trial-size perfumes. I really loved this one. When I got the 3.3 ounce bottle in the mail, I was surprised that the smell was slightly different from the smaller size (a bit sharper, stronger). I&#x27;ve either gotten used to it or it has improved with use. Overall a great scent that can be worn at any time of day. Note: unlike other perfumes that might have a lighter scent, it&#x27;s best to apply this sparingly.</li>
            <li> Been wearing this for years.It has gotten hard to find.When I found it on here for less than half the price had to get 2 bottles.A lady commented the smell went away after  about an hour.ALL good perfumes you can not smell on yourself but others can.LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I love this stuff ,it last a long time and you really cant beat the price at all ! To me its a sweet but fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Very subtle fragrance, but not wimpy.  Has a clean scent that lasts well.  Not as long lasting as Passion but very nice.</li>
            <li> Not what i expected i have been using this product for years and the scent always last for the entire day and people always ask what are you we wearing. This is totally different not lasting it think it may be fake.</li>
