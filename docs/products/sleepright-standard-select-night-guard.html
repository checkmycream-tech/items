    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I would be very happy if it lasted 6 months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works flawlessly (for me) to stop me from grinding my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This sleep guard is adjustable and fits on my molars perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is the best night guard I have used.  </li>
            <li>Brilliant!</li>
            <li>Great quality product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for those that deal with grinding issues.  </li>
            <li>I tryed many time to wear it switching sizes, nothing work !</li>
            <li>Even if you have to buy more than one a year</li>
            <li>Have been using the product for two months and love the comfort and that it is BPA free!</li>
            <li>It is much better for me than the ones you have to boil and mold.</li>
            <li>I was not at all satisfied with the nightguard, but the company accepted the return without question and refunded my money promptly.</li>
            <li>I think these work well; of course, I&#x27;m never awake to check whether I am still managing to grind my teeth :-)  .  </li>
            <li>Many times I was unconscious about grinding my teeth (aka: bruxism).</li>
            <li>but this one works better for me.</li>
            <li>More convenient than those night guards that need to be boiled.  </li>
            <li>This is much better price for me, and if one is eaten by the dogs no worries.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was the most comfortable mouth-guard I have ever used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Those boil to fit types are much more bulky and not as comfortable as this night guard.   </li>
            <li>I now have a huge problem.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to practice the lips together teeth apart</li>
            <li>So I went to read some of the 1 star reviews and a light went of in my head and reality</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable from the first night.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the easiest to keep clean</li>
            <li>Probably that why it was on special ???</li>
            <li>Sleep Right Guard worked!  </li>
            <li>It helps to keep the teeth separated without touching, unlike most night guards that fit over your entire row of teeth, leaving pressure and soreness in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I keep to the 3X. Comfortable and worth the money.</li>
            <li>You just need to find the right strength.</li>
            <li>Very fast.  </li>
            <li>Even though I think this product could possibly use a bit of tweaking in the front to fit my gum area better, it is so much nicer than the others that I can&#x27;t really complain.  </li>
            <li>When I first tried this I did not like it.</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yesterday I couldn&#x27;t open my mouth more than an inch without experiencing severe pain and today my jaw still feels out of wack and is clicking and locking.   </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a &#x27;grinder&#x27; as I am, you&#x27;ll get relief the first night.  </li>
            <li>definately helps you stop grinding your teeth and sleep peacefully</li>
            <li>I could used it only for 1 week until I decided to get the version with lower ends which fits small mouths perfectly.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the dentist version for a whole lot less money.  </li>
            <li>really fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a much smaller profile than some of the boil to fit models.  </li>
            <li>I have used this brand for well over a year now and have found it to be very durable.   </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really desapointed .</li>
            <li>All thanks to this sleep guard, I don&#x27;t wake up in the morning with splitting headaches and jaw pain anymore.</li>
            <li>find if you leave it in your mouth and get \\&quot;acclimated\\&quot; to its presence, you will have a better chance of finding it still in your mouth in the morning and with less chewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would highly recommend it to those that are seeking relief from night grinding.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product for clenching.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read bad reviews of this product, but it has worked wonderfully for me.   </li>
            <li>-- if I quit wearing it for a few nights I start grinding again, but I feel much better in the morning when I wear it -- my jaw doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>Overall, definetly worth the money.</li>
            <li>It was difficult for me top get the correct fit.</li>
            <li>It is a bit more expensive, but well worth it!</li>
            <li>This is my second one that I purchased ( I somehow lost the first one).</li>
            <li>was using some of that clear tape for closing a package.</li>
            <li>if it doesn&#x27;t clear up, I&#x27;m going to go nuts.</li>
            <li>As I was getting ready to purchase, I noticed the very low star rating and thought \\&quot;What the heck, this thing rocks?\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I clench my teeth in my sleep and this not only prevents me clenching but after a few nights of wearing it, I noticed I was naturally holding my jaw in a more relaxed position during the day.</li>
            <li>However, after trying other products, by Dentek, The Doctor&#x27;s brand and sport guards, I returned to the sleep right select.</li>
            <li>Clearly this night guard works for some people, but after wearing it for a week, my jaw/bite seems totally thrown off.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t chew and grind so much) but ANYTHING in my mouth made me chew harder.</li>
            <li>I have always had a slight gap and didn&#x27;t really pay attention, but after taking a closer look, it is definitely wider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> had 2 front side gum-line fillings pop out in my sleep - had to be due to the pressure from grinding with no support for the upper part of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend that anyone with a night grinding problem at least give this a try.</li>
            <li> spent 39.00 to 48.00 on those (One lost, 2 eaten by my dogs).</li>
            <li> Not good for small mouths also the higher end of the guard would hurt my gums.</li>
            <li> I chewed through the other one</li>
            <li> I can even talk to my husband with it in, which I could never do with the other type!</li>
            <li> I like the looks of this product because the band in front of the teeth is narrow</li>
            <li> so you catch yourself grinding (usually in traffic for me).</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth.</li>
            <li> No more waking up to jaw pain.</li>
            <li> Then I tried a $400 custom made mouthpiece from the dentist (he claimed since it was hard</li>
            <li> 4X is way too hard for me</li>
            <li> Horrible fit.</li>
            <li> No more waking up with jaw and head ache!</li>
            <li> If you are a serious grinder like me, spend the xtra bucks on the stronger style&lt;</li>
            <li> returned it to the drug store where I bought it and they gave me back my money, but this jaw thing is so incredibly annoying and depressing,</li>
            <li> I am getting one of those uncomfortable hockey pucks they call a boil and bite.</li>
            <li> I wish I could be refund, unfortunately I did not keep the box.</li>
            <li> Even when I yawned, I grinded my teeth (weird</li>
            <li> It does seem very expensive for a piece of plastic, but when compared to the $700 dentists charge for custom guards, this is not so bad.</li>
            <li> The difference with this is that it works to correct the bad habit of teeth grinding and jaw clenching.</li>
            <li> I hate them, but they do the job without messing up the alignment of your teeth!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> When I first tried this I did not like it. However, after trying other products, by Dentek, The Doctor&#x27;s brand and sport guards, I returned to the sleep right select. The difference with this is that it works to correct the bad habit of teeth grinding and jaw clenching. You have to unlearn this behavior and in the meantime this protects your teeth. It&#x27;s important to practice the lips together teeth apart so you catch yourself grinding (usually in traffic for me). It does seem very expensive for a piece of plastic, but when compared to the $700 dentists charge for custom guards, this is not so bad. Even if you have to buy more than one a year it still works out cheaper.</li>
            <li> Horrible fit. Made me feel like gagging. Would not recommend</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and within 2 days, arrived at my door.  Very fast.  With that said, this is my second in 1 month.  I chewed through the other one really fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find if you leave it in your mouth and get \\&quot;acclimated\\&quot; to its presence, you will have a better chance of finding it still in your mouth in the morning and with less chewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it a 4 but it&#x27;s not durable enough.  I&#x27;ll see how long this one lasts.  I would be very happy if it lasted 6 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mouth guards since 1989, some made by my dentist, and some over-the-counter for clenching my teeth at night.  I like the looks of this product because the band in front of the teeth is narrow and it&#x27;s a much smaller profile than some of the boil to fit models.  However- I now have a huge problem.  After 7 or 8 months of wearing this every night, my bottom teeth have shifted and I now have an overbite with my teeth no longer in alignment.  It&#x27;s severe enough that it&#x27;s causing a problem with chewing.  I definitely do *not* recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This one works and is simple to use (just as advertised). Have been using the product for two months and love the comfort and that it is BPA free! I plan to purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> I am actually writing this review after coming back to Amazon to buy a 2nd Sleepright mouth guard. As I was getting ready to purchase, I noticed the very low star rating and thought \\&quot;What the heck, this thing rocks?\\&quot;. So I went to read some of the 1 star reviews and a light went of in my head and reality came crashing down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the most comfortable mouth-guard I have ever used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the easiest to keep clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works flawlessly (for me) to stop me from grinding my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using some of that clear tape for closing a package. I went to start the tear by biting the end. I noticed I couldn&#x27;t do it. I went to the mirror and saw that my teeth can no longer touch on the front. They shifted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that I now have a much bigger gap between my two front teeth. I have always had a slight gap and didn&#x27;t really pay attention, but after taking a closer look, it is definitely wider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had 2 front side gum-line fillings pop out in my sleep - had to be due to the pressure from grinding with no support for the upper part of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a five star product for stopping teeth grinding, but the shifting and damage it causes make it a definite NO NO. I am getting one of those uncomfortable hockey pucks they call a boil and bite. I hate them, but they do the job without messing up the alignment of your teeth!</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for well over a year now and have found it to be very durable.   I&#x27;ve read bad reviews of this product, but it has worked wonderfully for me.   It is much better for me than the ones you have to boil and mold. I used those kinds for several years before finding this one.   Those boil to fit types are much more bulky and not as comfortable as this night guard.   Even though I think this product could possibly use a bit of tweaking in the front to fit my gum area better, it is so much nicer than the others that I can&#x27;t really complain.  I would highly recommend that anyone with a night grinding problem at least give this a try. It is a bit more expensive, but well worth it! I can even talk to my husband with it in, which I could never do with the other type!</li>
            <li> Clearly this night guard works for some people, but after wearing it for a week, my jaw/bite seems totally thrown off.  &lt;br /&gt;Yesterday I couldn&#x27;t open my mouth more than an inch without experiencing severe pain and today my jaw still feels out of wack and is clicking and locking.   &lt;br /&gt;I returned it to the drug store where I bought it and they gave me back my money, but this jaw thing is so incredibly annoying and depressing, if it doesn&#x27;t clear up, I&#x27;m going to go nuts. &lt;br /&gt;My advice: pay the money and get a custom guard made by your dentist, don&#x27;t risk developing a chronic condition.</li>
            <li> I tried an off the shelf mouthpiece. Then I tried a $400 custom made mouthpiece from the dentist (he claimed since it was hard I wouldn&#x27;t chew and grind so much) but ANYTHING in my mouth made me chew harder. Now I&#x27;m using a biofeedback device that is a headband -- it&#x27;s not in my mouth. It hasn&#x27;t \\&quot;cured\\&quot; me -- if I quit wearing it for a few nights I start grinding again, but I feel much better in the morning when I wear it -- my jaw doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I was not at all satisfied with the nightguard, but the company accepted the return without question and refunded my money promptly.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth. It was difficult for me top get the correct fit. Also, it leaves indentations in my lower cheeks after I sleep.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the dentist version for a whole lot less money.  If you&#x27;re a &#x27;grinder&#x27; as I am, you&#x27;ll get relief the first night.  It works also for TMJ sufferers.  Very comfortable from the first night.</li>
            <li> 10/10 would buy again. Great quality product.</li>
            <li> I tryed many time to wear it switching sizes, nothing work ! After 5 mn I have to take it off imy mouth because I feel like vomiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really desapointed . Probably that why it was on special ??? still I paid hight price for something who do not work. I wish I could be refund, unfortunately I did not keep the box.</li>
            <li> definately helps you stop grinding your teeth and sleep peacefully</li>
            <li> I think these work well; of course, I&#x27;m never awake to check whether I am still managing to grind my teeth :-)  .  I&#x27;ve used them for over five years now--I order a couple a guards a year.</li>
            <li> Not good for small mouths also the higher end of the guard would hurt my gums. I could used it only for 1 week until I decided to get the version with lower ends which fits small mouths perfectly.</li>
            <li> All thanks to this sleep guard, I don&#x27;t wake up in the morning with splitting headaches and jaw pain anymore. This sleep guard is adjustable and fits on my molars perfectly. Many times I was unconscious about grinding my teeth (aka: bruxism). Even when I yawned, I grinded my teeth (weird but it happened). I sleep with this in my mouth for 3 nights and my mouth muscles are properly trained to keep the teeth apart while sleeping. This is my second one that I purchased ( I somehow lost the first one). Overall, definetly worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is the best night guard I have used.  I have one made by my dentist but this one works better for me.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  I clench my teeth in my sleep and this not only prevents me clenching but after a few nights of wearing it, I noticed I was naturally holding my jaw in a more relaxed position during the day. No more waking up with jaw and head ache! Brilliant!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for those that deal with grinding issues.  More convenient than those night guards that need to be boiled.  It has adjustable settings.  It helps to keep the teeth separated without touching, unlike most night guards that fit over your entire row of teeth, leaving pressure and soreness in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it to those that are seeking relief from night grinding.</li>
            <li> I have used these for years. You just need to find the right strength. 4X is way too hard for me so I keep to the 3X. Comfortable and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Sleep Right Guard worked!  No more waking up to jaw pain. Highly recommend this product for clenching.</li>
            <li> I refuse to spend 400.00+ at the dentist for one of these. Have purchased 3 at CVS that were 4X stronger than this style. spent 39.00 to 48.00 on those (One lost, 2 eaten by my dogs). Bought 2 for that same price on Amazon, however they are NOT the stronger/thicker style and have already started to eat away at the bite plates. If you are a serious grinder like me, spend the xtra bucks on the stronger style&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE- I found temporary guards at Kroger, a 10 pack for 14.00. These say to throw away after 3 uses. But I am getting 2/3 wks out of one. This is much better price for me, and if one is eaten by the dogs no worries. After the last Sleepright fell apart in my mouth while sleeping, I can no longer recommend this product out of fear someone could choke.</li>
            <li> Bought these before from the actual retailer years ago and paid 80 dollars for em. They do work well and now selling for only 20 dollars. Cant beat this deal!!!!!</li>
