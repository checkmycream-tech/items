            <li>This &amp;#34;curler&amp;#34; curled 2 pieces of my hair okay.</li>
            <li>Love the function-steaming, like a spa for the hair.</li>
            <li>I love the tank on the top.</li>
            <li>your like me &amp; can&#x27;t get the perfect curl with a regular curling iron...</li>
            <li>It is one of the most regretful purchases I have every made.</li>
            <li>Curls last, and look beautiful!</li>
            <li>Not as magic as it is stated.</li>
            <li>You get what it is offered and more.</li>
            <li>It brings me a more uniform style.</li>
            <li>I love the way it is packed.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I love it.</li>
            <li>I WILL GIVE FIVE STARS SINCE IT IS PRICED LOWER THAN MOST RETAILERS.</li>
            <li>WORKS LIKE A MAGIC.</li>
            <li>you have to make sure their is not lingering strands because your hair will GET STUCK and from experience I had to unplug and literally dig my hair out</li>
            <li>Then sure you will have a problem.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if others will share the opinion that the hair looks shinier and more healthy.</li>
            <li>I love the steaming part.</li>
            <li>But I feel satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>My husband said my hair seems very natural and beautiful.</li>
            <li>first I think this is too good to be true.well, it did suprise  me.</li>
            <li>The product is so easy to use and retains your style better.</li>
            <li>Just be sure and follow the instruction, if you try to jam to much hair in it, it can tangle, so be patience and it will be gorgeous.</li>
            <li>The color and design are cool!</li>
            <li>so easy so use , fool proof</li>
            <li>It was really easy</li>
            <li>Like I said though it is  easy to correct if you pay attention to what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li>Wow, amazing!</li>
            <li>Forturnately I still got the protective bag and product itself is fine.</li>
            <li>Everything is fine then.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine hair.</li>
            <li>I expect the color to be deeper,but it is fine.</li>
            <li>And it seems fine.</li>
            <li>The spray is amazing after I fill the tank with pure water as requested.</li>
            <li>I am a genuine buyer from Indiana.</li>
            <li>Fantastic thing.</li>
            <li>But I feel comfortable with it after applying it into use for two times.</li>
            <li>I think that might be a bit important.</li>
            <li>I ended up returning this because it didn&#x27;t work great with my long fine hair.  </li>
            <li>but, so excited, I felt I needed to share the experience with someone wanting to purchase one.</li>
            <li>There I got my ideal slightly curls.</li>
            <li>Loved it, works great, long lasting curls!</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s smart &amp; won&#x27;t let your hair get stuck.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>It is special that I could combine the steaming and curling together.</li>
            <li>Really cool.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s is really cool.</li>
            <li>well, the English on the package is not so good, but it is understandable.</li>
            <li>Fiance said it heated up quickly.  </li>
            <li>Heat up quick.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use, fun and fast!</li>
            <li>This is my very first time writing a review on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I also knew because the cord was not packaged in the way most cords are packaged when the item is new.  </li>
            <li>It is easy and fast.</li>
            <li>I filled the tank with pure water as recommended.</li>
            <li>The curls don&#x27;t remains, and at night I just put all of my hair on top of my head with a soft scrunchie, then in the morning</li>
            <li>I love the soft curl.</li>
            <li>The hair is curler than I expect, but it will be more natural after a while.</li>
            <li>Worth my money, I ike it.</li>
            <li>really worth my money.</li>
            <li>#34;It’s special since it is different from the traditional curlers but much more effective than that.</li>
            <li>But got it right after three days.</li>
            <li>Very smart,</li>
            <li>I mean I can have the hair care while making the beautiful curl.</li>
            <li>The instruction is clear and operation is quite easy.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.it  arrived ahead of schedule.  </li>
            <li>Paid a new product price, but received a used one!!!</li>
            <li>I followed the direction on the package carefully and it is amazing when I found how my hair turned out to</li>
            <li>I think it would be harder on my own head of course.</li>
            <li>Seems pretty sturdy.  </li>
            <li>but, it really was worth the beauty it created.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn and it&#x27;s fast too!</li>
            <li>Ripped my wife&#x27;s hair out the first try and ruined mothers day for me.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Recommend the RC pro curl, definitely makes it look &amp; hold better.</li>
            <li>It took a bit of practice, but I could then regulate the tightness or looseness of the curl and place the curl in the exact location that I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li>First time out of the box it was usable.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Very durable!</li>
            <li>I will keep it well;-)</li>
            <li>Quite fast!</li>
            <li>I tried it out first thing</li>
            <li>It is a funny thing.</li>
            <li>And it is the first curl that doesn&#x27;t damage the hair, instead.it gave a spa to my damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Well even better than the last one no matter in the aspects of price, design, color or function.</li>
            <li>99% certain most every brand is made at the same 3 factories in China, just rebranded.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and will save you not only time but lots of dollars at a hair salon.</li>
            <li>And I had a try, not as easy to use  as the traditional one.</li>
            <li>Really smart.</li>
            <li>I have to say I so love the loose wave of my hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, fussy and curly red hair.</li>
            <li>all I have to do is run a brush through my hair and I am ready for work.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>Just received this I love it, working just as expected.</li>
            <li>But it really does curl and it keeps the curl without any product use.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this product.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>First off I was sent a used product that was advertised as new.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it for it worths the price and seems smart.</li>
            <li>It is a high tech product.</li>
            <li>This little gadget makes the prettiest curls ever, always get so many compliments.</li>
            <li>I have no complaint.</li>
            <li>With the curl, I can select the curl direction by sliding the switch to either left or right.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe it for a minute and the fact that more than one person (or anyone for that matter) confirmed they received a used item is a serious red flag.  </li>
            <li>I can live with getting my wife a crappy gift</li>
            <li>My freinds think highly of my new hair styling.</li>
            <li>You CANNOT sell something as new if you sold it before</li>
            <li>The curl give me a new look.</li>
            <li>After I adjusted it, it worked fine and the style last for a long time.</li>
            <li>The thing she pointed out is that it can only do small sections of hair at a time which of course adds more time to get ready in the morning.</li>
            <li>The LED flashing give me the clear direction.</li>
            <li>PLEASE don&#x27;t buy this product, leave it in the hands of professional hair dressers if you want to risk letting them use it on you.</li>
            <li>And she loves it so much that giving me a big kiss.  </li>
            <li>the way to alternate the  direction is a very thoughful idea</li>
            <li>I use it on freshly washed hair, use a little bit of hairspray as I curl each part and it is done.</li>
            <li>The package is great, just the English instruction on it is a little poor.</li>
            <li>Wow, I saw some store sold it like above 100dolloars.</li>
            <li>It’s a big plus for busy people using daily styling tools.</li>
            <li>The part where the English is completely off is when its actually telling you how to put your hair in the product!</li>
            <li>Some of them seemed copied and/or doubled (go through them carefully and you&#x27;ll see what I mean) and more than 15 people a day seem to be writing 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li>My hair has gotten caught in it a few times at first time I began to use, because the sections of hair I grabbed were too big</li>

            <li> And it seems fine.</li>
            <li> The spray is amazing after I fill the tank with pure water as requested.</li>
            <li> I am a genuine buyer from Indiana.</li>
            <li> Fantastic thing.</li>
            <li> But I feel comfortable with it after applying it into use for two times.</li>
            <li> I think that might be a bit important.</li>
            <li> I ended up returning this because it didn&#x27;t work great with my long fine hair.  </li>
            <li> but, so excited, I felt I needed to share the experience with someone wanting to purchase one.</li>
            <li> There I got my ideal slightly curls.</li>
            <li> Loved it, works great, long lasting curls!</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s smart &amp; won&#x27;t let your hair get stuck.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> It is special that I could combine the steaming and curling together.</li>
            <li> Really cool.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s is really cool.</li>
            <li> well, the English on the package is not so good, but it is understandable.</li>
            <li> Fiance said it heated up quickly.  </li>
            <li> Heat up quick.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use, fun and fast!</li>
            <li> This is my very first time writing a review on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I also knew because the cord was not packaged in the way most cords are packaged when the item is new.  </li>
            <li> It is easy and fast.</li>
            <li> I filled the tank with pure water as recommended.</li>
            <li> The curls don&#x27;t remains, and at night I just put all of my hair on top of my head with a soft scrunchie, then in the morning</li>
            <li> I love the soft curl.</li>
            <li> The hair is curler than I expect, but it will be more natural after a while.</li>
            <li> Worth my money, I ike it.</li>
            <li> really worth my money.</li>
            <li> #34;It’s special since it is different from the traditional curlers but much more effective than that.</li>
            <li> But got it right after three days.</li>
            <li> Very smart,</li>
            <li> I mean I can have the hair care while making the beautiful curl.</li>
            <li> The instruction is clear and operation is quite easy.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.it  arrived ahead of schedule.  </li>
            <li> Paid a new product price, but received a used one!!!</li>
            <li> I followed the direction on the package carefully and it is amazing when I found how my hair turned out to</li>
            <li> I think it would be harder on my own head of course.</li>
            <li> Seems pretty sturdy.  </li>
            <li> but, it really was worth the beauty it created.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn and it&#x27;s fast too!</li>
            <li> Ripped my wife&#x27;s hair out the first try and ruined mothers day for me.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Recommend the RC pro curl, definitely makes it look &amp; hold better.</li>
            <li> It took a bit of practice, but I could then regulate the tightness or looseness of the curl and place the curl in the exact location that I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> First time out of the box it was usable.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Very durable!</li>
            <li> I will keep it well;-)</li>
            <li> Quite fast!</li>
            <li> I tried it out first thing</li>
            <li> It is a funny thing.</li>
            <li> And it is the first curl that doesn&#x27;t damage the hair, instead.it gave a spa to my damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Well even better than the last one no matter in the aspects of price, design, color or function.</li>
            <li> 99% certain most every brand is made at the same 3 factories in China, just rebranded.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and will save you not only time but lots of dollars at a hair salon.</li>
            <li> And I had a try, not as easy to use  as the traditional one.</li>
            <li> Really smart.</li>
            <li> I have to say I so love the loose wave of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, fussy and curly red hair.</li>
            <li> all I have to do is run a brush through my hair and I am ready for work.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> Just received this I love it, working just as expected.</li>
            <li> But it really does curl and it keeps the curl without any product use.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this product.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> First off I was sent a used product that was advertised as new.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it for it worths the price and seems smart.</li>
            <li> It is a high tech product.</li>
            <li> This little gadget makes the prettiest curls ever, always get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> I have no complaint.</li>
            <li> With the curl, I can select the curl direction by sliding the switch to either left or right.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it for a minute and the fact that more than one person (or anyone for that matter) confirmed they received a used item is a serious red flag.  </li>
            <li> I can live with getting my wife a crappy gift</li>
            <li> My freinds think highly of my new hair styling.</li>
            <li> You CANNOT sell something as new if you sold it before</li>
            <li> The curl give me a new look.</li>
            <li> After I adjusted it, it worked fine and the style last for a long time.</li>
            <li> The thing she pointed out is that it can only do small sections of hair at a time which of course adds more time to get ready in the morning.</li>
            <li> The LED flashing give me the clear direction.</li>
            <li> PLEASE don&#x27;t buy this product, leave it in the hands of professional hair dressers if you want to risk letting them use it on you.</li>
            <li> And she loves it so much that giving me a big kiss.  </li>
            <li> the way to alternate the  direction is a very thoughful idea</li>
            <li> I use it on freshly washed hair, use a little bit of hairspray as I curl each part and it is done.</li>
            <li> The package is great, just the English instruction on it is a little poor.</li>
            <li> Wow, I saw some store sold it like above 100dolloars.</li>
            <li> It’s a big plus for busy people using daily styling tools.</li>
            <li> The part where the English is completely off is when its actually telling you how to put your hair in the product!</li>
            <li> Some of them seemed copied and/or doubled (go through them carefully and you&#x27;ll see what I mean) and more than 15 people a day seem to be writing 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten caught in it a few times at first time I began to use, because the sections of hair I grabbed were too big</li>
            <li> Well, it works fine just a little difficult to operate at the first time.</li>
            <li> She loves the curl but complained that her hair got stuck in the first time.</li>
            <li> She loves the curl but complained that her hair got stuck in the first time.</li>
            <li> The point is it last for a day long.</li>
            <li> This product is HORRIBLE.First of all, the instructions make absolutely no sense, it&#x27;s hardly English.</li>
            <li> I have long hair below my elbows.</li>
            <li> I have thick straight &amp;#34;Cher&amp;#34; hair and</li>
            <li> I set the lowest temperature and got the loose curl which is what I want.</li>
            <li> With the spray function ,it also fix the problem that the hair will get very dry after the curl.</li>
            <li> All I got from the other kinds of iron is dry hair.</li>
            <li> and I have absolutely no hair styling skills.</li>
            <li> Probably not a very honorable practice.</li>
            <li> I have the medium to long hair, slightly frizzy.</li>
            <li> I fully expected to have to be extremely patient to get the learning curve.</li>
            <li> Big difference in quality and small difference in price.</li>
            <li> other reviewers are saying.</li>
            <li> It got a little stuck a few times, but nothing like the reviewers who were saying they had to cut the hair or break open the curler!</li>
            <li> Not suitable for my short hair.</li>
            <li> The price is way better than others I&#x27;ve seen and also as for the &amp;#34;ripping your hair out&amp;#34; in my opinion you need to be stupid to let that happen because you can automatically feel the tug, which makes you automatically stop.</li>
            <li> This costs less than the average curling iron,it saves me a lot of money.</li>
            <li> and you can only use a very small amount of hair each time.  </li>
            <li> Does not even heat up, much less work</li>
            <li> Does take awhile to do long thick hair though.</li>
            <li> The spral just scared me a little.</li>
            <li> The reviews for this seemed a little off to me.</li>
            <li> Too heavy to use.</li>
            <li> its in broken English and sometimes doesn&#x27;t make sense at all.</li>
            <li> It happened a few times to me but it doesn&#x27;t get caught and rip it out like</li>
            <li> I heavily rely on reviews before purchasing anything .</li>
            <li> I just want to point out that there are in fact a ton of reviews in broken english and the instructions are in broken english.  </li>
            <li> I am going to wait for a few days.</li>
            <li> Instructions have that sloppy English translation in them.  </li>
            <li> I just slowly slid it down to release the curls.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but I wouldn&#x27;t waste my hard earned money on this.</li>
            <li> 1/2-1 inch of hair NO MORE than that.</li>
            <li> The curling iron does not work and seeing other bad reviews looks like we all have the same issue.  </li>
            <li> I am not good at curling the hair, so when I used the traditional one,the curl on both sides would sit casually.</li>
            <li> it was quite hard to get out once its stuck.</li>
            <li> My hair is the thick and wavy style</li>
            <li> So you seriously have to section off</li>
            <li> My hair is thin so it could never holds curl.</li>
            <li> The instructions are in horrible, broken English - very poorly translated.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to apply it into use, I guess it is not for me.</li>
            <li> The mail man sent to the wrong mail box.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use!But</li>
            <li> I will use the wrong side if it is not on it.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to handle at the begining.</li>
            <li> The directions are very poorly written/translated.  </li>
            <li> Was very skeptical bout trying this.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worthless, if I could give 0 stars I would.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> so easy so use , fool proof</li>
            <li> Was very skeptical bout trying this. I LOVE it. Get lots of compliments when I use it. Does take awhile to do long thick hair though. I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it daily. But I love it. Best curls ever.</li>
            <li> I bought Conair for same price. It seems over priced</li>
            <li> I tried this on my daughter&#x27;s ponytail and it came out really cute. I would like to post the picture but it keeps failing. It was really easy and I have absolutely no hair styling skills. I think it would be harder on my own head of course. It got a little stuck a few times, but nothing like the reviewers who were saying they had to cut the hair or break open the curler! I just pulled it out and started again. if I can use this, anyone can. She was really happy with her curly ponytail!</li>
            <li> My girl freind gets the beautiful gold hair. I like the the way she looks when she wearing the curl. yes, the product rocks! My girl freinds looks gorgeous after us e it!</li>
            <li> Big difference in quality and small difference in price. Love it!</li>
            <li> My hair seems more shinny after the steam curling.All I got from the other kinds of iron is dry hair. So to be honest, I am impressed by this curl.</li>
            <li> I sent it as a gift to my girl freind. She loves the curl but complained that her hair got stuck in the first time.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. Looks elegant!</li>
            <li> Just received the one I ordered yesterday.  Seems pretty sturdy.  Fiance said it heated up quickly.  All the buttons worked.  Haven&#x27;t tried steam yet.  She will be playing with it more this week.  99% certain most every brand is made at the same 3 factories in China, just rebranded.  I will post an update if things change but for now it is 5 out of 5 for me.  Instructions have that sloppy English translation in them.  Would be better to watch videos for any of this style curler to see how to use it.</li>
            <li> Love it!! I read the reviews. Most people were saying they didnt like it for this or that but i honestly love it! I am a genuine buyer from Indiana. I have wavy to curly hair, medium length and found it helped turn my frizzy parts  and all my hair into beautiful ringlets. I just got it and have just used it once but, so excited, I felt I needed to share the experience with someone wanting to purchase one. It does take about 5 min to get the hang of it. The directions were in english but Im not a direction reader and did it all just reading the labels on the device. It does take 35~45 min to do my hair but, it really was worth the beauty it created.  My husband said &amp;#34;your hair is beautiful!&amp;#34; What he didnt know was he bought it for me. Wink-wink..LOL.</li>
            <li> I received it. The color and design are cool! I might have to put away my last curler.It doesn&#x27;t burn and it&#x27;s fast too!</li>
            <li> Very easy to curl the hair. But it has to pay attention on the correct side to use it.</li>
            <li> Love the curls! it&#x27;s easy to use, fun and fast! Yes I would recommend it! I have fine, fussy and curly red hair.</li>
            <li> Used as directed to the letter. Watched online tutorials prior to use. Ripped my wife&#x27;s hair out the first try and ruined mothers day for me. She said oh honey its the thought, yeah yeah..  I can live with getting my wife a crappy gift but watching her face distort in pain was a nightmare. I feel like suing this company. The thing she pointed out is that it can only do small sections of hair at a time which of course adds more time to get ready in the morning. PLEASE don&#x27;t buy this product, leave it in the hands of professional hair dressers if you want to risk letting them use it on you.</li>
            <li> This product is HORRIBLE.First of all, the instructions make absolutely no sense, it&#x27;s hardly English. The instructions don&#x27;t even tell you how insert the water for the steamer. This &amp;#34;curler&amp;#34; curled 2 pieces of my hair okay. On the second time it defaulted and ate a section of my hair. I almost had to cut it out. The section of hair is now fried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I wish I had read these one star reviews about the sketchy 5 star reviews. I hope they give me my money back for this piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> My hair is quite short. It is difficult to apply it into use, I guess it is not for me. Thank you for letting me return it.</li>
            <li> Good shopping experience. Love the function-steaming, like a spa for the hair.</li>
            <li> I sent it as a gift to my girl freind. She loves the curl but complained that her hair got stuck in the first time.</li>
            <li> I love the tank on the top. I can atcually put inside some hair conditioner. It saves me the time to apply it after the curling.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!!I bought it to send to my best freind who enjoys &amp;#34;DIY&amp;#34; her hair.And she loves it so much that giving me a big kiss.  ;-)</li>
            <li> Thank you!! I just received it. The mail man sent to the wrong mail box. Anyway, it works well.</li>
            <li> The package is damaged. Forturnately I still got the protective bag and product itself is fine.</li>
            <li> Received within 3 days!!&lt;br /&gt;Works wonderfully, beautiful curls! Recommend the RC pro curl, definitely makes it look &amp; hold better. Love that it&#x27;s smart &amp; won&#x27;t let your hair get stuck.&lt;br /&gt;If your like me &amp; can&#x27;t get the perfect curl with a regular curling iron... This is for you</li>
            <li> first I think this is too good to be true.well, it did suprise  me.</li>
            <li> It is a high tech product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic thing. My freinds think highly of my new hair styling. Thank you guys.</li>
            <li> The directions are very poorly written/translated.  I ended up returning this because it didn&#x27;t work great with my long fine hair.  The company offered some free items in exchange for good reviews.  Probably not a very honorable practice.</li>
            <li> Really cool. The function is amazing.</li>
            <li> Well, it works fine just a little difficult to operate at the first time.</li>
            <li> the way to alternate the  direction is a very thoughful idea</li>
            <li> It took a bit of practice, but I could then regulate the tightness or looseness of the curl and place the curl in the exact location that I wanted it to be. I could make my hair wavy or curly</li>
            <li> First time out of the box it was usable. I fully expected to have to be extremely patient to get the learning curve. The instruction is clear and operation is quite easy.</li>
            <li> Love the effect but not impressed by the design. Too heavy to use.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Very durable!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wast your money, this does NOT work!  I was contacted by the vendor after writing this review.  They still have not resolved the issue.  The curling iron does not work and seeing other bad reviews looks like we all have the same issue.  Stay away from the product and the people who sell it.  It is one of the most regretful purchases I have every made.</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten caught in it a few times at first time I began to use, because the sections of hair I grabbed were too big but it immediately beeps to let you know, so I just slowly slid it down to release the curls. After I adjusted it, it worked fine and the style last for a long time. I use it on freshly washed hair, use a little bit of hairspray as I curl each part and it is done. The curls don&#x27;t remains, and at night I just put all of my hair on top of my head with a soft scrunchie, then in the morning all I have to do is run a brush through my hair and I am ready for work.</li>
            <li> This little gadget makes the prettiest curls ever, always get so many compliments. Just be sure and follow the instruction, if you try to jam to much hair in it, it can tangle, so be patience and it will be gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I love the curl direction setting!</li>
            <li> I have thick straight &amp;#34;Cher&amp;#34; hair and it is AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> My freind got it and she loves it. Well I am considering to buy another one for myself.</li>
            <li> The ceramic chamber looks great. My hair won&#x27;t get hurt.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use!But the effect is quite good!</li>
            <li> It is nice that a notice note is pasted on the head of the steam curl. I will use the wrong side if it is not on it.</li>
            <li> Not suitable for my short hair.</li>
            <li> Defective product!! After several minutes this product automatically shuts off and will not power back on. I tried this and received the same result for 2 days. I have contacted the seller and ashes for an cage. I will update my review with the quality of the replacement I received and my customer service experience.</li>
            <li> Good invention! My hair is thin so it could never holds curl. I still can&#x27;t believe how well it works. Curls last, and look beautiful!</li>
            <li> Doest come with any instructions. Im going to the beauty store tomorrow  to see if they can show me how to use it, if not I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> wonderful! have recommend to my freinds.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected! you know, buy it at that price is quite risky, I was worried about the quality but the seller told me that it is promotional price so I buy it.  Really happy!</li>
            <li> I used the steam roller before I bought this one.This one saves me  a lot of time and money. I will keep it well;-)</li>
            <li> Wonderful! I love the soft curl. 190degree will be enough for me.</li>
            <li> When I tried to use it, my hair get stuck. But when it comes to the third time. I can steer this gadget.</li>
            <li> I Got it.Just used once.It is difficult to handle at the begining. Everything is fine then.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy one of the more expensive steam curl- but this came out on the Amazon - so I thought I would try it. I received it ahead of estimated arrival date.This really works. All I need is to set the time and give some press. Fair price by the way.</li>
            <li> Got it yesterday！Had a try. The curl remains today and seems great! Impressive!</li>
            <li> Not as magic as it is stated. But I do get the beautiful curl. I set the lowest temperature and got the loose curl which is what I want. The point is it last for a day long.</li>
            <li> That is a good price for the wonderful product. It is easy to use and will save you not only time but lots of dollars at a hair salon. You get what it is offered and more. It helped my hair look incredible well at an event I had rencently and I am so happy with it.</li>
            <li> Good product! I am not good at curling the hair, so when I used the traditional one,the curl on both sides would sit casually. With the curl, I can select the curl direction by sliding the switch to either left or right. It brings me a more uniform style.</li>
            <li> I got the curling machine after ordered it three days. Quite fast! I love the way it is packed. I coudn&#x27;t wait to try it out and it is quite convenient to follow since the instructions are all on the package. I filled the tank with pure water as recommended. My hair is the thick and wavy style so I set the temperature to 230 celcius.The hair is curler than I expect, but it will be more natural after a while. Anyway, I love it.</li>
            <li> Loved it, works great, long lasting curls!</li>
            <li> The product is so easy to use and retains your style better.It’s a big plus for busy people using daily styling tools.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.it  arrived ahead of schedule.  I tried it out first thing and it&#x27;s is really cool. I can&#x27;t wait to fix my  hair. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I WILL GIVE FIVE STARS SINCE IT IS PRICED LOWER THAN MOST RETAILERS. i AM SUPPRISE D IT WORKS LIKE A MAGIC. THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> well, the English on the package is not so good, but it is understandable. The product functions well.</li>
            <li> I would love to recommend it to my freinds! :-)</li>
            <li> The spral just scared me a little. But I feel comfortable with it after applying it into use for two times.</li>
            <li> Wow, I saw some store sold it like above 100dolloars. Can&#x27;t believe that I got this one with a lovely price!</li>
            <li> Good product and brilliant idea. This product rocks!</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to fix my hair.</li>
            <li> This is my very first time writing a review on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just received this I love it, working just as expected. Only got a chance to use it once but my curls lasted for days on the lowest setting. I will be ordering another for my daughter</li>
            <li> k. I have long hair below my elbows. It&#x27;s fine hair. So you seriously have to section off 1/2-1 inch of hair NO MORE than that. Also you have to comb through that section even if you brushed your hair you have to make sure their is not lingering strands because your hair will GET STUCK and from experience I had to unplug and literally dig my hair out it was quite hard to get out once its stuck.But it really does curl and it keeps the curl without any product use.</li>
            <li> Good outlook and function. Very smart,</li>
            <li> I have to say I so love the loose wave of my hair.Thanks for this product.</li>
            <li> If I could give it a zero, I would. First off I was sent a used product that was advertised as new. How do I know? Because it has a chamber for liquid and when I opened it there was condensation on the inside of the chamber which indicates there was liquid in it before. I also knew because the cord was not packaged in the way most cords are packaged when the item is new.  You CANNOT sell something as new if you sold it before and it was returned. Thats what there are two options...new and used.  Second when I plugged it in...it did not work...so its a piece of garbage. Third...I tried reading the entire direction book before I even took the product out of the box...its in broken English and sometimes doesn&#x27;t make sense at all. The part where the English is completely off is when its actually telling you how to put your hair in the product! I think that might be a bit important. Stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it for it worths the price and seems smart.</li>
            <li> Ok so I absolutely love this curler! The price is way better than others I&#x27;ve seen and also as for the &amp;#34;ripping your hair out&amp;#34; in my opinion you need to be stupid to let that happen because you can automatically feel the tug, which makes you automatically stop. It happened a few times to me but it doesn&#x27;t get caught and rip it out like other reviewers are saying. The only way I see that happening is that if you feel the tug and you don&#x27;t let go and let the curler keep twisting your hair.... Then sure you will have a problem. Like I said though it is  easy to correct if you pay attention to what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> This costs less than the average curling iron,it saves me a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Will recommend to my friend. Good function and good price.</li>
            <li> My husband said my hair seems very natural and beautiful. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Ceramic chamber does have a different effect. My hair turn to be smoother after I compair with  another curler.</li>
            <li> It is a funny thing. Worth my money, I ike it.</li>
            <li> Heat up quick. And it is the first curl that doesn&#x27;t damage the hair, instead.it gave a spa to my damaged hair. Wow, amazing!</li>
            <li> I heavily rely on reviews before purchasing anything . The reviews for this seemed a little off to me. Some of them seemed copied and/or doubled (go through them carefully and you&#x27;ll see what I mean) and more than 15 people a day seem to be writing 5 star reviews. Despite all the evidence pointing to the contrary I still wanted to believe that it&#x27;d work. I should have listened to my instincts. Absolutely worthless, if I could give 0 stars I would. Does not even heat up, much less work, maybe I got a return? Maybe it was a fluke? I don&#x27;t know, but I wouldn&#x27;t waste my hard earned money on this.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.  I couldn&#x27;t get the curls to work well and you can only use a very small amount of hair each time.  I cannot begin to guess how I would curl the back.  The instructions are in horrible, broken English - very poorly translated.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> It is easy and fast. I don&#x27;t know if others will share the opinion that the hair looks shinier and more healthy.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before I bought this.It turns out to be the good product with the cheap price.</li>
            <li> The hairpin, cleaner, and note bottle are included inside the box. Great serivce!</li>
            <li> I have no complaint. Work as stated, expecially the function of spraying.</li>
            <li> Paid a new product price, but received a used one!!! What a shock!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t make a purchase.  I just want to point out that there are in fact a ton of reviews in broken english and the instructions are in broken english.  Some of the headlines used are the same.  They are all &amp;#34;verified purchase&amp;#34; reviews.  I don&#x27;t believe it for a minute and the fact that more than one person (or anyone for that matter) confirmed they received a used item is a serious red flag.  I suggest you think twice about buying this item.</li>
            <li> I love the steaming part. It is special that I could combine the steaming and curling together.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;It’s special since it is different from the traditional curlers but much more effective than that.I followed the direction on the package carefully and it is amazing when I found how my hair turned out to be.&lt;br /&gt;I set up the timer as 8sec, and released the handle after three beeps. There I got my ideal slightly curls. &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The seller is quite considerate. They labels a sticker indicating which side should be facing towards the head before I have to figure out myself. I like this hair curl.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I expect the color to be deeper,but it is fine. The spray is amazing after I fill the tank with pure water as requested. And the curl works quite automatically after everything is set. wonderful!</li>
            <li> This RC curl is different from the others.I bought the similar one from another store. It broke and I came across this store with the similar one. Well even better than the last one no matter in the aspects of price, design, color or function. Great! really worth my money.</li>
            <li> I wish it could also have the function of straightening the hair. Then it will be perfect!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the color,not as bright as the pictures show. Well I will accept it since the it works as described.</li>
            <li> I have the medium to long hair, slightly frizzy. The curl give me a new look. With the spray function ,it also fix the problem that the hair will get very dry after the curl.</li>
            <li> Perfect product. I mean I can have the hair care while making the beautiful curl. Amazing!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.And it seems fine.</li>
            <li> Not that automatic. But I feel satisfied with the product.It worths the money.</li>
            <li> The LED flashing give me the clear direction. Really smart.</li>
            <li> I am going to wait for a few days. But got it right after three days.The package is great, just the English instruction on it is a little poor. The product design is good. And I had a try, not as easy to use  as the traditional one.But I think I just need to get used to it.</li>
