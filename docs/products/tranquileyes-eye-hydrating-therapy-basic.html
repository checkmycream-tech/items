    <ol>
            <li>Best sleep mask EVER!!!!  </li>
            <li>Great product, but the sponge tape to keep the sponges on the mask, don&#x27;t stick after about 4 washings.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these for 4 months and they are still working great.  </li>
            <li>Good item for the price.</li>
            <li>Great for keeping out the light however.</li>
            <li>Warm compresses are very easy to do.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you have issues with not being able to sleep when there is ANY light these are GREAT.</li>
            <li>I get an excellent night&#x27;s sleep in the complete darkness.  </li>
            <li>It is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I love this kit.  </li>
            <li>The theory is you keep more moisture around the eye and it will keep it more hydrated.</li>
            <li>I am not used to wearing a sleeping mask, but this is comfortable and does the job it was designed to do!</li>
            <li>I would say this product is okay.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m GLAD I did.  </li>
            <li>I thought the size of the goggles was ok and the fit is ok.</li>
            <li>but that was fine for me.</li>
            <li>Unless you have a huge head, the goggles won&#x27;t stay on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They do loosen during the night somewhat but the head strap is comfortable.</li>
            <li>A nice side-effect of the mask was that I&#x27;ve been experiencing a much deeper sleep.</li>
            <li>I eventually cut them in half thickness wise and that was better.</li>
            <li>The moistened pads make the eye feel cool but did not help tremendously for me as far as moisture during the night.</li>
            <li>Not only do my eyes feel better at night,  </li>
            <li>Comfortable and soft.</li>
            <li>(I followed the directions EXACTLY.)  </li>
            <li>My eyes are feeling much better and my optometrist says that there has been an improvement from the last time I was there.</li>
            <li>While I am a sensitive sleeper, and know that not everyone is, the goggles were really pretty comfortable.  </li>
            <li>While they do provide some comfort the design really needs to be improved for the price.</li>
            <li>Well, it just did not work very well for me.</li>
            <li>I tried it, didn&#x27;t really like it, and put it away.</li>
            <li>moves a LOT; the attachment of the strap to the \\&quot;goggle\\&quot; leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work at all.</li>
            <li>The result is that the eyepieces did not sit flush on my face allowing them to dry out very quickly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>the complete darkness has enabled me to have much deeper sleep.</li>
            <li>They are a bit pricey, but worth it if you suffer from dry eyes and need relief.</li>
            <li>I would not discount it completely but it is not the miracle I hoped for.</li>
            <li>complete darkness..</li>
            <li>I have an eyelid that doesn&#x27;t close all the way at night, and my eye doc would sell me these plastic eye patches that wouldn&#x27;t last more than a few days and cost $15 a piece.  </li>
            <li>band that holds the glass on your head is theoretically adjustable, but in truth slippery so that it always slides right back out to the largest position.  </li>
            <li>However the strap keeps coming loose and sometimes right off in the middle of the night, losing the seal it is supposed to have to maintain the moisture level.</li>
            <li>Went back to my 8 year old foam eye covers with velcro attached headband.</li>
            <li>There are pillows of foam inside each eye that gently rests your eyes closed.  </li>
            <li>They completely block out the sun for a deep sleep.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It has made a major improvement in my extreme dry eyes.</li>

            <li> With severe dry eye and pending cataracts</li>
            <li> My eye do feel dry in the morning</li>
            <li> These are a God-send for people with dry eyes.  </li>
            <li> I was hopeful about TranquilEyes, but after using it (and having some compromised sleep) for 3 weeks, it has not seemed to make a difference in my night time dry eyes.  </li>
            <li> I take them with me when I travel and use them every single night.</li>
            <li> I have very dry eyes and purchased these to help with moisture at night.</li>
            <li> They allow me to sleep through the night without waking up with burning eyes due to severe dry eyes.  </li>
            <li> However, the nose piece was too wide for me.</li>
            <li> Total waste of $50.</li>
            <li> I use nightly - just need to tie the sides to keep from slipping off your head during the night.  </li>
            <li> Those of us with chronic dry eyes will tell you that the condition is generally made worse at night, especially in heated or air conditioned homes.  </li>
            <li> Epic failure.</li>
            <li> Yea so it was comfy I guess, and maybe someone with less severe dry eye would work but for me it didn&#x27;t relaly help at all.  </li>
            <li> The third time I heated up the little bead packets, one of them ruptured!  </li>
            <li> I continued to limp along with them as long as I could.</li>
            <li> black foam pieces should be attached so they don&#x27;t fall out and get lost.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Decreased my dry eye symptoms: 1) during the night, almost completely [was having to put in drops at least 3-4 times during the night];</li>
            <li> Does not fit</li>
            <li> I have had at least 4 sets at this point - one set, the foam was so limp</li>
            <li> It is hard to sleep with googles on your eyes</li>
            <li> hard to sleep in , clips holding the strap to the goggles hurt .</li>
            <li> Improved my sleep at least 3 fold&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one problem I had with the moistened inserts is that they were as thick as the goggle.</li>
            <li> 2) during the day by about 80%&lt;br /&gt;3) Decreased the puffiness around my eyes by about 80% and wrinkles by about 60%.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> paid $75 for these from my eye doc -- what a rip-off!</li>

            <li> I love this kit.  Warm compresses are very easy to do.  This product was recommended by my eye doctor.  Not only do my eyes feel better at night,  I get an excellent night&#x27;s sleep in the complete darkness.  Comfortable and soft.</li>
            <li> I recently got the Tranquileyes after suffering for ages with dry eye. I used it a couple of times and seemed to feel some relief. However the strap keeps coming loose and sometimes right off in the middle of the night, losing the seal it is supposed to have to maintain the moisture level. The foam pads glued to the goggles themselves (rather than the removable ones that you wet) are also already coming unglued and I have only had the goggles for 1 month and used them maybe a dozen times. While they do provide some comfort the design really needs to be improved for the price.</li>
            <li> I have very dry eyes and purchased these to help with moisture at night. I thought the size of the goggles was ok and the fit is ok. They do loosen during the night somewhat but the head strap is comfortable. The one problem I had with the moistened inserts is that they were as thick as the goggle. They press against the eye and cause some discomfort for me. I eventually cut them in half thickness wise and that was better. The moistened pads make the eye feel cool but did not help tremendously for me as far as moisture during the night. The theory is you keep more moisture around the eye and it will keep it more hydrated. Well, it just did not work very well for me. I would not discount it completely but it is not the miracle I hoped for.</li>
            <li> Does not fit well air gets in and wake up and it comes off</li>
            <li> The third time I heated up the little bead packets, one of them ruptured!  (I followed the directions EXACTLY.)  Beads everywhere, and now I have one-eyed goggles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The black foam pieces should be attached so they don&#x27;t fall out and get lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band that holds the glass on your head is theoretically adjustable, but in truth slippery so that it always slides right back out to the largest position.  Unless you have a huge head, the goggles won&#x27;t stay on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $75 for these from my eye doc -- what a rip-off!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from another source over a year ago. I tried it, didn&#x27;t really like it, and put it away. My dry eye continued to worsen, and my optometrist recommended using it. I have been using it continually since (8-12)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Improved my sleep at least 3 fold&lt;br /&gt;2) Decreased my dry eye symptoms: 1) during the night, almost completely [was having to put in drops at least 3-4 times during the night]; 2) during the day by about 80%&lt;br /&gt;3) Decreased the puffiness around my eyes by about 80% and wrinkles by about 60%.&lt;br /&gt;4) Don&#x27;t have to worry about \\&quot;ambient light\\&quot; in the bedroom, as it does not carry through with the mask.&lt;br /&gt;These are why I continue to use the mask, despite the following con&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) moves a LOT; the attachment of the strap to the \\&quot;goggle\\&quot; leaves much to be desired. In and of itself, it does not hold an adjustment. I tried several \\&quot;ways\\&quot; of getting it to retain the tension, finally ended up tying a knot in the end of the strap. This does not add to the comfort for a side sleeper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The replacement foam pieces - here&#x27;s a technical term for ya - Suck! I have had at least 4 sets at this point - one set, the foam was so limp it would not \\&quot;recover\\&quot; from squeezing - threw that one away after a couple of weeks. ALL of them - the adhesive gives out in a varyingly short time period. The last set, I really wanted to see if it could be corrected - cleaned the frame with alcohol and allowed to dry about an hour before applying the pieces; held the pieces firmly in place for about 1-2 minutes - was coming away the next day! The rest of them started to separate at about 2-3 wks. I continued to limp along with them as long as I could.</li>
            <li> I sleep with my eyes open and as such my optometrist diagnosed me with dry eyes. I did some research and Tranquileyes were the only brand of sleeping masks that was marketed for dry eyes. My eyes are feeling much better and my optometrist says that there has been an improvement from the last time I was there. A nice side-effect of the mask was that I&#x27;ve been experiencing a much deeper sleep. They are a bit pricey, but worth it if you suffer from dry eyes and need relief.</li>
            <li> I have had these for over one year and wouldn&#x27;t sleep without them!  They allow me to sleep through the night without waking up with burning eyes due to severe dry eyes.  I take them with me when I travel and use them every single night.</li>
            <li> It has made a major improvement in my extreme dry eyes. the complete darkness has enabled me to have much deeper sleep. It is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Good item for the price. I am not used to wearing a sleeping mask, but this is comfortable and does the job it was designed to do!</li>
            <li> With severe dry eye and pending cataracts I thought these would be just the thing. I read where the headband didn&#x27;t work for a lot of people...but that was fine for me. However, the nose piece was too wide for me. The result is that the eyepieces did not sit flush on my face allowing them to dry out very quickly. Total waste of $50. Went back to my 8 year old foam eye covers with velcro attached headband.</li>
            <li> I would say this product is okay. It is hard to sleep with googles on your eyes but I feel that it moistens my eyes throughout the night. My eye do feel dry in the morning so I am not sure if I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work at all.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to hydrate my eyes.  Didn&#x27;t come with instructions on how to use the &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34;. Great for keeping out the light however.</li>
            <li> Great product, but the sponge tape to keep the sponges on the mask, don&#x27;t stick after about 4 washings.</li>
            <li> I bought my product on 9/13 and paid extra to have two day shipping. I didn&#x27;t receive until Friday 9/19. I used it 9/19 and on 9/20 went to put on and the side came apart (broke). I have a safety pin holding together and it didn&#x27;t even last two times. I don&#x27;t have moisture in my eye so was hoping this would help save my eye. Epic failure.</li>
            <li> hard to sleep in , clips holding the strap to the goggles hurt . They slip off during the night.</li>
            <li> Those of us with chronic dry eyes will tell you that the condition is generally made worse at night, especially in heated or air conditioned homes.  This product helps to alleviate this problem.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> These are a God-send for people with dry eyes.  I have an eyelid that doesn&#x27;t close all the way at night, and my eye doc would sell me these plastic eye patches that wouldn&#x27;t last more than a few days and cost $15 a piece.  I was going broke.  I asked him about these, he said they wouldn&#x27;t work for me.  I bought them anyway and I&#x27;m GLAD I did.  I&#x27;ve had these for 4 months and they are still working great.  There are pillows of foam inside each eye that gently rests your eyes closed.  They completely block out the sun for a deep sleep.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Yea so it was comfy I guess, and maybe someone with less severe dry eye would work but for me it didn&#x27;t relaly help at all.  It was just like NOT having them on so why bother with the discomfort.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well. They came off during my sleep all the time.</li>
            <li> Best sleep mask EVER!!!!  I use nightly - just need to tie the sides to keep from slipping off your head during the night.  I have purchased 10 kits over this last years as gifts and EVERYONE loves them!</li>
            <li> I thought I had dry eyes and was using restatis and then found that I actually open my eyes when I sleep. i found these and they work wonders. Also, if you have issues with not being able to sleep when there is ANY light these are GREAT. complete darkness.. and you look like a big purple bug! I like that part too!</li>
            <li> I was hopeful about TranquilEyes, but after using it (and having some compromised sleep) for 3 weeks, it has not seemed to make a difference in my night time dry eyes.  While I am a sensitive sleeper, and know that not everyone is, the goggles were really pretty comfortable.  I just didn&#x27;t see any change in the dryness of my eyes from them.</li>
