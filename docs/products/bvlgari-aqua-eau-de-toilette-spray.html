    <ol>
            <li>the size is perfect, acceptable for air travel.</li>
            <li>Great price though</li>
            <li>Great service.</li>
            <li>very nice scent</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Very refreshing scent and not over powering.</li>
            <li>Great price, great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Nice job Amazon as always.</li>
            <li>It was excellent and much cheaper than they would sell you in store.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>i bought this for a friend, and the first thing he said was how great the bottle looked.</li>
            <li>The scent is lovely and your wife (girlfriend) will just love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Better yet, he loves it.</li>
            <li>This is one of my all time favorite cologne for men.</li>
            <li>Overall, great scent.</li>
            <li>smells like sweet salt water by the shore</li>
            <li>brand new, factory wrapped, bar coded and original &amp;#34;Made in Italy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>First item bought based on reviews.</li>
            <li>next time i&#x27;ll make sure i can try it before i buy a cologne, for me or anyone.</li>
            <li>it does last more than 1-2 hour; and the scent was quite off.</li>
            <li>I have used bvlgary parfume earlier, which I purchased in local shop, and I loved that one...</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but the scent doesn&#x27;t really follow.</li>
            <li>I am happy and i just love it.the base chord, the trail of the perfume, lasting several days.very good</li>
            <li>every product of this kind out there has the same label, to store under ambiance temperature, but the truth is that other brands are more likely to resist heat and this.</li>
            <li>The smell of the previous one time lasted even more than 4-5 days, once I checked my t-shirt and had smell after one week...</li>
            <li>I have used BVLGARI Aqua for a long time now; but this was is nothing close to an original Aqua.</li>
            <li>But when I purchased the same model on amazon and used it, realized that this is not the same one, this is not the original version of parfume!</li>
            <li>, I suppose it is normal.</li>
            <li>but this one is a little bit too strong.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance but it lasts for hardly an hour.</li>
            <li>(and if properly stored lasts long enough) and everybody always tell me they like it, specially females.</li>
            <li>the other hand, that is the only complaint I have, it actually smells great</li>
            <li>Instead it is like a large pebble that lays flat on its back.  </li>
            <li>I hope Amazon sells the real thing and not an imitation of this product.</li>
            <li>Very masculine and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I always kept a Diesel perfume on my glove compartment that to this day still smells like the first day I got it, so it really put me down when this perfume started lasting less after a couple weeks in my car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> just one remark, It lasts half a day not more, but if we consider, that it depends on several individual features of human skin</li>
            <li> Product itself is what I expected.</li>
            <li> Bulgari is a casual cologne but in the same time very classy</li>
            <li> My other cologne is Bvlgari Man, which I bought from an airport duty-free store.</li>
            <li> This was mainly due to proximity to seller&#x27;s warehouse, which I was not initially aware of.</li>
            <li> Smells just like the other ones I&#x27;ve bought over the years.</li>
            <li> but it seems to be watered down.</li>
            <li> Despite some negative reviews that I read, the product was as expected...</li>
            <li> i was a little bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> The container is a bit weird, though.</li>
            <li> This is very, very bad...</li>

            <li> The scent is lovely and your wife (girlfriend) will just love it.  If you are looking to change your perfume, go for this one.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations. First item bought based on reviews. Good product.</li>
            <li> I have used bvlgary parfume earlier, which I purchased in local shop, and I loved that one... But when I purchased the same model on amazon and used it, realized that this is not the same one, this is not the original version of parfume! Smell does not last even 4-5 hours... The smell of the previous one time lasted even more than 4-5 days, once I checked my t-shirt and had smell after one week... This is very, very bad...</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, exactly what I wanted.  Makes u smell and feel like a million bucks. Going to upgrade to the biggest bottle next time.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and I love it. Better yet, he loves it. The container is a bit weird, though. I thought I should mention that. It is not a bottle that stands. Instead it is like a large pebble that lays flat on its back.  Overall, great scent. Very masculine and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product and fast delivery.Met all my expections. Nice job Amazon as always. Bulgari is a casual cologne but in the same time very classy</li>
            <li> fast shipping. Product itself is what I expected. just one remark, It lasts half a day not more, but if we consider, that it depends on several individual features of human skin, I suppose it is normal. very nice scent, I like it!</li>
            <li> he likes the scent. the size is perfect, acceptable for air travel.</li>
            <li> perfume muy bueno exquisto fuerte me gusto el tipo de frasco q maneja muy elegante fino, tengan buenas tardes feliz dia</li>
            <li> It was excellent and much cheaper than they would sell you in store. 10/10 Would buy again.</li>
            <li> smells like sweet salt water by the shore</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite cologne for men. Very refreshing scent and not over powering. I hope Amazon sells the real thing and not an imitation of this product.</li>
            <li> I know, I know... every product of this kind out there has the same label, to store under ambiance temperature, but the truth is that other brands are more likely to resist heat and this. I always kept a Diesel perfume on my glove compartment that to this day still smells like the first day I got it, so it really put me down when this perfume started lasting less after a couple weeks in my car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, that is the only complaint I have, it actually smells great (and if properly stored lasts long enough) and everybody always tell me they like it, specially females.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the version I bought from Amazon but it seems to be watered down. I love the fragrance but it lasts for hardly an hour. My other cologne is Bvlgari Man, which I bought from an airport duty-free store. It lasts all day and then some.</li>
            <li> i bought this for a friend, and the first thing he said was how great the bottle looked. but the scent doesn&#x27;t really follow. i was a little bit disappointed. i like Bvlgari cologne but this one is a little bit too strong. next time i&#x27;ll make sure i can try it before i buy a cologne, for me or anyone. Great price though</li>
            <li> Great service. Shippment arrived the very next day, although it was requested as a &amp;#34;7-10 days&amp;#34; shippment. This was mainly due to proximity to seller&#x27;s warehouse, which I was not initially aware of. Despite some negative reviews that I read, the product was as expected...brand new, factory wrapped, bar coded and original &amp;#34;Made in Italy&amp;#34;. Smells just like the other ones I&#x27;ve bought over the years.</li>
            <li> I have used BVLGARI Aqua for a long time now; but this was is nothing close to an original Aqua. it does last more than 1-2 hour; and the scent was quite off.</li>
            <li> I am happy and i just love it.the base chord, the trail of the perfume, lasting several days.very good yeah!</li>
