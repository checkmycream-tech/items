            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>It works like this; the device has a bunch of rotating bunches in concentric rings - kind of like the Pentagon.</li>

            <li>So, finding a good face cleanser for your skin type is definitely key to seeing the best results with the Clarisonic.     </li>
            <li>they are soft and wonderful.</li>
            <li>I love the Clarisonic PRO Deluxe.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say this product help my skin care system be more effective.</li>
            <li>** had it over 3 years now and still going strong!  </li>
            <li>It feels very smooth and silky, but when I&#x27;m using the Clarisonic, its like its not even there.  </li>
            <li>GLAD</li>
            <li>After I use this for a while longer I&#x27;ll add more to this review.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over one month and have been satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I love taking this in to the shower with me  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>And, yes, Clarisonic has the same EXCELLENT customer service as Sonicare.</li>
            <li>The better the face cleanser for your skin type,</li>
            <li>the better the results.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute and all</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I am seeing verifications from many places.  </li>
            <li>I actually love it</li>
            <li>Same for this, its great for problem skin but its a wonderful product even if you have normal skin.  </li>
            <li>If you have problem teeth, an electric toothbrush will help but its great even if you have normal teeth.  </li>
            <li>- it exfoliates, softens my skin, and has reduced my fine lines and softened my big ole frown line in between my eyes - but it also sounds awesome.  </li>
            <li>Easy to charge in its cradle.  </li>
            <li>-Easy to hold grip/handle    Cons:  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I did not use the trial cleansers, I just used my own cleanser.  </li>
            <li>was getting married and wanted perfect skin on my big day.  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE it so much!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the Clarisonic cleaners that it comes with are all that fabulous.</li>
            <li>The design of the handle is ergonomic and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Skin Smooth.</li>
            <li>The design of the handle is ergonomic and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Skin Smooth.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine saw such a difference that she has been coming over for 10 minutes a day to use the Clarisonic and DPL machine and now her skin is looking great too.</li>
            <li>If it does, then take the brush off the machine after each use to clean it out - or it will cause build up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for dry, oily and combination skin.</li>
            <li>I own a Sonicare toothbrush (for several years) and love the results.  </li>
            <li>My face feels soooo clean after I&#x27;ve used this product.  </li>
            <li>I usually clean my face for 2-3 cycles of the face cleaning (i.e., I go over my face 2-3 times) because the face cleaning is on a timer and shuts off.</li>
            <li>I wanted a product that would REALLY clean my skin without being too abrasive.  </li>
            <li>My face feels so clean after I use it.  </li>
            <li>and I can say the my face has never felt smoother and clean.  </li>
            <li>At first given the cost of the product, I wasn&#x27;t sure it was worth the money, but now that I have used it.  </li>
            <li>As an esthetician, grooming editor and all-around product junkie, this is one of the things I recommend for most skin types.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that many lines, so I can&#x27;t really comment on that.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the various Sonicare toothbrushes for years and loved the results, which is what attracted me to the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>It is like a mini facial and very refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I felt my skin before I used the product, pretty darn smooth.</li>
            <li>They were very nice, asked for my name (I was already in the system from the previous replacement) and the serial # onthe handle.</li>
            <li>I have dropped it more than once in the shower and it has totally been fine.  </li>
            <li>, I was convinced it would be worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone - I have kind of sensitive skin and it has tolerated it very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>One thing to remember is to make sure you clean it with antibacterial soap on a regular basis to kill bacteria on the face brush.  </li>
            <li>I recommend you use your own cleansers (as long as it doesn&#x27;t have exfoliants in it.</li>
            <li>So, when I read that the same people invented Clarisonic, I felt more at ease about trying this product.  </li>
            <li>Although I have not actually changed my settings, I love that you have the ability to do so.  </li>
            <li>I emailed to confirm exactly what was included.  </li>
            <li>With constant use, I think most people will see results.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how SOFT and CLEAN my face feels after I&#x27;ve used it just a couple of times.  </li>
            <li>This review is from: Clarisonic PRO Deluxe Professional 4-Speed Skin Care System with Spot Therapy Kit, White (Health and Beauty)     </li>

            <li>[[ASIN:B001QOGXOG Clarisonic PRO Deluxe Professional 4-Speed Skin Care System with Spot Therapy Kit, White]]  </li>
            <li>With all the negative reviews I read, I think most of them expected it to be a miracle product, suddenly have flawless face and all imperfections would go way.</li>
            <li>I have medium to large pores.  </li>
            <li>It certainly does not hold a charge like a Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I told them that I have a 30 year old daughter ;-)!    </li>
            <li>No matter how expensive/cheap/raved about cleanser I&#x27;ve used, nothing really cleaned my face.</li>
            <li>VERY</li>
            <li>I was hesitant and kinda scoffed at the idea that a rotating brush could do much for me.</li>
            <li>It really buffed away some spots that had raised bumps before.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think I need this product.</li>
            <li>This is what really hit me.</li>
            <li>This is what really hit me.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>think this really is the equivalent to an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I REALLY like it, as well as the results.</li>
            <li>Plus when using it on the face, you have to give it a push in your face so you can really feel the strength of the bristles.</li>
            <li>I am using it in conjunction with the DPL deep Penetrating Light Therapy machine  </li>
            <li>so much got</li>
            <li>There is really a difference in how my skin feels when using this device, as compared to manual washing.  </li>
            <li>Plus the replacement heads are pricey considering it doesnt do that much for my oily skin.</li>
            <li>If you are someone who takes good care of their skin, like getting a facial, or exfoliating your face once a week and all that other stuff....</li>
            <li>I saw WAY better results using Neutrogena products, than I did using other products.</li>
            <li>I have been using this latest replacement for almost 2 months with no problems, but the 3-4 month mark is where I had problems on the other 2.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle (even with my current breakout) and does a great job of cleaning deep down into my pores and everything.    </li>
            <li>If your someone like me who doesn&#x27;t really do facials or doesn&#x27;t really take care of her skin as well as you should be, you might actually get some benefit from getting the Clarisonic and actually seeing more results.  </li>
            <li>They told me that my brush had a full 3-YEAR warranty (that all Clarisonic PROs purchased in 2010 were protected one-year longer than the standard 2-year warranty).</li>
            <li>They immediately sent me out a FULL replacement via UPS and a pre-paid UPS label to send my defective one back.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without mine - and if you have problem skin, neither should you!    </li>
            <li>I noticed that initially it made the acne more obvious.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>Yeh, my skin is silky smooth awesome, but it only lasts for a few days, then I feel a few dry spots here and there.</li>
            <li>Yeh, my skin is silky smooth awesome, but it only lasts for a few days, then I feel a few dry spots here and there.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is worth $225, but I haven&#x27;t found anything else that delivers the same results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now and it still works like new.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m an old lady!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent $ at spas doing a full body scrub.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent $ at spas doing a full body scrub.</li>
            <li>My favorite way to use this handheld tool is to take a dash of Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant, add a little water to make a paste, and work it into my skin with the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Again, no miracles, but clearly nicer looking skin.</li>
            <li>after I used the product - wow, it made my before skin feel like sand paper.</li>
            <li>As i got the brush from you,and you would be the direct buyer, could you please help to ask Clarisonc to guarantee the repairment?</li>
            <li>-Sensitive</li>
            <li>and I do have to say that this has completely made those disappear.  </li>
            <li>five (5) months ago directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li>So far I have used this product for a week</li>
            <li>and I can save money on all those professional facials.</li>
            <li>I am 53 years old and my skin now looks like a 30 year old and is radiant and glowing.</li>
            <li>She mentioned to me yesterday that another friend is seeing the same difference in her skin that now she wants to begin coming.</li>
            <li>So much for money back guarantees.  </li>
            <li>To me, this was strong enough to give your face an adequate scrub, but too weak for body parts.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it for the full 1 minute mainly because I somehow would always get soap in my mouth or eyes if I went for the full minute (and I&#x27;m lazy and impatient).  </li>
            <li>(I got the pink one), but I&#x27;m not too happy because it is expensive to have to just use on my face.</li>
            <li>Like many other I was quite hesitant to purchase the Clarisonic because of the heavy price tag attached to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricy, but I guess it&#x27;s worth it when it comes to my face.  </li>
            <li>healthy looking skin, less blackheads, less breakouts    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different types of brushes and exfoliants, but my skin just wasn&#x27;t baby soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different types of brushes and exfoliants, but my skin just wasn&#x27;t baby soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product three times so far (twice yesterday, and once today), but I can tell that it&#x27;s already made a difference.</li>
            <li>several fellows in their 20s and 30s were flirting with me saying I looked like I was about 28 or 30 years old.  </li>
            <li>I think most people make a common mistake of pushing too hard, I did for the first two days of using it</li>
            <li>Also, the brush head fits tighter and is a little more difficult to taken on/off (nothing out of the ordinary, but definitely not a loose/easy fit like the first 2).</li>
            <li>My face feels much cleaner, smoother and much less irritated than with the method I have been using for years-a washcloth and St. Ives&#x27; Apricot Scrub.</li>
            <li>I use it every other day on the normal speed.</li>

            <li> I wanted a product that would REALLY clean my skin without being too abrasive.  </li>
            <li> My face feels so clean after I use it.  </li>
            <li> and I can say the my face has never felt smoother and clean.  </li>
            <li> At first given the cost of the product, I wasn&#x27;t sure it was worth the money, but now that I have used it.  </li>
            <li> As an esthetician, grooming editor and all-around product junkie, this is one of the things I recommend for most skin types.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that many lines, so I can&#x27;t really comment on that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the various Sonicare toothbrushes for years and loved the results, which is what attracted me to the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> It is like a mini facial and very refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I felt my skin before I used the product, pretty darn smooth.</li>
            <li> They were very nice, asked for my name (I was already in the system from the previous replacement) and the serial # onthe handle.</li>
            <li> I have dropped it more than once in the shower and it has totally been fine.  </li>
            <li> , I was convinced it would be worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone - I have kind of sensitive skin and it has tolerated it very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> One thing to remember is to make sure you clean it with antibacterial soap on a regular basis to kill bacteria on the face brush.  </li>
            <li> I recommend you use your own cleansers (as long as it doesn&#x27;t have exfoliants in it.</li>
            <li> So, when I read that the same people invented Clarisonic, I felt more at ease about trying this product.  </li>
            <li> Although I have not actually changed my settings, I love that you have the ability to do so.  </li>
            <li> I emailed to confirm exactly what was included.  </li>
            <li> With constant use, I think most people will see results.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how SOFT and CLEAN my face feels after I&#x27;ve used it just a couple of times.  </li>
            <li> This review is from: Clarisonic PRO Deluxe Professional 4-Speed Skin Care System with Spot Therapy Kit, White (Health and Beauty)     </li>
            <li> B001QOGXOG Clarisonic PRO Deluxe Professional 4-Speed Skin Care System with Spot Therapy Kit, White]]</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001QOGXOG Clarisonic PRO Deluxe Professional 4-Speed Skin Care System with Spot Therapy Kit, White]]  </li>
            <li> With all the negative reviews I read, I think most of them expected it to be a miracle product, suddenly have flawless face and all imperfections would go way.</li>
            <li> I have medium to large pores.  </li>
            <li> It certainly does not hold a charge like a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I told them that I have a 30 year old daughter ;-)!    </li>
            <li> No matter how expensive/cheap/raved about cleanser I&#x27;ve used, nothing really cleaned my face.</li>
            <li> VERY</li>
            <li> I was hesitant and kinda scoffed at the idea that a rotating brush could do much for me.</li>
            <li> It really buffed away some spots that had raised bumps before.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think I need this product.</li>
            <li> This is what really hit me.</li>
            <li> This is what really hit me.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> think this really is the equivalent to an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I REALLY like it, as well as the results.</li>
            <li> Plus when using it on the face, you have to give it a push in your face so you can really feel the strength of the bristles.</li>
            <li> I am using it in conjunction with the DPL deep Penetrating Light Therapy machine  </li>
            <li> so much got</li>
            <li> There is really a difference in how my skin feels when using this device, as compared to manual washing.  </li>
            <li> Plus the replacement heads are pricey considering it doesnt do that much for my oily skin.</li>
            <li> If you are someone who takes good care of their skin, like getting a facial, or exfoliating your face once a week and all that other stuff....</li>
            <li> I saw WAY better results using Neutrogena products, than I did using other products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this latest replacement for almost 2 months with no problems, but the 3-4 month mark is where I had problems on the other 2.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle (even with my current breakout) and does a great job of cleaning deep down into my pores and everything.    </li>
            <li> If your someone like me who doesn&#x27;t really do facials or doesn&#x27;t really take care of her skin as well as you should be, you might actually get some benefit from getting the Clarisonic and actually seeing more results.  </li>
            <li> They told me that my brush had a full 3-YEAR warranty (that all Clarisonic PROs purchased in 2010 were protected one-year longer than the standard 2-year warranty).</li>
            <li> They immediately sent me out a FULL replacement via UPS and a pre-paid UPS label to send my defective one back.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without mine - and if you have problem skin, neither should you!    </li>
            <li> I noticed that initially it made the acne more obvious.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Yeh, my skin is silky smooth awesome, but it only lasts for a few days, then I feel a few dry spots here and there.</li>
            <li> Yeh, my skin is silky smooth awesome, but it only lasts for a few days, then I feel a few dry spots here and there.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is worth $225, but I haven&#x27;t found anything else that delivers the same results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now and it still works like new.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m an old lady!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent $ at spas doing a full body scrub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent $ at spas doing a full body scrub.</li>
            <li> My favorite way to use this handheld tool is to take a dash of Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant, add a little water to make a paste, and work it into my skin with the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Again, no miracles, but clearly nicer looking skin.</li>
            <li> after I used the product - wow, it made my before skin feel like sand paper.</li>
            <li> As i got the brush from you,and you would be the direct buyer, could you please help to ask Clarisonc to guarantee the repairment?</li>
            <li> -Sensitive</li>
            <li> and I do have to say that this has completely made those disappear.  </li>
            <li> five (5) months ago directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li> So far I have used this product for a week</li>
            <li> and I can save money on all those professional facials.</li>
            <li> I am 53 years old and my skin now looks like a 30 year old and is radiant and glowing.</li>
            <li> She mentioned to me yesterday that another friend is seeing the same difference in her skin that now she wants to begin coming.</li>
            <li> So much for money back guarantees.  </li>
            <li> To me, this was strong enough to give your face an adequate scrub, but too weak for body parts.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it for the full 1 minute mainly because I somehow would always get soap in my mouth or eyes if I went for the full minute (and I&#x27;m lazy and impatient).  </li>
            <li> (I got the pink one), but I&#x27;m not too happy because it is expensive to have to just use on my face.</li>
            <li> Like many other I was quite hesitant to purchase the Clarisonic because of the heavy price tag attached to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricy, but I guess it&#x27;s worth it when it comes to my face.  </li>
            <li> healthy looking skin, less blackheads, less breakouts    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different types of brushes and exfoliants, but my skin just wasn&#x27;t baby soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different types of brushes and exfoliants, but my skin just wasn&#x27;t baby soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product three times so far (twice yesterday, and once today), but I can tell that it&#x27;s already made a difference.</li>
            <li> several fellows in their 20s and 30s were flirting with me saying I looked like I was about 28 or 30 years old.  </li>
            <li> I think most people make a common mistake of pushing too hard, I did for the first two days of using it</li>
            <li> Also, the brush head fits tighter and is a little more difficult to taken on/off (nothing out of the ordinary, but definitely not a loose/easy fit like the first 2).</li>
            <li> My face feels much cleaner, smoother and much less irritated than with the method I have been using for years-a washcloth and St. Ives&#x27; Apricot Scrub.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day on the normal speed.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day on the normal speed.</li>
            <li> Now, no more flakes, less visible lines and just a generally smooth overall appearance.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t regret it and feel like I got in on a big secret since so few people know about this product or are convinced its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> PLUS this has cleared up dry spots that body scrubs have missed - the back of my thighs and upper arms.</li>
            <li> PLUS this has cleared up dry spots that body scrubs have missed - the back of my thighs and upper arms.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it will last without a charge</li>
            <li> Even with as few times as I&#x27;ve used this brush, I can tell that I won&#x27;t be going back to my old habits!</li>
            <li> Those rings of brushes spin in opposing directions at sonic speeds, loosening desmosomes (glue that holds dead skin cells together) to detach old, dull-looking skin cells from your face to reveal your younger skin.</li>
            <li> it is a little bit less, I don&#x27;t even use the other speed setting, I find the lowest setting to be just right for my face.    </li>
            <li> I also would only wash my face using my hands because a lot of the face brushes I had bought were too rough.  </li>
            <li> My skin type is combination/oily, minor breakouts once in while.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Clarisonic for about 10 months now,,, I think i could get the same results from scrubing with a wet, soapy towel.  </li>
            <li> It also seems like the handle is a little bit bigger than the regular model.</li>
            <li> They still seem a little big, but maybe not as deep.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchaed this product, due to dry skin, and blackheads.  </li>
            <li> The one thing that I do not like about the handle is that it does NOT hold acharge for very long.</li>
            <li> It would either dry it up, leave some type of a residue, or just irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Dry spots GONE.</li>
            <li> Dry spots GONE.</li>
            <li> Leave the brush off to air dry while the handle charges.   </li>
            <li> Think of how much $ you&#x27;ve spent over the years on cleansers, scrubbers, etc...think about it, seriously think about it..</li>
            <li> Although, the price has come down since I purchased it back in May for $225.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its a beep or just a slight break in the action, but either way, there&#x27;s an indication to move on to the next area.  </li>
            <li> Also, on the side note to use it don&#x27;t push hard on the brush, just let it glide and move it in a circular motion on to your face and let the sonic action do its work.  </li>

            <li> Hi, i bought a clarisonic brush from you in this Feb.the pink 4 speed one.it</li>
            <li> I have only had to charge it a few times -</li>
            <li> I have been using my Clarisonic for a few months now once daily.</li>
            <li> the PINK version sold by Facemedix.  </li>
            <li> There is absolutely NO PLACE</li>
            <li> I just bought the pink one</li>
            <li> The charger plug is now a regular small plug (a definite improvement), not a huge hair dryer type plug (like was on the previous 2 I had) and the writing/font on the handle is a slightly different color.</li>
            <li> so you know if one or the other causes a problem.  </li>
            <li> I say brainwashed because I watched the ad about 20 times and the first time thought it was silly but by the 15th time</li>
            <li> You might want to use on one small section to see the results BEFORE you do on your entire face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I haven&#x27;t replaced my brush head once in the whole year even though they recommend replacing every 3-4 months (the brush heads are expensive - $25</li>
            <li> b/c after using this product, it made me think of how much I&#x27;ve wasted and should have spent it on this product.</li>
            <li> My skin feels a little bit drier than when I use some other stuff -</li>
            <li> I received the \\&quot;Pro Deluxe\\&quot; version and it came with a \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brush and a little trial pack of cleansers.    </li>
            <li> I bought it because I got brainwashed into buying this by sitting in my dermatologists&#x27;s waiting room for 40 minutes and watching the little Clarisonic ad play over and over on the tv.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant since one reviewer said that Amazon was not an authorized seller.</li>
            <li> I would suggest making it lighter - when you&#x27;re using the body brush, it gets to be a little heavy after a few runs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would suggest making it lighter - when you&#x27;re using the body brush, it gets to be a little heavy after a few runs.     </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t push hard unless I have a rough patch of skin that I want to exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> all the products i&#x27;ve bought/used before couldn&#x27;t even come close...made me feel like I did waste a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it gets so much worse in the summer months, especially in this humid climate!</li>
            <li> It yanks out blackheads and sebum (oil) to help prevent breakouts and uneven tone.</li>
            <li> : the brush seems rather harsh for being \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times and it survived the fall with no damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few things I noticed about the Clarisonic and some suggestions ...   </li>
            <li> My husband got me the clarisonic for my birthday - and I had been coveting it for a few years.  </li>
            <li> Did anyone else have trouble registering it online?  </li>
            <li> I hate when my face doesn&#x27;t feel squeaky clean, so I&#x27;ve tortured it over the years with all kinda of harsh washes and scrubs.</li>
            <li> but it was too expensive and by the 20th time</li>
            <li> Oh, I did have a small \\&quot;bump\\&quot; on my forehead that would never go away, and it disappeared after I started using this!  </li>
            <li> But, I personally, do not have bad acne ...</li>
            <li> Pretty insane b/c</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I just wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> If the pro or plus is to expensive try the mia</li>
            <li> Cons: expensive and that the brush heads must be replaced.</li>
            <li> If you have bad acne, use caution.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> A favorite tool in my beauty arsenol!  It is like a mini facial and very refreshing.  Also, my skin has never looked clearer.</li>
            <li> Think of how much $ you&#x27;ve spent over the years on cleansers, scrubbers, etc...think about it, seriously think about it..b/c after using this product, it made me think of how much I&#x27;ve wasted and should have spent it on this product. WHY you ask...No matter how expensive/cheap/raved about cleanser I&#x27;ve used, nothing really cleaned my face. It would either dry it up, leave some type of a residue, or just irritated my skin. After years of trial and error, I gave up, and stuck to good ol fashion water and oil of olay. I&#x27;m blessed with good skin, but I still have my problem areas. I got this as a gift. VERY GLAD I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical. I was hesitant and kinda scoffed at the idea that a rotating brush could do much for me. I felt my skin before I used the product, pretty darn smooth. I tested it after I used the product - wow, it made my before skin feel like sand paper. I just knew that it cleaned out buildup of product (makeup, cleanser, lotion, whatever) because my skin actually GLOWED. I used the standard 2 minutes function on my t-zone. It really buffed away some spots that had raised bumps before. Pretty insane b/c I really didn&#x27;t think I need this product. I could only imagine what it could do for people who have problematic skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all the products i&#x27;ve bought/used before couldn&#x27;t even come close...made me feel like I did waste a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else do iI like about the Pro vs. the Mia - the 4 speed rules - only because I want it. I end up using the standard speed a lot for me face. It also seems like the handle is a little bit bigger than the regular model. I don&#x27;t think the Clarisonic cleaners that it comes with are all that fabulous. My skin feels a little bit drier than when I use some other stuff - I recommend you use your own cleansers (as long as it doesn&#x27;t have exfoliants in it. If it does, then take the brush off the machine after each use to clean it out - or it will cause build up. I like that there are grooves under the brushes so water can flow out and not stay stagnant in the machine. The design of the handle is ergonomic and comfortable to use. I would suggest making it lighter - when you&#x27;re using the body brush, it gets to be a little heavy after a few runs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the brush head that it comes with. Great for sensitive skin, great at all modes of the machine (I use the Pro mode for m t-zone and chin - my problem areas) - about once a week. I use it every other day on the normal speed. And alternate with the body brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I find most valuable - BODY BRUSH! This is what really hit me. I&#x27;ve tried different types of brushes and exfoliants, but my skin just wasn&#x27;t baby soft. I&#x27;ve spent $ at spas doing a full body scrub. Yeh, my skin is silky smooth awesome, but it only lasts for a few days, then I feel a few dry spots here and there. Not anymore!!! Dry spots GONE. Skin Smooth. It&#x27;s amazing. What I spent for 2 body scrubs &#x3D; this machine. It makes me happy. PLUS this has cleared up dry spots that body scrubs have missed - the back of my thighs and upper arms. My skin is like butter now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRUSHES - find some online -there are deals out there.r can flow out and not stay stagnant in the machine.

            <li> I cannot recommend this product, stopped working shortly after purchasing. Since it was purchased thru amazon Clairsonic will not warranty. Has been sitting under my bathroom counter for years...never again. Purchased thru &amp;#34;face medix&amp;#34; on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Hi, i bought a clarisonic brush from you in this Feb.the pink 4 speed one.it didnot work yesterday.i knew that Clarisonic could guarantee to keep it in good repair for 2 years, i did call their customer service,but they said that amazon sales are not their authorized sellers and willnot guarantee the one i bought. As i got the brush from you,and you would be the direct buyer, could you please help to ask Clarisonc to guarantee the repairment? thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product three times so far (twice yesterday, and once today), but I can tell that it&#x27;s already made a difference. My face feels much cleaner, smoother and much less irritated than with the method I have been using for years-a washcloth and St. Ives&#x27; Apricot Scrub. I hate when my face doesn&#x27;t feel squeaky clean, so I&#x27;ve tortured it over the years with all kinda of harsh washes and scrubs. I have oily skin and it gets so much worse in the summer months, especially in this humid climate! Even with as few times as I&#x27;ve used this brush, I can tell that I won&#x27;t be going back to my old habits! It&#x27;s very gentle (even with my current breakout) and does a great job of cleaning deep down into my pores and everything.    After I use this for a while longer I&#x27;ll add more to this review.</li>
            <li> As an esthetician, grooming editor and all-around product junkie, this is one of the things I recommend for most skin types. It works like this; the device has a bunch of rotating bunches in concentric rings - kind of like the Pentagon. Those rings of brushes spin in opposing directions at sonic speeds, loosening desmosomes (glue that holds dead skin cells together) to detach old, dull-looking skin cells from your face to reveal your younger skin. It also causes a bit of microcirculation, giving you that \\&quot;just )(#*@) flush! My favorite way to use this handheld tool is to take a dash of Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant, add a little water to make a paste, and work it into my skin with the Clarisonic. It yanks out blackheads and sebum (oil) to help prevent breakouts and uneven tone. It&#x27;s great for dry, oily and combination skin. I can&#x27;t live without mine - and if you have problem skin, neither should you!    i&#x27;ve posted a longer review at [...]</li>
            <li> I own a Sonicare toothbrush (for several years) and love the results.  So, when I read that the same people invented Clarisonic, I felt more at ease about trying this product.  I have used this product for over one month and have been satisfied.  I received the \\&quot;Pro Deluxe\\&quot; version and it came with a \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brush and a little trial pack of cleansers.    Pros:  -Waterproof:  I love taking this in to the shower with me  -Programmable:  Although I have not actually changed my settings, I love that you have the ability to do so.  The default is 30 seconds (forehead), 30 seconds (vertical/chin/nose), 30 seconds (cheek/side), 30 seconds (cheek/side).  -Timing: I&#x27;m not sure if its a beep or just a slight break in the action, but either way, there&#x27;s an indication to move on to the next area.  -Charging: Easy to charge in its cradle.  I don&#x27;t know how long it will last without a charge - I always keep it in its cradle.  Note, you&#x27;ll need 24 hours for the initial charge.  -Easy to hold grip/handle    Cons:  -Sensitive: the brush seems rather harsh for being \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot;.  I thought about only giving 4 stars, but, its not that big of a deal to decrease the rating.    The first time I used it, I did not use the trial cleansers, I just used my own cleanser.  The next day, I had a zit popping up on my chin.  So, I don&#x27;t know if it was on its way, or the cleansing brought it to the surface.  I mention this because I saw a prior review that blamed the trial cleanser on acne popping up.  Try either the brush (without the cleanser) or the cleanser (without the clarisonic) so you know if one or the other causes a problem.  As a side note, I did try one of the cleansers (in the orange tube).  It feels very smooth and silky, but when I&#x27;m using the Clarisonic, its like its not even there.  I thought it would help have a smoother feel during the wash.  Not a big deal, but thought I would mention it.    Results:  My face feels soooo clean after I&#x27;ve used this product.  I don&#x27;t have that many lines, so I can&#x27;t really comment on that.  I have medium to large pores.  They still seem a little big, but maybe not as deep.  Oh, I did have a small \\&quot;bump\\&quot; on my forehead that would never go away, and it disappeared after I started using this!  This product is not a miracle worker (to me), but then, I didn&#x27;t buy it with that intention.  I just wanted a cleaner face and a cleaner feel...and if my complexion improved - it was a bonus.  I&#x27;d like to try the \\&quot;spot\\&quot; brush.    Purchasing:  This review is about the product itself and not the seller.  I bought from a reseller - I emailed to confirm exactly what was included.  I believe I got what was advertised.  There is no guarantee on Clarisonic purchased via Amazon and probably not via reseller (ask them) - Clarisonic will say it only guarantees via authorized sellers.  Amazon has since removed the guarantee wording.    I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have constant breakouts or bumps.  I bought it because I got brainwashed into buying this by sitting in my dermatologists&#x27;s waiting room for 40 minutes and watching the little Clarisonic ad play over and over on the tv.  I say brainwashed because I watched the ad about 20 times and the first time thought it was silly but by the 15th time, I was convinced I wanted one but it was too expensive and by the 20th time, I was convinced it would be worth the cost.  I really don&#x27;t regret it and feel like I got in on a big secret since so few people know about this product or are convinced its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was getting married and wanted perfect skin on my big day.  I also would only wash my face using my hands because a lot of the face brushes I had bought were too rough.  I get tiny bumps on my forehead occasionally and I do have to say that this has completely made those disappear.  I don&#x27;t use it for the full 1 minute mainly because I somehow would always get soap in my mouth or eyes if I went for the full minute (and I&#x27;m lazy and impatient).  I still have terrific results.  I just leave it in my shower and charge it whenever it needs it.  I have only had to charge it a few times - the battery life is great!  I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times and it survived the fall with no damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now and it still works like new.  I don&#x27;t push hard unless I have a rough patch of skin that I want to exfoliate.  I&#x27;ll admit that I haven&#x27;t replaced my brush head once in the whole year even though they recommend replacing every 3-4 months (the brush heads are expensive - $25 each but you can get them cheaper if you buy the twin packs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this really is the equivalent to an electric toothbrush.  If you have problem teeth, an electric toothbrush will help but its great even if you have normal teeth.  Same for this, its great for problem skin but its a wonderful product even if you have normal skin.  My skin has never felt cleaner, I know I&#x27;m exfoliating without seeing any redness on my skin or damaging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update****** had it over 3 years now and still going strong!  Can&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
            <li> This review is from: Clarisonic PRO Deluxe Professional 4-Speed Skin Care System with Spot Therapy Kit, White (Health and Beauty)     I purchased my [[ASIN:B001QOGXOG Clarisonic PRO Deluxe Professional 4-Speed Skin Care System with Spot Therapy Kit, White]] five (5) months ago directly from Amazon. I REALLY like it, as well as the results. I don&#x27;t know if it is worth $225, but I haven&#x27;t found anything else that delivers the same results. Let me start off by saying that it does NOT perform miracles, but I do see results. I have (that is, had) flakey combination dry/T-ozone oily skin. Now, no more flakes, less visible lines and just a generally smooth overall appearance. Again, no miracles, but clearly nicer looking skin. I personally think the level of results that you see depends on the cleanser you use with the Clarisonic. I saw WAY better results using Neutrogena products, than I did using other products. So, finding a good face cleanser for your skin type is definitely key to seeing the best results with the Clarisonic.     I&#x27;ve used the various Sonicare toothbrushes for years and loved the results, which is what attracted me to the Clarisonic. And, yes, Clarisonic has the same EXCELLENT customer service as Sonicare. I was a little hesitant since one reviewer said that Amazon was not an authorized seller. Anyway, after two months of use, my handle was taking forever to charge and then not holding the charge. I called Clarisonic&#x27;s 800 # for customer service. They didn&#x27;t even ask me WHERE I purchased it, they just asked for the serial number. They told me that my brush had a full 3-YEAR warranty (that all Clarisonic PROs purchased in 2010 were protected one-year longer than the standard 2-year warranty). They immediately sent me out a FULL replacement via UPS and a pre-paid UPS label to send my defective one back. VERY HAPPY with that level of customer service that is rare these days!     The one thing that I do not like about the handle is that it does NOT hold acharge for very long. And, unless you speed race over your body, there won&#x27;t be enough charge to do your body and your face at the same time. It certainly does not hold a charge like a Sonicare. So, if you are traveling, you will need to bring the charger.     A few things I noticed about the Clarisonic and some suggestions ...   1. Facial cleanser used determines the results you will see with the Clarisonic. The better the face cleanser for your skin type, the better the results.   2. Take the brush head off after EVERY use and wash the handle and brush good. Leave the brush off to air dry while the handle charges.   3. I usually clean my face for 2-3 cycles of the face cleaning (i.e., I go over my face 2-3 times) because the face cleaning is on a timer and shuts off. (Beeps like the Sonicare to tell you to move to the next section.)   4. If you have bad acne, use caution. You might want to use on one small section to see the results BEFORE you do on your entire face. I noticed that initially it made the acne more obvious. But, after using several times, it actually cleared it up faster and gave an overall smoother appearance/complexion. But, I personally, do not have bad acne ... just an occasional blemish on my forehead or nose (and I noticed it initially ... but not anymore).   5. Worked great on smoothing knees and elbows.     Overall, with the EXCELLENT customer service and GREAT results, I give this product 5 STARS. I just wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive. Although, the price has come down since I purchased it back in May for $225.    UPDATE APRIL 2011: In January 2011 my REPLACEMENT HANDLE stopped holding a change AT ALL. It would sit in the charging cradle, show fully charged and the battery would INSTANTLY die when the on button was pressed. Again, I called Clarisonic&#x27;s 800# and explained my problem (that the handle was not holding a charge). They were very nice, asked for my name (I was already in the system from the previous replacement) and the serial # onthe handle. I received my replacement handle and charger via UPS within a week (along with a prepaid label to send the defective/non-working one back). This replacement looks slightly different. The charger plug is now a regular small plug (a definite improvement), not a huge hair dryer type plug (like was on the previous 2 I had) and the writing/font on the handle is a slightly different color. Also, the brush head fits tighter and is a little more difficult to taken on/off (nothing out of the ordinary, but definitely not a loose/easy fit like the first 2). I have been using this latest replacement for almost 2 months with no problems, but the 3-4 month mark is where I had problems on the other 2. I will update this review if this replacement starts to have issues.</li>
            <li> To me, this was strong enough to give your face an adequate scrub, but too weak for body parts. Plus when using it on the face, you have to give it a push in your face so you can really feel the strength of the bristles. It&#x27;s cute and all (I got the pink one), but I&#x27;m not too happy because it is expensive to have to just use on my face.</li>
            <li> I recently purchaed this product, due to dry skin, and blackheads.  I wanted a product that would REALLY clean my skin without being too abrasive.  So far I have used this product for a week and I absolutely love it.  I can see the results, I can feel the results and my skin is softer and my blackheads have diminished.  My face feels so clean after I use it.  I use it it twice a day in the morning and at night.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  If you are hedging on purchasing it, don&#x27;t.  You won&#x27;t regret it. You will see results immediately.  At first given the cost of the product, I wasn&#x27;t sure it was worth the money, but now that I have used it.  It&#x27;s worth every penny and I can save money on all those professional facials.</li>
            <li> My husband got me the clarisonic for my birthday - and I had been coveting it for a few years.  I absolutely LOVE it!  It not only does what it says it will - it exfoliates, softens my skin, and has reduced my fine lines and softened my big ole frown line in between my eyes - but it also sounds awesome.  Whoever designed the sounds and feel of the brush did a great job.  It feels solid and sounds like a well engineered machine.  I have dropped it more than once in the shower and it has totally been fine.  My elbows no longer feel like elephant knees - they are soft and wonderful. I would recommend this product to anyone - I have kind of sensitive skin and it has tolerated it very well.</li>
            <li> I have been using my Clarisonic for a few months now once daily. I am 53 years old and my skin now looks like a 30 year old and is radiant and glowing. I am using it in conjunction with the DPL deep Penetrating Light Therapy machine  and I believe that these two items make a great combination. Last weekend I went out with a girlfriend when my husband was out of town (which I haven&#x27;t done in years) and (to my utmost surprise) several fellows in their 20s and 30s were flirting with me saying I looked like I was about 28 or 30 years old.  I told them that I have a 30 year old daughter ;-)!    My girlfriends have been asking me what I am doing with my skin and my husband is telling me that my skin is beautiful, so I am seeing verifications from many places.  A friend of mine saw such a difference that she has been coming over for 10 minutes a day to use the Clarisonic and DPL machine and now her skin is looking great too. She mentioned to me yesterday that another friend is seeing the same difference in her skin that now she wants to begin coming. Anyway, I attribute my newfound appearance of \\&quot;youth\\&quot; to these two products, therefore I give both of them five stars plus!</li>
            <li> I tried my cousin&#x27;s Clarisonic once, and I was sold.  I cannot believe how SOFT and CLEAN my face feels after I&#x27;ve used it just a couple of times.  My moisturizer then makes it even softer.  And I&#x27;m an old lady!  Well, 63 anyway.  It&#x27;s well worth the money.  Did anyone else have trouble registering it online?  I couldn&#x27;t figure out which number was the 11-digit number they wanted . . .</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001QOGXOG Clarisonic PRO Deluxe Professional 4-Speed Skin Care System with Spot Therapy Kit, White]]  This ia actually the PINK version sold by Facemedix.  So much for money back guarantees.  Tbese people want a 20% restocking fee for an item I must return because the friend I bought it for already has one.  There is absolutely NO PLACE I see anything about a restocking fee.  I will never buy a product from Facemedix or Philips Sonic again.  Corey Carlson</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t ever leave a review or comment on anything I purchase but I thought I should share my experience with the Clarisonic, Like many other I was quite hesitant to purchase the Clarisonic because of the heavy price tag attached to it. So hopefully I can help someone decide to purchase it or not.      I think its an awesome product, it does what it says.  With all the negative reviews I read, I think most of them expected it to be a miracle product, suddenly have flawless face and all imperfections would go way. With constant use, I think most people will see results. I have used it for a month now and I can say the my face has never felt smoother and clean.  My skin type is combination/oily, minor breakouts once in while.  I use it once a day.      But I will say that not everyone needs this product if you have cash to shell out go for it.  If you are someone who takes good care of their skin, like getting a facial, or exfoliating your face once a week and all that other stuff.... you probably would not need this.  If your someone like me who doesn&#x27;t really do facials or doesn&#x27;t really take care of her skin as well as you should be, you might actually get some benefit from getting the Clarisonic and actually seeing more results.  I actually love it so much got my sister, my sister and I got our mom one. I can&#x27;t wash my face without using the clarisonic its just not the same.  If the pro or plus is to expensive try the mia it is a little bit less, I don&#x27;t even use the other speed setting, I find the lowest setting to be just right for my face.    Also, on the side note to use it don&#x27;t push hard on the brush, just let it glide and move it in a circular motion on to your face and let the sonic action do its work.  I think most people make a common mistake of pushing too hard, I did for the first two days of using it so I thought it was drying my face out but it was just me over exfoliating my skin. They say its not an exfoliator but I beg to differ its a brush your moving in a circular motion against your face its bound to exfoliate something.    Pros: healthy looking skin, less blackheads, less breakouts    Cons: expensive and that the brush heads must be replaced.</li>
            <li> I love the Clarisonic PRO Deluxe.  There is really a difference in how my skin feels when using this device, as compared to manual washing.  It&#x27;s a little pricy, but I guess it&#x27;s worth it when it comes to my face.  One thing to remember is to make sure you clean it with antibacterial soap on a regular basis to kill bacteria on the face brush.  Otherwise, you are just transfering bacteria back and forth.  I have already recommended this to several people.  My husband has his own brush head and uses it twice a day.  This is really a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Clarisonic for about 10 months now,,, I think i could get the same results from scrubing with a wet, soapy towel.  Plus the replacement heads are pricey considering it doesnt do that much for my oily skin.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. I have acne at 38 (geez when will it ever end) and I have to say this product help my skin care system be more effective. You can see a difference in about two weeks. Your face feels wonderful. I just wished they had made a buff so that I could put my creams (at night) in a spa way... I would highly recommend this item. I was eyeing this item for about three months before I bought it, and I wished I would have bought it sooner. Definitely get the 4 speed one.</li>
            <li> I just bought the pink one and I LOVE it so much!! Best thing ever!!</li>
