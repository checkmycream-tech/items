            <li>It&#x27;s the BEST product that we&#x27;ve been able to find for our skin.  </li>
            <li>So handy anywhere!  </li>
            <li>Great colour and convienent and easy to take with you anywhere!!</li>
            <li>This is the best product of its kind and nicely priced on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I would not use this as a primary source of sunscreen, but is great for touch ups!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly it works.</li>
            <li>Seemed to work fairly well.</li>
            <li>I have fair to medium skin tone and the powder is invisible on my skin.</li>
            <li>This product sounded like a good idea.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless,  this product is good in theory, but for sun protection, it is inefficient.  </li>
            <li>It is a good product</li>
            <li>which is good.  </li>
            <li>So good enough.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>The powder is nice, feels good, covers well</li>
            <li>The color, though advertised as transparent, is kind of a bronze color on my fair skin.</li>
            <li>Great product, be aware it comes off onto your clothes!!!</li>
            <li>My favorite powder!</li>
            <li>We love powder sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Leaves your face with a healthy glow!</li>
            <li>I love this as an alternative to greasy lotion!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and gives great coverage.</li>
            <li>amazing idea and so convenient.</li>
            <li>Amazing product that makes life easier.</li>
            <li>Awesome, not heavy or cakey this powder works great, love it for the summer.</li>
            <li>Because this is a specialty item, it&#x27;s not something we can find at our destination when we&#x27;re traveling, so I&#x27;m always happy when a product can fit into our carry-on luggage.  </li>
            <li>That is what zinc and titanium dioxide is for - but to each his/her own.</li>
            <li>So nice to have when you forget sunscreen and already have makeup on.</li>
            <li>Nice sheen to skin after it is applied.</li>
            <li>On those days I wear a make-up foundation, this is a nice &amp;#34;setter&amp;#34; for that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Handy on the golf course to protect my nose.</li>
            <li>it is like a nice translucent powder, that also gives sun protection.</li>
            <li>It was still looking nice, so it is protecting well.</li>
            <li>Nice compact styling</li>
            <li>It was great to quickly apply to my face and reduced shine.</li>
            <li>Yes it discolors my hair a bit, but this is the absolute best product I have been able to find that doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, keep one in my bag and one at the front door</li>
            <li>I love, love this powder!</li>
            <li>Great product and super easy to use!</li>
            <li>This sunscreen leaves a translucent, soft finish on my face, and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>The true test was on my vacation to the Mediterranean, and it passed with flying colors!!</li>
            <li>morning routine is so easy now!</li>
            <li>This powdered sunscreen goes on easily and stays on!</li>
            <li>so easy to apply!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this!</li>
            <li>It worked great to protect the part on my head from my hair being in pony tails;)</li>
            <li>Love this product goes on easy and covers so well!</li>
            <li>It is a very light application - even when fully opened.</li>
            <li>The brush is very cheap though.  </li>
            <li>It was everything I hoped it would be, easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li>Easy to use ,handy to carry.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for sunscreen lotion, but realized that the creams are superior to ensure you get adequate coverage.  </li>
            <li>I would not trust these types of mineral blocks for full on all day exposure as I am very very fair and thus very very sun-sensitive.</li>
            <li>and it gives a nice, light airbrush-like finish.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it works and it can be applied on top of my makeup when I go out into the sun.</li>
            <li>but I want to make sure they are protected.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>OK, I can&#x27;t tell you how well it screens me from the sun, but I have been using on top of my make-up and with no make up on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this powder sunscreen.</li>
            <li>so I can brush some on real quick when I head out for a walk or bike up to the store.</li>
            <li>Never have I been able to use them without making a mess.&lt;br</li>
            <li>may* be better quality powders, but the difference is negligible and none of them have the convenience factor or the portability</li>
            <li>If Im wearing makeup I can still dust this on top and not worry about smudging etc.</li>
            <li>You get more bristles on your face than powder.</li>
            <li>but the applicator could be much better.</li>
            <li>I like the product ok, but the brush is horrid.</li>
            <li>love the powder, but the brush bristle fall out all over.  </li>
            <li>So much better than the sticky, greasy, sprays and lotions.</li>
            <li>I like colorscience better.  </li>
            <li>Works fantastic!</li>
            <li>It seemed to work OK on my forehead and nose, but that was it.  </li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>Cheap brush!  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love that this is convenient to carry around.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend it to anyone, and def glad I tried it on myself before I tried it in my son.</li>
            <li>I did get a bit of a tan (probably should have reapplied more often)</li>
            <li>I use it as my top powder after I&#x27;ve put makeup on.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>Also make sure to keep it out of your eyes.</li>
            <li>However, I was most amazed at the fact that the powder stayed on my face without streaking  after I biked and was sweating.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Here&#x27;s why we love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this for me and my kids.</li>
            <li>A miracle for moms on the go with kids to cover :)</li>
            <li>The brush on Roth sunscreen was a lot better</li>
            <li>Love Amazon.</li>
            <li>Time to order more.  </li>
            <li>Excellent, light, good color, not too heavy</li>
            <li>So easy to apply and my kids love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen easy to carry and apply.</li>
            <li>Probably wouldn&#x27;t work in full sun for hours on end; but for running around doing errands and such, it &#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>I know we women are supposedly superior at multi-tasking, but there&#x27;s so much to do in the mornings</li>
            <li>Even when reapplying very often, you&#x27;ll still get some sun (though not a burn, in my experience, and I have somewhat fair skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to carry around in your purse.</li>
            <li>My redheaded husband easily applies this whenever he goes out to do yardwork or be i the sun at all.</li>
            <li>It takes 30 seconds to apply before leaving the house and keeping it in your purse or bag is so easy</li>
            <li>Also easy to reapply while on the trail.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy and convenient for reapplication during the day.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s also a really easy product to carry in your purse, bag, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I need sun protection - and this works well and is easy to pack.  </li>
            <li>The tone is fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;Compact powders require a separate brush and are fine but getting the coverage even is a pain - and they don&#x27;t have sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mineral formula is fine but the applicator is a nightmare.</li>
            <li>, it washes out fine).</li>
            <li>The stuff is super convenient!</li>
            <li>this is more pure and much more of a value.</li>
            <li>Perfect for everyday use</li>
            <li>The powder covers nicely, but not too much.</li>
            <li>But for a short walk in the sun, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Like the light feel of the powder and the fact</li>
            <li>applies lightly but leaves a soft, comfortable feel and good look.</li>
            <li>This I would not recommend because it does not go on smoothly without leaving a blotched look.  </li>
            <li>, so I have still been using a cream sunblock, but this is absolutely fantastic for face, hands, neck.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t expire for ages.</li>
            <li>This is so easy and quick to use.</li>
            <li>And how do I clean the brush?</li>
            <li>/&gt;In sum, if your skin is at all finicky or sensitive, or if you must avoid gluten products, or if you just want to try a great mineral sunblock, I highly recommend this product.onger</li>
            <li>/&gt;In sum, if your skin is at all finicky or sensitive, or if you must avoid gluten products, or if you just want to try a great mineral sunblock, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Love having this around with kids- so much easier than creams and sticks.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I am stocking up</li>
            <li>I love this because it has a bit of color, but not so much that it looks like bronzer or even face powder.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for my item, love my product.</li>
            <li>Product is great, however the brush is very rough on my face.</li>
            <li>I got the package rather quickly from the seller.</li>
            <li>is quick, a transparent powder</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s a nice powder in general.</li>
            <li>But that is being hyper sensitive (which I am), and I still rate it 5 stars because as far as sunscreens go, I think it is the best thing I have found so far.</li>
            <li>Though, most dermatologists warn against the spf stability in most makeup sunscreens - there are many that carry a similar mineral line with micronized sunscreen included that shouldn&#x27;t be completely snubbed.</li>
            <li>Small for travel and not too much color but good for oil/shiny ESP in Summer!!</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want something that would make me look as if I were wearing makeup, and this doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on easily and has no smell at all.</li>
            <li>The powder itself works very well, but the brush is so cheap.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ll likely shop around for a more affordable version of this.be the primary way to go</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Fun to use.  </li>
            <li>I should have applied it more frequently.  </li>
            <li>I just wanted something quick and easy to coat my face, neck, and ears (a place most people forget to protect and one of the most common sites for skin cancer)</li>
            <li>The brush is quite stiff and doesn&#x27;t feel great -</li>
            <li>Also, it goes only very easily and protects your skin.</li>
            <li>More likely, a quick application to the chest.</li>
            <li>Many of family and friends have become great fans of this and my young grandson uses it without complaint as well...</li>
            <li>The color is generally transparent: I&#x27;m quite fair, and it did not show except as a slight matte finish, at the beginning or at the end of vacation when I was more tanned.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the light just isn&#x27;t quite light enough.</li>
            <li>Packaging is not as good as another brand previously purchased.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply on young kids.</li>
            <li>This SPF provides great coverage and acts as a great base for a powder foundation.  </li>
            <li>Works good but sometimes leaves a muddy mess on my forehead if I sweat a lot.</li>
            <li>I like it because it is quick and easy to apply, non greasy like regular sunblock, esp on my face.  </li>
            <li>I thought that the first time as well.  </li>
            <li>Have reordered this multiple times and gifted it to our children.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ll likely shop around for a more affordable version of this.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying powder sun screen, so I can&#x27;t vouch for if this is best-in-class or not.</li>
            <li>Please comment back if you think there is something better.</li>
            <li>This thing definitely lets out powder if you use it as directed, need to shake a bit first to get the powder into the brush, i hope it is giving me more sun protection.  </li>
            <li>I apply regular sunscreen and then layer this on top.</li>
            <li>Maybe some lotion first would do the trick.  </li>
            <li>I love this for when it&#x27;s hot outside.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Brush is very soft and nice but powder doesn&#x27;t go into the applicator very fast or enough of it .</li>
            <li>I am a red head and fair and it works as a reapplication or in a pinch if you&#x27;re going to be outside on a patio or walking around.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty fair (usually buy &amp;#34;porcelain&amp;#34; foundation)</li>
            <li>This product actually works well for sun defense and applies really easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to carry and re-apply later in the day as needed.</li>
            <li>If you plan on using this product a fair amount, it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>The product itself is just fine, I took it with me on vacation in the Caribbean and used it almost exclusively on my face instead of regular sunblock.</li>
            <li>Though, that&#x27;s good in order to avoid dumping the powder all over your face; it makes the application process a little more timely and tedious if you&#x27;re concerned with making sure to receive ample coverage.</li>
            <li>The HUGE problem is that it is an enormous pain in the you-know-what to get the powder into the brush!!!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t hang out in the sun much but believe this does keep me protected when going about my day in the ever-present California sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just at a point in my life where I don&#x27;t want to have to fuss too much over anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t be any happier with it.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>You have to really work at getting the powder out, and must reapply every hour or so.</li>
            <li>-very silky</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t discolor my hair so much that I would want to risk skin cancer.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>The product is also very drying, but that may be a pro for someone with oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>If we put on regular sunblock, or even oil free sunblock, it wreaks havoc on our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll want to reapply very often.  </li>
            <li>Still, the tried and true topically application of zinc/titanium dioxide (physical blockers) seems to be the primary way to go</li>
            <li>As much as I do think the product itself is good, I might opt for the more expensive brand next time.</li>
            <li>I love that it is slightly tinted so that you can see how much you are applying.  </li>
            <li>After paying way too much for the Tickle Time product which claimed to have more grams of mineral sunblock than this, the Mineral Fusion lasted WAY longer with less product and was cheaper - though still kinda pricey for what you get.</li>
            <li>I have previously used Colorscience which I love, but this was cheaper.</li>
            <li>I love that this is a sunblock but isn&#x27;t subject to TSA&#x27;s 3-ounce liquid rule.  </li>
            <li>I also spilt half of it by twisting where the powder is to get more out.  </li>
            <li>My son, particularly hates the feel of lotion sunscreen on his face.</li>
            <li>and I would describe it as a high quality face powder.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I should not have been surprised when I got too much sun and the lack of coverage was noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I mean, most makeup brands carry something similar with the same ingredients for way less for more product and provide the added benefit of more colors and coverage.</li>
            <li>I do wish it came in a better array of colors as I am so pale</li>
            <li>glad I read reviews, because they said this looks pale when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>This is largely due to the fact that it can be difficult to tell exactly where you&#x27;ve dusted, and also the thought of applying this on a sweaty body just doesn&#x27;t sound like a good idea.</li>
            <li>A little hard to get the first application onto the brush but great after that.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida, so</li>
            <li>I received my new makeup yesterday just in time for an event.</li>
            <li>I like the product itself, but the bottom came off and spilled powder all over my brand new Kate Spade purse.</li>
            <li>I live in the sub-tropics.</li>
            <li>This SPF mineral powder works just as well as the most expensive brands out there, but without all the ridiculous fillers (which they claim are good for the skin but are not!).</li>
            <li>Just make sure u reapply if your face gets wet obviously because it&#x27;s a powder</li>
            <li>Related to point #1 above, this product is gluten free.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen works well after you figure out how to get the actual powder to come out in a consistent manner (which it never will</li>
            <li>Thought after the first couple uses the brush would stop shedding, but no such luck.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really only planning on using this on top of my regular sunscreen and make-up, so it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li>I have amazingly sensitive skin and the sun does not like me at all!</li>
            <li>I was completely sunburned!</li>
            <li>only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a higher rating, is the darn brush.</li>
            <li>and as I get older the sun seems to make me red that much quicker.  </li>
            <li>I easily burn if I am out in the sun after only 15 minutes; I tried this at a baseball game with full sun exposure for hours and stayed protected!  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply, and non messy.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and goes on thickly enough that you can actually see how much and how evenly it is applied to arms and legs - something not easily seen in more expensive and better known powder sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>It feels soft and smooth, yet manages a slightly matte finish.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely not a problem for us, and it&#x27;s one of the reasons we love it, but something to note if your skin is on the dry side to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is absolutely not a problem for us, and it&#x27;s one of the reasons we love it, but something to note if your skin is on the dry side to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The powder goes on lightly and with little color but provides hours of sun protection.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is a physical sunblock as I have always been a little concerned about chemical sunblocks.</li>
            <li>A bit of BB cream, some illuminator for those pesky under-eye circles, a quick swipe of all-day gel blush, my minimal eye makeup and this!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a clear part at the bottom, so you can tell when it&#x27;s running</li>
            <li>When I went back to whole foods to purchase another</li>
            <li>I use it like a facial powder and it works so well absorbing oil and reducing shine.  </li>
            <li>Used it on my hubbies face and head one day when we realized we were going to unexpectedly be out in the sun for a while.  </li>
            <li>So far my 11 year old son loves it and</li>
            <li>Just took a walk outside with my kids and got too much sun.  </li>
            <li>So far, it has kept my daughter and me from burning.</li>
            <li>I can see how much powder is left in the brush.  </li>
            <li>Work very well for my wife on a recent trip to Florida.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s working, because I burn at the drop of a hat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>its to have on hand, not mess up your make up or look like a greasy mess.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just brush a little on, it blends right over my makeup!</li>
            <li>All of my life I&#x27;ve used more expensive brands, but I picked up this makeup from whole foods in an emergency and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper and lasts twice as long.</li>
            <li>Normally, I would not have gotten any color with the daily moisturizer I use with SPF.</li>
            <li>Some of the brush hairs shed within the first few uses, but it&#x27;s not a serious problem.</li>
            <li>I can actually seen how much product is left and don&#x27;t have to guess.  </li>
            <li>This may be an effective sunscreen, I haven&#x27;t actually tested that part out, but I agree with other reviewers that this product makes your skin very pale.</li>
            <li>This works just as well as pricier brands, and is small enough to fit in my purse.</li>
            <li>Powder barely comes out of brush</li>
            <li>The cloud of dust apparently didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m playing a competitive tennis season, plus practices (~20 uses), the bottle is nearly gone, and I only use it on my face and shoulders.  </li>
            <li>This is the only thing I use in my face as I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small enough to fit in my makeup bag in my purse and tolerates the abuse of a daily carry -</li>
            <li>does the job and much lower price than other sunscreen powders.</li>
            <li>Thomas Roth didn&#x27;t show how much product was left so I never knew if it was empty or not.  </li>
            <li>Cheaper (by more than half) of another version I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that easy to use to cut down on the everyday exposure to sun.</li>
            <li>Will use Bare Minerals foundation next time for a powder spf coverage.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I couldn&#x27;t find the right shade of my usual brand.  </li>
            <li>But then I applied it in mirror with a window behind me and it was easy to see the powder coming</li>
            <li>The slight tint looks natural on my lighter-toned skin and doesn&#x27;t make my olive-skinned 10-year old daughter look like a ghost.  </li>
            <li>But the brush is little rough and it&#x27;s kind of hard to get enough powder on the brush..</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s the BEST product that we&#x27;ve been able to find for our skin.  </li>
            <li> So handy anywhere!  </li>
            <li> Great colour and convienent and easy to take with you anywhere!!</li>
            <li> This is the best product of its kind and nicely priced on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I would not use this as a primary source of sunscreen, but is great for touch ups!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly it works.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work fairly well.</li>
            <li> I have fair to medium skin tone and the powder is invisible on my skin.</li>
            <li> This product sounded like a good idea.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless,  this product is good in theory, but for sun protection, it is inefficient.  </li>
            <li> It is a good product</li>
            <li> which is good.  </li>
            <li> So good enough.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> The powder is nice, feels good, covers well</li>
            <li> The color, though advertised as transparent, is kind of a bronze color on my fair skin.</li>
            <li> Great product, be aware it comes off onto your clothes!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite powder!</li>
            <li> We love powder sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Leaves your face with a healthy glow!</li>
            <li> I love this as an alternative to greasy lotion!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and gives great coverage.</li>
            <li> amazing idea and so convenient.</li>
            <li> Amazing product that makes life easier.</li>
            <li> Awesome, not heavy or cakey this powder works great, love it for the summer.</li>
            <li> Because this is a specialty item, it&#x27;s not something we can find at our destination when we&#x27;re traveling, so I&#x27;m always happy when a product can fit into our carry-on luggage.  </li>
            <li> That is what zinc and titanium dioxide is for - but to each his/her own.</li>
            <li> So nice to have when you forget sunscreen and already have makeup on.</li>
            <li> Nice sheen to skin after it is applied.</li>
            <li> On those days I wear a make-up foundation, this is a nice &amp;#34;setter&amp;#34; for that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Handy on the golf course to protect my nose.</li>
            <li> it is like a nice translucent powder, that also gives sun protection.</li>
            <li> It was still looking nice, so it is protecting well.</li>
            <li> Nice compact styling</li>
            <li> It was great to quickly apply to my face and reduced shine.</li>
            <li> Yes it discolors my hair a bit, but this is the absolute best product I have been able to find that doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, keep one in my bag and one at the front door</li>
            <li> I love, love this powder!</li>
            <li> Great product and super easy to use!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen leaves a translucent, soft finish on my face, and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> The true test was on my vacation to the Mediterranean, and it passed with flying colors!!</li>
            <li> morning routine is so easy now!</li>
            <li> This powdered sunscreen goes on easily and stays on!</li>
            <li> so easy to apply!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this!</li>
            <li> It worked great to protect the part on my head from my hair being in pony tails;)</li>
            <li> Love this product goes on easy and covers so well!</li>
            <li> It is a very light application - even when fully opened.</li>
            <li> The brush is very cheap though.  </li>
            <li> It was everything I hoped it would be, easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> Easy to use ,handy to carry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for sunscreen lotion, but realized that the creams are superior to ensure you get adequate coverage.  </li>
            <li> I would not trust these types of mineral blocks for full on all day exposure as I am very very fair and thus very very sun-sensitive.</li>
            <li> and it gives a nice, light airbrush-like finish.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it works and it can be applied on top of my makeup when I go out into the sun.</li>
            <li> but I want to make sure they are protected.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> OK, I can&#x27;t tell you how well it screens me from the sun, but I have been using on top of my make-up and with no make up on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this powder sunscreen.</li>
            <li> so I can brush some on real quick when I head out for a walk or bike up to the store.</li>
            <li> Never have I been able to use them without making a mess.&lt;br</li>
            <li> may* be better quality powders, but the difference is negligible and none of them have the convenience factor or the portability</li>
            <li> If Im wearing makeup I can still dust this on top and not worry about smudging etc.</li>
            <li> You get more bristles on your face than powder.</li>
            <li> but the applicator could be much better.</li>
            <li> I like the product ok, but the brush is horrid.</li>
            <li> love the powder, but the brush bristle fall out all over.  </li>
            <li> So much better than the sticky, greasy, sprays and lotions.</li>
            <li> I like colorscience better.  </li>
            <li> Works fantastic!</li>
            <li> It seemed to work OK on my forehead and nose, but that was it.  </li>
            <li> ok.  </li>
            <li> Cheap brush!  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love that this is convenient to carry around.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it to anyone, and def glad I tried it on myself before I tried it in my son.</li>
            <li> I did get a bit of a tan (probably should have reapplied more often)</li>
            <li> I use it as my top powder after I&#x27;ve put makeup on.</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> Also make sure to keep it out of your eyes.</li>
            <li> However, I was most amazed at the fact that the powder stayed on my face without streaking  after I biked and was sweating.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Here&#x27;s why we love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this for me and my kids.</li>
            <li> A miracle for moms on the go with kids to cover :)</li>
            <li> The brush on Roth sunscreen was a lot better</li>
            <li> Love Amazon.</li>
            <li> Time to order more.  </li>
            <li> Excellent, light, good color, not too heavy</li>
            <li> So easy to apply and my kids love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen easy to carry and apply.</li>
            <li> Probably wouldn&#x27;t work in full sun for hours on end; but for running around doing errands and such, it &#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I know we women are supposedly superior at multi-tasking, but there&#x27;s so much to do in the mornings</li>
            <li> Even when reapplying very often, you&#x27;ll still get some sun (though not a burn, in my experience, and I have somewhat fair skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to carry around in your purse.</li>
            <li> My redheaded husband easily applies this whenever he goes out to do yardwork or be i the sun at all.</li>
            <li> It takes 30 seconds to apply before leaving the house and keeping it in your purse or bag is so easy</li>
            <li> Also easy to reapply while on the trail.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Easy and convenient for reapplication during the day.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s also a really easy product to carry in your purse, bag, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I need sun protection - and this works well and is easy to pack.  </li>
            <li> The tone is fine</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compact powders require a separate brush and are fine but getting the coverage even is a pain - and they don&#x27;t have sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mineral formula is fine but the applicator is a nightmare.</li>
            <li> , it washes out fine).</li>
            <li> The stuff is super convenient!</li>
            <li> this is more pure and much more of a value.</li>
            <li> Perfect for everyday use</li>
            <li> The powder covers nicely, but not too much.</li>
            <li> But for a short walk in the sun, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Like the light feel of the powder and the fact</li>
            <li> applies lightly but leaves a soft, comfortable feel and good look.</li>
            <li> This I would not recommend because it does not go on smoothly without leaving a blotched look.  </li>
            <li> , so I have still been using a cream sunblock, but this is absolutely fantastic for face, hands, neck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t expire for ages.</li>
            <li> This is so easy and quick to use.</li>
            <li> And how do I clean the brush?</li>
            <li> /&gt;In sum, if your skin is at all finicky or sensitive, or if you must avoid gluten products, or if you just want to try a great mineral sunblock, I highly recommend this product.onger</li>
            <li> /&gt;In sum, if your skin is at all finicky or sensitive, or if you must avoid gluten products, or if you just want to try a great mineral sunblock, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love having this around with kids- so much easier than creams and sticks.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I am stocking up</li>
            <li> I love this because it has a bit of color, but not so much that it looks like bronzer or even face powder.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for my item, love my product.</li>
            <li> Product is great, however the brush is very rough on my face.</li>
            <li> I got the package rather quickly from the seller.</li>
            <li> is quick, a transparent powder</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s a nice powder in general.</li>
            <li> But that is being hyper sensitive (which I am), and I still rate it 5 stars because as far as sunscreens go, I think it is the best thing I have found so far.</li>
            <li> Though, most dermatologists warn against the spf stability in most makeup sunscreens - there are many that carry a similar mineral line with micronized sunscreen included that shouldn&#x27;t be completely snubbed.</li>
            <li> Small for travel and not too much color but good for oil/shiny ESP in Summer!!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want something that would make me look as if I were wearing makeup, and this doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on easily and has no smell at all.</li>
            <li> The powder itself works very well, but the brush is so cheap.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll likely shop around for a more affordable version of this.be the primary way to go</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Fun to use.  </li>
            <li> I should have applied it more frequently.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted something quick and easy to coat my face, neck, and ears (a place most people forget to protect and one of the most common sites for skin cancer)</li>
            <li> The brush is quite stiff and doesn&#x27;t feel great -</li>
            <li> Also, it goes only very easily and protects your skin.</li>
            <li> More likely, a quick application to the chest.</li>
            <li> Many of family and friends have become great fans of this and my young grandson uses it without complaint as well...</li>
            <li> The color is generally transparent: I&#x27;m quite fair, and it did not show except as a slight matte finish, at the beginning or at the end of vacation when I was more tanned.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the light just isn&#x27;t quite light enough.</li>
            <li> Packaging is not as good as another brand previously purchased.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply on young kids.</li>
            <li> This SPF provides great coverage and acts as a great base for a powder foundation.  </li>
            <li> Works good but sometimes leaves a muddy mess on my forehead if I sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is quick and easy to apply, non greasy like regular sunblock, esp on my face.  </li>
            <li> I thought that the first time as well.  </li>
            <li> Have reordered this multiple times and gifted it to our children.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll likely shop around for a more affordable version of this.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying powder sun screen, so I can&#x27;t vouch for if this is best-in-class or not.</li>
            <li> Please comment back if you think there is something better.</li>
            <li> This thing definitely lets out powder if you use it as directed, need to shake a bit first to get the powder into the brush, i hope it is giving me more sun protection.  </li>
            <li> I apply regular sunscreen and then layer this on top.</li>
            <li> Maybe some lotion first would do the trick.  </li>
            <li> I love this for when it&#x27;s hot outside.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Brush is very soft and nice but powder doesn&#x27;t go into the applicator very fast or enough of it .</li>
            <li> I am a red head and fair and it works as a reapplication or in a pinch if you&#x27;re going to be outside on a patio or walking around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty fair (usually buy &amp;#34;porcelain&amp;#34; foundation)</li>
            <li> This product actually works well for sun defense and applies really easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry and re-apply later in the day as needed.</li>
            <li> If you plan on using this product a fair amount, it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> The product itself is just fine, I took it with me on vacation in the Caribbean and used it almost exclusively on my face instead of regular sunblock.</li>
            <li> Though, that&#x27;s good in order to avoid dumping the powder all over your face; it makes the application process a little more timely and tedious if you&#x27;re concerned with making sure to receive ample coverage.</li>
            <li> The HUGE problem is that it is an enormous pain in the you-know-what to get the powder into the brush!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hang out in the sun much but believe this does keep me protected when going about my day in the ever-present California sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just at a point in my life where I don&#x27;t want to have to fuss too much over anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t be any happier with it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> You have to really work at getting the powder out, and must reapply every hour or so.</li>
            <li> -very silky</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t discolor my hair so much that I would want to risk skin cancer.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> The product is also very drying, but that may be a pro for someone with oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> If we put on regular sunblock, or even oil free sunblock, it wreaks havoc on our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll want to reapply very often.  </li>
            <li> Still, the tried and true topically application of zinc/titanium dioxide (physical blockers) seems to be the primary way to go</li>
            <li> As much as I do think the product itself is good, I might opt for the more expensive brand next time.</li>
            <li> I love that it is slightly tinted so that you can see how much you are applying.  </li>
            <li> After paying way too much for the Tickle Time product which claimed to have more grams of mineral sunblock than this, the Mineral Fusion lasted WAY longer with less product and was cheaper - though still kinda pricey for what you get.</li>
            <li> I have previously used Colorscience which I love, but this was cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love that this is a sunblock but isn&#x27;t subject to TSA&#x27;s 3-ounce liquid rule.  </li>
            <li> I also spilt half of it by twisting where the powder is to get more out.  </li>
            <li> My son, particularly hates the feel of lotion sunscreen on his face.</li>
            <li> and I would describe it as a high quality face powder.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I should not have been surprised when I got too much sun and the lack of coverage was noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I mean, most makeup brands carry something similar with the same ingredients for way less for more product and provide the added benefit of more colors and coverage.</li>
            <li> I do wish it came in a better array of colors as I am so pale</li>
            <li> glad I read reviews, because they said this looks pale when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> This is largely due to the fact that it can be difficult to tell exactly where you&#x27;ve dusted, and also the thought of applying this on a sweaty body just doesn&#x27;t sound like a good idea.</li>
            <li> A little hard to get the first application onto the brush but great after that.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida, so</li>
            <li> I received my new makeup yesterday just in time for an event.</li>
            <li> I like the product itself, but the bottom came off and spilled powder all over my brand new Kate Spade purse.</li>
            <li> I live in the sub-tropics.</li>
            <li> This SPF mineral powder works just as well as the most expensive brands out there, but without all the ridiculous fillers (which they claim are good for the skin but are not!).</li>
            <li> Just make sure u reapply if your face gets wet obviously because it&#x27;s a powder</li>
            <li> Related to point #1 above, this product is gluten free.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen works well after you figure out how to get the actual powder to come out in a consistent manner (which it never will</li>
            <li> Thought after the first couple uses the brush would stop shedding, but no such luck.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really only planning on using this on top of my regular sunscreen and make-up, so it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I have amazingly sensitive skin and the sun does not like me at all!</li>
            <li> I was completely sunburned!</li>
            <li> only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a higher rating, is the darn brush.</li>
            <li> and as I get older the sun seems to make me red that much quicker.  </li>
            <li> I easily burn if I am out in the sun after only 15 minutes; I tried this at a baseball game with full sun exposure for hours and stayed protected!  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply, and non messy.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and goes on thickly enough that you can actually see how much and how evenly it is applied to arms and legs - something not easily seen in more expensive and better known powder sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> It feels soft and smooth, yet manages a slightly matte finish.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely not a problem for us, and it&#x27;s one of the reasons we love it, but something to note if your skin is on the dry side to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is absolutely not a problem for us, and it&#x27;s one of the reasons we love it, but something to note if your skin is on the dry side to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The powder goes on lightly and with little color but provides hours of sun protection.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is a physical sunblock as I have always been a little concerned about chemical sunblocks.</li>
            <li> A bit of BB cream, some illuminator for those pesky under-eye circles, a quick swipe of all-day gel blush, my minimal eye makeup and this!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a clear part at the bottom, so you can tell when it&#x27;s running</li>
            <li> When I went back to whole foods to purchase another</li>
            <li> I use it like a facial powder and it works so well absorbing oil and reducing shine.  </li>
            <li> Used it on my hubbies face and head one day when we realized we were going to unexpectedly be out in the sun for a while.  </li>
            <li> So far my 11 year old son loves it and</li>
            <li> Just took a walk outside with my kids and got too much sun.  </li>
            <li> So far, it has kept my daughter and me from burning.</li>
            <li> I can see how much powder is left in the brush.  </li>
            <li> Work very well for my wife on a recent trip to Florida.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s working, because I burn at the drop of a hat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> its to have on hand, not mess up your make up or look like a greasy mess.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just brush a little on, it blends right over my makeup!</li>
            <li> All of my life I&#x27;ve used more expensive brands, but I picked up this makeup from whole foods in an emergency and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper and lasts twice as long.</li>
            <li> Normally, I would not have gotten any color with the daily moisturizer I use with SPF.</li>
            <li> Some of the brush hairs shed within the first few uses, but it&#x27;s not a serious problem.</li>
            <li> I can actually seen how much product is left and don&#x27;t have to guess.  </li>
            <li> This may be an effective sunscreen, I haven&#x27;t actually tested that part out, but I agree with other reviewers that this product makes your skin very pale.</li>
            <li> This works just as well as pricier brands, and is small enough to fit in my purse.</li>
            <li> Powder barely comes out of brush</li>
            <li> The cloud of dust apparently didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m playing a competitive tennis season, plus practices (~20 uses), the bottle is nearly gone, and I only use it on my face and shoulders.  </li>
            <li> This is the only thing I use in my face as I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to fit in my makeup bag in my purse and tolerates the abuse of a daily carry -</li>
            <li> does the job and much lower price than other sunscreen powders.</li>
            <li> Thomas Roth didn&#x27;t show how much product was left so I never knew if it was empty or not.  </li>
            <li> Cheaper (by more than half) of another version I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that easy to use to cut down on the everyday exposure to sun.</li>
            <li> Will use Bare Minerals foundation next time for a powder spf coverage.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I couldn&#x27;t find the right shade of my usual brand.  </li>
            <li> But then I applied it in mirror with a window behind me and it was easy to see the powder coming</li>
            <li> The slight tint looks natural on my lighter-toned skin and doesn&#x27;t make my olive-skinned 10-year old daughter look like a ghost.  </li>
            <li> But the brush is little rough and it&#x27;s kind of hard to get enough powder on the brush..</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this since I&#x27;m tired of lotion type sunblock.</li>
            <li> I also felt like I wasted a lot of the product trying to get decent coverage.  </li>
            <li> However, given the benefits of the product, and how it doesn&#x27;t mess up my skin, I can live with this</li>
            <li> First it is hard to even tell if it is coming out of brush and applying evenly.</li>
            <li> Using the product can be hard to get the hang of at first.  </li>
            <li> Using the product can be hard to get the hang of at first.  </li>
            <li> I only use it on my face but it comes out clear and doesn&#x27;t mess up my makeup.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t last long if you use it all over your body though.  </li>
            <li> The brush is a bit scratchy and it is hard to get even coverage as there is no way to control how much of the powder is dispensed.  </li>
            <li> and if I don&#x27;t really blend this it can seem heavy and too dark.</li>
            <li> As long as this product is being made, it is my go-to powder.</li>
            <li> The bristles were not soft at all either.</li>
            <li> It seems to work as far as sunburn control goes, but I don&#x27;t like having trouble getting it into the brush.</li>
            <li> Also reapplied it on our long days at Disneyland.</li>
            <li> No wet mess.  </li>
            <li> I like it, especially the price when compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> does not leave my skin looking dry.</li>
            <li> my 1 year old daughter hasnt had a little pink after being out in the sun for hours!</li>
            <li> I hate using liquid sunscreen on top of my moisturizer, which contains only a low SPF because it&#x27;s all-natural.</li>
            <li> Received the next day for less than Drugstore.com.  </li>
            <li> my friend who has very dry skin, used it and it looked chalky on her.  </li>
            <li> Especially for my kids, to get their faces and parts in their hair with no oily mess, and no sunscreen in their eyes.</li>
            <li> though thankfully I&#x27;d used up what little product was left before I had to.</li>
            <li> Seems it would be so simple to improve that little problem.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s hard to see if the powder is definitely coming out, but I&#x27;ve found that if I shake it and then just start brushing across my skin, it is indeed being dispensed properly.</li>
            <li> Great powder - horrible packaging</li>
            <li> I was curious since this is a powder</li>
            <li> However, its effectiveness as a sunblock is rather minimal (I burned).</li>
            <li> I do like idea of having a powder rather than a sticky, messy fluid sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Really, it&#x27;s not a bargain product, why can&#x27;t they use a brush that doesn&#x27;t fall apart?</li>
            <li> and I will put it on my arms and neckline and face to minimize my exposure to the sun in everyday tasks such as going to the mailbox or walking across sunny parking lots to go into store.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have spent all day gardening with this and not reapplied (I know, I know) and still didn&#x27;t get a sunburn.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to get it started coming into the brush, and despite storing it brush down, I have to tap a lot every time I use it.</li>
            <li> (I looked like an albino rat with my red, irritated eyes and my pale face).</li>
            <li> I may just use this on my arms and less delicate skin and use the more expensive option on my face.</li>
            <li> The tubes are small enough to take anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed the issue some other reviewers have mentioned about the brush bristles coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I use other stuff on my face).</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to deal with getting all greasy when you only need sun protection for a small window of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Continued exposure can be an issue in the lungs as these minerals have sharp edges that can cause lots of micro cuts.</li>
            <li> you must tap the end hard to get powder to tip of brush, then hard to see just how much you have applied.</li>
            <li> My results may not be typical, but I found the product hard to use (how much do I apply?), irritating to my eyes (unavoidable gritty feeling after applying to my face) and unattractive</li>
            <li> I especially hate lotions residue on my fingers - which I always want clean for my smart phone and</li>
            <li> It was so hard to put the lid back on without bending all the bristles on the brush.</li>
            <li> The brush does not retract which makes it hard to get the bristles back in the lid.</li>
            <li> As other posters have said, the bristles come off when you use it, so you end up with big, thick black hairs all over your face.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the brush starts shedding the moment you use it.</li>
            <li> Probably not worth the price.</li>
            <li> TOO DARK- NOT TRANSLUCENT</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the dispenser.</li>
            <li> It makes me look a bit tan, so it can be utilized, as the color is not too dark.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t add any color to my face, but it does seem to keep shine down.</li>
            <li> just shake this while holding it upside down, and it dispenses.</li>
            <li> If your skin is already on the dry side, not sure you will like it though...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously used PTR&#x27;s brush-on sunscreen, which almost poofs out of the brush and has a slight smell;</li>
            <li> Zinc has a slight color too it</li>
            <li> Though there is a debate in the gluten-free community as to whether this matters, my wife cannot eat gluten and therefore prefers not to put gluten-containing products on her skin (and notices that her skin is less itchy and bumpy when she avoids gluten-containing products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only is it rough and feels scratchy when you apply it to your face, but it often leaves bristles behind on your face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only is it rough and feels scratchy when you apply it to your face, but it often leaves bristles behind on your face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus, if I want to carry it in my purse, it doesn&#x27;t make a mess</li>
            <li> The brush does leave little black bristles on your face, but no more than any other low-mid quality brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Essentially, I think these mineral marketed sunscreens are a little overhyped.</li>
            <li> little internet research shows that titanium dioxide, mica, and silica are not particles you want to inhale so</li>
            <li> The product is a little drying.  </li>
            <li> The product is a little drying.  </li>
            <li> It sheds bristles like crazy and is very scratchy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> have a few that may be</li>
            <li> The product is not meant for heavy coverage.  </li>
            <li> No more taking the kids out and worrying about them getting burnt.  </li>
            <li> but I am not sure about its effectiveness as a sunscreen till now.</li>
            <li> Also after opening and getting the brush in a useable position as shown in the picture you cannot get the cap back on the brush because it is to difficult without fraying the bristles.  </li>
            <li> I apply it very heavily to my kids&#x27; faces...</li>
            <li> And since I&#x27;m very pale, I figured it would work.</li>
            <li> Hard to tell if its one your face or not.</li>
            <li> It does have a tint, which I&#x27;m not thrilled about.</li>
            <li> If you want an base layer under make up, of have only want minimal protection this might work</li>
            <li> The picture does not give you a frame of reference do please go by the size listed in the description of the product so that you won&#x27;t have the same disappointment.</li>
            <li> Eventually with the frayed brush after a few uses it is difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> This is always a little frustrating because the product is relatively expensive.  </li>
            <li> Even with using the sunscreen that much, I am shocked by how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit of a challenge to get it into the brush and the bristles fall off like crazy but will probably buy it again because there are so few options for reapplication of sun screen over makeup.</li>
            <li> Also, the color of the powder is very orangy and looks terrible on my face.  </li>
            <li> I am tired of the lotion sunscreens staining everything I happen to touch.</li>
            <li> For example - the all natural Tickle Time brush became so gummy and nasty</li>
            <li> I was so sad about that.</li>
            <li> This brand works just as well and the brush doesn&#x27;t clog like the expensive alternative.</li>
            <li> With this, it was difficult to tell if I had applied anything.  </li>
            <li> I would like to try color science but probably won&#x27;t because it is too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t notice the size of this product until it arrived in the mail and for some reason I thought it would be 5x</li>
            <li> It appears the bottom is a screw on/off so if you&#x27;re throwing it in the bottom of your bad like I did, be careful. :(</li>
            <li> I bought this as a sunscreen for my face because I hate putting lotion on my face since it usually breaks me out.</li>
            <li> My grandsons 8 and 5 hate having sunscreen put on their faces - no more.  </li>
            <li> People will look at you like you&#x27;re crazy when you apply this product.  </li>
            <li> People will look at you like you&#x27;re crazy when you apply this product.  </li>
            <li> The powder does not flow tho the brush, very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> It sheds really bad.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s annoying but not a deal breaker.  </li>
            <li> ...the brush thing is REALLY annoying.</li>
            <li> Hate greasy sunblock.</li>
            <li> Minerals won&#x27;t come out and the brush is really bad - application is horrible and hairs come out.</li>
            <li> Yes, the brush is awful.  </li>
            <li> But like someone else said, the brush sheds something terrible.  </li>
            <li> It has become my one product I&#x27;d hate to go without!</li>

            <li> Excellent..used when go out for any length of time.</li>
            <li> I have bought this multiple times. Yes, the brush is awful.  It sheds bristles like crazy and is very scratchy.  That&#x27;s annoying but not a deal breaker.  I layer this over liquid sunscreen (face,chest,ears)  and it gives a nice, light airbrush-like finish. I don&#x27;t hang out in the sun much but believe this does keep me protected when going about my day in the ever-present California sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen reviews that say the powder doesn&#x27;t come out. I thought that the first time as well.  But then I applied it in mirror with a window behind me and it was easy to see the powder coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the brush, I like this for the price, finish and protection.  Great to have in my purse.</li>
            <li> Perfect for everyday use</li>
            <li> The powder does not flow tho the brush, very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it works and it can be applied on top of my makeup when I go out into the sun.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I couldn&#x27;t find the right shade of my usual brand.  It goes on easily and goes on thickly enough that you can actually see how much and how evenly it is applied to arms and legs - something not easily seen in more expensive and better known powder sunscreens.  Another plus is that the tube with the powder is transparent.  Hallelujah!  I can actually seen how much product is left and don&#x27;t have to guess.  My only complaint is that the brush starts shedding the moment you use it.</li>
            <li> This is great sunblock.  So easy to apply and my kids love it.  I love that it is slightly tinted so that you can see how much you are applying.  I easily burn if I am out in the sun after only 15 minutes; I tried this at a baseball game with full sun exposure for hours and stayed protected!  I apply it very heavily to my kids&#x27; faces...I brush it on and can actually see the powder in the air as I brush.  Probably not necessary but I want to make sure they are protected.  Even with using the sunscreen that much, I am shocked by how long it lasts.  The tubes are small enough to take anywhere.  No more taking the kids out and worrying about them getting burnt.  Love it.  Try this product, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to carry around in your purse.</li>
            <li> The brush does leave little black bristles on your face, but no more than any other low-mid quality brush. The powder covers nicely, but not too much. I live in Florida, so I would not use this as a primary source of sunscreen, but is great for touch ups! Plus, it&#x27;s a nice powder in general.</li>
            <li> My favorite powder! All of my life I&#x27;ve used more expensive brands, but I picked up this makeup from whole foods in an emergency and was pleasantly surprised. The one container lasted me an entire year! When I went back to whole foods to purchase another I was informed that they no longer carry this item. Thank you Amazon for always having what I need! I received my new makeup yesterday just in time for an event. As long as this product is being made, it is my go-to powder.</li>
            <li> Have reordered this multiple times and gifted it to our children. My redheaded husband easily applies this whenever he goes out to do yardwork or be i the sun at all. Does NOT run into his eyes when he gets sweaty like traditional sunscreens. Many of family and friends have become great fans of this and my young grandson uses it without complaint as well...Get several and keep in cars/bags/by the carkeys...Cannot see it on the face at all.</li>
            <li> OK, I can&#x27;t tell you how well it screens me from the sun, but I have been using on top of my make-up and with no make up on my face and neck.  I use it like a facial powder and it works so well absorbing oil and reducing shine.  And if it is helping protect my skin at the same time that is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep in my purse.  Used it on my hubbies face and head one day when we realized we were going to unexpectedly be out in the sun for a while.  Seemed to protect him well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and I love it. I only use it on my face but it comes out clear and doesn&#x27;t mess up my makeup. It&#x27;s super easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t expire for ages. I&#x27;d bought something for twice the price at sephora that expired in six months. I&#x27;ll be sticking to this brand in the future! Much cheaper and lasts twice as long.</li>
            <li> Wear this whenever I&#x27;ve planned an outdoor activity.  Goes on easily and gives great coverage.</li>
            <li> It was everything I hoped it would be, easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> After paying way too much for the Tickle Time product which claimed to have more grams of mineral sunblock than this, the Mineral Fusion lasted WAY longer with less product and was cheaper - though still kinda pricey for what you get. I digress, I just wanted something to enhance my incidental commute sun exposure; something to brush on in the morning before leaving the house. I would not trust these types of mineral blocks for full on all day exposure as I am very very fair and thus very very sun-sensitive. That is what zinc and titanium dioxide is for - but to each his/her own. I just wanted something quick and easy to coat my face, neck, and ears (a place most people forget to protect and one of the most common sites for skin cancer) after applying makeup or for running an errand and not wanting to smear on a ton of liquid spf in order to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush hairs seemed to tolerate the repeated use against the skin. For example - the all natural Tickle Time brush became so gummy and nasty I finally had to throw it out - though thankfully I&#x27;d used up what little product was left before I had to. This brush has yet to get gummy. It&#x27;s small enough to fit in my makeup bag in my purse and tolerates the abuse of a daily carry - no cracks or damage to the body of the item yet. I do wish it came in a better array of colors as I am so pale the light just isn&#x27;t quite light enough. But it&#x27;ll do for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, I think these mineral marketed sunscreens are a little overhyped. I mean, most makeup brands carry something similar with the same ingredients for way less for more product and provide the added benefit of more colors and coverage. Though, most dermatologists warn against the spf stability in most makeup sunscreens - there are many that carry a similar mineral line with micronized sunscreen included that shouldn&#x27;t be completely snubbed. Still, the tried and true topically application of zinc/titanium dioxide (physical blockers) seems to be the primary way to go and I appreciate that they use it. But I&#x27;ll likely shop around for a more affordable version of this.be the primary way to go and I appreciate that they use it.

            <li> This stuff is great. I am a red head and fair and it works as a reapplication or in a pinch if you&#x27;re going to be outside on a patio or walking around. Its not for swimming and working out and beach/pool days. its to have on hand, not mess up your make up or look like a greasy mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason its not 5 stars is there is a version that has a click mechanism on the bottom that pushes the powder out. This one doesn&#x27;t have it for some reason</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Love having this around with kids- so much easier than creams and sticks.</li>
            <li> amazing idea and so convenient. With 2 kids summer is my dreaded time of year bc of sunscreen application. My son, particularly hates the feel of lotion sunscreen on his face. This is so easy and quick to use. It takes 30 seconds to apply before leaving the house and keeping it in your purse or bag is so easy too bc there is no runny lotion to worry about leaking in your purse. It works so well as sun protection too. Amazing product that makes life easier. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I like the product itself, but the bottom came off and spilled powder all over my brand new Kate Spade purse. I was so sad about that. It appears the bottom is a screw on/off so if you&#x27;re throwing it in the bottom of your bad like I did, be careful. :(</li>
            <li> I got the package rather quickly from the seller. This sunscreen works well after you figure out how to get the actual powder to come out in a consistent manner (which it never will but you can try!). It worked great to protect the part on my head from my hair being in pony tails;)</li>
            <li> Awesome, not heavy or cakey this powder works great, love it for the summer. Just brush on and go!! Great colour and convienent and easy to take with you anywhere!!</li>
            <li> It was so hard to put the lid back on without bending all the bristles on the brush. The bristles were not soft at all either. Bummer.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a sunscreen for my face because I hate putting lotion on my face since it usually breaks me out. I was curious since this is a powder but it works wonderfully!! It&#x27;s perfect for using on the face, shoulders and chest area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying to avoid the sun, always use sunscreen and this gives me that extra coverage when I know I may be outside for an extended period. Great idea!</li>
            <li> We love powder sunscreen! Especially for my kids, to get their faces and parts in their hair with no oily mess, and no sunscreen in their eyes. This works just as well as pricier brands, and is small enough to fit in my purse. I&#x27;d buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this powder sunscreen. So nice to have when you forget sunscreen and already have makeup on.</li>
            <li> The tone is fine and I like the way it looks -- when I can get it to come out. It took a long time to get it started coming into the brush, and despite storing it brush down, I have to tap a lot every time I use it. It seems to work as far as sunburn control goes, but I don&#x27;t like having trouble getting it into the brush.</li>
            <li> I have like this product because it goes on without any color.  Also, it goes only very easily and protects your skin.</li>
            <li> Great price for a mineral sunscreen.  I&#x27;m white and can see the tannish hue of the powder.  I have previously used Colorscience which I love, but this was cheaper.</li>
            <li> The powder itself works very well, but the brush is so cheap.  It feels scratchy and the bristles keep falling out.</li>
            <li> Excellent, light, good color, not too heavy</li>
            <li> I brought this on vacation and brought it to the pool and beach. It was great to quickly apply to my face and reduced shine. Just make sure u reapply if your face gets wet obviously because it&#x27;s a powder</li>
            <li> Surprisingly it works. Very easy to use, keep one in my bag and one at the front door so I can brush some on real quick when I head out for a walk or bike up to the store.</li>
            <li> I know we women are supposedly superior at multi-tasking, but there&#x27;s so much to do in the mornings and I&#x27;m just at a point in my life where I don&#x27;t want to have to fuss too much over anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compact powders require a separate brush and are fine but getting the coverage even is a pain - and they don&#x27;t have sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loose powders - ick. Never have I been able to use them without making a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a few that may be *may* be better quality powders, but the difference is negligible and none of them have the convenience factor or the portability this item has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s hard to see if the powder is definitely coming out, but I&#x27;ve found that if I shake it and then just start brushing across my skin, it is indeed being dispensed properly. I haven&#x27;t noticed the issue some other reviewers have mentioned about the brush bristles coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My morning routine is so easy now! A bit of BB cream, some illuminator for those pesky under-eye circles, a quick swipe of all-day gel blush, my minimal eye makeup and this! Plus, if I want to carry it in my purse, it doesn&#x27;t make a mess and I don&#x27;t have to carry a second brush. I really couldn&#x27;t be any happier with it.</li>
            <li> The stuff is super convenient! If Im wearing makeup I can still dust this on top and not worry about smudging etc.</li>
            <li> Only used it twice. You get more bristles on your face than powder. Hard to tell if its one your face or not.</li>
            <li> Cheaper (by more than half) of another version I have bought in the past. This brand works just as well and the brush doesn&#x27;t clog like the expensive alternative. I&#x27;m stocking up!!!</li>
            <li> The powder is nice, feels good, covers well but the applicator could be much better. It is a bit of a challenge to get it into the brush and the bristles fall off like crazy but will probably buy it again because there are so few options for reapplication of sun screen over makeup.</li>
            <li> This is the best product of its kind and nicely priced on Amazon.  The powder goes on lightly and with little color but provides hours of sun protection.  Also easy to reapply while on the trail.</li>
            <li> I rated this 4 stars because I actually like the powder and the sun defense I get from it.  But like someone else said, the brush sheds something terrible.  Thought after the first couple uses the brush would stop shedding, but no such luck.  Whenever I put this on and am not by a mirror, I have to ask someone I am with to brush the brush hairs off my face.  As much as I do think the product itself is good, I might opt for the more expensive brand next time.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I use it when I walk my dog during the day and just want to get some coverage for my neck, chest, and arms (I use other stuff on my face). That being said, it definitely does not replace my liquid sunscreen for longer periods in the sun (e.g., going to the beach). This is largely due to the fact that it can be difficult to tell exactly where you&#x27;ve dusted, and also the thought of applying this on a sweaty body just doesn&#x27;t sound like a good idea. But for a short walk in the sun, it&#x27;s great. You don&#x27;t have to deal with getting all greasy when you only need sun protection for a small window of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only powder sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used, so I can&#x27;t provide any comparisons to more expensive brands, but I can say that I&#x27;ll definitely being buying it again.</li>
            <li> I love, love this powder! It is a great color and finish for my medium tone, oily skin. It feels soft and smooth, yet manages a slightly matte finish. The HUGE problem is that it is an enormous pain in the you-know-what to get the powder into the brush!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great for my daughter who doesn&#x27;t like sun lotion on her face!</li>
            <li> This the best!! Small for travel and not too much color but good for oil/shiny ESP in Summer!! Love!!!</li>
            <li> The brush was so defective with a lot of bristles coming out as I applied the sunscreen and I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was going on my face or not.</li>
            <li> Like the light feel of the powder and the fact it gives SPF protection at the same time. Easy to use</li>
            <li> Great product and super easy to use! Any lotion for my face with with sun screen in it always feels greasy, this is the best solution!</li>
            <li> Minerals won&#x27;t come out and the brush is really bad - application is horrible and hairs come out.</li>
            <li> Great mineral sunblock.  Convenient to use, even after makeup is applied!  Packaging is not as good as another brand previously purchased.  No instructions included to help the customer figure out how to use the package and specifics about the product.  Nice sheen to skin after it is applied. Seemed to work fairly well.</li>
            <li> I like the product ok, but the brush is horrid. It sheds really bad. Probably not worth the price. Will use Bare Minerals foundation next time for a powder spf coverage.</li>
            <li> Not all that impressed. You have to really work at getting the powder out, and must reapply every hour or so. I like the feel of the product on my skin -very silky and I would describe it as a high quality face powder. However, its effectiveness as a sunblock is rather minimal (I burned).</li>
            <li> I use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;Goes over makeup well&lt;br /&gt;The Brush is very soft and nice but powder doesn&#x27;t go into the applicator very fast or enough of it . I do like idea of having a powder rather than a sticky, messy fluid sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;O yes it does work as a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, and therefor my scalp burns where my hair parts. Yes it discolors my hair a bit, but this is the absolute best product I have been able to find that doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy. The true test was on my vacation to the Mediterranean, and it passed with flying colors!! It didn&#x27;t discolor my hair so much that I would want to risk skin cancer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well don&#x27;t buy. Powder barely comes out of brush</li>
            <li> I hate using liquid sunscreen on top of my moisturizer, which contains only a low SPF because it&#x27;s all-natural. This sunscreen leaves a translucent, soft finish on my face, and it works perfectly. I&#x27;ve previously used PTR&#x27;s brush-on sunscreen, which almost poofs out of the brush and has a slight smell; neither happens with this sunscreen. Some of the brush hairs shed within the first few uses, but it&#x27;s not a serious problem.</li>
            <li> love the powder, but the brush bristle fall out all over.  does not give you enough protection, have to wear 30+ cream under.</li>
            <li> As other posters have said, the bristles come off when you use it, so you end up with big, thick black hairs all over your face.  Also, the color of the powder is very orangy and looks terrible on my face.  I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> So much better than the sticky, greasy, sprays and lotions. So far my 11 year old son loves it and my 1 year old daughter hasnt had a little pink after being out in the sun for hours!</li>
            <li> I like it, especially the price when compared to other brands. It does have a tint, which I&#x27;m not thrilled about. I&#x27;m pretty fair (usually buy &amp;#34;porcelain&amp;#34; foundation) and if I don&#x27;t really blend this it can seem heavy and too dark. I&#x27;m really only planning on using this on top of my regular sunscreen and make-up, so it&#x27;s not a big deal. I do wish that it was translucent, but for the price and the ease of ordering from Amazon it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I like colorscience better.  You can always just order the refill and put it in any of the powder sunscreen containers.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s convenience to carry and it&#x27;s not greasy to reapply on makeup.  But the brush is little rough and it&#x27;s kind of hard to get enough powder on the brush..</li>
            <li> My grandsons 8 and 5 hate having sunscreen put on their faces - no more.  Just brush this on face, neck and ears. Takes 2 seconds!  They love it!! Just remember to reapply every time they get out of the water!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying powder sun screen, so I can&#x27;t vouch for if this is best-in-class or not. But it is great. I love it so much I am stocking up so I have it on the boat, at home, in the car, and a couple extras to give it to my mom and girlfriends. I can&#x27;t stand applying lotions. I especially hate lotions residue on my fingers - which I always want clean for my smart phone and everything else I touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This applies lightly but leaves a soft, comfortable feel and good look. My skin is happy it can breath. I have fair to medium skin tone and the powder is invisible on my skin. On those days I wear a make-up foundation, this is a nice &amp;#34;setter&amp;#34; for that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen ingredients are 20% zinc oxide, 17.3% titanium dioxide, The &amp;#34;additional stuff&amp;#34; is mica, silica, caprylic/capric trilyceride, Vitamin E, Glycine, white tea leaf extract, sea kelp, and pomegranate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little internet research shows that titanium dioxide, mica, and silica are not particles you want to inhale so don&#x27;t get it in your nose. Continued exposure can be an issue in the lungs as these minerals have sharp edges that can cause lots of micro cuts. But that is being hyper sensitive (which I am), and I still rate it 5 stars because as far as sunscreens go, I think it is the best thing I have found so far. Please comment back if you think there is something better.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. But the quantity does not seem plenty. And how do I clean the brush? Am I allowed to wash it?</li>
            <li> Great product, be aware it comes off onto your clothes!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use ,handy to carry.</li>
            <li> The mineral formula is fine but the applicator is a nightmare. The brush does not retract which makes it hard to get the bristles back in the lid. Plus the powder gets all over my purse. Great powder - horrible packaging</li>
            <li> Works fantastic! Leaves your face with a healthy glow!</li>
            <li> Awesome for kids on way to school!</li>
            <li> This product sounded like a good idea.  I don&#x27;t care for sunscreen lotion, but realized that the creams are superior to ensure you get adequate coverage.  With this, it was difficult to tell if I had applied anything.  I should not have been surprised when I got too much sun and the lack of coverage was noticeable.  It seemed to work OK on my forehead and nose, but that was it.  I also felt like I wasted a lot of the product trying to get decent coverage.  The cloud of dust apparently didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless,  this product is good in theory, but for sun protection, it is inefficient.  If you want an base layer under make up, of have only want minimal protection this might work ok.  I did not out to the beach or anything.  Just took a walk outside with my kids and got too much sun.  Normally, I would not have gotten any color with the daily moisturizer I use with SPF.</li>
            <li> This thing definitely lets out powder if you use it as directed, need to shake a bit first to get the powder into the brush, i hope it is giving me more sun protection.  I like that I can carry in my puras</li>
            <li> It is a good product but I am not sure about its effectiveness as a sunscreen till now. It does keep my face oil-free though.</li>
            <li> It took a lot of vigorous shaking it get it out of te container tho!</li>
            <li> Fun to use.  Handy on the golf course to protect my nose.</li>
            <li> Easy and convenient for reapplication during the day. I don&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
            <li> Cheap brush!  Keeps losing the brush hairs every time I use it!  Zinc has a slight color too it and you can notice it on my skin.</li>
            <li> you must tap the end hard to get powder to tip of brush, then hard to see just how much you have applied. doesn&#x27;t look like it would last long...disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have amazingly sensitive skin and the sun does not like me at all! This product actually works well for sun defense and applies really easy. I keep it in my purse and take it everywhere I go.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  it is like a nice translucent powder, that also gives sun protection. I use it on my face, neck and chest. I haven&#x27;t noticed it rubbing off on my clothes. it doesn&#x27;t add any color to my face, but it does seem to keep shine down. I also like that I can keep this in my purse and reapplication does not leave my skin looking dry. I will purchase this produce again.</li>
            <li> TOO DARK- NOT TRANSLUCENT AS STATED</li>
            <li> I love this as an alternative to greasy lotion! It doesn&#x27;t make my face look too powdery, and I have a somewhat tan complexion.</li>
            <li> I like that the sunscreen is tinted. So far, it has kept my daughter and me from burning. I apply regular sunscreen and then layer this on top. I use this sunscreen for re-application throughout the day. My only complaint is the dispenser. It is a very light application - even when fully opened. Though, that&#x27;s good in order to avoid dumping the powder all over your face; it makes the application process a little more timely and tedious if you&#x27;re concerned with making sure to receive ample coverage.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is quick and easy to apply, non greasy like regular sunblock, esp on my face.  If your skin is already on the dry side, not sure you will like it though...my friend who has very dry skin, used it and it looked chalky on her.  Maybe some lotion first would do the trick.  It won&#x27;t last long if you use it all over your body though.  I just use it on my face, hairline, and ears.</li>
            <li> This powdered sunscreen goes on easily and stays on! Especially for kids- so easy to apply! I&#x27;m a runner from Florida and this stuff stays put through sweat. The slight tint looks natural on my lighter-toned skin and doesn&#x27;t make my olive-skinned 10-year old daughter look like a ghost.  Love it and so does she!</li>
            <li> I love that this is convenient to carry around. Easy to apply on young kids. It took several shakes to actually get the powder out, that&#x27;s why I took off a star . And there is no button as the instructions say. I will say it does work as a powder touch up for makeup so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> Product is great, however the brush is very rough on my face. I may just use this on my arms and less delicate skin and use the more expensive option on my face. I like that it does not have an overpowering fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this since I&#x27;m tired of lotion type sunblock. First it is hard to even tell if it is coming out of brush and applying evenly. I used it for a 45 min period out in the sun and it didn&#x27;t work at all! I was completely sunburned! I would not recommend it to anyone, and def glad I tried it on myself before I tried it in my son.</li>
            <li> ...the brush thing is REALLY annoying. The product itself is just fine, I took it with me on vacation in the Caribbean and used it almost exclusively on my face instead of regular sunblock. I did get a bit of a tan (probably should have reapplied more often) but no burn at all, even after a day trip to the BVI with a lot of sun exposure on the boat. The color is generally transparent: I&#x27;m quite fair, and it did not show except as a slight matte finish, at the beginning or at the end of vacation when I was more tanned.&lt;br /&gt;I always had to start it on the back of my hand to get it flowing, and if I forgot to wash it off it would come off on my clothes later on (doesn&#x27;t stain though, it washes out fine). It did not cake or run, or transfer from my face, only problem was when I got it on my hands or neck.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a higher rating, is the darn brush. Really, it&#x27;s not a bargain product, why can&#x27;t they use a brush that doesn&#x27;t fall apart? Bristles everywhere, every time. I looked furry!  Seems it would be so simple to improve that little problem.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this! I use it as my top powder after I&#x27;ve put makeup on. I keep it in my handbag at all times; no sunburn for me this year, yeah!</li>
            <li> Works good but sometimes leaves a muddy mess on my forehead if I sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to get out of the container into the brush, but I do love the actual product.  Easy to carry and re-apply later in the day as needed.</li>
            <li> Great product! Hate greasy sunblock. This you can dust on over make up any time!</li>
            <li> Great product. A little hard to get the first application onto the brush but great after that. Need reapplying but great size for the handbag.</li>
            <li> love this product. I keep it around as &amp;#34;back up&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This SPF provides great coverage and acts as a great base for a powder foundation.  It also works well as a touch up throughout the day or acts as minimal coverage for a natural look if worn alone.  It has become my one product I&#x27;d hate to go without!</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen easy to carry and apply.</li>
            <li> I love this for when it&#x27;s hot outside. I just brush a little on, it blends right over my makeup! It doesn&#x27;t make me break out or make me oily like a lot of sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Works great. I keep it in my purse and use it on my daughter when dropping her off at school. Also reapplied it on our long days at Disneyland.</li>
            <li> seems to work and does not make me break out.</li>
            <li> This may be an effective sunscreen, I haven&#x27;t actually tested that part out, but I agree with other reviewers that this product makes your skin very pale. Also make sure to keep it out of your eyes. My results may not be typical, but I found the product hard to use (how much do I apply?), irritating to my eyes (unavoidable gritty feeling after applying to my face) and unattractive (I looked like an albino rat with my red, irritated eyes and my pale face). The product is also very drying, but that may be a pro for someone with oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, I am giving it 3 stars because I am looking forward to carrying it around in my purse as emergency sunscreen.  The fact that it won&#x27;t make my hands greasy and I can just dust it on without looking in a mirror is a plus. Because it irritates my eyes, I probably won&#x27;t end up using it on my face. More likely, a quick application to the chest.</li>
            <li> The color, though advertised as transparent, is kind of a bronze color on my fair skin. It makes me look a bit tan, so it can be utilized, as the color is not too dark. However, I was most amazed at the fact that the powder stayed on my face without streaking  after I biked and was sweating. It was still looking nice, so it is protecting well.</li>
            <li> My wife and I big Mineral Fusion fans, and this product is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why we love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) It&#x27;s the BEST product that we&#x27;ve been able to find for our skin.  We play a lot of tennis, which means we need to put on sunblock on our faces all the time, or else we&#x27;ll get scorched.  If we put on regular sunblock, or even oil free sunblock, it wreaks havoc on our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) Related to point #1 above, this product is gluten free.  Though there is a debate in the gluten-free community as to whether this matters, my wife cannot eat gluten and therefore prefers not to put gluten-containing products on her skin (and notices that her skin is less itchy and bumpy when she avoids gluten-containing products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) Because the product is a mineral powder that is applied with a brush, you don&#x27;t have to touch any sticky sunblock.  Enough said on this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4) Because this is a specialty item, it&#x27;s not something we can find at our destination when we&#x27;re traveling, so I&#x27;m always happy when a product can fit into our carry-on luggage.  I love that this is a sunblock but isn&#x27;t subject to TSA&#x27;s 3-ounce liquid rule.  Along these same lines, it&#x27;s also a really easy product to carry in your purse, bag, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some things you should know, though:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) The product is not meant for heavy coverage.  You&#x27;ll want to reapply very often.  Even when reapplying very often, you&#x27;ll still get some sun (though not a burn, in my experience, and I have somewhat fair skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) If you plan on using this product a fair amount, it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  When I&#x27;m playing a competitive tennis season, plus practices (~20 uses), the bottle is nearly gone, and I only use it on my face and shoulders.  This is always a little frustrating because the product is relatively expensive.  However, given the benefits of the product, and how it doesn&#x27;t mess up my skin, I can live with this (I just wish it lasted longer and/or were cheaper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) The brush is not the best quality.  Not only is it rough and feels scratchy when you apply it to your face, but it often leaves bristles behind on your face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4) The product is a little drying.  This is absolutely not a problem for us, and it&#x27;s one of the reasons we love it, but something to note if your skin is on the dry side to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(5) Using the product can be hard to get the hang of at first.  You have to turn the bottle over and shake it vigorously and even tap it on a surface if necessary, and then apply it.  If you don&#x27;t see beige powder emerging through the bristles, then nothing is coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(6) People will look at you like you&#x27;re crazy when you apply this product.  At tennis matches, my wife always feels like she has to make the disclaimer: &amp;#34;this isn&#x27;t powder! I&#x27;m not putting on makeup!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, if your skin is at all finicky or sensitive, or if you must avoid gluten products, or if you just want to try a great mineral sunblock, I highly recommend this product.onger and/or were cheaper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) The brush is not the best quality.  Not only is it rough and feels scratchy when you apply it to your face, but it often leaves bristles behind on your face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4) The product is a little drying.

            <li> I bought this as an alternative to lotion sunscreen.  I am tired of the lotion sunscreens staining everything I happen to touch. Worked oaky as a sunscreen,  I should have applied it more frequently.  The brush is a bit scratchy and it is hard to get even coverage as there is no way to control how much of the powder is dispensed.  Adding a mechanism to control the flow rate would be a big improvement.</li>
            <li> This SPF mineral powder works just as well as the most expensive brands out there, but without all the ridiculous fillers (which they claim are good for the skin but are not!). this is more pure and much more of a value.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;m very fair and as I get older the sun seems to make me red that much quicker.  I also want to minimize the risk of sun damage without lathering up or spraying on lotion.&lt;br /&gt;This is quick, a transparent powder and I will put it on my arms and neckline and face to minimize my exposure to the sun in everyday tasks such as going to the mailbox or walking across sunny parking lots to go into store.&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased three of these.  I keep one in my car, one in my purse and one in the bathroom.  It&#x27;s that easy to use to cut down on the everyday exposure to sun.</li>
            <li> I got sunburned using this product.  Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> This I would not recommend because it does not go on smoothly without leaving a blotched look.  Also after opening and getting the brush in a useable position as shown in the picture you cannot get the cap back on the brush because it is to difficult without fraying the bristles.  Eventually with the frayed brush after a few uses it is difficult to use.  The brush should be redesigned to twist in and out of the container to preserve the bristles  Way overpriced for this product</li>
            <li> Love this for me and my kids. No irritation and no sunburns.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect! Now I can have sunscreen wherever I am w/o the risk of a burst or leaky bottle in my bag, and no greasy afterlook either! Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product goes on easy and covers so well! A miracle for moms on the go with kids to cover :)</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I purchased it because I bought a makeup without sunscreen.  I do use sunscreen undermakeup.  The color is perfect.  Not too white and not orange which is good.  It doesn&#x27;t change the color if my makeup.  The brush is very cheap though.  I get pieces on my face.  I also spilt half of it by twisting where the powder is to get more out.  My fault.  I do like that I can see how much powder is left in the brush.  My last one by Petrr Thomas Roth didn&#x27;t show how much product was left so I never knew if it was empty or not.  The brush on Roth sunscreen was a lot better but I still won&#x27;t buy again because I never could see what was in there.  I would like to try color science but probably won&#x27;t because it is too expensive.  So bottom line.  I will probably purchase mineral fusion again.  Purchased at Amazon.  Received the next day for less than Drugstore.com.  Love Amazon.</li>
            <li> So handy anywhere!  No wet mess.  Just brush over area to protect &amp; you&#x27;re done.  Time to order more.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this because it has a bit of color, but not so much that it looks like bronzer or even face powder.  does the job and much lower price than other sunscreen powders.</li>
            <li> Work very well for my wife on a recent trip to Florida. Easy to apply, and non messy.</li>
            <li> This is great!! The only problem was that the Amazon posted instructions said to push a button to dispense the powder into the brush, and yet my product had no button. I called the company, and they said those were not their instructions because that product has never had a brush. So good enough.&lt;br /&gt;You just shake this while holding it upside down, and it dispenses. There&#x27;s a clear part at the bottom, so you can tell when it&#x27;s running out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I read reviews, because they said this looks pale when it&#x27;s on. And since I&#x27;m very pale, I figured it would work. I really didn&#x27;t want something that would make me look as if I were wearing makeup, and this doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on easily and has no smell at all. As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s working, because I burn at the drop of a hat.&lt;br /&gt;So I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Love this! Just a dusting is all you need. Nice compact styling</li>
            <li> I need sun protection - and this works well and is easy to pack.  I also keep one in my bathroom for daily use over my SPF30 moisturizer.  Like the matte finish and ease of application.</li>
            <li> I live in the sub-tropics. This stuff stands up to the humidity, and keeps the burn at bay. Probably wouldn&#x27;t work in full sun for hours on end; but for running around doing errands and such, it &#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t notice the size of this product until it arrived in the mail and for some reason I thought it would be 5x the size it was.  The picture does not give you a frame of reference do please go by the size listed in the description of the product so that you won&#x27;t have the same disappointment.</li>
            <li> Thanks for my item, love my product. This is the only thing I use in my face as I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. Didn&#x27;t even know it existed until recently. I have 2 kids and this beats trying to slather them with greasy lotion. I love that it is a physical sunblock as I have always been a little concerned about chemical sunblocks. And since it is a physical block, you don&#x27;t have to wait 30 minutes to go outside. I have had this for about 2 months now and I&#x27;m not quite half out yet and that it with daily use on 4 people (mainly just on faces, arms, and neck, though). The brush is quite stiff and doesn&#x27;t feel great - but no one else in my family seems to mind. I have spent all day gardening with this and not reapplied (I know, I know) and still didn&#x27;t get a sunburn. With the fairly small brush head, it seems like it is harder to get full coverage on big areas, arms, legs, back, etc., so I have still been using a cream sunblock, but this is absolutely fantastic for face, hands, neck. Very thrilled with this discovery.</li>
