            <li>The longevity of Pravana hair color is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Awesome vibrant color.</li>
            <li>its a great color just washes out quickly</li>
            <li>Quality dye, surprisingly fade resistant and was easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Love this color so much, it&#x27;s the perfect shade for Spring this year.  </li>
            <li>Bleached my hair and the color still washes off very easily.</li>
            <li>Wild orchid is a great color!  </li>
            <li>colour stays in better than everyone r kind</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this brand!</li>
            <li>color is also absolutely beautiful and my new favorite!  </li>
            <li>because when i shampoo my hair, they lie right on the top where i put the shampoo lol and</li>
            <li>This is very important to follow.</li>
            <li>all beautiful color more vibrant than pictured</li>
            <li>I want more of this stuff I used it</li>
            <li>so I knew I would need more then one tube of color.</li>
            <li>I love the way it looks.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>But love the boldness of the color.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for more of a purple you should buy the Violet color.</li>
            <li>Ok - the color swatch shows a somewhat violet-y orchid color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>- okay</li>
            <li>if you have kids, they love to play in it.</li>
            <li>I love this color.  </li>
            <li>Pravana love your products</li>
            <li>I love how the color turned out.</li>
            <li>most likely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found Scrubbing Bubbles works great for any splatter cleanup in the shower, but while you do the initial dye, it is best to cover everything because it stains FAST.</li>
            <li>The tips of my hair was dyed with Sparks and it&#x27;s started to fill and look muddy almost; can&#x27;t wait to order more</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>so many colors</li>
            <li>A nice rich color.  </li>
            <li>However, I believe for funky colors 2 months is a pretty good</li>
            <li>it was easy to apply and extremely easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>This is the most economical, has the correct color results, easy to use, and lasts longer than most.</li>
            <li>the ends just get second hand suds brought down from the top of my head to avoid drying them out, and thereforehave retained their color almost perfectly for the 3 months the color has been in my hair lol.</li>
            <li>It came out a beautiful deep reddish-pink.</li>
            <li>quick ship!  </li>
            <li>Even when it fades its still bold!</li>
            <li>I love this color, but find that it only stays bright for a couple of shampoos.</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments on my hair when it was purple and people were constantly coming up to me and asking me how I got my hair so bright.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a fantastic color.</li>
            <li>Ultimately the wild orchid came out as a magenta color, I was hoping for more purple but the pinkish magenta looks great!</li>
            <li>It was still very pigmented and it faded nicely, so the shades were not off-putting when it did fade.</li>
            <li>I use sulfate free shampoo</li>
            <li>At first!!</li>
            <li>mixed with pravana violet for a warm purple!</li>
            <li>Clorox Clean</li>
            <li>She has light brown hair and the color looked really good in it after dying it, then faded daily.  </li>
            <li>I mixed one part wild orchid to about three parts violet for the perfect purple I was looking for!</li>
            <li>However, this one &amp;#34;washes&amp;#34; over 3-4 weeks into a very pretty light purplish-magenta</li>
            <li>I was so amazed and impressed with how bright and colorful the wild orchids took even though my hair was not bleached down too much.</li>
            <li>I am now a convert to Pravana (have used special effects for 8 years)</li>
            <li>The quality of the dye is great, but the color was did not turn out like I expected over my bleached hair.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Cool color - but washes out at every shampoo...</li>
            <li>I mix Wild Orchid with Violet to make a nice purple tone that works well over pre-lightened hair.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t wash or fade quickly and despite it not being purple</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really show under fluourescent lighting, which actually worked out great</li>
            <li>It also washes out too quickly &amp; I didn&#x27;t like that at all.</li>
            <li>the prevana stays vibrant for much longer and leaves your hair nice and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normally I use punky flamingo pink and its very bright</li>
            <li>posted a picture, wild orchid is the top color, bottom is special effects.</li>
            <li>The color is really pretty!  </li>
            <li>Pretty!</li>
            <li>it turned out BRIGHT pink.</li>
            <li>if I want it to stay bright like the photo, but it still looks pretty long after that.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve been thinking of going with a fun funky color</li>
            <li>Strangely enough, the color seems to get more vibrant the more I wash it.</li>
            <li>My bangs faded out pretty quickly, but thats</li>
            <li>but when I put it in my hair, my hair turned BRIGHT PINK!</li>
            <li>Just as good as expected!</li>
            <li>but had to do two passes to get the right color.</li>
            <li>Get it right now.</li>
            <li>Deep dark and beautiful!</li>
            <li>the first photo, I have Violet on top and Wild Orchid on the bottom.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Meanwhile, I&#x27;ve bought Pravana Violet to dilute down and use over the top of this, hoping for more of what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Certainly can&#x27;t miss me!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much truer more professional color than the manic panic types too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did not stick to my naturally light brown/blonde roots and was not as vivid as I hoped like the violet.</li>
            <li>this stuff is the bomb diggity~ doesn&#x27;t wash out easily and leaves hair super soft and vibrant.</li>
            <li>Faded very fast, went more red then purple</li>
            <li>remember it&#x27;s best to wash your hair in cool cold water with shampoos and conditioners that don&#x27;t strip color.</li>
            <li>and I love that i won&#x27;t have to constantly be retouching.</li>
            <li>I really like this color!</li>
            <li>its much cheaper for them!</li>
            <li>it was more red than anything.</li>
            <li>I take a hot shower with a cap.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would last most of the summer.  </li>
            <li>We also did not bleach her hair first which is probably why it didn&#x27;t stay in so well.  </li>
            <li>Again, that may be mostly because I didn&#x27;t lighten my hair enough to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This color has a beautiful pink undertone when mixed with conditioner to create a pastel look.</li>
            <li>I usually touch my color up every two weeks or so to keep the color bright, but even when it is faded it&#x27;s still a pretty color.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida where it gets very hot and humid.</li>
            <li>It is more of a rich, vivid pink with a hint of purple</li>
            <li>Pravana&#x27;s Vivds are long lasting, elegant looking colors, and so easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Too high maintenance to keep up with color &amp; looks more red of a color.</li>
            <li>The color is very easy to work with and lasts longer than other brands I&#x27;ve used (Manic Panic, Ion Brights from Sally&#x27;s etc...).  </li>
            <li>Of course it isn&#x27;t going to turn out exact since my hair color underneath is a brassy orange color from bleaching my black hair, but the color it made still turned out very vivid and cool looking, love it.</li>
            <li>Its really bright and actually stayed longer than I expected, about three weeks before my hair demanded a touch up.</li>
            <li>It fades gradually but the gray stays properly purple, leaving fabulous highlights.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for more of a purple, and this came out quite pink.</li>
            <li>To get the maximum results of this color, you really have to have your hair bleached.</li>
            <li>In retrospect, I could have diluted this with conditioner and gotten a much tamer color (SHOULDA!).&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>High quality dye though!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re searching for a color that doesn&#x27;t fade fast and stays vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color lasts very well when you care for your hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But washes out fast.</li>
            <li>I used the whole tube.  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>i have dyed my hair before using manic panic but i dont think i&#x27;ll ever go back, the color on this is very strong and holds well and wild orchid is seriously such a pretty color !</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very easy to apply but messy on the rinse.</li>
            <li>i love how my hair looks, but be warned that this color is definitely more of a sharp purple/pink than than a dark purple</li>
            <li>Faded to fast, even with sulfate free natural conditioner, and only washing 1-2x a week.</li>
            <li>this is amazingly vibrant</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason I only gave it four stars is because it does wash out quickly.</li>
            <li>The only problem we had was it washed out extremely quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Manic Panic and Sparks on my bleached hair, Sparks was decent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just be ordering violet to fix it, since it riuned the possibility of a decent looking orchid to violet ombre.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend any dye color  by this brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worked with other purple/pink dyes before and so far this has been the most unsuccessful.</li>
            <li>The pink one was a bit too light for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Used this to help brighten the Violet Chroma Silk and make a different fun shade of purple.</li>
            <li>It has only been 2 weeks and the color is pretty much gone.  </li>
            <li>I used this and pravana red to create an ombr&amp;eacute; effect and in a small part of my bangs i mixed the red and w.o. for my bangs), and it looks awesome!</li>
            <li>I am new to the pastel hair thing</li>
            <li>I did not prelighten my hair, I applied a mixture of wild orchid and violet to clean, dry hair, wrapped it in plastic, then applied heat for 15 minutes and leaving the color on for an hour.</li>
            <li>Unlike Manic Panic, this color is truly vivid and lasts a lot longer.</li>
            <li>I would definitely suggest bleaching first if you want the color to stay.</li>
            <li>bleached first, but didn&#x27;t have enough bleach for all of my hair.</li>
            <li>For the first few weeks it&#x27;s a dark violet (almost burgundy) tone, but it gradually fades to a nice Barney purple.</li>
            <li>Definitely need to lighten first for the color to be truly</li>
            <li>The colors are so vivid</li>
            <li>I cut open large trash bags and drape them over EVERYTHING in my bathroom</li>
            <li>I bleached my hair before using Manic Panic and was completely dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>This looks like a soft purple color online</li>
            <li>- I like wild colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used lots of hair dyes, including having my hair professionally done.</li>
            <li>I have never found one (even in a professional salon) that is permanent.</li>
            <li>I bought Wild Orchid in hopes of getting a purpleish color,</li>
            <li>I purchased Wild Orchid as well as Violet.</li>
            <li>hair doesn&#x27;t take dye very well, so I have to redye constantly.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s already almost completely washed out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was able to keep this color fairly vibrant for approximately 2 months before it needed to be redone.</li>
            <li>The color lasts for a very long time, months later and it still has not completely washed out, not even after a light bleaching.</li>
            <li>The color was a little more pink than I wanted it.  </li>
            <li>much better than the Magenta color which only lasted a week, this stuff is hardly fading.</li>
            <li>If you are going for purple there is no other choice than Pravana.</li>
            <li>I bleached my hair to the level that the package said would allow the dye to be vivid and it only barely stuck to my hair.</li>
            <li>use old towels and keep my gloves on for the entire process.</li>
            <li>My hair is jet black, so when I had it done the first time with my hair stylist, she bleached me blonde.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is pretty although slightly lighter than the picture.</li>
            <li>is you want vibrant, long lasting dye!</li>
            <li>Washing hair in cold water may not sound appealing at all because it isn&#x27;t appealing, but you will spend less on color and have a vibrant shade for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The violet is darker than the wild orchid, and it only takes a little bit of violet to make the color much darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Also smells good</li>
            <li> I actually really loved the product; I just didn&#x27;t like the price</li>
            <li> One month in and the color still looked surprisingly good.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous</li>
            <li> Deposits beautifully on hair extensions,but I  should&#x27;ve bought more.  </li>

            <li> The longevity of Pravana hair color is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Awesome vibrant color.</li>
            <li> its a great color just washes out quickly</li>
            <li> Quality dye, surprisingly fade resistant and was easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Love this color so much, it&#x27;s the perfect shade for Spring this year.  </li>
            <li> Bleached my hair and the color still washes off very easily.</li>
            <li> Wild orchid is a great color!  </li>
            <li> colour stays in better than everyone r kind</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this brand!</li>
            <li> color is also absolutely beautiful and my new favorite!  </li>
            <li> because when i shampoo my hair, they lie right on the top where i put the shampoo lol and</li>
            <li> This is very important to follow.</li>
            <li> all beautiful color more vibrant than pictured</li>
            <li> I want more of this stuff I used it</li>
            <li> so I knew I would need more then one tube of color.</li>
            <li> I love the way it looks.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> But love the boldness of the color.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for more of a purple you should buy the Violet color.</li>
            <li> Ok - the color swatch shows a somewhat violet-y orchid color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> - okay</li>
            <li> if you have kids, they love to play in it.</li>
            <li> I love this color.  </li>
            <li> Pravana love your products</li>
            <li> I love how the color turned out.</li>
            <li> most likely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found Scrubbing Bubbles works great for any splatter cleanup in the shower, but while you do the initial dye, it is best to cover everything because it stains FAST.</li>
            <li> The tips of my hair was dyed with Sparks and it&#x27;s started to fill and look muddy almost; can&#x27;t wait to order more</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> so many colors</li>
            <li> A nice rich color.  </li>
            <li> However, I believe for funky colors 2 months is a pretty good</li>
            <li> it was easy to apply and extremely easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> This is the most economical, has the correct color results, easy to use, and lasts longer than most.</li>
            <li> the ends just get second hand suds brought down from the top of my head to avoid drying them out, and thereforehave retained their color almost perfectly for the 3 months the color has been in my hair lol.</li>
            <li> It came out a beautiful deep reddish-pink.</li>
            <li> quick ship!  </li>
            <li> Even when it fades its still bold!</li>
            <li> I love this color, but find that it only stays bright for a couple of shampoos.</li>
            <li> I got so many compliments on my hair when it was purple and people were constantly coming up to me and asking me how I got my hair so bright.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a fantastic color.</li>
            <li> Ultimately the wild orchid came out as a magenta color, I was hoping for more purple but the pinkish magenta looks great!</li>
            <li> It was still very pigmented and it faded nicely, so the shades were not off-putting when it did fade.</li>
            <li> I use sulfate free shampoo</li>
            <li> At first!!</li>
            <li> mixed with pravana violet for a warm purple!</li>
            <li> Clorox Clean</li>
            <li> She has light brown hair and the color looked really good in it after dying it, then faded daily.  </li>
            <li> I mixed one part wild orchid to about three parts violet for the perfect purple I was looking for!</li>
            <li> However, this one &amp;#34;washes&amp;#34; over 3-4 weeks into a very pretty light purplish-magenta</li>
            <li> I was so amazed and impressed with how bright and colorful the wild orchids took even though my hair was not bleached down too much.</li>
            <li> I am now a convert to Pravana (have used special effects for 8 years)</li>
            <li> The quality of the dye is great, but the color was did not turn out like I expected over my bleached hair.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Cool color - but washes out at every shampoo...</li>
            <li> I mix Wild Orchid with Violet to make a nice purple tone that works well over pre-lightened hair.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t wash or fade quickly and despite it not being purple</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really show under fluourescent lighting, which actually worked out great</li>
            <li> It also washes out too quickly &amp; I didn&#x27;t like that at all.</li>
            <li> the prevana stays vibrant for much longer and leaves your hair nice and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normally I use punky flamingo pink and its very bright</li>
            <li> posted a picture, wild orchid is the top color, bottom is special effects.</li>
            <li> The color is really pretty!  </li>
            <li> Pretty!</li>
            <li> it turned out BRIGHT pink.</li>
            <li> if I want it to stay bright like the photo, but it still looks pretty long after that.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve been thinking of going with a fun funky color</li>
            <li> Strangely enough, the color seems to get more vibrant the more I wash it.</li>
            <li> My bangs faded out pretty quickly, but thats</li>
            <li> but when I put it in my hair, my hair turned BRIGHT PINK!</li>
            <li> Just as good as expected!</li>
            <li> but had to do two passes to get the right color.</li>
            <li> Get it right now.</li>
            <li> Deep dark and beautiful!</li>
            <li> the first photo, I have Violet on top and Wild Orchid on the bottom.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Meanwhile, I&#x27;ve bought Pravana Violet to dilute down and use over the top of this, hoping for more of what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Certainly can&#x27;t miss me!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much truer more professional color than the manic panic types too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did not stick to my naturally light brown/blonde roots and was not as vivid as I hoped like the violet.</li>
            <li> this stuff is the bomb diggity~ doesn&#x27;t wash out easily and leaves hair super soft and vibrant.</li>
            <li> Faded very fast, went more red then purple</li>
            <li> remember it&#x27;s best to wash your hair in cool cold water with shampoos and conditioners that don&#x27;t strip color.</li>
            <li> and I love that i won&#x27;t have to constantly be retouching.</li>
            <li> I really like this color!</li>
            <li> its much cheaper for them!</li>
            <li> it was more red than anything.</li>
            <li> I take a hot shower with a cap.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would last most of the summer.  </li>
            <li> We also did not bleach her hair first which is probably why it didn&#x27;t stay in so well.  </li>
            <li> Again, that may be mostly because I didn&#x27;t lighten my hair enough to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This color has a beautiful pink undertone when mixed with conditioner to create a pastel look.</li>
            <li> I usually touch my color up every two weeks or so to keep the color bright, but even when it is faded it&#x27;s still a pretty color.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida where it gets very hot and humid.</li>
            <li> It is more of a rich, vivid pink with a hint of purple</li>
            <li> Pravana&#x27;s Vivds are long lasting, elegant looking colors, and so easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Too high maintenance to keep up with color &amp; looks more red of a color.</li>
            <li> The color is very easy to work with and lasts longer than other brands I&#x27;ve used (Manic Panic, Ion Brights from Sally&#x27;s etc...).  </li>
            <li> Of course it isn&#x27;t going to turn out exact since my hair color underneath is a brassy orange color from bleaching my black hair, but the color it made still turned out very vivid and cool looking, love it.</li>
            <li> Its really bright and actually stayed longer than I expected, about three weeks before my hair demanded a touch up.</li>
            <li> It fades gradually but the gray stays properly purple, leaving fabulous highlights.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for more of a purple, and this came out quite pink.</li>
            <li> To get the maximum results of this color, you really have to have your hair bleached.</li>
            <li> In retrospect, I could have diluted this with conditioner and gotten a much tamer color (SHOULDA!).&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> High quality dye though!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re searching for a color that doesn&#x27;t fade fast and stays vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color lasts very well when you care for your hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But washes out fast.</li>
            <li> I used the whole tube.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> i have dyed my hair before using manic panic but i dont think i&#x27;ll ever go back, the color on this is very strong and holds well and wild orchid is seriously such a pretty color !</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very easy to apply but messy on the rinse.</li>
            <li> i love how my hair looks, but be warned that this color is definitely more of a sharp purple/pink than than a dark purple</li>
            <li> Faded to fast, even with sulfate free natural conditioner, and only washing 1-2x a week.</li>
            <li> this is amazingly vibrant</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I only gave it four stars is because it does wash out quickly.</li>
            <li> The only problem we had was it washed out extremely quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Manic Panic and Sparks on my bleached hair, Sparks was decent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just be ordering violet to fix it, since it riuned the possibility of a decent looking orchid to violet ombre.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend any dye color  by this brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked with other purple/pink dyes before and so far this has been the most unsuccessful.</li>
            <li> The pink one was a bit too light for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Used this to help brighten the Violet Chroma Silk and make a different fun shade of purple.</li>
            <li> It has only been 2 weeks and the color is pretty much gone.  </li>
            <li> I used this and pravana red to create an ombr&amp;eacute; effect and in a small part of my bangs i mixed the red and w.o. for my bangs), and it looks awesome!</li>
            <li> I am new to the pastel hair thing</li>
            <li> I did not prelighten my hair, I applied a mixture of wild orchid and violet to clean, dry hair, wrapped it in plastic, then applied heat for 15 minutes and leaving the color on for an hour.</li>
            <li> Unlike Manic Panic, this color is truly vivid and lasts a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I would definitely suggest bleaching first if you want the color to stay.</li>
            <li> bleached first, but didn&#x27;t have enough bleach for all of my hair.</li>
            <li> For the first few weeks it&#x27;s a dark violet (almost burgundy) tone, but it gradually fades to a nice Barney purple.</li>
            <li> Definitely need to lighten first for the color to be truly</li>
            <li> The colors are so vivid</li>
            <li> I cut open large trash bags and drape them over EVERYTHING in my bathroom</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair before using Manic Panic and was completely dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> This looks like a soft purple color online</li>
            <li> - I like wild colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of hair dyes, including having my hair professionally done.</li>
            <li> I have never found one (even in a professional salon) that is permanent.</li>
            <li> I bought Wild Orchid in hopes of getting a purpleish color,</li>
            <li> I purchased Wild Orchid as well as Violet.</li>
            <li> hair doesn&#x27;t take dye very well, so I have to redye constantly.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s already almost completely washed out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was able to keep this color fairly vibrant for approximately 2 months before it needed to be redone.</li>
            <li> The color lasts for a very long time, months later and it still has not completely washed out, not even after a light bleaching.</li>
            <li> The color was a little more pink than I wanted it.  </li>
            <li> much better than the Magenta color which only lasted a week, this stuff is hardly fading.</li>
            <li> If you are going for purple there is no other choice than Pravana.</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair to the level that the package said would allow the dye to be vivid and it only barely stuck to my hair.</li>
            <li> use old towels and keep my gloves on for the entire process.</li>
            <li> My hair is jet black, so when I had it done the first time with my hair stylist, she bleached me blonde.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color is pretty although slightly lighter than the picture.</li>
            <li> is you want vibrant, long lasting dye!</li>
            <li> Washing hair in cold water may not sound appealing at all because it isn&#x27;t appealing, but you will spend less on color and have a vibrant shade for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The violet is darker than the wild orchid, and it only takes a little bit of violet to make the color much darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mixed the entire wild orchid tube with half of the violet plus a ton of white conditioner.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to dye your hair a dark natural color since its a stain dye and stains your cuticle.</li>
            <li> It lasts a really long time, but does bleed onto clothes/bedding when you hair is wet for the first few washes.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally a medium brown and was dyed darkest brown (looks black).</li>
            <li> My hair is a highlighted blonde color, so this color (and the pink Vivids color) turn my hair a magenta-ish purple color slightly darker than the photo of the color (that photo would likely result with completely dyed platinum hair).</li>
            <li> It was very dark and hardly notieable at first, probably because I didn&#x27;t lighten my hair all the way to the recommended level, but when it finally did start fading, (it took several weeks!)</li>
            <li> I first lightened my hair to a dark blonde/light brown color, then applied with a little bit of conditioner mixed in to tone it down.</li>
            <li> : this stuff goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> The second photo is with the pink.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been going back and forth with pink and lilac.</li>
            <li> It lasted longer than any other color I&#x27;ve used...will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This lasts about the same amount of time as other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> Not sure if silk creme or the other wild orchid pravana on here are different.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my hair type (thick), maybe because my hair doesn&#x27;t ever hold vivid colors long, but I have to refresh my hair color with Pravana every two weeks.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dark brown naturally and was bleached to a dark blond color.</li>
            <li> The N Rage &amp; ion semi-permanent products last longer for less money.</li>
            <li> I use Pravana Orange and it lasts for at least a month and a half of intense color.</li>
            <li> i dont sweat pink either when i work our.</li>
            <li> Colors like pink and purple don&#x27;t stay permanently in dyed blond hair....</li>
            <li> Not too pink or too purple.</li>
            <li> careful as this WILL stain everything..</li>
            <li> With this weather, my hair gets sweaty and oily so I have to wash it every other day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> maintained the color for a while by mixing small amounts of the dye with white conditioner and using that while in the shower, letting the conditioner sit while I did my shaving and other washing.</li>
            <li> Looks purple online but comes out very pink, almost fuchsia in color.</li>
            <li> I was going for a dark brown violet.</li>
            <li> If you have dark hair you will need to pre-lighten your hair</li>
            <li> cannot stress enough following the cold water wash and proper shampoos.</li>
            <li> Used this over highlighted dark hair.  </li>
            <li> The color even penetrates my dark brown</li>
            <li> After that it fades to a pale pink for a week or so, then virtualy disappears.</li>
            <li> It stains but nothing a little</li>
            <li> it turned my hair dark magenta/plum, i&#x27;m in loveee !</li>
            <li> I have very dark hair and have been using Vivids Violet for over a year now.  </li>
            <li> I bleached a few strips of hair to that gross ugly orange color and then used the wild orchids color on the Orange hair strips....</li>
            <li> I washed with only ice cold water, every 3 or 4 days powdering daily.</li>
            <li> I did touch ups of just the roots a few times in between.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This hair color lasted me about 2 1/2 almost 3 weeks before fading heavily...  </li>
            <li> I rinsed, shampooed, styled as usual.</li>
            <li> i usually use manic panic or ion brights</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if it is the color or the brand that didn&#x27;t hold.</li>
            <li> You will be disappointed with any pigment if you aren&#x27;t following proper hair care guidelines for colored hair.</li>
            <li> I went an entire month without any touch ups or colored conditioner, which was weird for me because I&#x27;m accustomed to weekly touch ups with Manic Panic.</li>
            <li> My hair had been foiled with bleach previously otherwise the rest of my hair is a darker dirty blonde.</li>
            <li> i used less than half the bottle and mixed it with a crap ton of conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I seriously use like a pea size amount too</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, she has to.  </li>
            <li> Pravana dye and say goodbye to mediocre color.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to retouch for 4-6 weeks when I wash my hair with fairly cold water.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i love how my hair looks, but be warned that this color is definitely more of a sharp purple/pink than than a dark purple</li>
            <li> Awesome hair color with a great look that lasts without much fading.</li>
            <li> this is amazingly vibrant I want more of this stuff I used it all beautiful color more vibrant than pictured</li>
            <li> I have thick hair so I knew I would need more then one tube of color. The color lasts for a very long time, months later and it still has not completely washed out, not even after a light bleaching.</li>
            <li> I bought this color and then I bought another pravana color the violet and used this color as highlights. I was bleached blonde and it did not take at all i will never purchase this color again ever!!</li>
            <li> Great product and shipper</li>
            <li> Used this to help brighten the Violet Chroma Silk and make a different fun shade of purple.</li>
            <li> Awesome vibrant color. Strangely enough, the color seems to get more vibrant the more I wash it. I don&#x27;t see this going anywhere for a while and I love that i won&#x27;t have to constantly be retouching.</li>
            <li> I love this dye! Unlike Manic Panic, this color is truly vivid and lasts a lot longer. I bleached my hair before using Manic Panic and was completely dissatisfied. After using Pravana Vivids, my hair popped! I usually touch my color up every two weeks or so to keep the color bright, but even when it is faded it&#x27;s still a pretty color.</li>
            <li> Great color but had to do two passes to get the right color.</li>
            <li> Of course it isn&#x27;t going to turn out exact since my hair color underneath is a brassy orange color from bleaching my black hair, but the color it made still turned out very vivid and cool looking, love it. Also smells good</li>
            <li> Love love love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this color! My hair had been foiled with bleach previously otherwise the rest of my hair is a darker dirty blonde. I love the way it looks. This is day 3 and I do see some fading but I haven&#x27;t been using the recommended color last shampoos.</li>
            <li> I love this hair color! Its really bright and actually stayed longer than I expected, about three weeks before my hair demanded a touch up.</li>
            <li> Deposits beautifully on hair extensions,but I  should&#x27;ve bought more.  Three boxes wasn&#x27;t  nearly enough to color three 4 ounce bundles of virgin extensions.</li>
            <li> Vivids gives excellent deposit on virgin hair! My hair is medium brown with about 30% gray concentrated to the front and sides. I did not prelighten my hair, I applied a mixture of wild orchid and violet to clean, dry hair, wrapped it in plastic, then applied heat for 15 minutes and leaving the color on for an hour. I rinsed, shampooed, styled as usual. The results were an eye-popping purple! I love it so much. It fades gradually but the gray stays properly purple, leaving fabulous highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to apply but messy on the rinse. I use the bathroom sink. It stains but nothing a little Clorox Clean Up can&#x27;t take care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I re-color every two weeks if I want it to stay bright like the photo, but it still looks pretty long after that. I shampoo every day.</li>
            <li> beautiful color that lasts forever</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! much better than the Magenta color which only lasted a week, this stuff is hardly fading. Deep dark and beautiful! Love it</li>
            <li> Awesome dye.  Pravana is always the best choice.</li>
            <li> Faded to fast, even with sulfate free natural conditioner, and only washing 1-2x a week. (I don&#x27;t use shampoo)</li>
            <li> awesome! love the color and the results!</li>
            <li> i used less than half the bottle and mixed it with a crap ton of conditioner. it was easy to apply and extremely easy to wash out. i dont sweat pink either when i work our. plus it smells great</li>
            <li> Great hair dye... much better than Manic Panic. It lasts a really long time, but does bleed onto clothes/bedding when you hair is wet for the first few washes. The quality of the dye is great, but the color was did not turn out like I expected over my bleached hair. I was looking for more of a purple, and this came out quite pink. Still beautiful, but not what I was going for. I left it like that for a while then mixed it with Violet and went over my hair again and it came out amazing. Definitely buy this is you want vibrant, long lasting dye!</li>
            <li> Very beautiful color..mixed with pravana violet for a warm purple! Love this product</li>
            <li> i have dyed my hair before using manic panic but i dont think i&#x27;ll ever go back, the color on this is very strong and holds well and wild orchid is seriously such a pretty color ! it turned my hair dark magenta/plum, i&#x27;m in loveee !</li>
            <li> Great color and product! It leaves my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> this stuff is the bomb diggity~ doesn&#x27;t wash out easily and leaves hair super soft and vibrant. will so recommend to anyone ever</li>
            <li> quick ship!  nice color!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Pravana by my stylist. She colored my hair once with Pravana and I asked her the product she used (so I can do it myself). To get the maximum results of this color, you really have to have your hair bleached. My hair is jet black, so when I had it done the first time with my hair stylist, she bleached me blonde.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I only gave it four stars is because it does wash out quickly. Maybe it&#x27;s my hair type (thick), maybe because my hair doesn&#x27;t ever hold vivid colors long, but I have to refresh my hair color with Pravana every two weeks. If you want the color to last, you can go without washing your hair but that is not feasible for me. I live in Florida where it gets very hot and humid. With this weather, my hair gets sweaty and oily so I have to wash it every other day.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like Pravana. I like that you don&#x27;t have to mix it with developer. Just put it in your hair and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> i bleached my hair before dying my hair with the pravana. it turned out BRIGHT pink. i usually use manic panic or ion brights but i wont be bothering with those anymore. the prevana stays vibrant for much longer and leaves your hair nice and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROTIP!&lt;br /&gt;i recommend befriending your stylist and asking them to order it for you. its much cheaper for them!</li>
            <li> Had to bleach my hair a bit to lighten it, and as I result it was orange in places; I should have used two tubes instead of one. But love the boldness of the color. Certainly can&#x27;t miss me!</li>
            <li> Pravana is amazing. There dye is always very bright and sticks wonderfully. Highly recommend any dye color  by this brand.</li>
            <li> Pravana&#x27;s Vivds are long lasting, elegant looking colors, and so easy to work with. I was hesitant to do my color myself, but this took the fright out of it.</li>
            <li> This looks like a soft purple color online but when I put it in my hair, my hair turned BRIGHT PINK!</li>
            <li> I lightened my hair beforehand and instead of wild orchid, it turned my hair different shades of PINK. If you&#x27;re looking for more of a purple you should buy the Violet color.</li>
            <li> Best hair color ever!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color but did not hold in my hair at all. My hair is very dark brown naturally and was bleached to a dark blond color. Normally I use punky flamingo pink and its very bright so I&#x27;m not sure if it is the color or the brand that didn&#x27;t hold.</li>
            <li> Love the bright color. To obtain the brightest color, I leave on my hair in foils for an hour. Just wished the color lasted longer, but it is a semi-permanent.</li>
            <li> Ok - the color swatch shows a somewhat violet-y orchid color.&lt;br /&gt;No.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fuchsia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now - okay - I like wild colors. But this was not what I was expecting. No fault of Pravana&#x27;s, though, and it is a beautiful color, so kudos to them for that....&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, I&#x27;ve bought Pravana Violet to dilute down and use over the top of this, hoping for more of what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also: this stuff goes a LONG way. I used 1 &amp; 1/2 tubes, and my hair is about the middle of my back. In retrospect, I could have diluted this with conditioner and gotten a much tamer color (SHOULDA!).&lt;br /&gt;As for the stain on the bottom of your bathtub? Shaving cream. Spray it on, let it sit, wipe it off. Bonus if you have kids, they love to play in it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely gorgeous color!! Get it right now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of hair dyes, including having my hair professionally done. This is the most economical, has the correct color results, easy to use, and lasts longer than most. My hair is a highlighted blonde color, so this color (and the pink Vivids color) turn my hair a magenta-ish purple color slightly darker than the photo of the color (that photo would likely result with completely dyed platinum hair). It lasts about 3-4 weeks and I wash my hair about every 3 days. Note that it&#x27;s not permanent - I have never found one (even in a professional salon) that is permanent. Colors like pink and purple don&#x27;t stay permanently in dyed blond hair....none of them do. However, this one &amp;#34;washes&amp;#34; over 3-4 weeks into a very pretty light purplish-magenta and then I re-dye it. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Looks purple online but comes out very pink, almost fuchsia in color. But it doesn&#x27;t wash or fade quickly and despite it not being purple it&#x27;s a fantastic color.</li>
            <li> I love this color.  I have very dark hair and have been using Vivids Violet for over a year now.  I wanted something that would &amp;#34;POP&amp;#34; without being gaudy. Not too pink or too purple. A nice rich color.  We did peek aboo streaks and it is great!  Love the look!  Thanks Pravana love your products</li>
            <li> I actually really loved the product; I just didn&#x27;t like the price</li>
            <li> I love how the color turned out. I was going for a dark brown violet. But, I recommend leaving the dye in longer than instructed.... if you have the time.</li>
            <li> The color was a little more pink than I wanted it.  High quality dye though!</li>
            <li> Love this hair color! I first lightened my hair to a dark blonde/light brown color, then applied with a little bit of conditioner mixed in to tone it down. It came out a beautiful deep reddish-pink. I keep buying it again and again!</li>
            <li> I bought Wild Orchid in hopes of getting a purpleish color, yeah it was more red than anything. It could be that I dyed it on faded orange hair so if you want the truest color I suggest you put it on blonde hair and not over an actual color. The longevity is amazing though. I use Pravana Orange and it lasts for at least a month and a half of intense color. Even when it fades its still bold! But once you go pravana vivids, you can&#x27;t bleach it out or color strip it. You&#x27;d have to dye your hair a dark natural color since its a stain dye and stains your cuticle. But nonetheless its great!&lt;br /&gt;I posted a picture, wild orchid is the top color, bottom is special effects.</li>
            <li> I love this color! Its is on of my favorites because its so bright and does not bleed like some of the others.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally a medium brown and was dyed darkest brown (looks black). I bleached a few strips of hair to that gross ugly orange color and then used the wild orchids color on the Orange hair strips....I was so amazed and impressed with how bright and colorful the wild orchids took even though my hair was not bleached down too much. I will never use manic panic again!  Ultimately the wild orchid came out as a magenta color, I was hoping for more purple but the pinkish magenta looks great!</li>
            <li> Just as good as expected!</li>
            <li> its a great color just washes out quickly</li>
            <li> Wild orchid is a great color!  It lasted longer than any other color I&#x27;ve used...will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> The best unnatural colors on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re here you&#x27;re searching for a color that doesn&#x27;t fade fast and stays vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pravana has created the perfect shades for just that! The color lasts very well when you care for your hair properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve been thinking of going with a fun funky color remember it&#x27;s best to wash your hair in cool cold water with shampoos and conditioners that don&#x27;t strip color. This is very important to follow. You will be disappointed with any pigment if you aren&#x27;t following proper hair care guidelines for colored hair. Washing hair in cold water may not sound appealing at all because it isn&#x27;t appealing, but you will spend less on color and have a vibrant shade for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you apply the color remember GLOVES. Gloves for everything. Even when you wash it out. If you dont wear gloves when you wash it out, you will have colored hands. Also, apply vaseline around your hairline and your neck. If you do not do this this will dye EVERYTHING. your face, your nails, anything it touches. It&#x27;s very pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use old towels and keep my gloves on for the entire process. If you have dark hair you will need to pre-lighten your hair most likely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to keep this color fairly vibrant for approximately 2 months before it needed to be redone. It was still very pigmented and it faded nicely, so the shades were not off-putting when it did fade. But by 2 months roots were obvious and color needed some TLC. However, I believe for funky colors 2 months is a pretty good stretch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot stress enough following the cold water wash and proper shampoos. I take a hot shower with a cap. Then rinse my hair separately after.</li>
            <li> Bleached my hair and the color still washes off very easily. Have to reapply every 10 days or so. The color is pretty although slightly lighter than the picture.</li>
            <li> I love this color, but find that it only stays bright for a couple of shampoos. After that it fades to a pale pink for a week or so, then virtualy disappears. The N Rage &amp; ion semi-permanent products last longer for less money.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted her tips dyed so I decided to try this.  The color is really pretty!  The only problem we had was it washed out extremely quickly.  She isn&#x27;t allowed to have dyed hair in school so I actually wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t stay in forever, but didn&#x27;t expect this to wash out so soon.  I was hoping it would last most of the summer.  She washes her hair daily which I know is not recommended with this dye.  Unfortunately, she has to.  We have really gross humid weather in the summer and she can&#x27;t stand not washing her hair every day.  We also did not bleach her hair first which is probably why it didn&#x27;t stay in so well.  I saw a lot of people add the color to a conditioner too but since she only had her tips done, I couldn&#x27;t do that.  She has light brown hair and the color looked really good in it after dying it, then faded daily.  It has only been 2 weeks and the color is pretty much gone.  I would definitely suggest bleaching first if you want the color to stay.</li>
            <li> I purchased Wild Orchid as well as Violet. I mixed the entire wild orchid tube with half of the violet plus a ton of white conditioner. I love the color! One month in and the color still looked surprisingly good. Two months in now and I&#x27;m finally going to retouch all of it. I did touch ups of just the roots a few times in between.&lt;br /&gt;I bleached first, but didn&#x27;t have enough bleach for all of my hair. I washed with only ice cold water, every 3 or 4 days powdering daily.</li>
            <li> Cool color - but washes out at every shampoo...</li>
            <li> The longevity of Pravana hair color is amazing.  I use this and the Violet color to create an ombre in my hair.  The color is very easy to work with and lasts longer than other brands I&#x27;ve used (Manic Panic, Ion Brights from Sally&#x27;s etc...).  I will keep repurchasing.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this brand!</li>
            <li> I love this color!  I mixed one part wild orchid to about three parts violet for the perfect purple I was looking for! It was very dark and hardly notieable at first, probably because I didn&#x27;t lighten my hair all the way to the recommended level, but when it finally did start fading, (it took several weeks!) it showed up brilliantly, especially in sunlight. It didn&#x27;t really show under fluourescent lighting, which actually worked out great so it wasn&#x27;t too bright for work. Again, that may be mostly because I didn&#x27;t lighten my hair enough to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I maintained the color for a while by mixing small amounts of the dye with white conditioner and using that while in the shower, letting the conditioner sit while I did my shaving and other washing. Use gloves or else it will stain your hands! I found Scrubbing Bubbles works great for any splatter cleanup in the shower, but while you do the initial dye, it is best to cover everything because it stains FAST. I will be using this product again, and I have plenty of leftover dye. I only dyed pieces in the bottom layers of my medium length hair, and I still have 3/4 of each tube left, even after making the colored conditioner!</li>
            <li> perfect highlight color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Manic Panic and Sparks on my bleached hair, Sparks was decent but I&#x27;m sold on Pravana! It hasn&#x27;t faded out in 3 washes over 2 weeks. The tips of my hair was dyed with Sparks and it&#x27;s started to fill and look muddy almost; can&#x27;t wait to order more Pravana dye and say goodbye to mediocre color.</li>
            <li> Perfect color. Totally satisfied. I plan on ordering again. I&#x27;ve recommended this to several people I know they&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> Great color But washes out fast. I use sulfate free shampoo but it still washes out. Only last about 2 weeks and my hair is bleached.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this color. I use it by itself or combined with the violet. I have short hair, so when I use this by itself I can dye my hair three or four times with one tube. The violet is darker than the wild orchid, and it only takes a little bit of violet to make the color much darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair doesn&#x27;t take dye very well, so I have to redye constantly. This happens with every brand of dye. This lasts about the same amount of time as other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> Did not stick to my naturally light brown/blonde roots and was not as vivid as I hoped like the violet. I used the whole tube.  I&#x27;ll just be ordering violet to fix it, since it riuned the possibility of a decent looking orchid to violet ombre.</li>
            <li> Quality dye, surprisingly fade resistant and was easy to work with. I am now a convert to Pravana (have used special effects for 8 years)</li>
            <li> very happy with my purchase : )</li>
            <li> Love this color so much, it&#x27;s the perfect shade for Spring this year.  I only wished that it would last longer on my hair, but I didn&#x27;t bleach it too blonde before I applied it.  Still a great color.</li>
            <li> After using this product I will probably never use Manic Panic again. I mix Wild Orchid with Violet to make a nice purple tone that works well over pre-lightened hair. I bleach my medium brown hair to a coppery orange color and apply the Pravana dye undiluted. For the first few weeks it&#x27;s a dark violet (almost burgundy) tone, but it gradually fades to a nice Barney purple. I went an entire month without any touch ups or colored conditioner, which was weird for me because I&#x27;m accustomed to weekly touch ups with Manic Panic. I only re-dyed my hair because my roots were coming in. As an experiment I applied the dye over my virgin roots and let it process for 35 minutes and it didn&#x27;t do much. Definitely need to lighten first for the color to be truly vivid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned that this stuff stains like a mofo. I cut open large trash bags and drape them over EVERYTHING in my bathroom and I still somehow always manage to get a drop somewhere. Be sure to cover your ears, neck, and forehead with vaseline, wear gloves, and set up your bathroom like you&#x27;re painting the ceiling! Also, if you like to workout prepare for all of your headbands and earbuds to turn purple!</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found..so many colors</li>
            <li> Pretty! Used this over highlighted dark hair.  Gorgeous</li>
            <li> I used this and pravana red to create an ombr&amp;eacute; effect and in a small part of my bangs i mixed the red and w.o. for my bangs), and it looks awesome! My bangs faded out pretty quickly, but thats because when i shampoo my hair, they lie right on the top where i put the shampoo lol and the ends just get second hand suds brought down from the top of my head to avoid drying them out, and thereforehave retained their color almost perfectly for the 3 months the color has been in my hair lol.</li>
            <li> I am in love with Pravana!  The colors are so vivid and I don&#x27;t have to retouch for 4-6 weeks when I wash my hair with fairly cold water.  The color even penetrates my dark brown roots!&lt;br /&gt;The color is also absolutely beautiful and my new favorite!  It is more of a rich, vivid pink with a hint of purple so I prefer this over the &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; color.  The pink one was a bit too light for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;In the first photo, I have Violet on top and Wild Orchid on the bottom.  The second photo is with the pink.  As you can see, they are way different!</li>
            <li> colour stays in better than everyone r kind I&#x27;ve tried... and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair to the level that the package said would allow the dye to be vivid and it only barely stuck to my hair. It&#x27;s been about a week since I dyed it and it&#x27;s already almost completely washed out. I&#x27;ve worked with other purple/pink dyes before and so far this has been the most unsuccessful. It did not stain the bathtub but it stained by scalp. My scalp is probably going to be purple for longer than my hair.</li>
            <li> I am new to the pastel hair thing so I&#x27;ve been going back and forth with pink and lilac. This color has a beautiful pink undertone when mixed with conditioner to create a pastel look. I seriously use like a pea size amount too so it&#x27;s going to last me forever. It&#x27;s a much truer more professional color than the manic panic types too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manic Panic is like a toddler with banana on it&#x27;s face and Pravana Vivids is smoking a joint under the bleachers during 2nd period.</li>
            <li> If you are going for purple there is no other choice than Pravana. I got so many compliments on my hair when it was purple and people were constantly coming up to me and asking me how I got my hair so bright. I have dyed my hair A LOT and this is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Too high maintenance to keep up with color &amp; looks more red of a color. It also washes out too quickly &amp; I didn&#x27;t like that at all. Even when I did all I could to make the color last.</li>
            <li> fine..just what i ordered.</li>
            <li> This hair color lasted me about 2 1/2 almost 3 weeks before fading heavily...  Not sure if silk creme or the other wild orchid pravana on here are different. Still extremely happy with the color!!&lt;br /&gt;Also used violet! Violet is still bright and brilliant as the day I dyed it. It&#x27;s been a month!&lt;br /&gt;Be careful as this WILL stain everything.. At first!!</li>
            <li> Faded very fast, went more red then purple</li>
    </ol>
