            <li>The battery life on this electric razor is amazing!</li>
            <li>This shaver is amazing!</li>
            <li>became a great good surprise.</li>

            <li>good price, works great.</li>
            <li>Packaged nice, delivery on time, and product as described!</li>
            <li>cuts great, the trimmer is excellent and you can clean the head with running water...</li>
            <li>good product, a pleasant purchase</li>
            <li>This has been the best by far the best electric shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Well, I had great hopes for this shaver since most of these reviews are great.</li>
            <li>Great value and works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>and it does a damn good job.</li>
            <li>I bought this one to try it because I thought it was a good value and</li>
            <li>Good products at affordable prices</li>
            <li>Good product, thank you.</li>
            <li>though it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, it gives me a good looking shave with no discomfort.  </li>
            <li>I also have Panasonic shavers and they are good as well</li>
            <li>All the others did a good job.</li>
            <li>is a good shaver, that I will continue to use, but for the price, I&#x27;d like the precision trimmer to be a bit</li>
            <li>It really is a good product.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as good as I was hoping it would be.</li>
            <li>When it is good, it is good, but when it doesn&#x27;t work it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>good razor at good price</li>
            <li>My husband loved it really good price compared to retail stores saves couple $$$$</li>
            <li>Amazingly good product.</li>
            <li>and so is my face, but for the $35 price point, I&#x27;m gonna say this is a fair deal.</li>
            <li>give it four stars for being a good value.</li>
            <li>good quality.</li>
            <li>how supremely good it is.</li>
            <li>Have always had Brauns and loved them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a good razor for a bargain price.</li>
            <li>He loved it.  </li>
            <li>in all it is a good product.</li>
            <li>otherwise it&#x27;s a good razor.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>He totally loved it.</li>
            <li>the price was so good.  </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for a good electric razor that doesn&#x27;t have a ton of garbage you don&#x27;t need or want and stil</li>
            <li>gives you a good shave</li>
            <li>This shaver had good ratings for a good price</li>
            <li>it is perfect ,very useful</li>
            <li>The shaver is very good, very clean shave.</li>
            <li>Best razor I have ever owned and it was priced right!</li>
            <li>Just used it on his full head of hair and it shaved it all off perfectly great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for one, two, or even three days of stubble (depending on how quickly you grow beard hair).</li>
            <li>so I was very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It is a great bargain and I am glad I gave it a chance.</li>
            <li>Good performance , amazing price</li>
            <li>Great Shaver!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Braun &amp;#34;Series 3&amp;#34; shavers for many years.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It would cost more to use blades for a year!.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver and over all I&#x27;m really happy about the product !</li>
            <li>Very nice, I like it very much!Very good use!</li>
            <li>Great value and easy for a traveler to pack</li>
            <li>Great comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice packaged and well looked.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t give a close shave, but still nice.</li>
            <li>liked this feature because I have a goatee</li>
            <li>so nice I bought it twice</li>
            <li>I already own a Braun branded model that happed to have a busted retractable trimmer.</li>
            <li>I have shaved with an electric razor for many years and thought the brand I had been using was really good until I used this one.  </li>
            <li>better than the Remington that I was using .Smooth shave and good battery life.</li>
            <li>My husband liked using it.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t see what I am doing) and liked the idea that the shaver could still be operated while plugged in if needed.</li>
            <li>and it gives a nice, close shave.  </li>
            <li>He says he likes it, but he needs more training to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li>Okay, I knew if Braun made it then it had to be a good product.</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and is reasonably kind to my face, but it&#x27;s not an improvement to what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>It shaved closer than the Norelco that I used to own.</li>
            <li>Bought for my son and he really likes it, Braun razors are the best.</li>
            <li>Powerful, shaving is very clean, color is also very beautiful</li>
            <li>This particular one has the best foil and cutter arrangement ever.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Very good shaver get a close shave every time easy to clean.</li>
            <li>They have been very, very good, and this one branded with the Old Spice name is yet another winner; good run time between charges, trimmer, water cleanup, and of course, close shaves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;mvVery impressed would recommend to anyone looking for new shaver.</li>
            <li>This however the stylish and modern design makes it an excellent paper weight.</li>
            <li>Good looking and easy to charge and use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to grip and feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li>I used to use Philips Shaves and this is the first time to use the Braun one,very good!</li>
            <li>love it love how close u may shave looks like u use razor on your face, how close the shave it!  </li>
            <li>popped this Old Spice shaver made by Braun, It&#x27;s the best bargin going.</li>
            <li>by far the best shaver i have ever used</li>
            <li>Have been shaving with Fusion for so many years and nice to have a switch to a quality electric--</li>
            <li>and (3) It seemed to have the most enthusiastic reviews of any shaver.</li>
            <li>Buy cheap and well used to that good</li>
            <li>but I do use it every day to keep the stubble away and for that, the Old Spice Shaver is perfect.</li>
            <li>works great ,easy to clean and does a nice close shave,</li>
            <li>The screens are very fine</li>
            <li>As someone who is not hell-bent on obtaining the best shave possibly on a daily basis, this shaver is amazing.</li>
            <li>Use a nice shaving gel on your face and you will have the most comfortable and closet shave ever!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a very light beard and need to do 20 passes to cut any hair.</li>
            <li>But the operation is very smooth, albeit a bit</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Very cheap quality.</li>
            <li>received it quickly and just as promised it shaves as good as my Norelco.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean, and again, amazing.</li>
            <li>This is NOT a shower shaver, but it may be safely cleaned under running water.  </li>
            <li>but that is more out of habit than the being out of the capability of the trimmer portion of this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many shaving systems over the years.  </li>
            <li>Logistics fast, shaver great.</li>
            <li>The most inexpensive Norelco razor shaves much better than this.</li>
            <li>Could they have rigged that many?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure of</li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>My brother is enjoying this product...</li>
            <li>its just ok</li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s better than the one it replaced -- this coming from a man who hates change.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t cost much more than the cutter and screen refill</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better than my Series 5.  </li>
            <li>top of that, the results were uneven.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not in love with the charging cord.</li>
            <li>so it was more of a &amp;#34;shadow-stubble)</li>
            <li>the better the results.</li>
            <li>The shave wasn&#x27;t all the close but better then most electric shavers.</li>
            <li>Overall it was ok but not the best shaver that I has use.</li>
            <li>Most of my brauns lasted years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>product is an outstanding value.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine they are that much better than this one.</li>
            <li>It works more often than not.</li>
            <li>Does not make your face smooth!</li>
            <li>Just make sure to shave every morning.</li>
            <li>it can be better but for the price you can not ask for more, sometimes It leaves some hairs.</li>
            <li>My fisrt electric shaver no cuts on my face perfect í definitely recommend it</li>
            <li>Now love to body electric razor.  </li>
            <li>haves better than Norelco, Braun and Remington shavers</li>
            <li>it is nice and works great so far</li>
            <li>The corded Braun that my wife gave me 22 years ago got dropped one too many times.</li>
            <li>It outperforms or equals the top of the line 7 series</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best razor he has had for shaving as well as cleaning.  </li>
            <li>One of the better electric shavers.</li>
            <li>He is very much satisfied.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic!</li>
            <li>It provides a really close shave and just feels great to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li>I was able to rinse it off in shower, and</li>
            <li>Compared to the Norelco, I get 3 to 5 more shaves with the Braun.</li>
            <li>&quot; but I&#x27;m, glad I did.</li>
            <li>This is simply the very best electric razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Excellent shaver, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>I recommend this for people that need to shave only not trim because this is more of a shaver than trimmer, but I love the Precision trimmer it is great for the sideburns!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>If I had more experience with this, I probably would have known to look for this.</li>
            <li>Use feels good, is worth buying</li>
            <li>I love that you can use it cordless or while plugged in.</li>
            <li>aside from the ginormus a/c plug sticking out of the socket, i love this shaver...</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Considering the price of most electric shavers not to mention the cost of razors now days this shaver is a deal.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good,maybe I should buy a better one in Braun........</li>
            <li>Overall, this is the best electric shaver I have owned and I have owned many.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Way better than I dreamed it would be.</li>
            <li>This one got good reviews and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>works good and priced right</li>
            <li>So it is a good idea to wash it right after opening.</li>
            <li>main part of it works wonderfully, but the feature that was intriguing was the pop up precision trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great shaver at a decent price.</li>
            <li>-wise, light and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t showed any signs of wear and the battery life is pretty good.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it was very easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled after the first shave!  </li>
            <li>Red is nice,The price is very good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very cool item for me.  </li>
            <li>I have a light beard, I&#x27;m retire and don&#x27;t need to shave more than once a week.</li>
            <li>He has always used razors, but is happy with the the results of the Old Spice electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I am really so happy with the Old Spice Men&#x27;s electric shaver.</li>
            <li>The Old Spice Shaver is a great shaver and I recommend it to anyone looking for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>If you are contemplating an electric shaver, or just want one for special times, gentlemen, start here!  </li>
            <li>and if you don&#x27;t have incredibly invasive facial hair, they will do the job just fine.  </li>
            <li>best advice, as with other electrics I&#x27;ve used... Shave as often as you can.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: Easy to use and maintain and gives a close shave</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>* Easy to use and maintain</li>
            <li>I bought it for my dad: lightweight and easy to manage, he says.</li>
            <li>The shaver hasn&#x27;t dulled over the course of 2 months and is easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>It is easily equivalent to a $60-100 shaver.  </li>
            <li>Makes for easy movement.  </li>
            <li>Opens and cleans easily.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend likes me to keep a clean face most of the time</li>
            <li>but i was able to use the electric shaver three days in a row, with a close enough shave to make her happy,</li>
            <li>I like how its so easy to use and how close of a cut it gives you.</li>
            <li>OK for a quick shave, good hold charge , fast recharge</li>
            <li>It is definitely a strong shaver.</li>
            <li>Braun320S-4, high performance, suitable for students or to father&#x27;s gift!</li>
            <li>This is the best razor I have ever had and that goes back to my first electric razor in 1955 and it does seem like three barbers had shaved me.</li>
            <li>I think when me and my face get used to the shaves will be fine.</li>
            <li>The machine is strong and accurate, doesn&#x27;t leave any cuts on the face, the additional trimmer is helpful</li>
            <li>He said it was the closest shave he has ever seen and so easy and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It worked fine on my mustache, and face cheeks.</li>
            <li>And it gives a super close shave too!</li>
            <li>one of the best I&#x27;ve used, close shave and the charge last a good long time</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rinsing the shaver head after use with water was very simple and easy, and worked great.</li>
            <li>It skips large patches and doesn&#x27;t have the power to be effective.</li>
            <li>This is my second foil shaver after the Braun 340s and it most certainly gives a very good shave .</li>
            <li>Shaver looks amazing,  but as far as shaving goes, I&#x27;m better off using a disposable razor from the dollar store..</li>
            <li>This is a really nice electric shaver, which achieves a reasonably close shave, feels comfortable while using it, and lasts a number of days before needing to recharge.</li>
            <li>I was enticed by the reviews I read along with a great price on the product to give electrics yet one last</li>
            <li>I get zero irritation and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>To get a smooth shave, you have to work at it for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>Overall though, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Holding the shaver is not as comfortable as I would like.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic shaver for the price.</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>Fantastic shave that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>It makes his skin smooth and doesn&#x27;t cause  irritation.</li>
            <li>My face is baby smooth now.</li>
            <li>Lightly spray the cutter as it&#x27;s operating then shave before showering.&lt;br /&gt;Better</li>
            <li>They work well and your finally free of razor burn.</li>
            <li>Smooth as silk with my shaving</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Get what you pay for, cheap price, cheaper product.</li>
            <li>Incredibly smooth and no irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice shaver for day to day get ready for work shave.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>She loves how smooth her legs feel, and so do I</li>
            <li>And even then it wasn&#x27;t getting as smooth as it use to.</li>
            <li>Before I start, I must note that I received this shaver for free to test/review.  </li>
            <li>Shave - Leaves my face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom&lt;</li>
            <li>I have had mine for almost three months and enjoy the comfortable close shave I always get.</li>
            <li>I got it free from BzzAgent</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, and works cordless or corded.</li>
            <li>Way to go Amazon for selling this dirt cheap.</li>
            <li>Works great, it cuts my facial hair.</li>
            <li>If you follow their shaving tips in the manual, and move the razor SLO-O-OWLY across your face rather than trying for a speed record, you will get a close, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Braun shaves very well and the clipper feature is effective.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li>My old razor didn&#x27;t do a good job on father&#x27;s day</li>
            <li>So far, by far, this is the best electric razor I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>but then again I haven&#x27;t had a good pop up trimmer since my old Norelco razor in 1969.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is super easy for him to use and it is easy clean up.</li>
            <li>Braun normal has a great product not so much this time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap electric razor that holds a charge for a long time and does a great job shaving.</li>
            <li>It charges right up, has a helpful LED, is easy to hold on to, easy to clean,...</li>
            <li>On the one hand I was happy to see this, but I was very leery about the new style shape and the triple foil.</li>
            <li>my first time using this brand,  haven&#x27;t used electric razor in many years,  </li>
            <li>Even around the edges of my mouth , I wasn&#x27;t sure at first</li>
            <li>I was actually excited when I saw this when I received it; however, the cut it gives is inconsistent.</li>
            <li>I love the colour so much !</li>
            <li>I was impressed with how close the shaver did shave, It wasnt quite as close as a conventional razor but pretty close.</li>
            <li>No problem, even not too clean</li>
            <li>Also clean your razor after every use.</li>
            <li>I have to use a blade razor to clean up that area.  </li>
            <li>beautiful shape and easy to use, a little bit noisy&lt;</li>
            <li>but it certainly shaves better.</li>
            <li>Thankfully I was right!</li>
            <li>I expected it to, as it would have been a great time saver.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>yet this is a true wet/dry razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Philips Norelco for last 2 years and it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>Want a good shave use a regular razor!</li>
            <li>The shave is only fair.  </li>
            <li>I am debating buying a second one of these as back-up because the price is so good.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise, it gave me a closer shave than the rotaries, and it&#x27;s the only one of the three that did a good job on my neck.</li>
            <li>Probably a reasonable shave for most men.</li>
            <li>Ergonomics are good, it&#x27;s relatively quiet, and shaves close with no irritation.</li>
            <li>The only reason I am giving it one star is because the product design and material quality was good.</li>
            <li>Nice look of Old Spice style too.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>This this is super nice, it gives me a really close shave, and it is very gentle on the skin, I have not had it pull any hairs.</li>
            <li>Has good battery and quick enough charge but will not cut hair.</li>
            <li>I used a Braun 7000 for about 10 years and it was great, but the replacement blades offered now don&#x27;t really fit well, and I got a few cuts.  </li>
            <li>I take this on trips ... and the shave it gives is adequate ...</li>
            <li>Came quick.....</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Charges quick and lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent shaver, I have no painful hair pulling at all and finish shaving in half the time as my old norelco.</li>
            <li>mistake most new electric razor users make is not using a lubricant before each shave.</li>
            <li>Most razors when new blades are needed can be bought separately from the foil.</li>
            <li>The shave itself was smoother and closer than expected (not to mention way quieter), which was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>Because it is easy to use, He is very satisfy with this gift.</li>
            <li>it really leaves your face very smooth; much smoother than my series 3 Braun.  </li>
            <li>Really close shave, feels comfortable on my face.</li>
            <li>a lot works great even after a few days beard</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I recommend that you read the directions carefully and follow the tips of a good shave.</li>
            <li>WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li>Just so so; but it worth the money.</li>
            <li>I thought about the lack of wet/dry feature but opted for this since I rarely shaved in the shower anyway</li>
            <li>useful and convenient.</li>
            <li>useful and cheap, with lovely red handle.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using this product and it actually a leaves a more smoother skin and also it last more days without recharging</li>
            <li>It is powerful and gives a comfortable and reasonably close shave.</li>
            <li>Well worth the one time investment.</li>
            <li>Norelco said they no longer had repair services and replacement heads were either no longer available or cost more than several shavers!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I used this product every morning to shave my stubble down, and it worked great for the first 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>And gets hot quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any water to clean it, just a cheap barber&#x27;s brush that came with an old set of hair clippers I had.  </li>
            <li>It performs adequately but not at the superior level that previous reviews indicated.  </li>
            <li>The thing I love about this is it is Gluten free and can be used as a door stop if you tie a big rock to it first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna go shave right now (&lt;;</li>
            <li>I received the shaver, and tried it right away.</li>
            <li>Vibration amplitude is larger than the Philips，In flat areas suitable for shaving，Rounded chin shaving foil is better fit</li>
            <li>It is a true testimony to the quality of the razor when it cuts better than a disposable or regular hand razor/shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The long hair trimmer was a good idea, but didn&#x27;t do much when I tried to cleaning up my sideburns.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap and quality razor, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Overall I love this shaver and definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a nice one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Functional with both trimming up with a goatee or dealing with daily stubble, this Braun performs very well without catching, pulling or leaving my face destroyed.  </li>
            <li>Received few days back and am impressed well with it&#x27;s features and performance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I thought it had done a really good job until I used the Old Spice razor the next day.  </li>
            <li>It is the only electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used on my whole face that gave me an amazing shave without have to go over areas over and over and over.</li>
            <li>Very simple design, easy  to use, clean and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I love the Old Spice Men&#x27;s Shaver, powered by Braun, it really get the job done</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t seem any better than my old razer, but no worse.  </li>
            <li>A great buy for a usually more expensive Bruan.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable and the battery seems to last forever.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable to hold and quiet.  </li>
            <li>I would love k other place as these so cheap.</li>
            <li>I am very surprised at the quality and close shave !!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Holds charge exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>This is my first Braun razor purchase after using Norelco for 20+ years.</li>
            <li>but I am relieved that I tried one on myself first and saved myself the embarrassment.</li>
            <li>My review comes from after the first use.</li>
            <li>Very close shave!</li>
            <li>At the end of the day I&#x27;m left with many cuts and patches of hair still on my face.. Will NOT recommend</li>
            <li>Although I checked it out and gave it the first charge, I did not use it.</li>
            <li>nice shaver but shaver does not give you as close a shave as you would have expected.</li>
            <li>The smooth shave was close, but did not cause any ingrown hairs or skin irritation--and I have pretty sensitive</li>
            <li>pretty easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First time out with this shaver today.  </li>
            <li>This is the first electric shaver I have owned in 30 years of shaving.  </li>
            <li>I believe that it actually shaved better and closer than the multi-blade and lasted longer to boot.  </li>
            <li>Well this is much better balanced than the one I had several years ago, and lighter too, but still feeling well made.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>This one is better than my last!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Ok so this is my second shaver I have owned in my lifetime</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 20) and the first one was bought at a garage sale, (although it too was Braun)</li>
            <li>It does a nice job at getting longer and short hair with a smooth overall shave.  </li>
            <li>Traditional spin type more effeciency</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s pretty and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Since then, I have been only mildly satisfied.</li>
            <li>When I saw the Old Spice version of the razor advertised and noticed the fabulous price on Amazon, I decided to give Braun another chance.</li>
            <li>it really can be used for allot of stuff!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and the battery charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>received the Old Spice Shaver from BuzzFeed for free at the end of January and have been using it for almost two months now.</li>
            <li>I use the slide-out trimmer to take a first pass in that case, followed by using the foil cutters.  </li>
            <li>Its his first electric shaver</li>
            <li>The battery, so far, keeps a good charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been one to use a blade razor and use an electric only for my mustache area, light trimming or head errant hairs, and for a quick refresh on days I don&#x27;t feel like shaving.</li>
            <li>To start the shaver is built very sturdy and it feels right in my hand</li>
            <li>The unique thing is that it has a clipper on the back side which is cool.</li>
            <li>I saw this on Amazon, and bought it because of the Braun quality and all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>The battery holds its charge for a long time, many shaves.</li>
            <li>He fully charged the shaver once we received it, since then two weeks passed, and battery is still full WOW.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have any experience in the Old Spice Shaver taming a full beard</li>
            <li>Works well, a little weight, not so clean, but cheap and useful.</li>
            <li>The shave is very close on flat areas and good enough around the jawbone.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much else positive about it.</li>
            <li>It works great on the cheeks, but on the jawline and especially the neck it wouldn&#x27;t catch the hairs, and I would have to go back with a wet razor to clean up the rest.</li>
            <li>Shaving is very clean, but need long time.</li>
            <li>If you are like me and only shave several times a week this is a good shaver, BUT of course does not give the same clean feel that a razor does.</li>
            <li>Value really, really cheap, as a Chinese people see things that are made in China in the United States is much cheaper than China so much, really very helpless!</li>
            <li>This is a great Braun shaver for a half of the regualr cost of the same model.</li>
            <li>Great shaver without being super expensive like Braun or the others.  </li>
            <li>This would be good for those first starting to shave, not a 31 year old man who needs to shave daily or will grow a beard.</li>
            <li>you consider the very high quality construction of this razor.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s a nice little shaver.</li>
            <li>A nice little shaver for the price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use an electric razor regularly, I just wanted a cheap one for days that I&#x27;m rushing and really don&#x27;t feel like shaving with blades/cream.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a built in side burn trimmer, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well at all.</li>
            <li>Although initially the shave is smooth, but the end of the day his face is course like sandpaper.</li>
            <li>You will find it really really quite when not turned on</li>
            <li>The rotary blades of Norelco cut much closer &amp; smoother than this Braun.</li>
            <li>It shaves close and fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving electric for years, but have never spend much money on a razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Charging the razor was fast, and no complaints about battery life.</li>
            <li>Really amazed by this product.  </li>
            <li>and you get a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>Works better than expected</li>
            <li>Although it does not get the job done as well as I like, it does get the job done, but in a much longer time.</li>
            <li>The battery also holds a charge very well.</li>
            <li>Gave him a very close shave</li>
            <li>works very well as it was a gift for my brother bear</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still in the break-in period and have found it much better than expected.  </li>
            <li>High praise!</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s very picky about shavers.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>Great price, poor expectations.  </li>
            <li>Very close shave.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t spend a C-note, then find out you don&#x27;t like the whole experience.</li>
            <li>Shaves very well- really fast and close shaves.  </li>
            <li>the price, which makes it a real bargain.  </li>
            <li>then that, the price is really reasonable</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this if you&#x27;re looking to upgrade or replace!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver!</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>For this price range, you absolutely cannot beat the quality of this electric razor.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone who wants a screen shaver.</li>
            <li>It takes me about five minutes to do my whole face.</li>
            <li>and I really like this shaver</li>
            <li>Should really be 0 stars if I could.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had much luck with electric razors, so your milage may vary.</li>
            <li>so I thought why not just replace the whole razor.  </li>
            <li>It works reasonably well -</li>
            <li>The charging time is fast.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a reasonably priced shaver to replace a Norelco that quit working.  </li>
            <li>nice,i like it so much.</li>
            <li>reasonably priced razor and works well.</li>
            <li>When my old Braun began to show its age several years ago, I bought the latest Norelco on the market.</li>
            <li>that doesn&#x27;t leave a fair number of it&#x27;s purchasers unhappy, so I have no idea if there are better options.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m done I remove the head, tap it on the edge of my garbage can, and it&#x27;s clean and ready to go for next time.</li>
            <li>Better than expected!</li>
            <li>I only replaced them because I wanted a new one.&lt;br /&gt;You can spend much more, but you won&#x27;t necessarily get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>After having this shaver for several weeks now, I am happy to report that I have finally found a shaver capable of effectively dealing with my thick facial hair.  </li>
            <li>not near as close of a shave or as comfortable as my three head Norelco but for the price.  </li>
            <li>It sticks out pretty far and, when plugged in, can get knocked or fall out of the socket</li>
            <li>The first time I used this model Braun, I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of use and the close shave I got.</li>
            <li>plus, it looks so cool with the red.</li>
            <li>I was using a regular non electric razor since my other electric razor was not doing the job( and never did as well this old spice on a good day}.</li>
            <li>so far so good, but due to my prior ingrown issues it takes some time to work on the neck area which causes irritation.</li>
            <li>As a new year gift for my father,It;s really cheaper than that sold in china.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good shaver as a gift for my wife, most woman&#x27;s shavers have bad ratings</li>
            <li>This takes the place of an older version my husband uses.</li>
            <li>It charges quickly and holds power for over a week with daily use.</li>
            <li>The razor doesn&#x27;t do particularly well with the longer, softer hair on the neck.  </li>
            <li>Close shave, only mild irritation on my neck (Adam&#x27;s apple).</li>
            <li>I like old spice after shave and expected better from them.  </li>
            <li>Overall a decent deal that you will not regret!!!</li>
            <li>i REALLY like the Old Spice Men&#x27;s Shaver!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quality shaver that doesn&#x27;t cost $150+.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This product gives high performance for its price.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend .</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned Norelco rotary shavers in the past, but decided to take a chance on this razor after reading so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>And the fact that it is Old Spice branded instead of Remington makes it significantly cheaper than the same razor with the Remington brand.</li>
            <li>the plus side, the battery lasts a really long time, a feature I havent found on other shavers, and it was REALLY easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Little did I know it became my favorite shaver.</li>
            <li>I prefer to clean the blades directly with a brush but no big deal</li>
            <li>It takes much time to shave completely.</li>
            <li>I no longer wet shave, as I use this with the Remington face saver and it gives a convenient, close and comfortable shave .</li>
            <li>and normally I have to use a separate shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>None lasted more than a few months.</li>
            <li>My first Braun powered shaver, but using standard blade is much easier and faster.</li>
            <li>i can never seem to find normal batterys when i need them.</li>
            <li>I have a thick beard, so three days is kind of pushing it</li>
            <li>I recently replaced my Norelco (the kind with 3 round heads) and I&#x27;m really digging this Old Spice shaver.</li>
            <li>Stay far away from this product, spend a little more and get a quality razor.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone looking for a new razor.</li>
            <li>I live in a dorm room with a roommate</li>
            <li>The additional little trimmer is very cool for things like side burns and whatever the heck else</li>
            <li>I get the same smooth shave in the same amount of time as blades without the cuts, burning, expense and hassle of replenishing blades.  </li>
            <li>It shaves very close, much closer than my $160 Philips Norelco Arcitec that recently died.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really a fan of the red color, and also it should be more heavy-duty</li>
            <li>So this razor might be good for some people, but if you have thick facial hair, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>But even before I broke it I was using the old corded single foil to clean up the stuff that the fancy triple foil coudn&#x27;t seem to pick up.</li>
            <li>I have been using this razor for ONE MONTH on my first initial charge.</li>
            <li>Not being able to shave on a regular basis due to being on the road alot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It won&#x27;t give you nearly as close of a shave as a normal razor</li>
            <li>looks like Braun finally went back to using better or larger batteries.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first electric razor that actually takes care of the chin hairs and peach fuzz on face and lip area.  </li>
            <li>Amazon, Old Spice, and Braun have it together!</li>
            <li>In conclusion I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes electric shavers or is interested in trying one out, in fact i have been telling every one with i beard that i know about it and</li>
            <li>THANK YOU BRAUN AND OLD SPICE!</li>
            <li>My 12 year old Rem rotary still cuts closer than this new one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a slightly above average electric shaver, what more</li>
            <li>It is far superior to any other electric razor I have ever used, closely approaching the results of wet shaving -- but not quite there yet.</li>
            <li>Its so comfortable to use that I got a little carried away.</li>
            <li>Only downside (minor) is that I can&#x27;t access the blades directly to clean them.</li>
            <li>It is much better in hard to shave areas</li>
            <li>Although it took a little longer than usual and some irritation because it was the first time, I quite liked the result.</li>
            <li>In my opinion this shaver is hard to beat for a close, fast, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Bears Old Spice and Braun testament to quality.</li>
            <li>Still scratching my head on why the Old Spice branded version is cheaper</li>
            <li>The feel of this product is solid, the shave surpasses any electric shaver I&#x27;ve used, the ease of cleaning is spot on and what has really blown me away is the battery life.</li>
            <li>I now shave with a blade when I want that baby soft face, but this shaver is my go to shaver.  </li>
            <li>My only real disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>* Makes you feel manly while having baby soft</li>
            <li>Baby soft furlessness all over.</li>
            <li>Just saw this Old Spice Braun shaver on Deal and ordered one.</li>
            <li>This was to replace my old shaver which is identical.</li>
            <li>I know there have been some cons, but the pros far outweigh the cons here.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if Old Spice pays Braun for the advertising or vice-versa, but the consumer makes out on this one.</li>
            <li>Always thought of deodorant when it came to old spice.</li>
            <li>Then I was looking at Braun series 3 shavers and I came across with the Old Spice one.</li>
            <li>My husband had an old shaver that was falling apart.</li>
            <li>I used it yesterday and today I am still absent any wild hairs on chins and peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>He has sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not cheap or light.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant that Old Spice branded a shaver, but was pleasantly surprised by how well it performed.  </li>
            <li>Seeing this Old Spice branded unit made by Braun...and at this price...</li>
            <li>the cover and charger have held up well so far (couple of months).</li>
            <li>I knew I was taking a chance buying something called an \\&quot;Old Spice Shaver,\\</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>Only two brands -- Norelco and Braun -- have ever been given me a reasonable shave.</li>
            <li>However, the convenience presented by this shaver makes it my first choice unless I have let my stubble get too long.</li>
            <li>and then im going to go buy another old spice electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Before receiving the Old Spice Shaver I had been using a Norelco Electric Shaver.</li>
            <li>The Old Spice Shaver whacks any strays hairs on my face with ease.</li>
            <li>This shaver gives me a reasonable shave, although when I was younger and had a heavier beard, I might have needed a 5 o&#x27;clock touchup.</li>
            <li>i do wish it came with a soft travel case though...</li>
            <li>Overall this is a GOOD shaver, not a GREAT one.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I was unable to get a good shave from this razor.</li>
            <li>little clippers are only marginally useful, but fine for a minor trim on the sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only do I personally prefer the clean shave I get from a razor, but it is almost a requirement because if I don&#x27;t show up looking &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; at work I will most likely not be taken seriously.</li>
            <li>Not like my old panosonic used the panosonic for 12 years it finally got dull, this one is functional for the money but wish I had got a bit better function type.</li>
            <li>Definitely true what others have said, after buying more expensive ons and then using this one, I wonder why I thought expensive is better.</li>
            <li>If you need a premium shaver, this would be the one you put in your travel kit that won&#x27;t break your heart if you lose it, and yet be good enough you can leave the expensive one at home.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin and shave daily.</li>
            <li>I would DEFINITELY recommend it for someone with Rosacea and very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It very much exceeded my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;However in my case the long whiskers of my mustache required the pop up trimmer to knock it down and the foils cleaned it up very nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually just tap it out once or twice during  a shave and use the brush once a week to clean it out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim given it was cheaper to get a new razor than it was to replace parts for my old one (which also doesnt stay charged for very long now).</li>
            <li>/&gt;The absolute only con that I would have is that when I first used the razor, it left black markings all over my face.</li>
            <li>now Im clean for work everyday with no red bumps!  </li>
            <li>I usually only need two or three passes over an area before it&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li>I have relatively sensitive skin and would often get razor burn when using regular razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the shaver 3 times so far</li>
            <li>Bought this after a considerable number of different products reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had very low expectations for this product, and was pleasantly surprised by the weight/feel, durability.</li>
            <li>The Old Spice Shaver is now my daily shaver.</li>
            <li>in all, I definitely recommend this shaver highly and especially for younger men just beginning to develop a beard.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>and I have to be very careful when setting it down that the charging light remains lit.</li>
            <li>His other razor gave a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>This shaver costs as much as replacement blades for any other shaver.  </li>
            <li>Called Braun and was assured this was the same as a Series 3, but made especially for Old Spice.  </li>
            <li>With the Old Spice Shaver I can shave in my room because it is quiet enough that it won&#x27;t wake him up.</li>
            <li>So far, no luck finding a replacement foil for much less than the price of a new razor.</li>
            <li>With shaving so much is a personal opinion based primarily on your type of beard and your overall expectations and previous experience with other shavers.</li>
            <li>I bought the blue one from braun at $80 and then decided to buy this one to see if its the same and its exactly the same product for $40 dollars less.  </li>
            <li>it was the old style single foil palm sized simplest of the lineup shaver.</li>
            <li>I wish they still made that old corded single foil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The push out trimmer works well for side burns, but is a little too large for precision work.</li>
            <li>Some slight irritation but went over my whole face several times.</li>
            <li>This is exactly the same as the more expensive standard Braun branded 320s-4 but only in red and black</li>
            <li>The razor shaving is not a good clean</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Incredible Performance, Incredible Value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Braun&#x27;s 7 Series Top of the line version.</li>
            <li> The battery life on this electric razor is amazing!</li>
            <li> This shaver is amazing!</li>
            <li> became a great good surprise.</li>
            <li> but I have been very impressed and don&#x27;t think you could buy a better shaver for this price.</li>

            <li> good product, a pleasant purchase</li>
            <li> This has been the best by far the best electric shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Well, I had great hopes for this shaver since most of these reviews are great.</li>
            <li> Great value and works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> and it does a damn good job.</li>
            <li> I bought this one to try it because I thought it was a good value and</li>
            <li> Good products at affordable prices</li>
            <li> Good product, thank you.</li>
            <li> though it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, it gives me a good looking shave with no discomfort.  </li>
            <li> I also have Panasonic shavers and they are good as well</li>
            <li> All the others did a good job.</li>
            <li> is a good shaver, that I will continue to use, but for the price, I&#x27;d like the precision trimmer to be a bit</li>
            <li> It really is a good product.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as good as I was hoping it would be.</li>
            <li> When it is good, it is good, but when it doesn&#x27;t work it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> good razor at good price</li>
            <li> My husband loved it really good price compared to retail stores saves couple $$$$</li>
            <li> Amazingly good product.</li>
            <li> and so is my face, but for the $35 price point, I&#x27;m gonna say this is a fair deal.</li>
            <li> give it four stars for being a good value.</li>
            <li> good quality.</li>
            <li> how supremely good it is.</li>
            <li> Have always had Brauns and loved them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a good razor for a bargain price.</li>
            <li> He loved it.  </li>
            <li> in all it is a good product.</li>
            <li> otherwise it&#x27;s a good razor.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> He totally loved it.</li>
            <li> the price was so good.  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for a good electric razor that doesn&#x27;t have a ton of garbage you don&#x27;t need or want and stil</li>
            <li> gives you a good shave</li>
            <li> This shaver had good ratings for a good price</li>

            <li> Best razor I have ever owned and it was priced right!</li>
            <li> Just used it on his full head of hair and it shaved it all off perfectly great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for one, two, or even three days of stubble (depending on how quickly you grow beard hair).</li>
            <li> so I was very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It is a great bargain and I am glad I gave it a chance.</li>
            <li> Good performance , amazing price</li>
            <li> Great Shaver!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Braun &amp;#34;Series 3&amp;#34; shavers for many years.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> It would cost more to use blades for a year!.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver and over all I&#x27;m really happy about the product !</li>
            <li> Very nice, I like it very much!Very good use!</li>
            <li> Great value and easy for a traveler to pack</li>
            <li> Great comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice packaged and well looked.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give a close shave, but still nice.</li>
            <li> liked this feature because I have a goatee</li>
            <li> so nice I bought it twice</li>
            <li> I already own a Braun branded model that happed to have a busted retractable trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have shaved with an electric razor for many years and thought the brand I had been using was really good until I used this one.  </li>
            <li> better than the Remington that I was using .Smooth shave and good battery life.</li>
            <li> My husband liked using it.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t see what I am doing) and liked the idea that the shaver could still be operated while plugged in if needed.</li>
            <li> and it gives a nice, close shave.  </li>
            <li> He says he likes it, but he needs more training to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> Okay, I knew if Braun made it then it had to be a good product.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and is reasonably kind to my face, but it&#x27;s not an improvement to what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> It shaved closer than the Norelco that I used to own.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son and he really likes it, Braun razors are the best.</li>
            <li> Powerful, shaving is very clean, color is also very beautiful</li>
            <li> This particular one has the best foil and cutter arrangement ever.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Very good shaver get a close shave every time easy to clean.</li>
            <li> They have been very, very good, and this one branded with the Old Spice name is yet another winner; good run time between charges, trimmer, water cleanup, and of course, close shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;mvVery impressed would recommend to anyone looking for new shaver.</li>
            <li> This however the stylish and modern design makes it an excellent paper weight.</li>
            <li> Good looking and easy to charge and use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to grip and feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li> I used to use Philips Shaves and this is the first time to use the Braun one,very good!</li>
            <li> love it love how close u may shave looks like u use razor on your face, how close the shave it!  </li>
            <li> popped this Old Spice shaver made by Braun, It&#x27;s the best bargin going.</li>
            <li> by far the best shaver i have ever used</li>
            <li> Have been shaving with Fusion for so many years and nice to have a switch to a quality electric--</li>
            <li> and (3) It seemed to have the most enthusiastic reviews of any shaver.</li>
            <li> Buy cheap and well used to that good</li>
            <li> but I do use it every day to keep the stubble away and for that, the Old Spice Shaver is perfect.</li>
            <li> works great ,easy to clean and does a nice close shave,</li>
            <li> The screens are very fine</li>
            <li> As someone who is not hell-bent on obtaining the best shave possibly on a daily basis, this shaver is amazing.</li>
            <li> Use a nice shaving gel on your face and you will have the most comfortable and closet shave ever!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a very light beard and need to do 20 passes to cut any hair.</li>
            <li> But the operation is very smooth, albeit a bit</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Very cheap quality.</li>
            <li> received it quickly and just as promised it shaves as good as my Norelco.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to clean, and again, amazing.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a shower shaver, but it may be safely cleaned under running water.  </li>
            <li> but that is more out of habit than the being out of the capability of the trimmer portion of this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many shaving systems over the years.  </li>
            <li> Logistics fast, shaver great.</li>
            <li> The most inexpensive Norelco razor shaves much better than this.</li>
            <li> Could they have rigged that many?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure of</li>
            <li> OK.  </li>
            <li> My brother is enjoying this product...</li>
            <li> its just ok</li>
            <li> He says it&#x27;s better than the one it replaced -- this coming from a man who hates change.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t cost much more than the cutter and screen refill</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s better than my Series 5.  </li>
            <li> top of that, the results were uneven.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in love with the charging cord.</li>
            <li> so it was more of a &amp;#34;shadow-stubble)</li>
            <li> the better the results.</li>
            <li> The shave wasn&#x27;t all the close but better then most electric shavers.</li>
            <li> Overall it was ok but not the best shaver that I has use.</li>
            <li> Most of my brauns lasted years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> product is an outstanding value.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine they are that much better than this one.</li>
            <li> It works more often than not.</li>
            <li> Does not make your face smooth!</li>
            <li> Just make sure to shave every morning.</li>
            <li> it can be better but for the price you can not ask for more, sometimes It leaves some hairs.</li>
            <li> My fisrt electric shaver no cuts on my face perfect í definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> Now love to body electric razor.  </li>
            <li> haves better than Norelco, Braun and Remington shavers</li>
            <li> it is nice and works great so far</li>
            <li> The corded Braun that my wife gave me 22 years ago got dropped one too many times.</li>
            <li> It outperforms or equals the top of the line 7 series</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best razor he has had for shaving as well as cleaning.  </li>
            <li> One of the better electric shavers.</li>
            <li> He is very much satisfied.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic!</li>
            <li> It provides a really close shave and just feels great to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li> I was able to rinse it off in shower, and</li>
            <li> Compared to the Norelco, I get 3 to 5 more shaves with the Braun.</li>
            <li> &quot; but I&#x27;m, glad I did.</li>
            <li> This is simply the very best electric razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I recommend this for people that need to shave only not trim because this is more of a shaver than trimmer, but I love the Precision trimmer it is great for the sideburns!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> If I had more experience with this, I probably would have known to look for this.</li>
            <li> Use feels good, is worth buying</li>
            <li> I love that you can use it cordless or while plugged in.</li>
            <li> aside from the ginormus a/c plug sticking out of the socket, i love this shaver...</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Considering the price of most electric shavers not to mention the cost of razors now days this shaver is a deal.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good,maybe I should buy a better one in Braun........</li>
            <li> Overall, this is the best electric shaver I have owned and I have owned many.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Way better than I dreamed it would be.</li>
            <li> This one got good reviews and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> works good and priced right</li>
            <li> So it is a good idea to wash it right after opening.</li>
            <li> main part of it works wonderfully, but the feature that was intriguing was the pop up precision trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great shaver at a decent price.</li>
            <li> -wise, light and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t showed any signs of wear and the battery life is pretty good.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it was very easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled after the first shave!  </li>
            <li> Red is nice,The price is very good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very cool item for me.  </li>
            <li> I have a light beard, I&#x27;m retire and don&#x27;t need to shave more than once a week.</li>
            <li> He has always used razors, but is happy with the the results of the Old Spice electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I am really so happy with the Old Spice Men&#x27;s electric shaver.</li>
            <li> The Old Spice Shaver is a great shaver and I recommend it to anyone looking for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> If you are contemplating an electric shaver, or just want one for special times, gentlemen, start here!  </li>
            <li> and if you don&#x27;t have incredibly invasive facial hair, they will do the job just fine.  </li>
            <li> best advice, as with other electrics I&#x27;ve used... Shave as often as you can.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: Easy to use and maintain and gives a close shave</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> * Easy to use and maintain</li>
            <li> I bought it for my dad: lightweight and easy to manage, he says.</li>
            <li> The shaver hasn&#x27;t dulled over the course of 2 months and is easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> It is easily equivalent to a $60-100 shaver.  </li>
            <li> Makes for easy movement.  </li>
            <li> Opens and cleans easily.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend likes me to keep a clean face most of the time</li>
            <li> but i was able to use the electric shaver three days in a row, with a close enough shave to make her happy,</li>
            <li> I like how its so easy to use and how close of a cut it gives you.</li>
            <li> OK for a quick shave, good hold charge , fast recharge</li>
            <li> It is definitely a strong shaver.</li>
            <li> Braun320S-4, high performance, suitable for students or to father&#x27;s gift!</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I have ever had and that goes back to my first electric razor in 1955 and it does seem like three barbers had shaved me.</li>
            <li> I think when me and my face get used to the shaves will be fine.</li>
            <li> The machine is strong and accurate, doesn&#x27;t leave any cuts on the face, the additional trimmer is helpful</li>
            <li> He said it was the closest shave he has ever seen and so easy and comfortable.</li>
            <li> It worked fine on my mustache, and face cheeks.</li>
            <li> And it gives a super close shave too!</li>
            <li> one of the best I&#x27;ve used, close shave and the charge last a good long time</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rinsing the shaver head after use with water was very simple and easy, and worked great.</li>
            <li> It skips large patches and doesn&#x27;t have the power to be effective.</li>
            <li> This is my second foil shaver after the Braun 340s and it most certainly gives a very good shave .</li>
            <li> Shaver looks amazing,  but as far as shaving goes, I&#x27;m better off using a disposable razor from the dollar store..</li>
            <li> This is a really nice electric shaver, which achieves a reasonably close shave, feels comfortable while using it, and lasts a number of days before needing to recharge.</li>
            <li> I was enticed by the reviews I read along with a great price on the product to give electrics yet one last</li>
            <li> I get zero irritation and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> To get a smooth shave, you have to work at it for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> Overall though, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Holding the shaver is not as comfortable as I would like.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> Cheap.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shave that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> It makes his skin smooth and doesn&#x27;t cause  irritation.</li>
            <li> My face is baby smooth now.</li>
            <li> Lightly spray the cutter as it&#x27;s operating then shave before showering.&lt;br /&gt;Better</li>
            <li> They work well and your finally free of razor burn.</li>
            <li> Smooth as silk with my shaving</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Get what you pay for, cheap price, cheaper product.</li>
            <li> Incredibly smooth and no irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice shaver for day to day get ready for work shave.</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> She loves how smooth her legs feel, and so do I</li>
            <li> And even then it wasn&#x27;t getting as smooth as it use to.</li>
            <li> Before I start, I must note that I received this shaver for free to test/review.  </li>
            <li> Shave - Leaves my face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom&lt;</li>
            <li> I have had mine for almost three months and enjoy the comfortable close shave I always get.</li>
            <li> I got it free from BzzAgent</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, and works cordless or corded.</li>
            <li> Way to go Amazon for selling this dirt cheap.</li>
            <li> Works great, it cuts my facial hair.</li>
            <li> If you follow their shaving tips in the manual, and move the razor SLO-O-OWLY across your face rather than trying for a speed record, you will get a close, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Braun shaves very well and the clipper feature is effective.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as my old Norelco.  </li>
            <li> My old razor didn&#x27;t do a good job on father&#x27;s day</li>
            <li> So far, by far, this is the best electric razor I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> but then again I haven&#x27;t had a good pop up trimmer since my old Norelco razor in 1969.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is super easy for him to use and it is easy clean up.</li>
            <li> Braun normal has a great product not so much this time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap electric razor that holds a charge for a long time and does a great job shaving.</li>
            <li> It charges right up, has a helpful LED, is easy to hold on to, easy to clean,...</li>
            <li> On the one hand I was happy to see this, but I was very leery about the new style shape and the triple foil.</li>
            <li> my first time using this brand,  haven&#x27;t used electric razor in many years,  </li>
            <li> Even around the edges of my mouth , I wasn&#x27;t sure at first</li>
            <li> I was actually excited when I saw this when I received it; however, the cut it gives is inconsistent.</li>
            <li> I love the colour so much !</li>
            <li> I was impressed with how close the shaver did shave, It wasnt quite as close as a conventional razor but pretty close.</li>
            <li> No problem, even not too clean</li>
            <li> Also clean your razor after every use.</li>
            <li> I have to use a blade razor to clean up that area.  </li>
            <li> beautiful shape and easy to use, a little bit noisy&lt;</li>
            <li> but it certainly shaves better.</li>
            <li> Thankfully I was right!</li>
            <li> I expected it to, as it would have been a great time saver.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> yet this is a true wet/dry razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Philips Norelco for last 2 years and it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> Want a good shave use a regular razor!</li>
            <li> The shave is only fair.  </li>
            <li> I am debating buying a second one of these as back-up because the price is so good.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise, it gave me a closer shave than the rotaries, and it&#x27;s the only one of the three that did a good job on my neck.</li>
            <li> Probably a reasonable shave for most men.</li>
            <li> Ergonomics are good, it&#x27;s relatively quiet, and shaves close with no irritation.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving it one star is because the product design and material quality was good.</li>
            <li> Nice look of Old Spice style too.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> This this is super nice, it gives me a really close shave, and it is very gentle on the skin, I have not had it pull any hairs.</li>
            <li> Has good battery and quick enough charge but will not cut hair.</li>
            <li> I used a Braun 7000 for about 10 years and it was great, but the replacement blades offered now don&#x27;t really fit well, and I got a few cuts.  </li>
            <li> I take this on trips ... and the shave it gives is adequate ...</li>
            <li> Came quick.....</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Charges quick and lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaver, I have no painful hair pulling at all and finish shaving in half the time as my old norelco.</li>
            <li> mistake most new electric razor users make is not using a lubricant before each shave.</li>
            <li> Most razors when new blades are needed can be bought separately from the foil.</li>
            <li> The shave itself was smoother and closer than expected (not to mention way quieter), which was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> Because it is easy to use, He is very satisfy with this gift.</li>
            <li> it really leaves your face very smooth; much smoother than my series 3 Braun.  </li>
            <li> Really close shave, feels comfortable on my face.</li>
            <li> a lot works great even after a few days beard</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I recommend that you read the directions carefully and follow the tips of a good shave.</li>
            <li> WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li> Just so so; but it worth the money.</li>
            <li> I thought about the lack of wet/dry feature but opted for this since I rarely shaved in the shower anyway</li>
            <li> useful and convenient.</li>
            <li> useful and cheap, with lovely red handle.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this product and it actually a leaves a more smoother skin and also it last more days without recharging</li>
            <li> It is powerful and gives a comfortable and reasonably close shave.</li>
            <li> Well worth the one time investment.</li>
            <li> Norelco said they no longer had repair services and replacement heads were either no longer available or cost more than several shavers!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I used this product every morning to shave my stubble down, and it worked great for the first 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> And gets hot quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any water to clean it, just a cheap barber&#x27;s brush that came with an old set of hair clippers I had.  </li>
            <li> It performs adequately but not at the superior level that previous reviews indicated.  </li>
            <li> The thing I love about this is it is Gluten free and can be used as a door stop if you tie a big rock to it first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna go shave right now (&lt;;</li>
            <li> I received the shaver, and tried it right away.</li>
            <li> Vibration amplitude is larger than the Philips，In flat areas suitable for shaving，Rounded chin shaving foil is better fit</li>
            <li> It is a true testimony to the quality of the razor when it cuts better than a disposable or regular hand razor/shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The long hair trimmer was a good idea, but didn&#x27;t do much when I tried to cleaning up my sideburns.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap and quality razor, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Overall I love this shaver and definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a nice one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Functional with both trimming up with a goatee or dealing with daily stubble, this Braun performs very well without catching, pulling or leaving my face destroyed.  </li>
            <li> Received few days back and am impressed well with it&#x27;s features and performance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I thought it had done a really good job until I used the Old Spice razor the next day.  </li>
            <li> It is the only electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used on my whole face that gave me an amazing shave without have to go over areas over and over and over.</li>
            <li> Very simple design, easy  to use, clean and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I love the Old Spice Men&#x27;s Shaver, powered by Braun, it really get the job done</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem any better than my old razer, but no worse.  </li>
            <li> A great buy for a usually more expensive Bruan.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable and the battery seems to last forever.</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable to hold and quiet.  </li>
            <li> I would love k other place as these so cheap.</li>
            <li> I am very surprised at the quality and close shave !!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Holds charge exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> This is my first Braun razor purchase after using Norelco for 20+ years.</li>
            <li> but I am relieved that I tried one on myself first and saved myself the embarrassment.</li>
            <li> My review comes from after the first use.</li>
            <li> Very close shave!</li>
            <li> At the end of the day I&#x27;m left with many cuts and patches of hair still on my face.. Will NOT recommend</li>
            <li> Although I checked it out and gave it the first charge, I did not use it.</li>
            <li> nice shaver but shaver does not give you as close a shave as you would have expected.</li>
            <li> The smooth shave was close, but did not cause any ingrown hairs or skin irritation--and I have pretty sensitive</li>
            <li> pretty easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First time out with this shaver today.  </li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I have owned in 30 years of shaving.  </li>
            <li> I believe that it actually shaved better and closer than the multi-blade and lasted longer to boot.  </li>
            <li> Well this is much better balanced than the one I had several years ago, and lighter too, but still feeling well made.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> ;-)  </li>
            <li> This one is better than my last!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Ok so this is my second shaver I have owned in my lifetime</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 20) and the first one was bought at a garage sale, (although it too was Braun)</li>
            <li> It does a nice job at getting longer and short hair with a smooth overall shave.  </li>
            <li> Traditional spin type more effeciency</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s pretty and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Since then, I have been only mildly satisfied.</li>
            <li> When I saw the Old Spice version of the razor advertised and noticed the fabulous price on Amazon, I decided to give Braun another chance.</li>
            <li> it really can be used for allot of stuff!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and the battery charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> received the Old Spice Shaver from BuzzFeed for free at the end of January and have been using it for almost two months now.</li>
            <li> I use the slide-out trimmer to take a first pass in that case, followed by using the foil cutters.  </li>
            <li> Its his first electric shaver</li>
            <li> The battery, so far, keeps a good charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been one to use a blade razor and use an electric only for my mustache area, light trimming or head errant hairs, and for a quick refresh on days I don&#x27;t feel like shaving.</li>
            <li> To start the shaver is built very sturdy and it feels right in my hand</li>
            <li> The unique thing is that it has a clipper on the back side which is cool.</li>
            <li> I saw this on Amazon, and bought it because of the Braun quality and all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> The battery holds its charge for a long time, many shaves.</li>
            <li> He fully charged the shaver once we received it, since then two weeks passed, and battery is still full WOW.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have any experience in the Old Spice Shaver taming a full beard</li>
            <li> Works well, a little weight, not so clean, but cheap and useful.</li>
            <li> The shave is very close on flat areas and good enough around the jawbone.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much else positive about it.</li>
            <li> It works great on the cheeks, but on the jawline and especially the neck it wouldn&#x27;t catch the hairs, and I would have to go back with a wet razor to clean up the rest.</li>
            <li> Shaving is very clean, but need long time.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and only shave several times a week this is a good shaver, BUT of course does not give the same clean feel that a razor does.</li>
            <li> Value really, really cheap, as a Chinese people see things that are made in China in the United States is much cheaper than China so much, really very helpless!</li>
            <li> This is a great Braun shaver for a half of the regualr cost of the same model.</li>
            <li> Great shaver without being super expensive like Braun or the others.  </li>
            <li> This would be good for those first starting to shave, not a 31 year old man who needs to shave daily or will grow a beard.</li>
            <li> you consider the very high quality construction of this razor.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s a nice little shaver.</li>
            <li> A nice little shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use an electric razor regularly, I just wanted a cheap one for days that I&#x27;m rushing and really don&#x27;t feel like shaving with blades/cream.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a built in side burn trimmer, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well at all.</li>
            <li> Although initially the shave is smooth, but the end of the day his face is course like sandpaper.</li>
            <li> You will find it really really quite when not turned on</li>
            <li> The rotary blades of Norelco cut much closer &amp; smoother than this Braun.</li>
            <li> It shaves close and fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving electric for years, but have never spend much money on a razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Charging the razor was fast, and no complaints about battery life.</li>
            <li> Really amazed by this product.  </li>
            <li> and you get a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> Works better than expected</li>
            <li> Although it does not get the job done as well as I like, it does get the job done, but in a much longer time.</li>
            <li> The battery also holds a charge very well.</li>
            <li> Gave him a very close shave</li>
            <li> works very well as it was a gift for my brother bear</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in the break-in period and have found it much better than expected.  </li>
            <li> High praise!</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s very picky about shavers.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> Great price, poor expectations.  </li>
            <li> Very close shave.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend a C-note, then find out you don&#x27;t like the whole experience.</li>
            <li> Shaves very well- really fast and close shaves.  </li>
            <li> the price, which makes it a real bargain.  </li>
            <li> then that, the price is really reasonable</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this if you&#x27;re looking to upgrade or replace!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver!</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> For this price range, you absolutely cannot beat the quality of this electric razor.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone who wants a screen shaver.</li>
            <li> It takes me about five minutes to do my whole face.</li>
            <li> and I really like this shaver</li>
            <li> Should really be 0 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had much luck with electric razors, so your milage may vary.</li>
            <li> so I thought why not just replace the whole razor.  </li>
            <li> It works reasonably well -</li>
            <li> The charging time is fast.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a reasonably priced shaver to replace a Norelco that quit working.  </li>
            <li> nice,i like it so much.</li>
            <li> reasonably priced razor and works well.</li>
            <li> When my old Braun began to show its age several years ago, I bought the latest Norelco on the market.</li>
            <li> that doesn&#x27;t leave a fair number of it&#x27;s purchasers unhappy, so I have no idea if there are better options.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m done I remove the head, tap it on the edge of my garbage can, and it&#x27;s clean and ready to go for next time.</li>
            <li> Better than expected!</li>
            <li> I only replaced them because I wanted a new one.&lt;br /&gt;You can spend much more, but you won&#x27;t necessarily get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> After having this shaver for several weeks now, I am happy to report that I have finally found a shaver capable of effectively dealing with my thick facial hair.  </li>
            <li> not near as close of a shave or as comfortable as my three head Norelco but for the price.  </li>
            <li> It sticks out pretty far and, when plugged in, can get knocked or fall out of the socket</li>
            <li> The first time I used this model Braun, I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of use and the close shave I got.</li>
            <li> plus, it looks so cool with the red.</li>
            <li> I was using a regular non electric razor since my other electric razor was not doing the job( and never did as well this old spice on a good day}.</li>
            <li> so far so good, but due to my prior ingrown issues it takes some time to work on the neck area which causes irritation.</li>
            <li> As a new year gift for my father,It;s really cheaper than that sold in china.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good shaver as a gift for my wife, most woman&#x27;s shavers have bad ratings</li>
            <li> This takes the place of an older version my husband uses.</li>
            <li> It charges quickly and holds power for over a week with daily use.</li>
            <li> The razor doesn&#x27;t do particularly well with the longer, softer hair on the neck.  </li>
            <li> Close shave, only mild irritation on my neck (Adam&#x27;s apple).</li>
            <li> I like old spice after shave and expected better from them.  </li>
            <li> Overall a decent deal that you will not regret!!!</li>
            <li> i REALLY like the Old Spice Men&#x27;s Shaver!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quality shaver that doesn&#x27;t cost $150+.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product gives high performance for its price.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend .</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Norelco rotary shavers in the past, but decided to take a chance on this razor after reading so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> And the fact that it is Old Spice branded instead of Remington makes it significantly cheaper than the same razor with the Remington brand.</li>
            <li> the plus side, the battery lasts a really long time, a feature I havent found on other shavers, and it was REALLY easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Little did I know it became my favorite shaver.</li>
            <li> I prefer to clean the blades directly with a brush but no big deal</li>
            <li> It takes much time to shave completely.</li>
            <li> I no longer wet shave, as I use this with the Remington face saver and it gives a convenient, close and comfortable shave .</li>
            <li> and normally I have to use a separate shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> None lasted more than a few months.</li>
            <li> My first Braun powered shaver, but using standard blade is much easier and faster.</li>
            <li> i can never seem to find normal batterys when i need them.</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard, so three days is kind of pushing it</li>
            <li> I recently replaced my Norelco (the kind with 3 round heads) and I&#x27;m really digging this Old Spice shaver.</li>
            <li> Stay far away from this product, spend a little more and get a quality razor.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone looking for a new razor.</li>
            <li> I live in a dorm room with a roommate</li>
            <li> The additional little trimmer is very cool for things like side burns and whatever the heck else</li>
            <li> I get the same smooth shave in the same amount of time as blades without the cuts, burning, expense and hassle of replenishing blades.  </li>
            <li> It shaves very close, much closer than my $160 Philips Norelco Arcitec that recently died.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a fan of the red color, and also it should be more heavy-duty</li>
            <li> So this razor might be good for some people, but if you have thick facial hair, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> But even before I broke it I was using the old corded single foil to clean up the stuff that the fancy triple foil coudn&#x27;t seem to pick up.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for ONE MONTH on my first initial charge.</li>
            <li> Not being able to shave on a regular basis due to being on the road alot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It won&#x27;t give you nearly as close of a shave as a normal razor</li>
            <li> looks like Braun finally went back to using better or larger batteries.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first electric razor that actually takes care of the chin hairs and peach fuzz on face and lip area.  </li>
            <li> Amazon, Old Spice, and Braun have it together!</li>
            <li> In conclusion I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes electric shavers or is interested in trying one out, in fact i have been telling every one with i beard that i know about it and</li>
            <li> THANK YOU BRAUN AND OLD SPICE!</li>
            <li> My 12 year old Rem rotary still cuts closer than this new one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slightly above average electric shaver, what more</li>
            <li> It is far superior to any other electric razor I have ever used, closely approaching the results of wet shaving -- but not quite there yet.</li>
            <li> Its so comfortable to use that I got a little carried away.</li>
            <li> Only downside (minor) is that I can&#x27;t access the blades directly to clean them.</li>
            <li> It is much better in hard to shave areas</li>
            <li> Although it took a little longer than usual and some irritation because it was the first time, I quite liked the result.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this shaver is hard to beat for a close, fast, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Bears Old Spice and Braun testament to quality.</li>
            <li> Still scratching my head on why the Old Spice branded version is cheaper</li>
            <li> The feel of this product is solid, the shave surpasses any electric shaver I&#x27;ve used, the ease of cleaning is spot on and what has really blown me away is the battery life.</li>
            <li> I now shave with a blade when I want that baby soft face, but this shaver is my go to shaver.  </li>
            <li> My only real disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> * Makes you feel manly while having baby soft</li>
            <li> Baby soft furlessness all over.</li>
            <li> Just saw this Old Spice Braun shaver on Deal and ordered one.</li>
            <li> This was to replace my old shaver which is identical.</li>
            <li> I know there have been some cons, but the pros far outweigh the cons here.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if Old Spice pays Braun for the advertising or vice-versa, but the consumer makes out on this one.</li>
            <li> Always thought of deodorant when it came to old spice.</li>
            <li> Then I was looking at Braun series 3 shavers and I came across with the Old Spice one.</li>
            <li> My husband had an old shaver that was falling apart.</li>
            <li> I used it yesterday and today I am still absent any wild hairs on chins and peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> He has sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not cheap or light.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant that Old Spice branded a shaver, but was pleasantly surprised by how well it performed.  </li>
            <li> Seeing this Old Spice branded unit made by Braun...and at this price...</li>
            <li> the cover and charger have held up well so far (couple of months).</li>
            <li> I knew I was taking a chance buying something called an \\&quot;Old Spice Shaver,\\</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> Only two brands -- Norelco and Braun -- have ever been given me a reasonable shave.</li>
            <li> However, the convenience presented by this shaver makes it my first choice unless I have let my stubble get too long.</li>
            <li> and then im going to go buy another old spice electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Before receiving the Old Spice Shaver I had been using a Norelco Electric Shaver.</li>
            <li> The Old Spice Shaver whacks any strays hairs on my face with ease.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives me a reasonable shave, although when I was younger and had a heavier beard, I might have needed a 5 o&#x27;clock touchup.</li>
            <li> i do wish it came with a soft travel case though...</li>
            <li> Overall this is a GOOD shaver, not a GREAT one.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I was unable to get a good shave from this razor.</li>
            <li> little clippers are only marginally useful, but fine for a minor trim on the sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only do I personally prefer the clean shave I get from a razor, but it is almost a requirement because if I don&#x27;t show up looking &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; at work I will most likely not be taken seriously.</li>
            <li> Not like my old panosonic used the panosonic for 12 years it finally got dull, this one is functional for the money but wish I had got a bit better function type.</li>
            <li> Definitely true what others have said, after buying more expensive ons and then using this one, I wonder why I thought expensive is better.</li>
            <li> If you need a premium shaver, this would be the one you put in your travel kit that won&#x27;t break your heart if you lose it, and yet be good enough you can leave the expensive one at home.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin and shave daily.</li>
            <li> I would DEFINITELY recommend it for someone with Rosacea and very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It very much exceeded my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;However in my case the long whiskers of my mustache required the pop up trimmer to knock it down and the foils cleaned it up very nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually just tap it out once or twice during  a shave and use the brush once a week to clean it out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim given it was cheaper to get a new razor than it was to replace parts for my old one (which also doesnt stay charged for very long now).</li>
            <li> /&gt;The absolute only con that I would have is that when I first used the razor, it left black markings all over my face.</li>
            <li> now Im clean for work everyday with no red bumps!  </li>
            <li> I usually only need two or three passes over an area before it&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li> I have relatively sensitive skin and would often get razor burn when using regular razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the shaver 3 times so far</li>
            <li> Bought this after a considerable number of different products reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had very low expectations for this product, and was pleasantly surprised by the weight/feel, durability.</li>
            <li> The Old Spice Shaver is now my daily shaver.</li>
            <li> in all, I definitely recommend this shaver highly and especially for younger men just beginning to develop a beard.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> and I have to be very careful when setting it down that the charging light remains lit.</li>
            <li> His other razor gave a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver costs as much as replacement blades for any other shaver.  </li>
            <li> Called Braun and was assured this was the same as a Series 3, but made especially for Old Spice.  </li>
            <li> With the Old Spice Shaver I can shave in my room because it is quiet enough that it won&#x27;t wake him up.</li>
            <li> So far, no luck finding a replacement foil for much less than the price of a new razor.</li>
            <li> With shaving so much is a personal opinion based primarily on your type of beard and your overall expectations and previous experience with other shavers.</li>
            <li> I bought the blue one from braun at $80 and then decided to buy this one to see if its the same and its exactly the same product for $40 dollars less.  </li>
            <li> it was the old style single foil palm sized simplest of the lineup shaver.</li>
            <li> I wish they still made that old corded single foil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The push out trimmer works well for side burns, but is a little too large for precision work.</li>
            <li> Some slight irritation but went over my whole face several times.</li>
            <li> This is exactly the same as the more expensive standard Braun branded 320s-4 but only in red and black</li>
            <li> The razor shaving is not a good clean</li>
            <li> I was originally going to replace the heads on my Norelco Sensotouch 3D as the stupid light was flashing on it to let me know that I should replace the heads.  </li>
            <li> Bought this one over their other ones since this old spice one was cheaper with the same features.  </li>
            <li> I used it every other day with no trouble.  </li>
            <li> Treat it as such and it will last long.</li>
            <li> However, I find shaving with it takes a bit longer, particularly because it has trouble getting along the sideburns and jaw line area.</li>
            <li> As soon as my beard was long enough to shave, I tackled it with my Braun.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t say if it will keep a close shave in the long run since I just got it last week.</li>
            <li> The only difference is that its red and the other one its blue, it can even use the same blade number.  </li>
            <li> As long as this thing keeps working, I will not go back to blades ever again.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;ve been using it for  month, which is long enough for a preliminary  opinion.</li>
            <li> Hoping it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> The warranty is for 2 years, mine lasted barely 4 months with minimal usage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this razor received a single positive review.</li>
            <li> I only shave electric when I have to shave dry or am out of blades for the moment...</li>
            <li> Tried shaving with the grain, against the grain, side of the grain, wet, dry, quick, and slow.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this razor allows me to shave everyday as apposed to twice a week.</li>
            <li> The shave is consistent with other foil shavers I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and lets you know when to recharge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did not take long to get accustomed to using it.  </li>
            <li> What a strange marketing decision.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The red color is about the same color as other red things which means it can go in any room or even in a Green Dodge Mustang for that long road trip.</li>
            <li> I see other similar shavers in stores for $100</li>
            <li> I never faced any problem on shaving above neck as other users reported.</li>
            <li> Quiet compared to other shavers I used over the years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure why the old spice logo is on it, but if it made it less expensive, then all the better.</li>
            <li> I am rather ancient and have used a wide variety of electric razors over the years, mostly with disappointing results.</li>
            <li> Despite the gratuitous &amp;#34;Old Spice&amp;#34; packaging of the product, even non-users of Old Spice products will find much to appreciate in this Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> It left hairs and I had to press really hard, and go over same spots several times to get it.</li>
            <li> I had to shave over the same spot at least 20 times to get all the hair which left my skin visibly red &amp; irritated.</li>
            <li> Also the triple rotating circular blades are not useful to maintain French Beard.</li>
            <li> (w/ a small old spice logo).</li>
            <li> but it has a trimmer built in, I used the trimmer to knock down the volume of my facial hair and then used the head to get as close a shave as I could.</li>
            <li> As far as other attributes it&#x27;s hard to comment for such sort useage.</li>
            <li> Same as the Braun version, but much less $$$.</li>
            <li> but if you are careful you can still get it done.  </li>
            <li> The shaver blades are so wide and flexible/adjustable.</li>
            <li> Not much to explain here, bought this for the bang for buck.</li>
            <li> And after 40 you start getting a few chin hairs and then they become too numerous to pluck.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s basically the same as an existing Braun model, but this was a few bucks cheaper.</li>
            <li> The connection of the charger cord to the shaver is very loose</li>
            <li> I guess that is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> May not work out as I had expected.  </li>
            <li> I alternate between this and a Norelco rotary every few months.  </li>
            <li> It seemed as though the blades were starting to get dull because it was taking several pass overs to shave down the hair.</li>
            <li> it was missing whiskers that were laying flat.</li>
            <li> I have tried NUMEROUS shavers in the past, including three head, pivoting, etc.</li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> It does not cut as close as other razors</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend after reading the reviews from other user as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well.</li>
            <li> No thanks razor and shaving cream!</li>
            <li> otherwise it other areas of my face it is an extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what product this review is for, since I was sent a regular Braun shaver, Series 5.</li>
            <li> I think that only happens when you press too hard.  </li>
            <li> If you are 1 day late from the company receiving the product you send back they WILL deny the claim.</li>
            <li> the edges , the neck region all were left with uncut patches of hair after multiple tries.</li>
            <li> This holds enough charge for me to go at least 2 weeks, and the motor can plow through 3 days of stubble without slowing down.  </li>
            <li> I can shave with my clothes on and not have rinse water running down my neck.  </li>
            <li> Braun hands down.</li>
            <li> It is less noisy than the average shaver in this price range.</li>
            <li> I use it with very thin layer of shave cream and rinse the cutter about half way thru the shave and it provides a very close shave.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic might shave me slightly closer but it will take longer.</li>
            <li> isnt a practice I will be abandoning, as the feature on this shaver is less than stellar.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It helps to shave faster (50% less time than Norelco).</li>
            <li> The razor requires so much less effort and care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d assum they have a wharhouse of these I&#x27;ve see them for less than 10 dollars.</li>
            <li> Does not require water or shaving cream, so less muss and fuss.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less noisy than the previous model, but still cuts well.  </li>
            <li> I like that its rechargeable and doesn&#x27;t require the mess of foam.</li>
            <li> and it will get relly really cold if you put it in the freezer but really really hot if you put it in the oven at 425 degrees.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, so looked and looked for the right one.  </li>
            <li> still trim some small areas with a blade (to get sharp sideburn, etc.)</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t shave for a couple of weeks it will pull a little</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after he had gone through three electric razors in a little over a year.  </li>
            <li> Shaving is not clean，I&#x27;m sorry, limited English proficiency</li>
            <li> This razor is a little heavy</li>
            <li> I have very thick facial hair and was looking for an electric razor that could handle it.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s 22 with very thick facial hair that starts growing in within a day and he think this shaver works well for him.</li>
            <li> I was getting VERY irritated constantly cutting my face despite buying the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; razor/shaving cream combo.</li>
            <li> And I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly heavy beard and shave every day.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my 93-year old father, as a replacement for a Braun shaver that finally failed to hold a charge.</li>
            <li> If you are a everyday shaver then it will probably for you.</li>
            <li> and then you will still need to go over it a few times.</li>
            <li> I have to wait for few hours to charge it and use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product to try out for a few months already.</li>
            <li> I have a five-or-six-year-old Braun I that still runs, and I used it as a backup when I had trouble with the others.  </li>
            <li> i will update this review in a few weeks once my face gets used to the shaver and see how it is doing on my neck area.</li>
            <li> but I was super disappointed when,five days after the warranty expired the pop up trimmer on my $200 shaver broke.</li>
            <li> usually just leave it plugged in while I am using it to maintain the charge (its never run out, even after a few days of not charging it.)  </li>
            <li> If you like your face raw &amp; bleeding</li>
            <li> I still prefer a manual shave, but I&#x27;ll use this 1-2x  per week when I&#x27;m too lazy for a manual shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Braun for over 15 years, and usually get a Series 5.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;triple action cutting system&amp;#34</li>
            <li> so I was not able to shave every day before having this product,</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that an electric razor could shave so close and not make my skin break out from the usual ordeal.  </li>
            <li> then then the razors that I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> but i usually have to wait three or four days to shave because of the razor burn</li>
            <li> and I usually wake up way before him.</li>
            <li> The triple action cutting system worked for a close shave everywhere on my face.</li>
            <li> This is a godsend product that is unbelievably inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not better than my Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Pop the foil head off, use the included small brush and rinse if needed.</li>
            <li> My first foil razor after years of rotary shaving, but very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Of course, I still have to work hard to shave areas like the jaw and neckline, but it is almost baby-smooth in 95% of the areas.</li>
            <li> Had a Norelco and never liked that three headed monster.</li>
            <li> After using it for awhile now I don&#x27;t think i can think of a negative about this product.</li>
            <li> but the battery lasted for at least 10 shaves before it needed recharged.</li>
            <li> this is for people that have a median beard so not to thick</li>
            <li> It shaves slowly.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the return window has closed and we&#x27;re stuck with it.&lt;br /&gt;Avoid!</li>
            <li> I have even tackled a two week growth with mine and noted that it did not bog down or fail to perform, which is something for an electric shaver on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am SICK AND TIRED of shaving the old fashioned way!</li>
            <li> not real impressed with how close a shave i get with this razor,</li>
            <li> The charge cord is a little weird in that it does protrude like some reviews suggest, but I don’t leave it plugged in, either.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, but have always been disappointed eventually after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> But it slowly got worse and worse.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in the Remington after several weeks bc</li>
            <li> Those were my last two shavers and I was disappointed in them.</li>
            <li> Having been a razor-shaver for 99.999% of my life, this was a tough decision.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that trimmer is VERY delicate.</li>
            <li> (my beard grows very slow</li>
            <li> This model is absolutely the worst razor I have ever used</li>
            <li> hate when Norelco stops in between as Low Battery.</li>
            <li> Poor shave.</li>
            <li> Poor design.</li>
            <li> Braun&#x27;s that I had purchased in the past would pick up and cut off these whiskers with the cutting bar in between the microscreen heads.</li>
            <li> This one runs slower than previous models, but I&#x27;m not convinced that&#x27;s a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> I hardly give one star reviews but the bad experience makes it a tough one.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am holding it wrong.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my husband, who is blind.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> I am sad that it didnt work as well as  </li>
            <li> then you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I went from expensive Gillette razors to this.</li>
            <li> It was awkwardly balanced and literally jumped out of my hand as I was getting used to it.</li>
            <li> I can literally shave and watch tv at the sam time without worrying about cutting myself.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a cutting edge design.</li>
            <li> Eight years ago, I had an bad experience with a Philips shaver model.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t the case for me because after using this for a couple weeks now, I have bad razor bumps and the shave is not as close to what I got from the Gilette Pro Glide Styler.</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Holy crap</li>
            <li> Very bad guest service on part of Braun</li>
            <li> This is a well packaged and well made item however it is a terrible shaver.</li>
            <li> Had a &amp;#34;W***&amp;#34; and hated it!</li>
            <li> Even on Amazon the cheapest price was $60 plus tax and the reviews were horrible</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s probably the worst shaver he&#x27;s ever used.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After having this shaver for several weeks now, I am happy to report that I have finally found a shaver capable of effectively dealing with my thick facial hair.  I have tried NUMEROUS shavers in the past, including three head, pivoting, etc. and had written off electric shavers as non-compatible with my face and beard.  I was enticed by the reviews I read along with a great price on the product to give electrics yet one last try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And boy am I happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Functional with both trimming up with a goatee or dealing with daily stubble, this Braun performs very well without catching, pulling or leaving my face destroyed.  I have even tackled a two week growth with mine and noted that it did not bog down or fail to perform, which is something for an electric shaver on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size-wise, light and easy to clean.  This is NOT a shower shaver, but it may be safely cleaned under running water.  (Difference being the immersibility of the entire unit.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds charge exactly as advertised.  The charge cord is a little weird in that it does protrude like some reviews suggest, but I don’t leave it plugged in, either.  The way the charger is designed, it may bother you if your sink is close to a wall outlet (see photo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still trim some small areas with a blade (to get sharp sideburn, etc.) but that is more out of habit than the being out of the capability of the trimmer portion of this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I’m really happy with this.  Bears Old Spice and Braun testament to quality.</li>
            <li> Still scratching my head on why the Old Spice branded version is cheaper but, I&#x27;m stoked with this purchase.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quality shaver that doesn&#x27;t cost $150+.</li>
            <li> It works great. And I use it everyday. I only have to charge once a week</li>
            <li> Great shaver for the price.  Very happy with this one.</li>
            <li> it is cheap,so i buy it.</li>
            <li> Definitely true what others have said, after buying more expensive ons and then using this one, I wonder why I thought expensive is better.</li>
            <li> As someone who is not hell-bent on obtaining the best shave possibly on a daily basis, this shaver is amazing. It&#x27;s perfect for one, two, or even three days of stubble (depending on how quickly you grow beard hair). This requires no water, no shaving cream, nothing... works just as it is and it does a damn good job. The additional little trimmer is very cool for things like side burns and whatever the heck else you might use it on... I don&#x27;t want to know. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Impressive! This shaver does not have the bells and whistles like my $200 Panasonic does but it certainly shaves better. The Braun captures hair that the Panasonic would otherwise miss. I&#x27;ve used many shaving systems over the years.  I can truly say that this one has been the closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten from an electric shaver.  I have a very sensitive skin and shave daily. The Braun has been great - I get zero irritation and smooth shave. I bought this one to try it because I thought it was a good value and the replacement foils are cheaper compared to the Panasonic. I like Panasonic but I was super disappointed when,five days after the warranty expired the pop up trimmer on my $200 shaver broke. The Braun trimmer has a different design that I believe should last longer.</li>
            <li> Incredible razor by Braun. Buy this one with confidence.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my grandson and he likes it. For the price, it&#x27;s a nice little shaver.</li>
            <li> It performs adequately but not at the superior level that previous reviews indicated.  To get a smooth shave, you have to work at it for quite a while.  It helps to use pre-electric shave lotion.</li>
            <li> This has been the best by far the best electric shaver I have ever used. I&#x27;ve owned Norelco rotary shavers in the past, but decided to take a chance on this razor after reading so many positive reviews. So happy! The feel of this product is solid, the shave surpasses any electric shaver I&#x27;ve used, the ease of cleaning is spot on and what has really blown me away is the battery life. I have a fairly heavy beard and shave every day. I have been using this razor for ONE MONTH on my first initial charge. Follow the instruction book on initial setup and hopefully you&#x27;ll get the same results. Don&#x27;t hesitate buy this unit.</li>
            <li> Very good.Logistics fast, shaver great.</li>
            <li> Nice packaged and well looked. As a new year gift for my father,It;s really cheaper than that sold in china.</li>
            <li> great price for a Braun shaver.  purchased this to take on trips.  works great</li>
            <li> Value really, really cheap, as a Chinese people see things that are made in China in the United States is much cheaper than China so much, really very helpless!</li>
            <li> for the price - what a great deal</li>
            <li> This is my first Braun razor purchase after using Norelco for 20+ years. This model is absolutely the worst razor I have ever used and it&#x27;s not even a low end Braun razor. The most inexpensive Norelco razor shaves much better than this. I had to shave over the same spot at least 20 times to get all the hair which left my skin visibly red &amp; irritated. I tried shaving my neck but gave up after about 4-5 solid minutes. I almost bought a bunch of these to give out as Christmas presents but I am relieved that I tried one on myself first and saved myself the embarrassment. I&#x27;m not sure how this razor received a single positive review. Could they have rigged that many? I don&#x27;t know but one thing I&#x27;m sure of is that I will never buy a Braun razor again.</li>
            <li> My review comes from after the first use. Eight years ago, I had an bad experience with a Philips shaver model. So with a big suspiciousness I decided to try this braun shaver and its became a great good surprise. Although it took a little longer than usual and some irritation because it was the first time, I quite liked the result. I recommend it. The four stars is because the skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Excellent value.</li>
            <li> excellent electric shaver by braun for the price works great</li>
            <li> I have relatively sensitive skin and would often get razor burn when using regular razors. This shaver however gets me just as close a shaver, but without the tacit burn. However, I find shaving with it takes a bit longer, particularly because it has trouble getting along the sideburns and jaw line area. It comes with a built in side burn trimmer, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well at all. Overall though, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I take this on trips ... and the shave it gives is adequate ... not near as close of a shave or as comfortable as my three head Norelco but for the price.  OK.  If I had make the choice again.. I will go back to Norelco.</li>
            <li> Good products at affordable prices</li>
            <li> My brother is enjoying this product...he thinks it&#x27;s to best....</li>
            <li> Very good, I like it.</li>
            <li> Same as the Braun version, but much less $$$.</li>
            <li> Not being able to shave on a regular basis due to being on the road alot. my first time using this brand,  haven&#x27;t used electric razor in many years,  it felt great to shave with out a blade.  Even around the edges of my mouth , I wasn&#x27;t sure at first then it was a charm no cuts. I would give it as a gift to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give a close shave, but still nice. I wish it shaved closer!! I gave this to my hubby for a Christmas gift thinking it was time to upgrade his shaver. Although initially the shave is smooth, but the end of the day his face is course like sandpaper. His other razor gave a much closer shave. This would be good for those first starting to shave, not a 31 year old man who needs to shave daily or will grow a beard.</li>
            <li> not real impressed with how close a shave i get with this razor, its just ok</li>
            <li> Good product, thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. I decided to give him the shaver earlier. And he loves it! Very close shave! Just used it on his full head of hair and it shaved it all off perfectly great! You will not be upset with this great of a price shaver.</li>
            <li> Great razor for price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted an electric shaver, but didn&#x27;t want to spend $150.00+ for one.  This one got good reviews and the price was right.  I&#x27;ve shaved with it 3 or 4 times in the last couple months and, though it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, it gives me a good looking shave with no discomfort.  I have a light beard, I&#x27;m retire and don&#x27;t need to shave more than once a week. Its perfect for when I&#x27;m traveling.  I like that its rechargeable and doesn&#x27;t require the mess of foam. I can shave with my clothes on and not have rinse water running down my neck.  I now shave with a blade when I want that baby soft face, but this shaver is my go to shaver.  I&#x27;ll give it a 5 star rating for its performance in the 2 months I&#x27;ve owned it. I&#x27;m gonna go shave right now (&lt;;</li>
            <li> After using Norelco and Panasonic products for years, this Braun is truly impressive. Great price, well made, works excellent.</li>
            <li> The thing I love about this is it is Gluten free and can be used as a door stop if you tie a big rock to it first. The red color is about the same color as other red things which means it can go in any room or even in a Green Dodge Mustang for that long road trip. You will find it really really quite when not turned on and it will get relly really cold if you put it in the freezer but really really hot if you put it in the oven at 425 degrees.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver that I&#x27;ve used to date.  The shave is very close on flat areas and good enough around the jawbone.  I still prefer a manual shave, but I&#x27;ll use this 1-2x  per week when I&#x27;m too lazy for a manual shave.  Great deal at the price point.</li>
            <li> Not as good as my old Norelco.  The rotary blades of Norelco cut much closer &amp; smoother than this Braun.</li>
            <li> Shaver looks amazing,  but as far as shaving goes, I&#x27;m better off using a disposable razor from the dollar store.. I have to go over the same spot about 20 times, and even then it doesn&#x27;t shave all the hair off. At the end of the day I&#x27;m left with many cuts and patches of hair still on my face.. Will NOT recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my 93-year old father, as a replacement for a Braun shaver that finally failed to hold a charge. Although I checked it out and gave it the first charge, I did not use it. He says it&#x27;s better than the one it replaced -- this coming from a man who hates change. * * * *UPDATE* Almost 1-year to the day of purchasing this, the foil has worn through and has to be replaced. So far, no luck finding a replacement foil for much less than the price of a new razor.</li>
            <li> nice shaver but shaver does not give you as close a shave as you would have expected. easy to clean. Holding the shaver is not as comfortable as I would like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the shaver 3 times so far but I have been very impressed and don&#x27;t think you could buy a better shaver for this price. It shaves close and fast. As far as other attributes it&#x27;s hard to comment for such sort useage. With shaving so much is a personal opinion based primarily on your type of beard and your overall expectations and previous experience with other shavers. I also have Panasonic shavers and they are good as well but this shaver is probably the best in terms of  being the best combination of speed, comfort, and closeness. The Panasonic might shave me slightly closer but it will take longer. In my opinion this shaver is hard to beat for a close, fast, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Shaving is not clean，I&#x27;m sorry, limited English proficiency</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving electric for years, but have never spend much money on a razor. All the others did a good job. This one is WONDERFUL. It&#x27;s feels good to shave with this thing, and it does a great job. Highly recommended. (Seems identical to one of the Braun 3 series shavers)</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t work well. Leave beard.</li>
            <li> Red is nice,The price is very good.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift. Seems great!</li>
            <li> This is a well packaged and well made item however it is a terrible shaver. Has good battery and quick enough charge but will not cut hair. I don&#x27;t have a very light beard and need to do 20 passes to cut any hair. Tried shaving with the grain, against the grain, side of the grain, wet, dry, quick, and slow. After 20 passes still lots of hair. This however the stylish and modern design makes it an excellent paper weight.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for me!</li>
            <li> Without any accident or falling, screen started to tear apart within ten uses. Always had cover on and in a bag. Cheap.</li>
            <li> Item works great, just as descrided. Great price</li>
            <li> Best shaver I ever had!</li>
            <li> Great razor and it doesn&#x27;t cost much more than the cutter and screen refill</li>
            <li> My first foil razor after years of rotary shaving, but very disappointing. My 12 year old Rem rotary still cuts closer than this new one. I returned it.</li>
            <li> Great shaver.  I&#x27;ve been using Braun for over 15 years, and usually get a Series 5.  I bought this (a Series 3, for travel) and it&#x27;s better than my Series 5.  It&#x27;s now my daily shaver.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I received this as part of a BuzzAgent campaign. Overall this is a GOOD shaver, not a GREAT one.&lt;br /&gt;The main part of it works wonderfully, but the feature that was intriguing was the pop up precision trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I liked this feature because I have a goatee and normally I have to use a separate shaver.&lt;br /&gt;This isnt a practice I will be abandoning, as the feature on this shaver is less than stellar.&lt;br /&gt;I had to make multiple passes on my face before I was finished.&lt;br /&gt;on top of that, the results were uneven.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good shaver, that I will continue to use, but for the price, I&#x27;d like the precision trimmer to be a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the battery lasts a really long time, a feature I havent found on other shavers, and it was REALLY easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This razor was perfect for 1-3 days of scruff. The &amp;#34;triple action cutting system&amp;#34; (as they call it) worked for a close shave everywhere on my face, including under the nose and around the chin. The smooth shave was close, but did not cause any ingrown hairs or skin irritation--and I have pretty sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinsing the shaver head after use with water was very simple and easy, and worked great. It&#x27;s designed in a way that hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck in the shaver head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging the razor was fast, and no complaints about battery life. I&#x27;m not in love with the charging cord. It sticks out pretty far and, when plugged in, can get knocked or fall out of the socket pretty easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long hair trimmer was a good idea, but didn&#x27;t do much when I tried to cleaning up my sideburns. My only real disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Easy to use and maintain and gives a close shave</li>
            <li> It really is a good product. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> my husband bought this.</li>
            <li> works good and priced right</li>
            <li> First time out with this shaver today.  Some slight irritation but went over my whole face several times. Used a pre-shave splash then shaved with this shaver. I started off today with a three day stubble after using my Gillette ($20.00 for four heads) by the way. This shaver does a superb job on the stubble (my beard grows very slow so it was more of a &amp;#34;shadow-stubble) and that&#x27;s the trick. As soon as my beard was long enough to shave, I tackled it with my Braun. It very much exceeded my expectations!&lt;br /&gt;However in my case the long whiskers of my mustache required the pop up trimmer to knock it down and the foils cleaned it up very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;So in all, I definitely recommend this shaver highly and especially for younger men just beginning to develop a beard.&lt;br /&gt;My best advice, as with other electrics I&#x27;ve used... Shave as often as you can. The shorter your beard the better the results.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the price!!!. Excellent for any price. Close shave. But I can&#x27;t say if it will keep a close shave in the long run since I just got it last week.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shave that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver you will find for the price.  I bought the blue one from braun at $80 and then decided to buy this one to see if its the same and its exactly the same product for $40 dollars less.  The only difference is that its red and the other one its blue, it can even use the same blade number.  I have really sensitive skin so I was not able to shave every day before having this product, now Im clean for work everyday with no red bumps!  Really amazed by this product.  Also, I have tried phillips norelco(think thats the name) and it didnt work, rotary electrical shavers do not do the job well.</li>
            <li> so nice I bought it twice</li>
            <li> Great shaver.  Easy to use and you get a very close shave.  I&#x27;mvVery impressed would recommend to anyone looking for new shaver.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver from buzzagent.com as part of a trial offer. It wasn&#x27;t as good as I was hoping it would be. Braun normal has a great product not so much this time. The trimmer on the back made me nervous because of were it was at. Every time I used it made me think I was hitting my beard with it. The shave wasn&#x27;t all the close but better then most electric shavers. It wont make me change all the way I will keep my pro glide. If you are a everyday shaver then it will probably for you. If you don&#x27;t shave for a couple of weeks it will pull a little and then you will still need to go over it a few times. Overall it was ok but not the best shaver that I has use.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband. He loves it. It makes his skin smooth and doesn&#x27;t cause  irritation. He fully charged the shaver once we received it, since then two weeks passed, and battery is still full WOW.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this razor allows me to shave everyday as apposed to twice a week. Plus the price is great.</li>
            <li> No problem, even not too clean</li>
            <li> I was recently given one of these and my god. It fought my man beard off like my course chin hair was nothing but air. My face is baby smooth now. If you are seeing this beautiful price of equipment then you should be buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Charges fast&lt;br /&gt;* Beats the boldest of beards&lt;br /&gt;* Easy to use and maintain&lt;br /&gt;* Makes you feel manly while having baby soft face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Its so comfortable to use that I got a little carried away. Baby soft furlessness all over.</li>
            <li> Closest shave I&#x27;ve received from electric razor yet. It&#x27;s very comfortable and the battery seems to last forever. And the fact that it is Old Spice branded instead of Remington makes it significantly cheaper than the same razor with the Remington brand. it&#x27;s a win-win.</li>
            <li> Good Braun,Nice shaver! I used to use Philips Shaves and this is the first time to use the Braun one,very good!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my dad: lightweight and easy to manage, he says. He has always used razors, but is happy with the the results of the Old Spice electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I have used electric razors for over 30 years. I have tried other brands, but have always been disappointed eventually after a few weeks. Braun is the best for closeness and battery life. This particular one has the best foil and cutter arrangement ever.&lt;br /&gt;One mistake most new electric razor users make is not using a lubricant before each shave. You can buy a spray can of spray lubricant for barber shears at any beauty/barber supply store. Lightly spray the cutter as it&#x27;s operating then shave before showering.&lt;br /&gt;Better yet this is a true wet/dry razor. Use a nice shaving gel on your face and you will have the most comfortable and closet shave ever! It does take a week to acclimate yourself to electric razors, but don&#x27;t give up. They work well and your finally free of razor burn. Also clean your razor after every use. Most of my brauns lasted years. I only replaced them because I wanted a new one.&lt;br /&gt;You can spend much more, but you won&#x27;t necessarily get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Smooth as silk with my shaving</li>
            <li> beautiful shape and easy to use, a little bit noisy&lt;br /&gt;i am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> The battery life on this electric razor is amazing! Lasts a long time and lets you know when to recharge. The shave is great too.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I have owned in 30 years of shaving.  As long as this thing keeps working, I will not go back to blades ever again.  I get the same smooth shave in the same amount of time as blades without the cuts, burning, expense and hassle of replenishing blades.  This shaver has already paid for itself and improved the quality of my life in the morning.  I don&#x27;t dread shaving anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not take long to get accustomed to using it.  As others have mentioned, you can probably get away with 2-3 days stubble using this shaver.  I have a thick beard, so three days is kind of pushing it but if you are careful you can still get it done.  But the operation is very smooth, albeit a bit loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually just leave it plugged in while I am using it to maintain the charge (its never run out, even after a few days of not charging it.)  I don&#x27;t use any water to clean it, just a cheap barber&#x27;s brush that came with an old set of hair clippers I had.  I usually just tap it out once or twice during  a shave and use the brush once a week to clean it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little clippers are only marginally useful, but fine for a minor trim on the sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is an outstanding value.  I see other similar shavers in stores for $100+.  I can&#x27;t imagine they are that much better than this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Philips Norelco for last 2 years and it&#x27;s good. It takes much time to shave completely. Also the triple rotating circular blades are not useful to maintain French Beard. Just saw this Old Spice Braun shaver on Deal and ordered one. Received few days back and am impressed well with it&#x27;s features and performance.&lt;br /&gt;I hate when Norelco stops in between as Low Battery. I have to wait for few hours to charge it and use. But this Braun Shaver is Cord and Cordless. So I never need to worry about charge it the night before. The shaver blades are so wide and flexible/adjustable. It helps to shave faster (50% less time than Norelco). I never faced any problem on shaving above neck as other users reported. The Popout trimmer is great for side burns. The protective cover saves the blades/power button when not in use. The spiral style charger cable is Wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this the Best Shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected</li>
            <li> This was to replace my old shaver which is identical. No issues there. But I would like the option of shipping and/or not having to sign for it. My schedule prevents me from being home during FedEx and ups deliveries. And this causes multiple problems....</li>
            <li> A nice little shaver for the price. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Not much to explain here, bought this for the bang for buck. I already own a Braun branded model that happed to have a busted retractable trimmer. Keep in mind that trimmer is VERY delicate. Treat it as such and it will last long.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and only shave several times a week this is a good shaver, BUT of course does not give the same clean feel that a razor does. Not only do I personally prefer the clean shave I get from a razor, but it is almost a requirement because if I don&#x27;t show up looking &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; at work I will most likely not be taken seriously. Although it does not get the job done as well as I like, it does get the job done, but in a much longer time. The shaver hasn&#x27;t dulled over the course of 2 months and is easy to maintain. This shaver also has a trimmer on the back that you can slide up. I was actually excited when I saw this when I received it; however, the cut it gives is inconsistent. Maybe I am holding it wrong. When it is good, it is good, but when it doesn&#x27;t work it doesn&#x27;t work. It works more often than not. The battery also holds a charge very well. I know there have been some cons, but the pros far outweigh the cons here. Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a Braun after getting a Remington. Was disappointed in the Remington after several weeks bc it was missing whiskers that were laying flat. Braun&#x27;s that I had purchased in the past would pick up and cut off these whiskers with the cutting bar in between the microscreen heads. I was looking for a Braun that I didn&#x27;t have to pay $200 for that would outperform the Remington. Happened to do a shopping search on Google and up popped this Old Spice shaver made by Braun, It&#x27;s the best bargin going. I don&#x27;t know if Old Spice pays Braun for the advertising or vice-versa, but the consumer makes out on this one. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Does not make your face smooth! Want a good shave use a regular razor!</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to my friend as his razor had bit the bullet.  He called and said it was the best razor he had ever had.  Gave him a very close shave so I was very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Really close shave, feels comfortable on my face.</li>
            <li> My bf loves it! Looks nice!</li>
            <li> Very nice, I like it very much!Very good use!</li>
            <li> OK for a quick shave, good hold charge , fast recharge</li>
            <li> works well for the price</li>
            <li> good razor at good price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slightly above average electric shaver, what more can I say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t give you nearly as close of a shave as a normal razor will but it will do the job and if you don&#x27;t have incredibly invasive facial hair, they will do the job just fine.  Just make sure to shave every morning.</li>
            <li> My daughter purchased this for me from my wishlist this year.  I had researched it and found very good reviews.  I have shaved with an electric razor for many years and thought the brand I had been using was really good until I used this one.  My old razor didn&#x27;t do a good job on father&#x27;s day so I shaved with the multi-blade razor with foam before we went to lunch.  I thought it had done a really good job until I used the Old Spice razor the next day.  I believe that it actually shaved better and closer than the multi-blade and lasted longer to boot.  I didn&#x27;t realize that an electric razor could shave so close and not make my skin break out from the usual ordeal.  This is the best razor I have ever had and that goes back to my first electric razor in 1955 and it does seem like three barbers had shaved me.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the raving reviews about how this doesn&#x27;t leave razor bumps and gives you a close shave... it wasn&#x27;t the case for me because after using this for a couple weeks now, I have bad razor bumps and the shave is not as close to what I got from the Gilette Pro Glide Styler. I hardly give one star reviews but the bad experience makes it a tough one.</li>
            <li> I bought this thing for my face. This product gives high performance for its price. You will never regret it.</li>
            <li> by far the best shaver i have ever used</li>
            <li> very good. works very well as it was a gift for my brother bear</li>
            <li> Great product. it can be better but for the price you can not ask for more, sometimes It leaves some hairs.</li>
            <li> Get what you pay for, cheap price, cheaper product. If you like your face raw &amp; bleeding this shaver is for you!!!</li>
            <li> My husband loved it really good price compared to retail stores saves couple $$$$</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaver, I have no painful hair pulling at all and finish shaving in half the time as my old norelco.</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea and was advised to switch to an electric shaver.  I was very skeptical, so looked and looked for the right one.  Settled on this razor  because of low cost and maker (Braun).  Called Braun and was assured this was the same as a Series 3, but made especially for Old Spice.  I was thrilled after the first shave!  I&#x27;m still in the break-in period and have found it much better than expected.  I would DEFINITELY recommend it for someone with Rosacea and very sensitive skin.  GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> Came quick.....it doesn&#x27;t cutt as close as I would like. The unique thing is that it has a clipper on the back side which is cool.</li>
            <li> My fisrt electric shaver no cuts on my face perfect í definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> love it love how close u may shave looks like u use razor on your face, how close the shave it!  Best razor bought yet!  Now love to body electric razor.  from John Bradford</li>
            <li> This is a great Braun shaver for a half of the regualr cost of the same model.</li>
            <li> Razor cuts great BUT anyone notice the foil and blades are ONE piece. Most razors when new blades are needed can be bought separately from the foil. So when you have to replace them as suggested in 18 months the replacement part is 43.00 dollars.So Braun hooks you with this inexpensive razor up front  for 28.00 then &amp;#34; gets you&amp;#34; on the later for a much more expensive cost.</li>
            <li> Amazingly good product. haves better than Norelco, Braun and Remington shavers I paid premiums for.</li>
            <li> Always thought of deodorant when it came to old spice. Little did I know it became my favorite shaver.</li>
            <li> Braun320S-4, high performance, suitable for students or to father&#x27;s gift! High praise!</li>
            <li> So far, by far, this is the best electric razor I have ever owned. It is a true testimony to the quality of the razor when it cuts better than a disposable or regular hand razor/shaver. Of course, I still have to work hard to shave areas like the jaw and neckline, but it is almost baby-smooth in 95% of the areas.</li>
            <li> it is nice and works great so far</li>
            <li> Holy crap this shaver is incredible. I&#x27;ve always been one to use a blade razor and use an electric only for my mustache area, light trimming or head errant hairs, and for a quick refresh on days I don&#x27;t feel like shaving. But this shaver is making me rethink using a blade. It is the only electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used on my whole face that gave me an amazing shave without have to go over areas over and over and over. Incredibly smooth and no irritation whatsoever. I just got it so can&#x27;t speak to battery life.</li>
            <li> Very simple design, easy  to use, clean and gets the job done. I like it.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend love it!!!</li>
            <li> The corded Braun that my wife gave me 22 years ago got dropped one too many times. it was the old style single foil palm sized simplest of the lineup shaver. But it was durable and it shaved well. About 10 years ago my wife got me a newer style rechargable with the triple head. It was awkwardly balanced and literally jumped out of my hand as I was getting used to it. But even before I broke it I was using the old corded single foil to clean up the stuff that the fancy triple foil coudn&#x27;t seem to pick up. On the one hand I was happy to see this, but I was very leery about the new style shape and the triple foil. Well this is much better balanced than the one I had several years ago, and lighter too, but still feeling well made. I&#x27;m stll getting used to it and so is my face, but for the $35 price point, I&#x27;m gonna say this is a fair deal. I think when me and my face get used to the shaves will be fine. I wish they still made that old corded single foil.&lt;br /&gt;I give it four stars for being a good value. It&#x27;s a nice shaver for day to day get ready for work shave. Enjoy. If you need a premium shaver, this would be the one you put in your travel kit that won&#x27;t break your heart if you lose it, and yet be good enough you can leave the expensive one at home.</li>
            <li> I keep thinking there must be some mistake in how this shaver was priced.  It is easily equivalent to a $60-100 shaver.  It shaves very close, much closer than my $160 Philips Norelco Arcitec that recently died.  This shaver costs as much as replacement blades for any other shaver.  Definitely a great deal and a great product.</li>
            <li> The shave is only fair.  It does not do a very good job under the chin.  I have to use a blade razor to clean up that area.  Would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I purchased and returned Philips Norelco Shaver 3100 because it cause skin irritation on my neck and didn&#x27;t get close shave.  Then I was looking at Braun series 3 shavers and I came across with the Old Spice one. It was under $30 and gave it a chance. This one works great! No skin irritation and provides close shave I anticipated. It is a great bargain and I am glad I gave it a chance.</li>
            <li> Very good shaver get a close shave every time easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good shaver as a gift for my wife, most woman&#x27;s shavers have bad ratings so I got her this one instead.  She absolutely loves it!  She said that it is the best shaver she&#x27;s ever had!  She loves how smooth her legs feel, and so do I ;-)  Now, I&#x27;m planning on getting one of my own!!</li>
            <li> My husband had an old shaver that was falling apart. He&#x27;s very picky about shavers. I took a gamble and got him this one based on excellent reviews. My husband LOVES it! And it gives a super close shave too! His face is smoother than ever!</li>
            <li> Not like my old panosonic used the panosonic for 12 years it finally got dull, this one is functional for the money but wish I had got a bit better function type.</li>
            <li> .Much better than the Remington that I was using .Smooth shave and good battery life.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very cool item for me.  thanks. good quality.</li>
            <li> Great comfortable shave.  Fits my hand well.  Makes for easy movement.  Opens and cleans easily.</li>
            <li> Works well, a little weight, not so clean, but cheap and useful. I love the colour so much !</li>
            <li> I am very surprised at the quality and close shave !!! Worth the money. Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I have only used razors in the past and have never owned an electric shaver before. Razors offer a cleaner shave than an electric shaver, but electric shavers still have a ton of pluses! The shave is not as close as a razor, but it is still close enough that I feel refreshed afterwards. The razor requires so much less effort and care. I can literally shave and watch tv at the sam time without worrying about cutting myself. This is a cheap and quality razor, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Best razor I have ever owned and it was priced right! Get one while you can at this price.</li>
            <li> Incredible Performance, Incredible Value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Braun&#x27;s 7 Series Top of the line version. I needed a second Travel razor. Bought 4 different razors ranging from $40 to $60. None lasted more than a few months. Bought this after a considerable number of different products reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this machine is priced so low is because they have no idea how supremely good it is. It outperforms or equals the top of the line 7 series Braun hands down. I am buying several as Xmas gifts for family and friends.</li>
            <li> This shaver is amazing! Had a &amp;#34;W***&amp;#34; and hated it! Have always had Brauns and loved them. This one is better than my last!</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my husband, who is blind.  This is definitely the best razor he has had for shaving as well as cleaning.  He loves it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! My boyfriend loves it!</li>
            <li> the Shaver is very good</li>
            <li> it is perfect ,very useful</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver!&lt;br /&gt;It looks like Braun finally went back to using better or larger batteries.  This holds enough charge for me to go at least 2 weeks, and the motor can plow through 3 days of stubble without slowing down.  The screens are very fine and I haven&#x27;t experienced any pulled hairs.  The pop-up trimmer has worked well, but doesn&#x27;t get as close as some shavers.  It is very comfortable to hold and quiet.  You are essentially getting a $90 Braun shaver that is &amp;#34;old spice&amp;#34; branded.  What a strange marketing decision.&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy some mid-grade remingtons every couple of years, but the last 2 didn&#x27;t seem to shave close.  I am debating buying a second one of these as back-up because the price is so good.  It would cost more to use blades for a year!.</li>
            <li> One of the better electric shavers.</li>
            <li> my husband likes it he has always used Braun shavers.</li>
            <li> The machine is strong and accurate, doesn&#x27;t leave any cuts on the face, the additional trimmer is helpful&lt;br /&gt;Well put for money invested</li>
            <li> I have very thick facial hair and was looking for an electric razor that could handle it. I used this product every morning to shave my stubble down, and it worked great for the first 2 weeks. But it slowly got worse and worse. It seemed as though the blades were starting to get dull because it was taking several pass overs to shave down the hair. And even then it wasn&#x27;t getting as smooth as it use to. On the plus side, it was very easy to clean and maintain. And the trimmer worked well for trimming up my sideburns. So this razor might be good for some people, but if you have thick facial hair, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good performance , amazing price</li>
            <li> Ok so this is my second shaver I have owned in my lifetime (I&#x27;m 20) and the first one was bought at a garage sale, (although it too was Braun) so take my review with a grain of salt. This this is super nice, it gives me a really close shave, and it is very gentle on the skin, I have not had it pull any hairs. Overall I love this shaver and definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a nice one.</li>
            <li> Very solid, quality electric razor. Charges quick and lasts a good long time. Only downside (minor) is that I can&#x27;t access the blades directly to clean them. You have to wash it under the faucet, which requires adding oil after it dries.  I prefer to clean the blades directly with a brush but no big deal really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good razor for a bargain price.</li>
            <li> good price, works great.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I have ever owned.  Very happy with it.  The battery holds its charge for a long time, many shaves.</li>
            <li> My first Braun powered shaver, but using standard blade is much easier and faster.</li>
            <li> I am a woman. And after 40 you start getting a few chin hairs and then they become too numerous to pluck.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using an electric shaver for around 7 years. Several different brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first electric razor that actually takes care of the chin hairs and peach fuzz on face and lip area.  I used it yesterday and today I am still absent any wild hairs on chins and peach fuzz. I was using a regular non electric razor since my other electric razor was not doing the job( and never did as well this old spice on a good day}. I could not believe that after one day I still did not need to use a razor today it cut that close. I am really so happy with the Old Spice Men&#x27;s electric shaver. It cut close on my upper lip area with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let my husband try it too. I am ordering him one he was blown away with the operation of this shaver.  He said it was the closest shave he has ever seen and so easy and comfortable. He has sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed with this shaver and the price is unreal. Braun does make this. The charging cord has BRAUN written on it. I also like the protective cap. I would give this shaver a 10 rating if I could.</li>
            <li> The shaver is very good, very clean shave.</li>
            <li> Brought this for my husband. He loved it.  He is very much satisfied.</li>
            <li> great close shave waterproof I just leave mine in the shower 24/7, this is beyond convenient. I would recommend to anyone looking for a new razor.</li>
            <li> I recently replaced my Norelco (the kind with 3 round heads) and I&#x27;m really digging this Old Spice shaver. I know it&#x27;s basically the same as an existing Braun model, but this was a few bucks cheaper. It shaves great, even if I miss a day or two, which I couldn&#x27;t say for the Norelco.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product to try out for a few months already. It is fantastic! It feels really solid. Not cheap or light. It provides a really close shave and just feels great to hold in your hand. It hasn&#x27;t showed any signs of wear and the battery life is pretty good. The price is great and I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Before I start, I must note that I received this shaver for free to test/review.  I was hesitant that Old Spice branded a shaver, but was pleasantly surprised by how well it performed.  I used it every other day with no trouble.  I was able to rinse it off in shower, and never once did it stop working. I&#x27;m not really a fan of the red color, and also it should be more heavy-duty feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it is a good product.</li>
            <li> We had to send two back.  Neither of them cut close enough for my husband&#x27;s liking.  Great price, poor expectations.  Sorry</li>
            <li> Does not remove facial hair like it should it takes 15 min to get a smoht shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for over two months. Like it. Charge every two weeks. Very close shave. Taking away one star only for noise level. Yes. It&#x27;s vey aloud.</li>
            <li> Great on all counts. Packaged nice, delivery on time, and product as described! Have been shaving with Fusion for so many years and nice to have a switch to a quality electric--</li>
            <li> Better than expected!</li>
            <li> This is my second foil shaver after the Braun 340s and it most certainly gives a very good shave . I no longer wet shave, as I use this with the Remington face saver and it gives a convenient, close and comfortable shave . Highly recommend .</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T EVER USE AN ELECTRIC SHIFT, I HAVE NEVER SEEN ONE THAT SHAVES CLOSE.---GOT ANY IDEAS ???????</li>
            <li> Great shaver for the price, already used it about 15 times and no issues.</li>
            <li> Having been a razor-shaver for 99.999% of my life, this was a tough decision. I courted a Remington foil shaver about 20 years ago, and while it was big and square and clunky, it was dependable. I can&#x27;t say much else positive about it. The stint was short-lived. Seeing this Old Spice branded unit made by Braun...and at this price...I had to try it!  It&#x27;s red!  It&#x27;s cool!  It charges right up, has a helpful LED, is easy to hold on to, easy to clean,...I could go on, but I&#x27;ll spare you that. If you are contemplating an electric shaver, or just want one for special times, gentlemen, start here!  Don&#x27;t spend a C-note, then find out you don&#x27;t like the whole experience. Amazon, Old Spice, and Braun have it together! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Had a Norelco and never liked that three headed monster. It took me forever to shave with it to get a close shave. The battery sucked! The first time I used this model Braun, I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of use and the close shave I got. I recommend that you read the directions carefully and follow the tips of a good shave. Quiet compared to other shavers I used over the years.The battery, so far, keeps a good charge for a long time. Compared to the Norelco, I get 3 to 5 more shaves with the Braun. There is one shortcoming though. The connection of the charger cord to the shaver is very loose and I have to be very careful when setting it down that the charging light remains lit. Great shaver at a decent price.</li>
            <li> ONE OF THE BEST ELECTRIC SHAVERS I HAVE EVER USE WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li> This takes the place of an older version my husband uses. It is working well to shave his face, especially around the chin areas.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice shave and an excellent price point on a Braun.  It does a nice job at getting longer and short hair with a smooth overall shave.  I travel a lot and the cover and charger have held up well so far (couple of months).</li>
            <li> Just so so; but it worth the money.</li>
            <li> Shaves very well- really fast and close shaves.  Seems to be a quality ravor.  A Braun product at roughly&lt;br /&gt;half the price, which makes it a real bargain.  The only issue for me (and this my not be a problem for&lt;br /&gt;others) is that I suffer from tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and therefore, I find the noise level somewhat&lt;br /&gt;higher then then the razors that I have used in the past.  Other then that, the price is really reasonable&lt;br /&gt;when you consider the very high quality construction of this razor.</li>
            <li> fulfill my needs。but on point Of clearness. Traditional spin type more effeciency</li>
            <li> My husband liked using it.</li>
            <li> Good deal and good product!</li>
            <li> &#x27;ve been using it for  month, which is long enough for a preliminary  opinion. I knew I was taking a chance buying something called an \\&quot;Old Spice Shaver,\\&quot; but I&#x27;m, glad I did. I bought it because (1) it wasn&#x27;t a Norelco or Remington. Those were my last two shavers and I was disappointed in them. (2) It was made by Braun, so I figured it would last. I have a five-or-six-year-old Braun I that still runs, and I used it as a backup when I had trouble with the others.  and (3) It seemed to have the most enthusiastic reviews of any shaver. To my surprise, it gave me a closer shave than the rotaries, and it&#x27;s the only one of the three that did a good job on my neck. And the simpler construction -- fewer moving parts than a rotary -- suggests it will last longer.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Good looking and easy to charge and use.</li>
            <li> Read reviews for several shavers and decided on this one.  This is a great shaver - it really leaves your face very smooth; much smoother than my series 3 Braun.  It is also very quiet - the wife loves that.  Charges in about an hour and that lasts about 10 shaves or so.  Extremely happy with this purchase.  Hoping it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great Shaver!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Braun &amp;#34;Series 3&amp;#34; shavers for many years. They have been very, very good, and this one branded with the Old Spice name is yet another winner; good run time between charges, trimmer, water cleanup, and of course, close shaves. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaver, says he gets the closet shave ever with it!</li>
            <li> It does not cut as close as other razors otherwise it&#x27;s a good razor.</li>
            <li> Well, I had great hopes for this shaver since most of these reviews are great. I received the shaver, and tried it right away. It worked fine on my mustache, and face cheeks. The rest of the face it just couldn&#x27;t handle. It left hairs and I had to press really hard, and go over same spots several times to get it. I am sad that it didnt work as well as  I expected it to, as it would have been a great time saver.</li>
            <li> Vibration amplitude is larger than the Philips，In flat areas suitable for shaving，Rounded chin shaving foil is better fit</li>
            <li> Bought for my BF.  Bought this one over their other ones since this old spice one was cheaper with the same features.  It has a trimmer that pops out as well.  Can use it on things like trimming the back hair line or sideburns.  Highly recommend this if you&#x27;re looking to upgrade or replace!</li>
            <li> Use it daily still. Bought it 8 months ago and have only charged it 3 times. It&#x27;s not the best in the world. But it&#x27;s pretty and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Powerful, shaving is very clean, color is also very beautiful</li>
            <li> Good quality. Poor shave. Have to work to get a close shave. Would not recommend this shaver.   After using this for a year I replaced the shaving cassette. WOW what a difference. Great shaves now.</li>
            <li> Buy cheap and well used to that good</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim given it was cheaper to get a new razor than it was to replace parts for my old one (which also doesnt stay charged for very long now). This is exactly the same as the more expensive standard Braun branded 320s-4 but only in red and black (w/ a small old spice logo). The shave itself was smoother and closer than expected (not to mention way quieter), which was a pleasant surprise.  I thought about the lack of wet/dry feature but opted for this since I rarely shaved in the shower anyway (ie. can&#x27;t see what I am doing) and liked the idea that the shaver could still be operated while plugged in if needed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend after reading the reviews from other user as a Christmas gift. He totally loved it.</li>
            <li> Great razer , I have use others and like this one the best. It is much better in hard to shave areas</li>
            <li> This is simply the very best electric razor I have ever used. I am rather ancient and have used a wide variety of electric razors over the years, mostly with disappointing results. Only two brands -- Norelco and Braun -- have ever been given me a reasonable shave. When my old Braun began to show its age several years ago, I bought the latest Norelco on the market. Since then, I have been only mildly satisfied. When I saw the Old Spice version of the razor advertised and noticed the fabulous price on Amazon, I decided to give Braun another chance. It is far superior to any other electric razor I have ever used, closely approaching the results of wet shaving -- but not quite there yet. However, the convenience presented by this shaver makes it my first choice unless I have let my stubble get too long. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use it with very thin layer of shave cream and rinse the cutter about half way thru the shave and it provides a very close shave.</li>
            <li> It is so good,I like it,and I want to buy it again</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after he had gone through three electric razors in a little over a year.  None of them held up well and all were prone to breakage.  However, with this one, he&#x27;s totally happy and so am I.  We have had it for some time now, and no problems at all and it gives a nice, close shave.  Definitely a 5-star product.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver, especially for the price! But it !</li>
            <li> Very cheap quality. The shaver head pops off while shaving. Poor design. Stay far away from this product, spend a little more and get a quality razor. As for the company&#x27;s 60 day money guarantee, change that to 45 days. If you are 1 day late from the company receiving the product you send back they WILL deny the claim. Very bad guest service on part of Braun</li>
            <li> To start the shaver is built very sturdy and it feels right in my hand, I also like the fact that it has a rechargeable battery i can never seem to find normal batterys when i need them. Before I used the shaver I had grown my facial hair out for about a week or so to test it out on. The shaver head did tug at the longer hair but it has a trimmer built in, I used the trimmer to knock down the volume of my facial hair and then used the head to get as close a shave as I could. I was impressed with how close the shaver did shave, It wasnt quite as close as a conventional razor but pretty close. My girlfriend likes me to keep a clean face most of the time but i usually have to wait three or four days to shave because of the razor burn but i was able to use the electric shaver three days in a row, with a close enough shave to make her happy, an didt get any razor burn, and i shaved without any shaving cream or water. In conclusion I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes electric shavers or is interested in trying one out, in fact i have been telling every one with i beard that i know about it and how it&#x27;s the only shaver i will use now. Before I tried this product i would never have gone out and bought an electric razor but now im going to use this one until it dies and then im going to go buy another old spice electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I love the Old Spice Men&#x27;s Shaver, powered by Braun, it really get the job done I recommend this for people that need to shave only not trim because this is more of a shaver than trimmer, but I love the Precision trimmer it is great for the sideburns! this is for people that have a median beard so not to thick but the Precision trimmer is great for trimming head or beard hair&#x27;s it really can be used for allot of stuff!</li>
            <li> Shaver works great. Made by Braun. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to exp3ct bexause the price was so good.  I am very happy.</li>
            <li> The razor shaving is not a good clean</li>
            <li> Excellent Shaver, Its alot of work maintaining a beard and this trimmer/shaver is perfect for the task. It&#x27;s easy to clean and the battery charge lasts a long time. I highly recommend this shaver!</li>
            <li> Works grate with short stubble</li>
            <li> useful and convenient.</li>
            <li> Works very well. If I shave with a traditional razor every day, I get ingrown hairs and irritated skin. That doesn&#x27;t happen with this.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Grandson who has just started shaving.  He says he likes it, but he needs more training to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I&#x27;d like. Sometimes does not shave anything.</li>
            <li> For this price range, you absolutely cannot beat the quality of this electric razor. I don&#x27;t use an electric razor regularly, I just wanted a cheap one for days that I&#x27;m rushing and really don&#x27;t feel like shaving with blades/cream. I had very low expectations for this product, and was pleasantly surprised by the weight/feel, durability. I couldn&#x27;t believe how well this razor worked, for this price range I really didn&#x27;t expect much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The absolute only con that I would have is that when I first used the razor, it left black markings all over my face. I later figured out that it was just a lubricant oil they initially place on the product for longevity. I didn&#x27;t know about this, because I&#x27;m not accustomed to electric razors. So it is a good idea to wash it right after opening. If I had more experience with this, I probably would have known to look for this.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Works extremely well. Price was perfect. Would recommend to anyone who wants a screen shaver.</li>
            <li> useful and cheap, with lovely red handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d assum they have a wharhouse of these I&#x27;ve see them for less than 10 dollars. I would love k other place as these so cheap.</li>
            <li> Use feels good, is worth buying</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my father. Because it is easy to use, He is very satisfy with this gift.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice electric shaver, which achieves a reasonably close shave, feels comfortable while using it, and lasts a number of days before needing to recharge. Despite the gratuitous &amp;#34;Old Spice&amp;#34; packaging of the product, even non-users of Old Spice products will find much to appreciate in this Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> Great product. It&#x27;s a cheap electric razor that holds a charge for a long time and does a great job shaving.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Battery - I can shave three weeks without needing a charge&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning - Tap out the head or rinse under water and you&#x27;re done&lt;br /&gt;Smooth Shave - Leaves my face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom&lt;br /&gt;Not a Razor - No need for shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not Wet/Dry - I wish I could use this in the shower&lt;br /&gt;Not a Razor - Using a razor will always be quicker no matter what electric shaver you use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Old Spice Shaver from BuzzFeed for free at the end of January and have been using it for almost two months now. Before receiving the Old Spice Shaver I had been using a Norelco Electric Shaver. The Old Spice Shaver is now my daily shaver. I&#x27;m only 19 so I don&#x27;t have any experience in the Old Spice Shaver taming a full beard but I do use it every day to keep the stubble away and for that, the Old Spice Shaver is perfect. I live in a dorm room with a roommate and I usually wake up way before him. With the Old Spice Shaver I can shave in my room because it is quiet enough that it won&#x27;t wake him up. The Old Spice Shaver whacks any strays hairs on my face with ease. I usually only need two or three passes over an area before it&#x27;s clear. It takes me about five minutes to do my whole face. When I&#x27;m done I remove the head, tap it on the edge of my garbage can, and it&#x27;s clean and ready to go for next time. The Old Spice Shaver is a great shaver and I recommend it to anyone looking for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Not as close a shave as safety razor, but I guess that is to be expected.  Does not require water or shaving cream, so less muss and fuss.  I bought this to use on my husband, who has alzheimer&#x27;s disease, but the buzzing of the electric razor seem to distress him.  May not work out as I had expected.  Probably a reasonable shave for most men.</li>
            <li> Great shaver without being super expensive like Braun or the others.  Does the job just as well ... plus, it looks so cool with the red.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this product and it actually a leaves a more smoother skin and also it last more days without recharging and I really like this shaver</li>
            <li> This shaver is a cutting edge design. It charges quickly and holds power for over a week with daily use. I have had mine for almost three months and enjoy the comfortable close shave I always get. The only reason I only give 4 stars is, this model leaves room for improvement when shaving the spotty areas on my neck. Overall a decent deal that you will not regret!!!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating cause i REALLY like the Old Spice Men&#x27;s Shaver! I got it free from BzzAgent and I would recommend this product to everyone! I like how its so easy to use and how close of a cut it gives you. After using it for awhile now I don&#x27;t think i can think of a negative about this product. If you want to look great and feel great shaving, this is the shaver for you!!</li>
            <li> This shaver gives me a reasonable shave, although when I was younger and had a heavier beard, I might have needed a 5 o&#x27;clock touchup. The shave is consistent with other foil shavers I&#x27;ve had in the past.  This one runs slower than previous models, but I&#x27;m not convinced that&#x27;s a bad thing.  It&#x27;s less noisy than the previous model, but still cuts well.  I don&#x27;t experience any razor burn or pulling.  I think that only happens when you press too hard.  Stretching the skin is helpful.  The razor doesn&#x27;t do particularly well with the longer, softer hair on the neck.  I use the slide-out trimmer to take a first pass in that case, followed by using the foil cutters.  No electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had matches a blade razor and this one is no exception.  But I knew that going in.  The low cost of this razor makes it a bargain purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver a man can have. The triple action cutting system worked for a close shave everywhere on my face. I&#x27;m really happy whit this.</li>
            <li> Great value and easy for a traveler to pack</li>
            <li> Should really be 0 stars if I could. I would not recommend purchasing any shavers from this brand. Why? Because of their warranty which states that they(Braun) will repair or replace at no charge to the consumer. The warranty is for 2 years, mine lasted barely 4 months with minimal usage. Contacted Braun, and they still want you, the consumer, to pay for shipping to send their defective product back to them. What happened to the &amp;#34;at no charge to the consumer&amp;#34; line listed in the warranty?  Even if you sent it back, Braun would still need to &amp;#34;hold on&amp;#34; to the shaver for another 15 days to determine if their product is indeed defective/broken before doing anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Products of such low quality should not even be on the market. Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> good product, a pleasant purchase</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, and works cordless or corded. I was unable to get a good shave from this razor. It works great on the cheeks, but on the jawline and especially the neck it wouldn&#x27;t catch the hairs, and I would have to go back with a wet razor to clean up the rest. I&#x27;ve never had much luck with electric razors, so your milage may vary.</li>
            <li> Great value and works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> Okay, I knew if Braun made it then it had to be a good product. Thankfully I was right! I love that you can use it cordless or while plugged in. It is definitely a strong shaver. I am SICK AND TIRED of shaving the old fashioned way! No thanks razor and shaving cream! I was getting VERY irritated constantly cutting my face despite buying the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; razor/shaving cream combo. THANK YOU BRAUN AND OLD SPICE! This is a godsend product that is unbelievably inexpensive. Way to go Amazon for selling this dirt cheap. 5/5</li>
            <li> Works great, it cuts my facial hair.</li>
            <li> I used a Braun 7000 for about 10 years and it was great, but the replacement blades offered now don&#x27;t really fit well, and I got a few cuts.  I saw this on Amazon, and bought it because of the Braun quality and all the positive reviews.  If you follow their shaving tips in the manual, and move the razor SLO-O-OWLY across your face rather than trying for a speed record, you will get a close, smooth shave.  I would have given it five stars, but gave it only four just in case an unforeseen issue arises.  If no problems ensue, I might upgrade to five stars at a later date.</li>
            <li> Wonderful electric shaver I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I was originally going to replace the heads on my Norelco Sensotouch 3D as the stupid light was flashing on it to let me know that I should replace the heads.  That all changed when I started looking at the prices.  Even on Amazon the cheapest price was $60 plus tax and the reviews were horrible so I thought why not just replace the whole razor.  I didn&#x27;t need anything fancy and I&#x27;ve always wanted to try the Braun electric razors.  I came across this one for $46  and the reviews were good.&lt;br /&gt;I received it quickly and just as promised it shaves as good as my Norelco.  I haven&#x27;t tried the pop up trimmer but then again I haven&#x27;t had a good pop up trimmer since my old Norelco razor in 1969.  But if you&#x27;re looking for a good electric razor that doesn&#x27;t have a ton of garbage you don&#x27;t need or want and stil gives you a good shave then you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I only shave electric when I have to shave dry or am out of blades for the moment... my 15 yo re-chargeable triple-head norelco finally bit the dust.  This shaver had good ratings for a good price and I thought I&#x27;d try it.  It works reasonably well - it doesn&#x27;t seem any better than my old razer, but no worse.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and is reasonably kind to my face, but it&#x27;s not an improvement to what I&#x27;m used to. However, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a razor out there that doesn&#x27;t leave a fair number of it&#x27;s purchasers unhappy, so I have no idea if there are better options.</li>
            <li> does a great job well made great price</li>
            <li> works great ,easy to clean and does a nice close shave,</li>
            <li> Shaving is very clean, but need long time.There is, the voice is bigger, like a combustion engine</li>
            <li> aside from the ginormus a/c plug sticking out of the socket, i love this shaver...cuts great, the trimmer is excellent and you can clean the head with running water...i do wish it came with a soft travel case though...</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.  I alternate between this and a Norelco rotary every few months.  Love it.  Close shave, only mild irritation on my neck (Adam&#x27;s apple).</li>
            <li> i suffer from ingrown hairs so i figured that a electric shaver might stop the ingrown from coming. so far so good, but due to my prior ingrown issues it takes some time to work on the neck area which causes irritation. i will update this review in a few weeks once my face gets used to the shaver and see how it is doing on my neck area. otherwise it other areas of my face it is an extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> This item was purchased as a birthday gift for my husband. He&#x27;s used it for only 2 months and it&#x27;s probably the worst shaver he&#x27;s ever used. It skips large patches and doesn&#x27;t have the power to be effective. Unfortunately, the return window has closed and we&#x27;re stuck with it.&lt;br /&gt;Avoid!</li>
            <li> Considering the price of most electric shavers not to mention the cost of razors now days this shaver is a deal.  No performance complaints whatsoever.  Ergonomics are good, it&#x27;s relatively quiet, and shaves close with no irritation.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver a lot works great even after a few days beard</li>
            <li> great braun shaver for the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good,maybe I should buy a better one in Braun........</li>
            <li> i recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage son who does not like to spend time grooming. This shaver is super easy for him to use and it is easy clean up.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is the best electric shaver I have owned and I have owned many. I have owned and used this shaver for a couple of months and I love it. The charging time is fast. I can use it for over a week before needing a recharge. It is powerful and gives a comfortable and reasonably close shave. It is easy to grip and feels good in your hand. It is less noisy than the average shaver in this price range.</li>
            <li> It shaves slowly. And gets hot quickly. It&#x27;s not better than my Panasonic. I returned this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what product this review is for, since I was sent a regular Braun shaver, Series 5. It works great!, but I think this is supposed to be a Series 3 shaver. Don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;ll get, but I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> This shaver is amazing. I love it. I went from expensive Gillette razors to this. The battery lasts forever, and warns you way before it dies. Doesn&#x27;t matter if you have stubble or a beard, works great and doesn&#x27;t hurt. Well worth the one time investment. It&#x27;s very easy to clean, and again, amazing.</li>
            <li> This razor is a little heavy but the battery lasted for at least 10 shaves before it needed recharged. It shaved closer than the Norelco that I used to own. I&#x27;m not really sure why the old spice logo is on it, but if it made it less expensive, then all the better. It&#x27;s very easy to clean. Pop the foil head off, use the included small brush and rinse if needed. The push out trimmer works well for side burns, but is a little too large for precision work. A great buy for a usually more expensive Bruan.</li>
            <li> I got this as part of lightning deal after reading a lot of glowing reviews here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it did not deliver at all. Had to return it .  The only reason I am giving it one star is because the product design and material quality was good. But all that comes to nothing if it does not shave .  The description says it is like three barbers on your face. Well after trying it over and over again on the same patch of skin on my face the hair was still there. the only place where it worked was around the cheek area. the edges , the neck region all were left with uncut patches of hair after multiple tries. I like old spice after shave and expected better from them.  I will not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a reasonably priced shaver to replace a Norelco that quit working.  Norelco said they no longer had repair services and replacement heads were either no longer available or cost more than several shavers!&lt;br /&gt;The Braun shaves very well and the clipper feature is effective.  It seems that I get several shaves before having to recharge.  I like having a cord to use - lots easier than a receptable/holder when traveling.</li>
            <li> nice,i like it so much.</li>
            <li> Way better than I dreamed it would be.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son and he really likes it, Braun razors are the best. Nice look of Old Spice style too.&lt;br /&gt;Good reasonably priced razor and works well.</li>
            <li> one of the best I&#x27;ve used, close shave and the charge last a good long time</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend as a valentine gift and he loved it! Its his first electric shaver and he says it feels great. He&#x27;s 22 with very thick facial hair that starts growing in within a day and he think this shaver works well for him.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver and over all I&#x27;m really happy about the product !</li>
