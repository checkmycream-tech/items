            <li> if you like the product in the store, you&#x27;ll like this one, it&#x27;s nothing more, nothing less, a bit more price worthy but the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;This is actually one of my most favorite lotions, one of the few products where you don&#x27;t have to choose, between a good smell and good hydration for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re both excellent features , offered by this product, the bottle lasts a long time too!

            <li> I received this product in the mail totally busted open and smeared all over the packaging.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for years and absolutely love it. It makes my skin feel amazing and it smells fabulous too.</li>
            <li> I wish the fragrance was stronger, the lotion is lighter than I would like.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter really enjoyed this body lotion, which I gave her at Christmas.  It was a very nice smelling lotion, and I know she will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Everyone loves bath and body works.  Sweet pea has a fresh soft scent, and the size of the bottles were great for the price.</li>
            <li> I love sweet pea my favorit</li>
            <li> I heard a great deal about this Bath &amp; Body Works Sweat Pea Body Lotion.  I decided to purchase this lotion for a good friend, and the price was reasonable.  She states she loves the aroma, not over-powering, a soft scent, and allows people to notice the aroma of the lotion.  She receives a lot of inquisitive questions about this lotion; &amp;#34;what are you wearing? -- it smells great” responses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves the aroma, although allergic to some fragrances, this does not affect her at all.  She would recommend this lotion to other Amazon Customers.  She feels it is soft, not over-powering, smells great, and anyone with allergies can use this product without fear of &amp;#34;breaking out,&amp;#34; or having any form of reaction.  Of course sensitivity to colognes/perfumes for some is different than for others.  She thinks anyone who loves a floral type of cologne without the strong fragrance would love this product. She is happy and pleased with this product.  Try it, I am sure you would love this lotion!</li>
            <li> I gave this as part of a work Secret Santa gift and the 8 oz. size is a good size for the price.  It was the recipients favorite scent so that of course, it was perfect.  A lot of other people received smaller sizes for not much less in cost.</li>
            <li> This lotion is pleasant smelling, goes on easy, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue on my hands. It leaves my hands soft for hours!</li>
            <li> I love bath and body works. This is my favorite scent and I will buy it again on here. Post more bath and body items to choose from.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this smell at all.</li>
            <li> My wife just love it, since she bougth the first one, she has remain using it for more than a year.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!! They don&#x27;t send there products andtry to keep your money.</li>
            <li> Received this as a gift and I really do like the smell. It is not overpowering like some scents tend to be. It keeps me feeling really good all day. It definitely helps with the winter dry skin &#x27;itchies&#x27;. I am very happy with it and when it is gone (used up), I will probably replenish my supply. It is so very nice to receive a gift that you really love. I am happy.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love Bath &amp; Body Works?? :) Smells yummy &amp; sweet...</li>
            <li> Overall this product isn&#x27;t bad. The only downfall is that the smell doesn&#x27;t last very long. I would still reccomend this</li>
            <li> A little too strong for me. I prefer the pink chiffon to this one, as it&#x27;s overwhelmingly strong. I LOVE the other sweet pea products (hand sanitizer, shower gel) and I would love this too, if it were &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34; just a little. :/&lt;br /&gt;Still decent, and once it dries it&#x27;s not SO invasive.</li>
            <li> Arrived fairly.  Took a little longer to come.  but still gave it a 4 star for the price. I think the price wasa the most that I like.  You pay only half the price.</li>
            <li> Not only do I absolutely love the smell of this lotion but it exceeds expectations as to how well it works as a moisturizor. As I get older am finding my skin seems to get dryer every day. I apply this lotion and get all day relief as well as a very refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this smell, was able to get it at a more reasonable price, so to give as gifts later..</li>
            <li> Got this today and used it already!! Love love love it!!!!</li>
