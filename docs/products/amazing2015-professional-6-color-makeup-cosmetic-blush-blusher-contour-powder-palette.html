            <li>The best part is the highlights.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>It took maybe two weeks to ship and it was in perfect condition when arriving.</li>
            <li>still playing with the colors....goes on great....</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy I did.</li>

            <li>I love to contour with this item.</li>
            <li>I can say this product&#x27;s quality is OK for a beginner.</li>
            <li>The darker colors work better than the lighter colors.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s probably better ones on the market, but can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>It works fantastic on me!</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I am starting to &amp;#34;contour&amp;#34; and it works great!!!</li>
            <li>This product is ok.  </li>
            <li>, i should have read or researched more.  </li>
            <li>and i was pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>It came very quickly which I was very excited about.</li>
            <li>This pallet&#x27;s case is very light and looks cheap.</li>
            <li>easy to blend</li>
            <li>i would still buy this again because i like this type of make up, its easy to use for contouring</li>
            <li>Seems to be just fine....</li>
            <li>This is a great product - especially for the price - for someone who is just learning how to highlight and contour.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I got deserved this because I chose this with cheap cost.</li>
            <li>feel free to ask me any questions about this product</li>
            <li>I looked fine for 5 hours without touching up, but took it off when I got home, so I don&#x27;t know how it lasts much after that.</li>
            <li>I was super excited when these came in the mail because it had arrived so quickly.</li>
            <li>Or maybe I am not using it right.  </li>
            <li>Next time, I will buy a better product.</li>
            <li>It blends very well and if you use a primer before applying it, it stays on all day!</li>
            <li>would&#x27;ve been great if it didn&#x27;t arrive broken.</li>
            <li>I really like your color palettes</li>
            <li>Its OK just not what I expected.  </li>
            <li>very pigmented and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>or maybe I put on too much, but in a few minutes it looked fine.</li>
            <li>I want to throw away this new color make up or give it away to somebody...</li>
            <li>; they look almost identical but the &amp;#34;Outop Cosmetics Professional 6 Colors Contour Face Power Foundation Makeup Palette&amp;#34; is cheaper.</li>
            <li>I just realized I didn&#x27;t order this product I actually ordered the &amp;#34;Outop Cosmetics Professional</li>
            <li>Now I am go back to my previous colorful powders and putting them on my face.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product - especially for the price - for someone who is just learning how to highlight and contour.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
            <li> I love to contour with this item. I never have before and this works well with my skin tone. Thank you</li>
            <li> I remember that someone did review for this product. you did pay for what you got! I agree with that. This pallet&#x27;s case is very light and looks cheap. I can say this product&#x27;s quality is OK for a beginner. Next time, I will buy a better product. Updated: I have been using this over a month, but I need to adjust 3 stars to 2 stars because I realized that this color make up doesn&#x27;t last long on my face when I see my pic. After 2 hrs, the make up on face was gone and couldn&#x27;t see any colors on my face. Now I am go back to my previous colorful powders and putting them on my face. I want to throw away this new color make up or give it away to somebody...Totally, I wasted my money. Yes, I got deserved this because I chose this with cheap cost. I never do make a mistake again. not satisfied...</li>
            <li> Just got my pallete and the lightest and darkest shades were broken completely very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> It came broken and cracked, huge mess :(&lt;br /&gt;Pretty disappointed</li>
            <li> Pretty good. It was a lot bigger than I thought it would be. Arrived on time and intact. The darker colors work better than the lighter colors. I have to keep applying the highighting colors. There&#x27;s probably better ones on the market, but can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Seems to be just fine....still playing with the colors....goes on great....easy to blend</li>
            <li> One disc was broken.  Colors and texture are nice.</li>
            <li> would&#x27;ve been great if it didn&#x27;t arrive broken.</li>
            <li> It works fantastic on me! Love it</li>
            <li> When the countour kit came it was broken what a mess . I will no longer our&lt;br /&gt;Purchase the countour kit</li>
            <li> Works well for the price.</li>
            <li> A lot bigger than I thought it would be! Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good with makeup, but this worked well for me. It looked a bit dark or maybe I put on too much, but in a few minutes it looked fine. I looked fine for 5 hours without touching up, but took it off when I got home, so I don&#x27;t know how it lasts much after that.</li>
            <li> I really like your color palettes</li>
            <li> This is a powder not a cream.  Its OK just not what I expected.  The best part is the highlights.</li>
            <li> Great product larger than I thought it would be which was a great surprise.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product. It blends very well and if you use a primer before applying it, it stays on all day! It took maybe two weeks to ship and it was in perfect condition when arriving. There was quiet a few complaints about receiving it with the powders being broken so I questioned ordering it but I&#x27;m happy I did. It was bigger than I expected it to be and for the price you cant go wrong! ----- OPPS I just realized I didn&#x27;t order this product I actually ordered the &amp;#34;Outop Cosmetics Professional 6 Colors Contour Face Power Foundation Makeup Palette&amp;#34; they look almost identical but the &amp;#34;Outop Cosmetics Professional 6 Colors Contour Face Power Foundation Makeup Palette&amp;#34; is cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am starting to &amp;#34;contour&amp;#34; and it works great!!! very pigmented and stays on all day. Will buy this item again</li>
            <li> This product is ok.  In my opinion, you have to use a lot to notice you are even wearing it.... I wasn&#x27;t thrilled it was a powder..  I was hoping for something creamy.  I guess that is my fault, i should have read or researched more.  Or maybe I am not using it right.  Who knows....</li>
            <li> I was super excited when these came in the mail because it had arrived so quickly. to my dissapointment it was broken i assume during shipping. although i have make up containers at home so for me it isnt an issue. i would still buy this again because i like this type of make up, its easy to use for contouring and i was pleased. feel free to ask me any questions about this product</li>
            <li> It came very quickly which I was very excited about. But when I had opened the pallet some of the powders were all broken up and just a huge mess everywhere. Was a little disappointed. But for the price I can&#x27;t be to upset. Still use everyday.</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations!!! I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.</li>
