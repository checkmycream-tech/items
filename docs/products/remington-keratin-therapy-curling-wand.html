            <li>Everyone was complimenting me on how great my hair looked.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The Remington keratin therapy curling iron has been a great tool for me.</li>
            <li>results were great.</li>
            <li>The barrel was just the perfect size for the type of curls I liked and it even heated up</li>
            <li>This is a Very nice curling iron.  </li>
            <li>But, the product itself is very nice and works well</li>
            <li>perfect curling i have not tried before bust from the first time my hair was great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok not the best wand</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sleeker and more tapered and works excellently with shorter hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was great, I loved it.</li>
            <li>Great product for a good price.</li>
            <li>great value and holds a good curl!  very easy to use as well</li>
            <li>I was able to curl my own hair without getting tangled in it!!</li>
            <li>Very good curl iron and very light.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>Note: my hair is fairly thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you have to sit fairly close to the power plug</li>
            <li>So if ya need one for that it&#x60;s good.</li>
            <li>And this gives good curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i am by no means good at doing hair, in fact before i got this wand</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re wanting this type of product, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Unless you are really good with tools, stick to a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use!!  </li>
            <li>i have burned myself a couple of times but so worth the beautiful curls this thing provides!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d not washed it that day, but the wand alone tamed most of the frizz while adding a great shining sheen to my locks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the curls and waves the 1&amp;#34; barrel creates (side note:</li>
            <li>I honestly have to say that I did not have good luck with this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product at a nice price.</li>
            <li>i love it !</li>
            <li>Love this wand!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I got this one!</li>
            <li>Love this wand!</li>
            <li>and I get so many compliments on my hair!</li>
            <li>Love this curling wand!</li>
            <li>This wand has worked magic on my hair!</li>
            <li>I love this wand!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love this wand!</li>
            <li>Amazing and suuuuper cost efficient</li>
            <li>The protectant glove comes in handy as well.</li>
            <li>It is great and leaves my hair nice and smooth</li>
            <li>I Own over 10 curling wands and this is the lightest one which just makes it a lot easier.</li>
            <li>and I liked the ability to regulate the heat and hopefully not burn my hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this wand thinking that it would give me nice spiral curls in my hair.</li>
            <li>she curled looked nice, except for a pointy tip where she would have to hold it away from the iron.  </li>
            <li>The ceramic barrel is really nice.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>And is a nice price compared to others.</li>
            <li>I liked it and I recommned it.</li>
            <li>It gives the perfect curls and it heats up fast</li>
            <li>What I loved even more was their service.</li>
            <li>good news is that it heats very quickly.</li>
            <li>Great price - received quickly.  </li>
            <li>those who do not like that there is no clip: i find it very easy to use after you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>Hair slips around very easily.  </li>
            <li>It makes beautiful curls and volume when you get it to work, but it will take time, patience and practice to use for the best results, especially for those of us who depend on the curling iron clip to keep our hair secure while we curl.</li>
            <li>It makes beautiful curls and volume when you get it to work, but it will take time, patience and practice to use for the best results, especially for those of us who depend on the curling iron clip to keep our hair secure while we curl.</li>
            <li>way I do my hair with the wand is super quick and gives my hair a perfect, relaxed, beachy curl.</li>
            <li>Perhaps with lots of practice I might become more adept with this, but after using the old-fashioned curling irons with clamps for over 30 years, learning how to use one all over again</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair, that is not so wavy in some spots, so I use this wand to enhance my waves and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>and i have been able to effectively use this wand on my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the inch curler for my hair, works perfect, and as good as any curling iron will do, but if you use 1 &amp; 1/2 inches you&#x27;re going to have to use hair spray definitely</li>
            <li>I love love love love this wand!</li>
            <li>I was debating between 3 and 4 stars but gave it 4 because it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li>This would be good for a quick section touch-up.</li>
            <li>This curing wand gets good and hot and holds my curls all day!</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and still look fantastic!</li>
            <li>THEY LOVE THE CURL.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I am curler challenged but I love the wavy beach curl look.  </li>
            <li>I equally love this 1 inch one.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many curling irons and clipless wands I have had.</li>
            <li>I always find Remington products to be a better bargain for the price they are listed for.</li>
            <li>this means you have to have your finger practically touching the iron.  </li>
            <li>then this might work for you, but that&#x27;s not the case for most women.  </li>
            <li>but I have better ones.</li>
            <li>I was in the middle of curling my hair for my best friends surprise engagement</li>
            <li>and I love how it looks curled.</li>
            <li>I really love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>A better name for this \\&quot;Curling Wand\\&quot; would be the \\&quot;WAVE Wand.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Not everyone relies on being able to hold the tip, but I find that it helps me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave dents or bumps or creases.</li>
            <li>my best tip would be, the next time you are at the mall, watch how the girls who are selling those $80 curling wands do it.</li>
            <li>that said, this is my favorite curling wand, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>and you won&#x27;t regret buying this tool either! :)</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to turn the car around on mornings when I can&#x27;t remember for sure.</li>
            <li>but i am able to style it into the 40s</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>The Remington did give my hair more volume, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I saw this was one of the more cheaper wands on Amazon that were 1 inch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>She feels she can use a lower heat and get better curls with the clamp.  </li>
            <li>and it never lasted more than an hour.</li>
            <li>and you can do many hairstyles with it</li>
            <li>/&gt;She was very excited... until she used it.  </li>
            <li>The product works amazing and gives me full beach curls that I love.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for my long hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally bummed too because this seemed to fit my needs perfectly.</li>
            <li>This one comes with a glove, which is nice even though I honestly only used it when getting used to the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing wand at a great price.</li>
            <li>It gave me the perfect loose curls I wanted.</li>
            <li>very useful and works fine!</li>
            <li>Works great and helps control my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worked great for me so far.</li>
            <li>This isabsolutely the BEST $20 I&#x27;ve ever spent on my hair</li>
            <li>This wand is really good and heats up really fast</li>
            <li>easy to use</li>
            <li>This curling iron is easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>curling iron is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an uncomplicated curling wand that&#x27;s easy to handle (thank God for swivel cords)</li>
            <li>Easy to use and curled my hair well.</li>
            <li>My wife has owned Remington products before, making this an easy choice since we know what to expect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>gets hot very quickly and is a really nice size for looser curls.</li>
            <li>I used this curling iron and wow, my curl was amazing and lasted all night!</li>
            <li>I am VERY happy with this, and I wasn&#x27;t planning on such good quality for the low price</li>
            <li>She loves this iron and states it takes only minutes to get beautiful girls.</li>
            <li>, which are beautiful and polished and lasting.</li>
            <li>It works fine but just not 5 star quality.</li>
            <li>bottom line is that the REMINGTON KERATIN THERAPY CURLING WAND curls hair just fine.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine and somewhat wavy hair.</li>
            <li>It heated up just fine and the bits of hair</li>
            <li>My hair is just below shoulder length, and though I have a lot of it the texture is fine.</li>
            <li>Best iv ever used and my hair is long and thick, and it holds the curl in great!!!</li>
            <li>different types including most recently a model from the hairdresser, I can safely say this is the best product out there to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>When it came I was mystified by it being a wand not having a way to secure the hair in clamp.  </li>
            <li>The light on the wand was off</li>
            <li>The curls are smooth every time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used curing irons and heated curlers before, but never one without a way to secure the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the elimination of the clamp in favor of the wand has made a huge difference in terms of handling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Her hair looks fabulous in no time at all.</li>
            <li>My awesome and very understanding hair stylist recommended I try a curling wand and low and behold</li>
            <li>I can only say that I think this product will be very nice</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for those beautiful loose curls</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with the product and will recommend it to friends and Amazon browsers. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use once you master the wrapping technique (</li>
            <li>Easy to use and creates nice, soft curls with her hair.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful and loose!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s original packaging.</li>
            <li>I do have to admit that I&#x27;m more of a hot rollers person because I can put the rollers in and multi-task.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terribly expensive, and well not make you regret spending $100 or more.</li>
            <li>I got my curling wand yesterday and was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li>She was extremely excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>It works very well, and it came with a glove that I could use until I became more familiar and comfortable with the product.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say I like this more than a regular curling iron, but the variety is nice.</li>
            <li>Not sure this is the magical answer to those beautiful spiral curls</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>The size is great for a medium not too tight/not too loose curl.</li>
            <li>This curling wand is definitely not for someone who is looking for a fast, easy way to curl their hair and is not overly experienced with a range of products on the market.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Burning my hand wasn&#x27;t an issue because they included a specially made glove for it.</li>
            <li>and it not work right out of the gate!</li>
            <li>It normally responds very easily to any curling iron.</li>
            <li>Works great and makes really pretty curls that last.</li>
            <li>My daughter first purchased this curling wand and her hair looked great AFTER about a month of almost daily use, thus practice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the REMINGTON KERATIN THERAPY CURLING WAND is a good curling iron, it&#x27;s being designated as a back-up to the traditional curling iron ...</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good curling iron</li>
            <li>I have very curly kinky frizzy hair, but not in a manageable and sexy way like all the hollywood stars.</li>
            <li>* Cool tip &amp; glove.</li>
            <li>i love so much and a friend of mine said her daughters hair just doesn&#x27;t hold a curl</li>
            <li>The curl or better, coil, had a straight end, which bugged me to no degree.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of no little crimp in the curl where the clamp held the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>Luckily, this takes almost no time</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>It was quickly sent to me and everything that it said it was on the add.</li>
            <li>It heats up really quickly, and has an adjustable heat range.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I found this one just in time.</li>
            <li>Quick heat up.</li>
            <li>it heats up quickly and has adjustable settings.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li>With this product, while of high quality, using the glove and wrap technique, she finds requires more temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Get very hot.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that this new stylish hair tool would be helpful in styling my hair.  </li>
            <li>Works really well on my hair and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Such a good value - and really holds a curl!</li>
            <li>My curls held all day and the second day curls were even better!</li>
            <li>I first bought this in Australia and was hoping to find a comparable US product, but after buying 6 (not kidding!)</li>
            <li>Makes my hair in pretty waves that stay!</li>
            <li>The curls come out great and hold strong for at least 5-6 hours with no product being used.</li>
            <li>Curls last and look amazing</li>
            <li>As a pre-teen learning to style my own hair, I could spend countless hours practicing.</li>
            <li>But for the price its pretty cool</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
            <li>The glove is useful.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite curling tool</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the old school style wands, with the metal clip arm, for most of my life.</li>
            <li>maybe for a hair stylist who has spent many hours perfecting her trade is able to have success at this \\&quot;simple\\&quot; wrap.  </li>
            <li>curlers\\&quot; because they are supposed to give more naturally looking</li>
            <li>My hair rarely holds a curl.</li>
            <li>In a more hospitable environment, I&#x27;m sure it would last much longer.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my 12 year old for her birthday last month and so far she says it&#x27;s the greatest ever!!!!</li>
            <li>I thought I would give it a try although months later I&#x27;m still struggling to get a decent curl, get that curl to start closer to the crown of my head rather than at my temple, which then leaves my hair flat on top and curly at the bottom and isn&#x27;t a really good look.</li>
            <li>and it had been confirmed as New</li>
            <li>so I know that the temperature set for this curling wand is exactly the right</li>
            <li>Firstly, I should probably clarify that I naturally have type 2A/2B (&amp;#34;wurly&amp;#34;) hair that holds curls really well without styling products or hairspray -- so I can&#x27;t really comment on whether or not this works with straight hair, since I use this hair tool primarily to make my wavy/curly hair more uniform and</li>
            <li>I liked that the cord was a long enough length to be able to maneuver the wand without pulling the plug out of the wall.</li>
            <li>I liked that the cord was a long enough length to be able to maneuver the wand without pulling the plug out of the wall.</li>
            <li>My hair is more like Merida&#x27;s, from Brave, if someone wet her down and put her through a spin cycle.</li>
            <li>i have very straight, long(over 24\\&quot; hair)</li>
            <li>The barrel/wand heats quickly and its ceramic construction offers a nice \\&quot;slick\\&quot; surface that allows hair to simply slip off ...</li>
            <li>I really like the design -- which is better suited for longer lengths -- and that this wand heats quickly and includes multiple heat settings.</li>
            <li>I was seeking because thus far I haven&#x27;t been able to achieve any decent looking curl from this wand.</li>
            <li>gets hot fast, stays hot!</li>
            <li>This curling iron gets really hot and it does not damage my hair.</li>
            <li>Most electrical beauty products should be versatile for use outside the US.</li>
            <li>but ok, doesn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li>The iron heated pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be sure to watch a video on how to use a wand because it is different from a curling iron since it doesn&#x27;t have a clamp to hold your hair.</li>
            <li>In this case, paying more isn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
            <li>Not wearing it isn&#x27;t an option since it&#x27;s hot even through the glove, but while wearing the glove</li>
            <li>Had the first one for over a year and never had any problems with it.</li>
            <li>I tried a different outlet to be sure, no bueno.</li>
            <li>This curling wand stopped working the first time that I used it.</li>
            <li>I have hot rollers, and have never quite figured out how to use them.</li>
            <li>This styling wand gives me the look I wanted from hot rollers, but could never get.</li>
            <li>The Remington CI5325 Keratin Therapy Curling Wand is exactly what I want in a hair curling product.  </li>
            <li>then I really suggest this!</li>
            <li>now i love curling it, and the only reason i knew how was by watching the girls at the mall.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really pleased with the low price.</li>
            <li>It curls very well!</li>
            <li>This is my first clampless curling wand.</li>
            <li>make sure you do some looking around before settling with this one.&lt;br /&gt;One might be on sale at a local retailer of yours!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably me more than the tool, but I only used it once.  </li>
            <li>She uses this curling wand now with more ease although initially she had difficulty and suffered some burns despite using the provided glove.</li>
            <li>I would definitely order from them again :)</li>
            <li>As an adult with a full-time job, busy social schedule, and a house full of chores, I just can’t spare that kind of time to figure this curling iron out.</li>
            <li>If you have previously used and liked clip-less curling wands, you will likely be satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>The best feature, however, is the swivel base of the power cord eliminates the cord from tangling ... makes you wonder why this feature isn&#x27;t on most electric household</li>
            <li>otherwise you could really do yourself damage with a hot iron.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not completely given up on curling wands, and would like to try a 1/2\\&quot; barrel that may be more suited for my hair type and length.error for what will work for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not completely given up on curling wands, and would like to try a 1/2\\&quot; barrel that may be more suited for my hair type and length.</li>
            <li>I was pretty unsure about this whole curling wand thing</li>
            <li>After I curl all my hair in sections, I let them cool completely.</li>
            <li>I did notice my hair was shinier than normal but using this cumbersome tool wasn&#x27;t worth the shine.</li>
            <li>It has the feel of a good quality product, not cheap or rattley like some products that are available at the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing that I don&#x27;t love is having to hold the hair while the curl heats, but the end result makes curls that look much more natural than those made with a traditional curling iron with a clamp.</li>
            <li>I was in the market for a new 1-inch curling iron and the Remington CI5325 Keratin Therapy Curling Wand looked intriguing.</li>
            <li>They curl my hair easily and the curls last for days.</li>
            <li>Excellent on my very long thick hair.</li>
            <li>and this gives me a nice curl, nothing too tight.</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair and you want to have it hold all day the same as when you rolled it , I suggest a thermal protectant that has hold to it.</li>
            <li>This wand includes a heat resistant glove which I highly suggest using the first couple times you use the wand since it gets up to 400 degrees (I think).</li>
            <li>I really think it should be a lot easier than this is.</li>
            <li>If you fall under that criteria then maybe this will work for you, but my hair is shoulder-length and layered, and it was an absolute nightmare trying to curl it with this.  </li>
            <li>The glove doesn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li>I really like the ease of using this wand.</li>
            <li>I was getting ready for a party, plugged it in, went to answer the phone</li>
            <li>and I think anything much shorter would not work with this wand.  </li>
            <li>My daughter really loves this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very</li>
            <li>The glove is meant to fit on the left hand, so some users may need to adapt the way they use this</li>
            <li>this product seemed to work better as the hair didn&#x27;t keep slipping off the barrel even when wound around it three to four times.</li>

            <li>this product seemed to work better as the hair didn&#x27;t keep slipping off the barrel even when wound around it three to four times.</li>
            <li>I have no idea if the keratin thing is really what&#x27;s doing the job, but my hair looks healthier/shinier AFTER I curl it than before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m talking about a scenario where most mornings I&#x27;m walking through wet fog.</li>
            <li>I really despised using this machine.</li>
            <li>The curl didn&#x27;t hold very well either.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This remington keratin therapy curling wand was not what I expected, it didn&#x27;t leave a curl more like a wave</li>
            <li>It really took some time to get used to it, but after that it seemed effortless.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really appreciated their trust and honor.  </li>
            <li>The REMINGTON KERATIN THERAPY CURLING WAND offers an alternative to the standard curling iron by taking away the tried-and-true clip that accompanies most curling irons.  </li>
            <li>The iron gets really hot and there&#x27;s no way you&#x27;re holding your hair directly around the hot part.</li>
            <li>There was a short learning curve to wrapping my hair, but I watched a couple you tube videos and got the hang of it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>-less wands seem to be the current great new feature of curling wands according to my family.  </li>
            <li>I have long fine hair and this curls really well.</li>
            <li>hair is long and fine, and I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>It makes great loose or tight curls depending on the tightness of your hair winding.</li>
            <li>included black glove was a nice touch, but please note it&#x27;s made for the left hand and assumes you&#x27;ll be holding the wand on your right.</li>
            <li>The glove does enough to lightly touch the wand through your hair, but it&#x27;s not very thick, so you can&#x27;t really grasp the wand full-palmed without getting quite a bit of heat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is rather long, and it still fit on the barrel.</li>
            <li>I did find that if someone else were wielding the curling wand with my hair, it did create a lovely head of loose, soft curls.</li>
            <li>CI5325 curling wand gets hot very fast, making it a must for those rushed mornings when time is short.</li>
            <li>New to the whole curling hair scene</li>
            <li>My hair used to be very curly, and as I&#x27;ve gotten older and my hair longer, it&#x27;s more of a limp wave.</li>
            <li>My hair feels smooth and soft after using it; maybe the keratin coating, maybe the lack of a traditional curling iron clamp ... either way</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and the curls last all day!</li>
            <li>The wand get very hot quickly and works better than my expensive  Sedu wand.</li>
            <li>I work in a very busy emergency room and the curls held all night!</li>
            <li>Before I get to the office, my hair is a frizzy mess with most curlers.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this curling wand.</li>
            <li>It heats up real fast, &amp; curls quick too, which is good for a girl that is usually running late on school mornings.</li>
            <li>After using, my hair doesn&#x27;t look dried out, it&#x27;s like the keratin infusion makes it look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>For people with normal or courser hair</li>
            <li>For people with normal or courser hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since gotten the hang of it, it now takes the same amount of time to curl my mane as it does with my old iron, with the added bonus of a quick heating iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Goody Iron took only 2 minutes to give me strong, definite curls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty certain that unless you have long hair, that this wand will not work out well for you</li>
            <li>In the English version you gave 4 distinct heat settings, on this one there is a dial with no indication of what is hot and what is low-</li>
            <li>he did not expect it to be 120v&lt;br /&gt;Because all new devices 220v</li>
            <li>But I have a new haircut</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not wanting to learn a new trick, then this might not be the product for you...</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re a professional hairstylist, or you have very long hair of all the same length (which notably is the case with the model they&#x27;re showing here)</li>
            <li>wand heated up very quickly and I didn&#x27;t experience any temperature fluctuations like I sometimes do with a typical curling iron.</li>
            <li>am taking this down to my hairdresser and let her show me effective techniques because so far, all I have gotten is very loose curls which really don&#x27;t stay.  </li>
            <li>It was just ok; the elliptical shape of that one made strange dents in my hair and made my ends look dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with a clampless curling iron and it will be my last.  </li>
            <li>Frankly, I&#x27;m always looking for products to make styling my hair quicker and easier, and this is the exact opposite.  </li>
            <li>So in other words... it is so worth it!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even get hot enough for the hair to hold a curl.</li>
            <li>and when I came back, it was already hot.</li>
            <li>decided to purchase it without looking around my local stores first.</li>
            <li>It may be that my hair just wasn&#x27;t long enough or is too fine to use this product to its fullest extent.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t really that big a deal because in the end there&#x27;s only three temperatures: hot, really-fricking-hot, and everything in between.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my hair kept slipping right back off ...</li>
            <li>She has real long straight hair, &amp; it curls it just the way she wants it.</li>
            <li>handle isn&#x27;t cumbersome, but it is large -- larger than the actual barrel, which is fairly large on</li>
            <li>figured that my hair just wasn&#x27;t meant to be curled, and I started looking for a curling wand that would help me achieve a curl closer to my scalp in hopes that if my curls weren&#x27;t going to last, at least they&#x27;d look a little better before they went away :)</li>
            <li>You want to get as much hair wrapped around the wand as possible,</li>
            <li>otherwise the end that was left out will be straight and you&#x27;ll have a curl that almost looks like it has a tail.  </li>
            <li>Well since you have to hold the hair in place with your hand, to get all of the hair completely around the wand to finish off the curl</li>
            <li>My curls can last the whole day (and overnight) without hairspray.</li>
            <li>my curls look healthier then with my old curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I decided to retire my old clamp iron.</li>
            <li>Her hair is a bit longer, and its texture is naturally curly.</li>
            <li>tried again after she left but was still unsuccessful in getting much of my hair to curl in a uniform fashion.</li>
            <li>the fact that even I have managed to curl my hair with this without ever burning my hand, without a glove, is testimony to that) and delivers soft, bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>It seems to beat the old style with the clamp.</li>
            <li>It takes much longer when using a regular clamp curling iron.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Strangely enough, the Remington was way too gentle for my hair.</li>
            <li>First, some background: my hair is straight and goes to my shoulders, and has a slight wave.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this only to use until I could afford a much more expensive curling iron..</li>
            <li>but the curls are not tight as I wanted them</li>
            <li>While the wheel \\&quot;clicks\\&quot; when moved, there are no graphic identifiers that specify any particular heat setting</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had to take advantage of this feature with this particular curling iron yet, but it definitely makes me feel</li>
            <li>My daughter wanted this particular iron as her beautician had the same one.</li>
            <li>It comes with a glove to protect your hand and definitely gets hot enough to make a curl that will hold.</li>
            <li>I also tried different settings and, even at a higher temperature, the results were more or less the same - very loose curls that didn&#x27;t hold their shape too</li>
            <li>It is ironic that the very thing that you need to protect your hand from being burned is the same item that makes this iron more difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So, if you have short or medium hair, then you might want to pass on this wand (though I do highly recommend Remington&#x27;s &amp;#34;pearl&amp;#34; curling wand --</li>
            <li>I have long, naturally straight hair.</li>
            <li>The wand just doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to handle layers and the process of trying to curl is tedious at best, first gather a thin strip of same length hair, hold wand in one hand and with other hand wind strip of hair around wand, leave in place for about 30 seconds then turn wand vertically and unwind hair down wand.</li>
            <li>you definitely want to release your hand from this heating product so you can \\&quot;go\\&quot; and put ice on your newly burned fingers...that the glove did not protect.  </li>
            <li>It finally died and I had to search for a new one.</li>
            <li>Only one that I have found that will actually curl my straight hair and keep for hours</li>
            <li>/&gt;Drawbacks, as far as I can tell, are the fact that wearing the glove makes sectioning hair more difficult and I worry about loosing the glove (I&#x27;m really doubting this can be used properly without it).</li>
            <li>The clip-free design and dent free curls are hard to come by.  </li>
            <li>You will burn yourself and it will barely even look like it&#x27;s been curled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The glove provided to help in aiding the curl....was not heavy duty enough because I kept burning my hand.  </li>
            <li>On the cool tip there are also two tiny bumps that catch on to a few strands of hair.</li>
            <li>like to use this with Not-Your-Mother&#x27;s Dry Shampoo to add a little texture and volume, and then a really light spritzing of chi hairspray.</li>
            <li>wand came in the mail 2 days later, and it works great!&lt;br /&gt;You can adjust the heat settings, and the light blinks green when you turn it on, and turns solid green when its at the right temperature.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but a TON of it and all I do is spray a small amount of hairspray in my hair before wrapping my hair around the barrel, my curls last the entire day.</li>
            <li>I am not sure the glove seemed worthy for the job.  </li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fine hair that isn&#x27;t long enough to wrap around the barrel several times, other users may encounter the same difficulties I did.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fine hair that isn&#x27;t long enough to wrap around the barrel several times, other users may encounter the same difficulties I did.</li>
            <li>It works really well though in tandem with my other remmington tapered wand.</li>
            <li>you have to get a lock of hair, make it flat, then as you wrap it around the wand, keep it flat to make as much hair as possible have contact with the wand.</li>
            <li>I own another 1&amp;#34; curling iron that&#x27;s similar in design, however I loathed the clamp, which makes it difficult to work with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not difficult to use, but it does take a little getting used to.</li>
            <li>First off I have pretty thick and a little course hair with natural waves and curls.</li>
            <li>Heats up and cools down fast.</li>
            <li>They did not even make me send the other one back, they sent me a brand new one, no questions asked!</li>
            <li>If I wanted to avoid my ends being straight, I had to actually hold the end pieces of my hair down on the rod.</li>
            <li>I have thin fine hair</li>
            <li>The only other curling irons that work are ones meant for ethnic hair, but those are so hit that they made my hair dry, crunchy, and very damaged feeling.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s ok not the best wand</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sleeker and more tapered and works excellently with shorter hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was great, I loved it.</li>
            <li> Great product for a good price.</li>

            <li> so you have to sit fairly close to the power plug</li>
            <li> So if ya need one for that it&#x60;s good.</li>
            <li> And this gives good curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i am by no means good at doing hair, in fact before i got this wand</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re wanting this type of product, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Unless you are really good with tools, stick to a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use!!  </li>
            <li> i have burned myself a couple of times but so worth the beautiful curls this thing provides!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d not washed it that day, but the wand alone tamed most of the frizz while adding a great shining sheen to my locks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the curls and waves the 1&amp;#34; barrel creates (side note:</li>
            <li> I honestly have to say that I did not have good luck with this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product at a nice price.</li>
            <li> i love it !</li>
            <li> Love this wand!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I got this one!</li>
            <li> Love this wand!</li>
            <li> and I get so many compliments on my hair!</li>
            <li> Love this curling wand!</li>
            <li> This wand has worked magic on my hair!</li>
            <li> I love this wand!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love this wand!</li>
            <li> Amazing and suuuuper cost efficient</li>
            <li> The protectant glove comes in handy as well.</li>
            <li> It is great and leaves my hair nice and smooth</li>
            <li> I Own over 10 curling wands and this is the lightest one which just makes it a lot easier.</li>
            <li> and I liked the ability to regulate the heat and hopefully not burn my hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this wand thinking that it would give me nice spiral curls in my hair.</li>
            <li> she curled looked nice, except for a pointy tip where she would have to hold it away from the iron.  </li>
            <li> The ceramic barrel is really nice.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> And is a nice price compared to others.</li>
            <li> I liked it and I recommned it.</li>
            <li> It gives the perfect curls and it heats up fast</li>
            <li> What I loved even more was their service.</li>
            <li> good news is that it heats very quickly.</li>
            <li> Great price - received quickly.  </li>
            <li> those who do not like that there is no clip: i find it very easy to use after you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Hair slips around very easily.  </li>
            <li> It makes beautiful curls and volume when you get it to work, but it will take time, patience and practice to use for the best results, especially for those of us who depend on the curling iron clip to keep our hair secure while we curl.</li>
            <li> It makes beautiful curls and volume when you get it to work, but it will take time, patience and practice to use for the best results, especially for those of us who depend on the curling iron clip to keep our hair secure while we curl.</li>
            <li> way I do my hair with the wand is super quick and gives my hair a perfect, relaxed, beachy curl.</li>
            <li> Perhaps with lots of practice I might become more adept with this, but after using the old-fashioned curling irons with clamps for over 30 years, learning how to use one all over again</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair, that is not so wavy in some spots, so I use this wand to enhance my waves and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> and i have been able to effectively use this wand on my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the inch curler for my hair, works perfect, and as good as any curling iron will do, but if you use 1 &amp; 1/2 inches you&#x27;re going to have to use hair spray definitely</li>
            <li> I love love love love this wand!</li>
            <li> I was debating between 3 and 4 stars but gave it 4 because it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li> This would be good for a quick section touch-up.</li>
            <li> This curing wand gets good and hot and holds my curls all day!</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and still look fantastic!</li>
            <li> THEY LOVE THE CURL.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I am curler challenged but I love the wavy beach curl look.  </li>
            <li> I equally love this 1 inch one.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many curling irons and clipless wands I have had.</li>
            <li> I always find Remington products to be a better bargain for the price they are listed for.</li>
            <li> this means you have to have your finger practically touching the iron.  </li>
            <li> then this might work for you, but that&#x27;s not the case for most women.  </li>
            <li> but I have better ones.</li>
            <li> I was in the middle of curling my hair for my best friends surprise engagement</li>
            <li> and I love how it looks curled.</li>
            <li> I really love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> A better name for this \\&quot;Curling Wand\\&quot; would be the \\&quot;WAVE Wand.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Not everyone relies on being able to hold the tip, but I find that it helps me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave dents or bumps or creases.</li>
            <li> my best tip would be, the next time you are at the mall, watch how the girls who are selling those $80 curling wands do it.</li>
            <li> that said, this is my favorite curling wand, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t regret buying this tool either! :)</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to turn the car around on mornings when I can&#x27;t remember for sure.</li>
            <li> but i am able to style it into the 40s</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> The Remington did give my hair more volume, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I saw this was one of the more cheaper wands on Amazon that were 1 inch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> She feels she can use a lower heat and get better curls with the clamp.  </li>
            <li> and it never lasted more than an hour.</li>
            <li> and you can do many hairstyles with it</li>
            <li> /&gt;She was very excited... until she used it.  </li>
            <li> The product works amazing and gives me full beach curls that I love.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for my long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally bummed too because this seemed to fit my needs perfectly.</li>
            <li> This one comes with a glove, which is nice even though I honestly only used it when getting used to the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing wand at a great price.</li>
            <li> It gave me the perfect loose curls I wanted.</li>
            <li> very useful and works fine!</li>
            <li> Works great and helps control my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worked great for me so far.</li>
            <li> This isabsolutely the BEST $20 I&#x27;ve ever spent on my hair</li>
            <li> This wand is really good and heats up really fast</li>
            <li> easy to use</li>
            <li> This curling iron is easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> curling iron is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an uncomplicated curling wand that&#x27;s easy to handle (thank God for swivel cords)</li>
            <li> Easy to use and curled my hair well.</li>
            <li> My wife has owned Remington products before, making this an easy choice since we know what to expect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> gets hot very quickly and is a really nice size for looser curls.</li>
            <li> I used this curling iron and wow, my curl was amazing and lasted all night!</li>
            <li> I am VERY happy with this, and I wasn&#x27;t planning on such good quality for the low price</li>
            <li> She loves this iron and states it takes only minutes to get beautiful girls.</li>
            <li> , which are beautiful and polished and lasting.</li>
            <li> It works fine but just not 5 star quality.</li>
            <li> bottom line is that the REMINGTON KERATIN THERAPY CURLING WAND curls hair just fine.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine and somewhat wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It heated up just fine and the bits of hair</li>
            <li> My hair is just below shoulder length, and though I have a lot of it the texture is fine.</li>
            <li> Best iv ever used and my hair is long and thick, and it holds the curl in great!!!</li>
            <li> different types including most recently a model from the hairdresser, I can safely say this is the best product out there to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> When it came I was mystified by it being a wand not having a way to secure the hair in clamp.  </li>
            <li> The light on the wand was off</li>
            <li> The curls are smooth every time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used curing irons and heated curlers before, but never one without a way to secure the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fortunately, the elimination of the clamp in favor of the wand has made a huge difference in terms of handling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Her hair looks fabulous in no time at all.</li>
            <li> My awesome and very understanding hair stylist recommended I try a curling wand and low and behold</li>
            <li> I can only say that I think this product will be very nice</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for those beautiful loose curls</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with the product and will recommend it to friends and Amazon browsers. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use once you master the wrapping technique (</li>
            <li> Easy to use and creates nice, soft curls with her hair.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful and loose!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s original packaging.</li>
            <li> I do have to admit that I&#x27;m more of a hot rollers person because I can put the rollers in and multi-task.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terribly expensive, and well not make you regret spending $100 or more.</li>
            <li> I got my curling wand yesterday and was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li> She was extremely excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> It works very well, and it came with a glove that I could use until I became more familiar and comfortable with the product.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I like this more than a regular curling iron, but the variety is nice.</li>
            <li> Not sure this is the magical answer to those beautiful spiral curls</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> The size is great for a medium not too tight/not too loose curl.</li>
            <li> This curling wand is definitely not for someone who is looking for a fast, easy way to curl their hair and is not overly experienced with a range of products on the market.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Burning my hand wasn&#x27;t an issue because they included a specially made glove for it.</li>
            <li> and it not work right out of the gate!</li>
            <li> It normally responds very easily to any curling iron.</li>
            <li> Works great and makes really pretty curls that last.</li>
            <li> My daughter first purchased this curling wand and her hair looked great AFTER about a month of almost daily use, thus practice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the REMINGTON KERATIN THERAPY CURLING WAND is a good curling iron, it&#x27;s being designated as a back-up to the traditional curling iron ...</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good curling iron</li>
            <li> I have very curly kinky frizzy hair, but not in a manageable and sexy way like all the hollywood stars.</li>
            <li> * Cool tip &amp; glove.</li>
            <li> i love so much and a friend of mine said her daughters hair just doesn&#x27;t hold a curl</li>
            <li> The curl or better, coil, had a straight end, which bugged me to no degree.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of no little crimp in the curl where the clamp held the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> Luckily, this takes almost no time</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li> It was quickly sent to me and everything that it said it was on the add.</li>
            <li> It heats up really quickly, and has an adjustable heat range.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I found this one just in time.</li>
            <li> Quick heat up.</li>
            <li> it heats up quickly and has adjustable settings.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> With this product, while of high quality, using the glove and wrap technique, she finds requires more temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Get very hot.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this new stylish hair tool would be helpful in styling my hair.  </li>
            <li> Works really well on my hair and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Such a good value - and really holds a curl!</li>
            <li> My curls held all day and the second day curls were even better!</li>
            <li> I first bought this in Australia and was hoping to find a comparable US product, but after buying 6 (not kidding!)</li>
            <li> Makes my hair in pretty waves that stay!</li>
            <li> The curls come out great and hold strong for at least 5-6 hours with no product being used.</li>
            <li> Curls last and look amazing</li>
            <li> As a pre-teen learning to style my own hair, I could spend countless hours practicing.</li>
            <li> But for the price its pretty cool</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
            <li> The glove is useful.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite curling tool</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the old school style wands, with the metal clip arm, for most of my life.</li>
            <li> maybe for a hair stylist who has spent many hours perfecting her trade is able to have success at this \\&quot;simple\\&quot; wrap.  </li>
            <li> curlers\\&quot; because they are supposed to give more naturally looking</li>
            <li> My hair rarely holds a curl.</li>
            <li> In a more hospitable environment, I&#x27;m sure it would last much longer.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my 12 year old for her birthday last month and so far she says it&#x27;s the greatest ever!!!!</li>
            <li> I thought I would give it a try although months later I&#x27;m still struggling to get a decent curl, get that curl to start closer to the crown of my head rather than at my temple, which then leaves my hair flat on top and curly at the bottom and isn&#x27;t a really good look.</li>
            <li> and it had been confirmed as New</li>
            <li> so I know that the temperature set for this curling wand is exactly the right</li>
            <li> Firstly, I should probably clarify that I naturally have type 2A/2B (&amp;#34;wurly&amp;#34;) hair that holds curls really well without styling products or hairspray -- so I can&#x27;t really comment on whether or not this works with straight hair, since I use this hair tool primarily to make my wavy/curly hair more uniform and</li>
            <li> I liked that the cord was a long enough length to be able to maneuver the wand without pulling the plug out of the wall.</li>
            <li> I liked that the cord was a long enough length to be able to maneuver the wand without pulling the plug out of the wall.</li>
            <li> My hair is more like Merida&#x27;s, from Brave, if someone wet her down and put her through a spin cycle.</li>
            <li> i have very straight, long(over 24\\&quot; hair)</li>
            <li> The barrel/wand heats quickly and its ceramic construction offers a nice \\&quot;slick\\&quot; surface that allows hair to simply slip off ...</li>
            <li> I really like the design -- which is better suited for longer lengths -- and that this wand heats quickly and includes multiple heat settings.</li>
            <li> I was seeking because thus far I haven&#x27;t been able to achieve any decent looking curl from this wand.</li>
            <li> gets hot fast, stays hot!</li>
            <li> This curling iron gets really hot and it does not damage my hair.</li>
            <li> Most electrical beauty products should be versatile for use outside the US.</li>
            <li> but ok, doesn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li> The iron heated pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be sure to watch a video on how to use a wand because it is different from a curling iron since it doesn&#x27;t have a clamp to hold your hair.</li>
            <li> In this case, paying more isn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
            <li> Not wearing it isn&#x27;t an option since it&#x27;s hot even through the glove, but while wearing the glove</li>
            <li> Had the first one for over a year and never had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> I tried a different outlet to be sure, no bueno.</li>
            <li> This curling wand stopped working the first time that I used it.</li>
            <li> I have hot rollers, and have never quite figured out how to use them.</li>
            <li> This styling wand gives me the look I wanted from hot rollers, but could never get.</li>
            <li> The Remington CI5325 Keratin Therapy Curling Wand is exactly what I want in a hair curling product.  </li>
            <li> then I really suggest this!</li>
            <li> now i love curling it, and the only reason i knew how was by watching the girls at the mall.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really pleased with the low price.</li>
            <li> It curls very well!</li>
            <li> This is my first clampless curling wand.</li>
            <li> make sure you do some looking around before settling with this one.&lt;br /&gt;One might be on sale at a local retailer of yours!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably me more than the tool, but I only used it once.  </li>
            <li> She uses this curling wand now with more ease although initially she had difficulty and suffered some burns despite using the provided glove.</li>
            <li> I would definitely order from them again :)</li>
            <li> As an adult with a full-time job, busy social schedule, and a house full of chores, I just can’t spare that kind of time to figure this curling iron out.</li>
            <li> If you have previously used and liked clip-less curling wands, you will likely be satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li> The best feature, however, is the swivel base of the power cord eliminates the cord from tangling ... makes you wonder why this feature isn&#x27;t on most electric household</li>
            <li> otherwise you could really do yourself damage with a hot iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not completely given up on curling wands, and would like to try a 1/2\\&quot; barrel that may be more suited for my hair type and length.error for what will work for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not completely given up on curling wands, and would like to try a 1/2\\&quot; barrel that may be more suited for my hair type and length.</li>
            <li> I was pretty unsure about this whole curling wand thing</li>
            <li> After I curl all my hair in sections, I let them cool completely.</li>
            <li> I did notice my hair was shinier than normal but using this cumbersome tool wasn&#x27;t worth the shine.</li>
            <li> It has the feel of a good quality product, not cheap or rattley like some products that are available at the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t love is having to hold the hair while the curl heats, but the end result makes curls that look much more natural than those made with a traditional curling iron with a clamp.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new 1-inch curling iron and the Remington CI5325 Keratin Therapy Curling Wand looked intriguing.</li>
            <li> They curl my hair easily and the curls last for days.</li>
            <li> Excellent on my very long thick hair.</li>
            <li> and this gives me a nice curl, nothing too tight.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair and you want to have it hold all day the same as when you rolled it , I suggest a thermal protectant that has hold to it.</li>
            <li> This wand includes a heat resistant glove which I highly suggest using the first couple times you use the wand since it gets up to 400 degrees (I think).</li>
            <li> I really think it should be a lot easier than this is.</li>
            <li> If you fall under that criteria then maybe this will work for you, but my hair is shoulder-length and layered, and it was an absolute nightmare trying to curl it with this.  </li>
            <li> The glove doesn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li> I really like the ease of using this wand.</li>
            <li> I was getting ready for a party, plugged it in, went to answer the phone</li>
            <li> and I think anything much shorter would not work with this wand.  </li>
            <li> My daughter really loves this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very</li>
            <li> The glove is meant to fit on the left hand, so some users may need to adapt the way they use this</li>
            <li> this product seemed to work better as the hair didn&#x27;t keep slipping off the barrel even when wound around it three to four times.</li>

            <li> I have no idea if the keratin thing is really what&#x27;s doing the job, but my hair looks healthier/shinier AFTER I curl it than before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking about a scenario where most mornings I&#x27;m walking through wet fog.</li>
            <li> I really despised using this machine.</li>
            <li> The curl didn&#x27;t hold very well either.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This remington keratin therapy curling wand was not what I expected, it didn&#x27;t leave a curl more like a wave</li>
            <li> It really took some time to get used to it, but after that it seemed effortless.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really appreciated their trust and honor.  </li>
            <li> The REMINGTON KERATIN THERAPY CURLING WAND offers an alternative to the standard curling iron by taking away the tried-and-true clip that accompanies most curling irons.  </li>
            <li> The iron gets really hot and there&#x27;s no way you&#x27;re holding your hair directly around the hot part.</li>
            <li> There was a short learning curve to wrapping my hair, but I watched a couple you tube videos and got the hang of it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> -less wands seem to be the current great new feature of curling wands according to my family.  </li>
            <li> I have long fine hair and this curls really well.</li>
            <li> hair is long and fine, and I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> It makes great loose or tight curls depending on the tightness of your hair winding.</li>
            <li> included black glove was a nice touch, but please note it&#x27;s made for the left hand and assumes you&#x27;ll be holding the wand on your right.</li>
            <li> The glove does enough to lightly touch the wand through your hair, but it&#x27;s not very thick, so you can&#x27;t really grasp the wand full-palmed without getting quite a bit of heat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is rather long, and it still fit on the barrel.</li>
            <li> I did find that if someone else were wielding the curling wand with my hair, it did create a lovely head of loose, soft curls.</li>
            <li> CI5325 curling wand gets hot very fast, making it a must for those rushed mornings when time is short.</li>
            <li> New to the whole curling hair scene</li>
            <li> My hair used to be very curly, and as I&#x27;ve gotten older and my hair longer, it&#x27;s more of a limp wave.</li>
            <li> My hair feels smooth and soft after using it; maybe the keratin coating, maybe the lack of a traditional curling iron clamp ... either way</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and the curls last all day!</li>
            <li> The wand get very hot quickly and works better than my expensive  Sedu wand.</li>
            <li> I work in a very busy emergency room and the curls held all night!</li>
            <li> Before I get to the office, my hair is a frizzy mess with most curlers.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this curling wand.</li>
            <li> It heats up real fast, &amp; curls quick too, which is good for a girl that is usually running late on school mornings.</li>
            <li> After using, my hair doesn&#x27;t look dried out, it&#x27;s like the keratin infusion makes it look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> For people with normal or courser hair</li>
            <li> For people with normal or courser hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since gotten the hang of it, it now takes the same amount of time to curl my mane as it does with my old iron, with the added bonus of a quick heating iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Goody Iron took only 2 minutes to give me strong, definite curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty certain that unless you have long hair, that this wand will not work out well for you</li>
            <li> In the English version you gave 4 distinct heat settings, on this one there is a dial with no indication of what is hot and what is low-</li>
            <li> he did not expect it to be 120v&lt;br /&gt;Because all new devices 220v</li>
            <li> But I have a new haircut</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not wanting to learn a new trick, then this might not be the product for you...</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a professional hairstylist, or you have very long hair of all the same length (which notably is the case with the model they&#x27;re showing here)</li>
            <li> wand heated up very quickly and I didn&#x27;t experience any temperature fluctuations like I sometimes do with a typical curling iron.</li>
            <li> am taking this down to my hairdresser and let her show me effective techniques because so far, all I have gotten is very loose curls which really don&#x27;t stay.  </li>
            <li> It was just ok; the elliptical shape of that one made strange dents in my hair and made my ends look dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with a clampless curling iron and it will be my last.  </li>
            <li> Frankly, I&#x27;m always looking for products to make styling my hair quicker and easier, and this is the exact opposite.  </li>
            <li> So in other words... it is so worth it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even get hot enough for the hair to hold a curl.</li>
            <li> and when I came back, it was already hot.</li>
            <li> decided to purchase it without looking around my local stores first.</li>
            <li> It may be that my hair just wasn&#x27;t long enough or is too fine to use this product to its fullest extent.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t really that big a deal because in the end there&#x27;s only three temperatures: hot, really-fricking-hot, and everything in between.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it my hair kept slipping right back off ...</li>
            <li> She has real long straight hair, &amp; it curls it just the way she wants it.</li>
            <li> handle isn&#x27;t cumbersome, but it is large -- larger than the actual barrel, which is fairly large on</li>
            <li> figured that my hair just wasn&#x27;t meant to be curled, and I started looking for a curling wand that would help me achieve a curl closer to my scalp in hopes that if my curls weren&#x27;t going to last, at least they&#x27;d look a little better before they went away :)</li>
            <li> You want to get as much hair wrapped around the wand as possible,</li>
            <li> otherwise the end that was left out will be straight and you&#x27;ll have a curl that almost looks like it has a tail.  </li>
            <li> Well since you have to hold the hair in place with your hand, to get all of the hair completely around the wand to finish off the curl</li>
            <li> My curls can last the whole day (and overnight) without hairspray.</li>
            <li> my curls look healthier then with my old curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I decided to retire my old clamp iron.</li>
            <li> Her hair is a bit longer, and its texture is naturally curly.</li>
            <li> tried again after she left but was still unsuccessful in getting much of my hair to curl in a uniform fashion.</li>
            <li> the fact that even I have managed to curl my hair with this without ever burning my hand, without a glove, is testimony to that) and delivers soft, bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> It seems to beat the old style with the clamp.</li>
            <li> It takes much longer when using a regular clamp curling iron.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Strangely enough, the Remington was way too gentle for my hair.</li>
            <li> First, some background: my hair is straight and goes to my shoulders, and has a slight wave.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this only to use until I could afford a much more expensive curling iron..</li>
            <li> but the curls are not tight as I wanted them</li>
            <li> While the wheel \\&quot;clicks\\&quot; when moved, there are no graphic identifiers that specify any particular heat setting</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to take advantage of this feature with this particular curling iron yet, but it definitely makes me feel</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this particular iron as her beautician had the same one.</li>
            <li> It comes with a glove to protect your hand and definitely gets hot enough to make a curl that will hold.</li>
            <li> I also tried different settings and, even at a higher temperature, the results were more or less the same - very loose curls that didn&#x27;t hold their shape too</li>
            <li> It is ironic that the very thing that you need to protect your hand from being burned is the same item that makes this iron more difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So, if you have short or medium hair, then you might want to pass on this wand (though I do highly recommend Remington&#x27;s &amp;#34;pearl&amp;#34; curling wand --</li>
            <li> I have long, naturally straight hair.</li>
            <li> The wand just doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to handle layers and the process of trying to curl is tedious at best, first gather a thin strip of same length hair, hold wand in one hand and with other hand wind strip of hair around wand, leave in place for about 30 seconds then turn wand vertically and unwind hair down wand.</li>
            <li> you definitely want to release your hand from this heating product so you can \\&quot;go\\&quot; and put ice on your newly burned fingers...that the glove did not protect.  </li>
            <li> It finally died and I had to search for a new one.</li>
            <li> Only one that I have found that will actually curl my straight hair and keep for hours</li>
            <li> /&gt;Drawbacks, as far as I can tell, are the fact that wearing the glove makes sectioning hair more difficult and I worry about loosing the glove (I&#x27;m really doubting this can be used properly without it).</li>
            <li> The clip-free design and dent free curls are hard to come by.  </li>
            <li> You will burn yourself and it will barely even look like it&#x27;s been curled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The glove provided to help in aiding the curl....was not heavy duty enough because I kept burning my hand.  </li>
            <li> On the cool tip there are also two tiny bumps that catch on to a few strands of hair.</li>
            <li> like to use this with Not-Your-Mother&#x27;s Dry Shampoo to add a little texture and volume, and then a really light spritzing of chi hairspray.</li>
            <li> wand came in the mail 2 days later, and it works great!&lt;br /&gt;You can adjust the heat settings, and the light blinks green when you turn it on, and turns solid green when its at the right temperature.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but a TON of it and all I do is spray a small amount of hairspray in my hair before wrapping my hair around the barrel, my curls last the entire day.</li>
            <li> I am not sure the glove seemed worthy for the job.  </li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fine hair that isn&#x27;t long enough to wrap around the barrel several times, other users may encounter the same difficulties I did.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fine hair that isn&#x27;t long enough to wrap around the barrel several times, other users may encounter the same difficulties I did.</li>
            <li> It works really well though in tandem with my other remmington tapered wand.</li>
            <li> you have to get a lock of hair, make it flat, then as you wrap it around the wand, keep it flat to make as much hair as possible have contact with the wand.</li>
            <li> I own another 1&amp;#34; curling iron that&#x27;s similar in design, however I loathed the clamp, which makes it difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not difficult to use, but it does take a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> First off I have pretty thick and a little course hair with natural waves and curls.</li>
            <li> Heats up and cools down fast.</li>
            <li> They did not even make me send the other one back, they sent me a brand new one, no questions asked!</li>
            <li> If I wanted to avoid my ends being straight, I had to actually hold the end pieces of my hair down on the rod.</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair</li>
            <li> The only other curling irons that work are ones meant for ethnic hair, but those are so hit that they made my hair dry, crunchy, and very damaged feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sort of an old dog, so I&#x27;m just not sure about learning this new trick.  </li>
            <li> The second problem is that if your hair has any layers to it at all the shorter layers will slip through and unwind themselves from the wand during the curling process, meaning you&#x27;re either missing strands or you have to go back through and curl every single individual layer - which of course is going to be very time-consuming.  </li>
            <li> other claim of \\&quot;simply\\&quot; wrap your hair around the barrel is far fetched...</li>
            <li> She complained that it didn&#x27;t get hot enough for her to get the curl that she wanted.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair, so it didn&#x27;t get quite hot enough for the effect I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ve noticed a real difference in the quality of my curls, however.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To put it simply, I can&#x27;t imagine this working for anyone unless they have long hair of all one length.  </li>
            <li> If it does hold the curl, it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> so here I am, writing a positive, yet negative review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use a blow-dryer until a couple of years ago, and have been slowly taking on new hair challenges since then :) I had finally almost figured out how to make my hair look presentable with my regular curling iron, but was always frustrated when it wouldn&#x27;t look natural and my curls would fall out and look ratty just hours</li>
            <li> My hair is long (mid-back length)</li>
            <li> After several tries, this is already in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This added ingredient made my hair feel definitely softer but paradoxically harder to curl.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the tight curl look, run your fingers or a loose tooth comb/brush through them once COMPLETELY cooled, and then spray from the bottom and scrunch upwards.</li>
            <li> The only reason it is cheaper is because the heat doesn&#x27;t actually say any temperatures in numbers, its just a scroll that can go up or down and anywhere in between.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast, give long lasting, bouncy, shiny curls!&lt;br /&gt;I have medium-thick, long, somewhat coarse hair; it can be very hard to curl!</li>
            <li> My hair is very long (to the tips of my shoulder blades) and it takes about 35 minutes to do all of my hair.</li>
            <li> I will try it a few more times when I have time to do so, but for now, I’m just not impressed with how this works.</li>
            <li> I found the time and effort required to effortlessly use this curling wand without getting burned was not worth replacing the traditional curling iron.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a pretty thin glove.)  </li>
            <li> It gave me really loose waves instead of curls.</li>
            <li> so I can do loose waves with that one.</li>
            <li> The heat settings are adjusted by using a mouse-wheel device on the handle that simply scrolls up or down.  </li>
            <li> There is very little the same between these supposedly same things</li>
            <li> After I had wrapped my long, fairly thick tresses around the clipless wand for about 5 minutes, I found that the curls came out too soft and loose.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my husband isn&#x27;t willing to be my personal hair dresser every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had previously been using a regular curling iron, but felt like it didn&#x27;t give me the curl I was going for</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for tight curls, then you need a smaller curling wand.</li>
            <li> the only thing is that it has two little bumps on the end that catch your hair</li>
            <li> I wanted to try one, and it initially took a little practice</li>
            <li> However, the only limitation to this product is the heat setting isn&#x27;t displayed on the wand, and it is hard to tell which heat setting you are actually on.</li>
            <li> But with this one, my hair holds enough wave to at least not get totally frizzed out.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not I have spent literally hundreds of dollars on curling irons to try to find a &amp;#34;more professional&amp;#34; brand that suits this model.</li>
            <li> This was such a waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron a few months back.</li>
            <li> I got the smaller wand a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I also liked that it is attached to the base by a swivel, which helps keep the cord from tangling.</li>
            <li> I also liked that it is attached to the base by a swivel, which helps keep the cord from tangling.</li>
            <li> You have to hold down the button to turn it off, which means you&#x27;re less likely to accidently turn it off while you&#x27;re still curling your hair.</li>
            <li> I would say it takes at least three times as long as using a standard curling iron and</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t gold the curls like my other wand does.</li>
            <li> of the other \\&quot;benefits\\&quot; associated with the REMINGTON KERATIN THERAPY CURLING WAND include \\&quot;30 heat settings\\&quot; and the Keratin Protein that is infused into the ceramic wand.  </li>
            <li> but you just have to be careful where you place your hands!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if everyone actually uses this, because I usually just stick to one setting, but they&#x27;re there.</li>
            <li> The heat setting is adjusted via a dial -- which is extremely convenient -- but unfortunately doesn&#x27;t include a digitized window or marker to let you know the exact temperature.</li>
            <li> I am usually hopeless when it comes to curling my hair - my hair will not hold a curl from a regular curling iron - and I feel like a beauty queen every time I use this.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I have long hair, both have a few layers although her layers are closer together</li>
            <li> At least this one has a barrel that is the same width from one end to the other and for some reason that makes it slightly easier to hold the hair in place around the wand while</li>
            <li> There is a lot of work involved in using this wand and my arms are tired by the time I&#x27;m finished with only one side of my head, yet even so I am left with sporadic partial waves, definitely not nice spiral curls or anything close.</li>
            <li> I can curl my medium length hair in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> This product does not give curls, instead it smooths, adds body and slight waves.  </li>
            <li> With a typical curling iron, you clip the hair and wrap the curling iron around the hair.</li>
            <li> My previous curling iron took forever</li>
            <li> She uses hair tools even less than I do, but she had an easier time getting her hair to wrap around and stay in place around the barrel.</li>
            <li> thickness if you are hoping to get a tight curl effect.</li>
            <li> I have very long and thick somewhat wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have to put it at the highest for it to atleast work a little.</li>
            <li> this is what she told me about the Curling Wand: I was so excited to try this product and was so quickly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> She couldn&#x27;t say if the keratin helped her hair any as she didn&#x27;t notice any additional smoothness after using this wand for a little over a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There seems to be a very long and difficult learning curve with this product, so be prepared to spend a lot of time practicing and possibly getting burned (literally) along the way despite the glove they include.</li>
            <li> While the wand does come with a protective glove to prevent burns, the whole step of having to use a glove became an inconvenient additional step to an already streamlined process that previously required no thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think that it is because this company makes a bad curling iron or it is poor quality, but it really is not something that is easy to use on yourself.  </li>
            <li> so when I use a traditional curler I get all tangled up and confused</li>
            <li> Give that wavy, messy look that I&#x27;ve been looking for.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: now they want me to pay $10 to ship the broken thing back!</li>
            <li> It burned a chunk of my girlfriends hair off within a few seconds of use.</li>
            <li> A few months ago, I reviewed the Goody Heat Wave Creator Iron for Amazon.</li>
            <li> She tried using the glove, but could not accurately hold her hair in place, and would still get burned anyway</li>
            <li> I have long thin hair</li>
            <li> It takes much longer and makes styling my hair virtually impossible.  </li>
            <li> I wrapped a small section around the wand and tried to hold it in place, but my gloved hand kept losing grip of the end of the hair section.</li>
            <li> As for the Keratin Protein aspect, I found no notable differences in the results from the ordinary curling iron.  </li>
            <li> So usually I will have to straighten my hair, and then curl it.</li>
            <li> The end is plastic which helps, but you will know when your fingers have gone past the plastic.</li>
            <li> I also hate how the dial for the temperature is right</li>
            <li> I was also intrigued that it didn&#x27;t have a clip because I hate the crinkle it leaves if you don&#x27;t do it right.</li>
            <li> It is rather hard to use.  </li>
            <li> It was hard to wrap my hair around</li>
            <li> It transforms my thin, stick-straight boring hair into gorgeous victorias secret hair and it lasts!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very difficult to separate and handle the pieces of hair you want because your hand is encased in what essentially amounts to a velvet snowglove.  </li>
            <li> From what I can tell, very few of my hairs fell out or were broken off when using this product.  </li>
            <li> My wife never thought that this brand would make such a bad product.</li>
            <li> I rate this not good unless you have Kate Middleton hair.</li>
            <li> Using this wand, my hair stays curls for DAYS until I wash it (of course the curls lose a little bounce but still, for days!!!).</li>
            <li> I usually get well defined curls when I use an iron, and this gave me weird waves.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I find this curling wand frustrating and intimidating.</li>
            <li> As a result, I had a very difficult time wrapping even small portions of hair around the wand.</li>
            <li> its very difficult to use...at least to keep the hair on the barrel without burning your hand.  </li>
            <li> My downfall with it tho is that I just feel like I have to keep it on my hair for forever to get the curl I want and a curl that stays which gets a little annoying.</li>
            <li> so technically useless...</li>
            <li> is proving to be difficult.</li>
            <li> Just be wary of hair</li>
            <li> This feature has saved my butt a million times, I&#x27;m sorry to say.</li>
            <li> ; -- I can&#x27;t imagine how difficult it would be to use the 1 1/2&amp;#34; on shorter lengths).</li>
            <li> The glove was useless for me since it got in the way of me separating my hair and taking it off and on in between curling each strand is strictly tedious.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, despite the excitement they had over the product, over time, she has found herself returning to a wand with the clamp.  </li>
            <li> The gloves are useless.  </li>
            <li> For casual days, I like to let it loosen as the day goes for a relaxed look.</li>
            <li> Sad to say, it was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re left-handed, it might feel awkward.</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the product.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when I went to go use this item, and it would not turn on.</li>
            <li> so I hate waiting for curling iron to heat up.</li>
            <li> Very DISAPPOINTED!!!</li>
            <li> So disappointed!!</li>

            <li> Easy to use!!  Works Great!</li>
            <li> This curling iron gets really hot and it does not damage my hair. It gives me any curl that i want and it looks perfect.</li>
            <li> Great wand!!! Only one that I have found that will actually curl my straight hair and keep for hours</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Should have mentioned the voltage restrictions...Most electrical beauty products should be versatile for use outside the US. This only works with 110...so technically useless...why offer internatonal shipping options ....</li>
            <li> perfect curling i have not tried before bust from the first time my hair was great! i love it !</li>
            <li> very useful and works fine!</li>
            <li> It works very well, and it came with a glove that I could use until I became more familiar and comfortable with the product. I wouldn&#x27;t say I like this more than a regular curling iron, but the variety is nice.</li>
            <li> Works great and helps control my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Great product! My curls held all day and the second day curls were even better! Beautiful and loose! :) Perfect for my long hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok not the best wand but ok, doesn&#x27;t get hot enough I have to put it at the highest for it to atleast work a little. Doesn&#x27;t gold the curls like my other wand does.</li>
            <li> Great product! It heats up fast, give long lasting, bouncy, shiny curls!&lt;br /&gt;I have medium-thick, long, somewhat coarse hair; it can be very hard to curl! The only other curling irons that work are ones meant for ethnic hair, but those are so hit that they made my hair dry, crunchy, and very damaged feeling. This I can leave at 300-350 degrees and get beautiful curls last last me two days and still look fantastic! I used it over thanksgiving while cooking and being around heat and humidity, not a hair out of place! I highly recommend this curling wand.</li>
            <li> Great iron! gets hot fast, stays hot!</li>
            <li> BOUGHT 3 OF THESE FOR GRANDDAUGHTERS AT CHRISTMAS. THEY LOVE THE CURL.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new 1-inch curling iron and the Remington CI5325 Keratin Therapy Curling Wand looked intriguing. I liked the idea of no little crimp in the curl where the clamp held the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand comes with a heat-resistant glove to help protect your hand from burns while styling your hair with it. The iron heated pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long and fine, and I have a lot of hair. I wrapped a small section around the wand and tried to hold it in place, but my gloved hand kept losing grip of the end of the hair section. It is ironic that the very thing that you need to protect your hand from being burned is the same item that makes this iron more difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried a similar wand with a tapered barrel and found it to be even more difficult to use than this one. At least this one has a barrel that is the same width from one end to the other and for some reason that makes it slightly easier to hold the hair in place around the wand while curling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this curling wand frustrating and intimidating. Perhaps with lots of practice I might become more adept with this, but after using the old-fashioned curling irons with clamps for over 30 years, learning how to use one all over again is proving to be difficult. As a pre-teen learning to style my own hair, I could spend countless hours practicing. As an adult with a full-time job, busy social schedule, and a house full of chores, I just can’t spare that kind of time to figure this curling iron out. I really think it should be a lot easier than this is. I will try it a few more times when I have time to do so, but for now, I’m just not impressed with how this works.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Works really well on my hair and is easy to use. The protectant glove comes in handy as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent on my very long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling wand after doing some research and watching some videos on how to use wands vs. curling irons. My hair never holds a curl for longer than an hour, but with this wand, it lasts for days! Be sure to watch a video on how to use a wand because it is different from a curling iron since it doesn&#x27;t have a clamp to hold your hair. The benefit though is no clamp marks! This wand includes a heat resistant glove which I highly suggest using the first couple times you use the wand since it gets up to 400 degrees (I think). After I curl all my hair in sections, I let them cool completely. If you don&#x27;t like the tight curl look, run your fingers or a loose tooth comb/brush through them once COMPLETELY cooled, and then spray from the bottom and scrunch upwards. These curls will last for days! Love this wand!</li>
            <li> Believe it or not I have spent literally hundreds of dollars on curling irons to try to find a &amp;#34;more professional&amp;#34; brand that suits this model. I first bought this in Australia and was hoping to find a comparable US product, but after buying 6 (not kidding!) different types including most recently a model from the hairdresser, I can safely say this is the best product out there to curl my hair. In this case, paying more isn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
            <li> The curls do not last.  I have another wand by a different maker, but smaller barrel.  My curls last three days with that thing (no product at all), but with this wand, the curls hardly last three hours.</li>
            <li> It works fine but just not 5 star quality. But for the price its pretty cool</li>
            <li> I use this all of the time. It makes great loose or tight curls depending on the tightness of your hair winding. Heats up and cools down fast.</li>
            <li> works great. easy to use</li>
            <li> I am curler challenged but I love the wavy beach curl look.  My hair is long (mid-back length) so when I use a traditional curler I get all tangled up and confused which way I&#x27;m going.  My awesome and very understanding hair stylist recommended I try a curling wand and low and behold I was able to curl my own hair without getting tangled in it!!</li>
            <li> I already had the 1 1/2 inch wand and I loved it. I equally love this 1 inch one. It is great and leaves my hair nice and smooth</li>
            <li> Amazing and suuuuper cost efficient</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many curling irons and clipless wands I have had. This is by far my favorite! I have long fine hair and this curls really well. The keratin does seem to make it smoother when curling and keeps &amp;#34;fly aways&amp;#34; from happening. It&#x27;s now my go to wand that I use almost daily. The size is great for a medium not too tight/not too loose curl. If you have fine hair and you want to have it hold all day the same as when you rolled it , I suggest a thermal protectant that has hold to it. For casual days, I like to let it loosen as the day goes for a relaxed look.</li>
            <li> I always find Remington products to be a better bargain for the price they are listed for. After two weeks of using this product I have found that the Keratin infused barrel of the wand has given my hair a healthier shine, and the curls will hold for 5+ hours. However, the only limitation to this product is the heat setting isn&#x27;t displayed on the wand, and it is hard to tell which heat setting you are actually on. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The REMINGTON KERATIN THERAPY CURLING WAND offers an alternative to the standard curling iron by taking away the tried-and-true clip that accompanies most curling irons.  While the idea of removing the clip may seem revolutionary in a way, the supposed benefits don&#x27;t seem to justify the learning curve and potential pain that is necessary to master the use of a clip-less curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that the REMINGTON KERATIN THERAPY CURLING WAND curls hair just fine.  The barrel/wand heats quickly and its ceramic construction offers a nice \\&quot;slick\\&quot; surface that allows hair to simply slip off ... no snags or sticks.  Add a clip to this curling iron and it would be perfect.  I found the time and effort required to effortlessly use this curling wand without getting burned was not worth replacing the traditional curling iron.  While the wand does come with a protective glove to prevent burns, the whole step of having to use a glove became an inconvenient additional step to an already streamlined process that previously required no thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the other \\&quot;benefits\\&quot; associated with the REMINGTON KERATIN THERAPY CURLING WAND include \\&quot;30 heat settings\\&quot; and the Keratin Protein that is infused into the ceramic wand.  The heat settings are adjusted by using a mouse-wheel device on the handle that simply scrolls up or down.  While the wheel \\&quot;clicks\\&quot; when moved, there are no graphic identifiers that specify any particular heat setting so it&#x27;s either at the highest heat, lowest heat or one of the remaining 28 settings in between the two (I didn&#x27;t bother counting the clicks).  As for the Keratin Protein aspect, I found no notable differences in the results from the ordinary curling iron.  The best feature, however, is the swivel base of the power cord eliminates the cord from tangling ... makes you wonder why this feature isn&#x27;t on most electric household products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the REMINGTON KERATIN THERAPY CURLING WAND is a good curling iron, it&#x27;s being designated as a back-up to the traditional curling iron ... going clip-less wasn&#x27;t for me.being designated as a back-up to the traditional curling iron ... going clip-less wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with a clampless curling iron and it will be my last.  To put it simply, I can&#x27;t imagine this working for anyone unless they have long hair of all one length.  If you fall under that criteria then maybe this will work for you, but my hair is shoulder-length and layered, and it was an absolute nightmare trying to curl it with this.  I would say it takes at least three times as long as using a standard curling iron and the results weren&#x27;t even as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clamp-free designs means you have to manually wrap your hair around the wand and hold it there in place with your hand, and the problems abound with this.  You want to get as much hair wrapped around the wand as possible, otherwise the end that was left out will be straight and you&#x27;ll have a curl that almost looks like it has a tail.  Well since you have to hold the hair in place with your hand, to get all of the hair completely around the wand to finish off the curl this means you have to have your finger practically touching the iron.  As you can imagine, your fingers get burned, even through the glove and even on the lowest heat setting.  The second problem is that if your hair has any layers to it at all the shorter layers will slip through and unwind themselves from the wand during the curling process, meaning you&#x27;re either missing strands or you have to go back through and curl every single individual layer - which of course is going to be very time-consuming.  The final problem is with the glove itself.  Not wearing it isn&#x27;t an option since it&#x27;s hot even through the glove, but while wearing the glove it&#x27;s very difficult to separate and handle the pieces of hair you want because your hand is encased in what essentially amounts to a velvet snowglove.  And if you have bangs you want to curl, forget it.  You will burn yourself and it will barely even look like it&#x27;s been curled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a professional hairstylist, or you have very long hair of all the same length (which notably is the case with the model they&#x27;re showing here) then this might work for you, but that&#x27;s not the case for most women.  Frankly, I&#x27;m always looking for products to make styling my hair quicker and easier, and this is the exact opposite.  It takes much longer and makes styling my hair virtually impossible.  I just don&#x27;t see why I would want all the hassle.  I&#x27;ve never had a big issue with dents from traditional curling irons and that&#x27;s what I plan to go back to immediately.</li>
            <li> Works great and makes really pretty curls that last. The only reason it is cheaper is because the heat doesn&#x27;t actually say any temperatures in numbers, its just a scroll that can go up or down and anywhere in between. So in other words... it is so worth it! Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> This is the best wand I have ever used. Loved it. Get very hot. Curls last and look amazing</li>
            <li> Give that wavy, messy look that I&#x27;ve been looking for.  The glove doesn&#x27;t do much for me but you just have to be careful where you place your hands!</li>
            <li> First off I have pretty thick and a little course hair with natural waves and curls. I was debating between 3 and 4 stars but gave it 4 because it&#x27;s very light. I Own over 10 curling wands and this is the lightest one which just makes it a lot easier. My downfall with it tho is that I just feel like I have to keep it on my hair for forever to get the curl I want and a curl that stays which gets a little annoying. I also hate how the dial for the temperature is right where I put my hand/thumb which makes me move it around a lot. Overall it&#x27;s a good curling iron but I have better ones.</li>
            <li> It works great, curls my hair well, and if I wanted to, I could create a beachy wave look. My hair is rather long, and it still fit on the barrel. After using, my hair doesn&#x27;t look dried out, it&#x27;s like the keratin infusion makes it look shiny and healthy. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that there are no temperatures on the dial, so you have no way of knowing where you&#x27;re at. On the cool tip there are also two tiny bumps that catch on to a few strands of hair. Overall it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great Price! This curing wand gets good and hot and holds my curls all day! I go between this and my 2 inch wand depending on what look I&#x27;m going for.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is easy to use. It heats up quickly. The glove is useful. The wand gives wonderful results.</li>
            <li> These curling wands are great. They curl my hair easily and the curls last for days.</li>
            <li> Wonderful&lt;br /&gt;But he did not expect it to be 120v&lt;br /&gt;Because all new devices 220v</li>
            <li> I really like the ease of using this wand. I have naturally wavy hair, that is not so wavy in some spots, so I use this wand to enhance my waves and it works perfectly. I can do my  hair in about 10 minutes and I am out the door.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an inexpensive curling wand and I&#x27;m glad I got this one! Works well. I can curl my medium length hair in less than 10 minutes. My curls can last the whole day (and overnight) without hairspray. Note: my hair is fairly thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons: It arrived without it&#x27;s original packaging. I also do not like the dial where you turn up the heat settings. I never know what setting I am at since it is not labeled with the degrees or anything.</li>
            <li> Great curling iron for price. Only gripe is that the cord is too short...so you have to sit fairly close to the power plug</li>
            <li> gets hot very quickly and is a really nice size for looser curls. the only thing is that it has two little bumps on the end that catch your hair</li>
            <li> When I ordered this I had just come back from England where my roomie had just bought the English version of this.  I have thin fine hair and I liked the ability to regulate the heat and hopefully not burn my hair.  I ordered this when I got home, thinking to myself that I was getting a bargain knowing what she had paid for hers.  When it came I was mystified by it being a wand not having a way to secure the hair in clamp.  I understand why it comes with a cloth glove...otherwise you could really do yourself damage with a hot iron.  In the English version you gave 4 distinct heat settings, on this one there is a dial with no indication of what is hot and what is low- yeah, you try putting your fingers on one to find out.&lt;br /&gt;I am taking this down to my hairdresser and let her show me effective techniques because so far, all I have gotten is very loose curls which really don&#x27;t stay.  There is very little the same between these supposedly same things so I suggest Remington put the clamp back , indicate the temp settings and raise the price about $15.00.  I rate this not good unless you have Kate Middleton hair.</li>
            <li> I got it for my daughter, she loves it. She has real long straight hair, &amp; it curls it just the way she wants it. It heats up real fast, &amp; curls quick too, which is good for a girl that is usually running late on school mornings. So if ya need one for that it&#x60;s good.</li>
            <li> My hair has A LOT of difficulty curling. It almost always falls out of the curls within an hour of me curling it. I have very long and thick somewhat wavy hair and it&#x27;s always been a battle if I want to curl it. Using this wand, my hair stays curls for DAYS until I wash it (of course the curls lose a little bounce but still, for days!!!). In fact, my dog chewed the cord on mine and it stopped working and I ordered another one. Had the first one for over a year and never had any problems with it. Definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair, so it didn&#x27;t get quite hot enough for the effect I wanted. It gave me really loose waves instead of curls. It works really well though in tandem with my other remmington tapered wand. It&#x27;s still a great styling tool. Just be wary of hair thickness if you are hoping to get a tight curl effect.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever ordered something and it not work right out of the gate! But lo and behold, I plugged in this iron, no lights, no heat. I tried a different outlet to be sure, no bueno. I&#x27;m totally bummed too because this seemed to fit my needs perfectly. Returned and did not reorder.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite curling tool</li>
            <li> great value and holds a good curl!  very easy to use as well</li>
            <li> I bought this wand thinking that it would give me nice spiral curls in my hair. It does just the opposite. It doesn&#x27;t even get hot enough for the hair to hold a curl. Very DISAPPOINTED!!!</li>
            <li> This curling wand stopped working the first time that I used it. I was in the middle of curling my hair for my best friends surprise engagement and it just stopped working. The light on the wand was off and I kept trying to turn it back on and nothing worked. Highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> perfection. adjustable heat. watch your fingers because the gloves stick to your hair and make it staticy. I cant use the gloves.... i have burned myself a couple of times but so worth the beautiful curls this thing provides!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this only to use until I could afford a much more expensive curling iron.. But I don&#x27;t need to! I am VERY happy with this, and I wasn&#x27;t planning on such good quality for the low price</li>
            <li> Very good wand for the price. Makes my hair in pretty waves that stay!</li>
            <li> My wife never thought that this brand would make such a bad product.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine and somewhat wavy hair. Before I had a child my hair wouldn&#x27;t hold a curl, but since I have had a child it will. And this gives good curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This heats up very quickly. Which is a plus with me. I&#x27;m not someone who likes to spend a lot of time doing my hair so I hate waiting for curling iron to heat up. But I have a new haircut and I love how it looks curled. Luckily, this takes almost no time so I&#x27;ve actually been \\&quot;doing\\&quot; my hair on a fairly regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried that it didn&#x27;t have a clip because I couldn&#x27;t figure out how I was going to wrap my hair around the barrel without burning my fingers. I was also intrigued that it didn&#x27;t have a clip because I hate the crinkle it leaves if you don&#x27;t do it right. This non clip design allows for me to get the curl closer to my scalp and doesn&#x27;t leave crimps, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burning my hand wasn&#x27;t an issue because they included a specially made glove for it. Yay! Overall I am very pleased with the product and will recommend it to friends and Amazon browsers. :)</li>
            <li> I have very curly kinky frizzy hair, but not in a manageable and sexy way like all the hollywood stars. My hair is more like Merida&#x27;s, from Brave, if someone wet her down and put her through a spin cycle. So usually I will have to straighten my hair, and then curl it. This curling iron worked great for both purposes. Granted, my hair had been blow-dried the day before and I&#x27;d not washed it that day, but the wand alone tamed most of the frizz while adding a great shining sheen to my locks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part was it heat up in literally seconds. I was getting ready for a party, plugged it in, went to answer the phone and when I came back, it was already hot. The glove does enough to lightly touch the wand through your hair, but it&#x27;s not very thick, so you can&#x27;t really grasp the wand full-palmed without getting quite a bit of heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the old school style wands, with the metal clip arm, for most of my life. Never again! I have hot rollers, and have never quite figured out how to use them. This styling wand gives me the look I wanted from hot rollers, but could never get.</li>
            <li> The Remington CI5325 Keratin Therapy Curling Wand is exactly what I want in a hair curling product.  It heats up quickly.  It is easy to use.  IT curls your hair and your hair stays curled so I know that the temperature set for this curling wand is exactly the right temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the product description, there is a Keratin protein infused coating on the curling iron&#x27;s barrel, which is ceramic and totally awesome.  This Keratin is supposed to be used to strengthen hair.  From what I can tell, very few of my hairs fell out or were broken off when using this product.  The Keratin on the barrel of the curling iron did not leave a residue that made my hair greasy or anything.  In fact, this was the perfect curling iron for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron is easy to use.  It has a swivel cord, 30 different heat settings, it will automatically shut off and you can have instant heat in thirty seconds.  I would definitely purchase this product for myself or as a gift.  It was just that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natalie Sickles for Amazon Vine</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife to use - this is what she told me about the Curling Wand: I was so excited to try this product and was so quickly disappointed.  The clip-free design and dent free curls are hard to come by.  I kept trying it, thinking it would take practice to get use to no clip.  I will tell you....its very difficult to use...at least to keep the hair on the barrel without burning your hand.  The glove provided to help in aiding the curl....was not heavy duty enough because I kept burning my hand.  I am not sure the glove seemed worthy for the job.  It seemed like a dollar store glove that was included with this product.  I was hoping that this new stylish hair tool would be helpful in styling my hair.  I also am leary of the claim that the Keratin protein infused in the coating of the barrel actually strengthens your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other claim of \\&quot;simply\\&quot; wrap your hair around the barrel is far fetched...maybe for a hair stylist who has spent many hours perfecting her trade is able to have success at this \\&quot;simple\\&quot; wrap.  They say that after the simple wrap around the barrel, hold in place and poof...you have a simple curl produced...they forgot to include that during the process you burned your fingers and they did get the concept correct when they reply \\&quot;release and go\\&quot;...you definitely want to release your hand from this heating product so you can \\&quot;go\\&quot; and put ice on your newly burned fingers...that the glove did not protect.  Disappointed with the product.  Maybe, you could purchase this product after you have been to a couple of days of cosmetology schooling.</li>
            <li> I really love this curling iron.  I wanted to try one, and it initially took a little practice and I did burn myself a couple of times.  Once I got the hang of it, I could whiz through curling my hair in no time.  The trick for me was to not over think curling the strands.  my curls look healthier then with my old curling iron.  I decided to retire my old clamp iron.</li>
            <li> A better name for this \\&quot;Curling Wand\\&quot; would be the \\&quot;WAVE Wand.\\&quot;  This product does not give curls, instead it smooths, adds body and slight waves.  In addition, this wand is NOT for people with shorter hair.  I have mid-back length hair and I think anything much shorter would not work with this wand.  I do have to admit that I&#x27;m more of a hot rollers person because I can put the rollers in and multi-task.  I did find there was a learning curve with trying to section my hair and wrap it around the wand.  I definitely will not be using it on a daily basis for that reason.  This would be good for a quick section touch-up.</li>
            <li> Great product.  My daughter really loves this.  It was quickly sent to me and everything that it said it was on the add.</li>
            <li> With a typical curling iron, you clip the hair and wrap the curling iron around the hair. With this tool, I find myself wrapping the hair around the iron. It&#x27;s not difficult to use, but it does take a little getting used to. It heats up really quickly, and has an adjustable heat range. You have to hold down the button to turn it off, which means you&#x27;re less likely to accidently turn it off while you&#x27;re still curling your hair. The glove is a necessity, but DO NOT think it will protect your fingers. The iron gets really hot and there&#x27;s no way you&#x27;re holding your hair directly around the hot part. The end is plastic which helps, but you will know when your fingers have gone past the plastic. My hair is very long (to the tips of my shoulder blades) and it takes about 35 minutes to do all of my hair.</li>
            <li> I returned this item because my hair is too short.  My fault in ordering.&lt;br /&gt;If I had longer hair it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife who had been begging for one of those \\&quot;no clamp curlers\\&quot; because they are supposed to give more naturally looking curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was very excited... until she used it.  After several tries, this is already in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think that it is because this company makes a bad curling iron or it is poor quality, but it really is not something that is easy to use on yourself.  It heated up just fine and the bits of hair she curled looked nice, except for a pointy tip where she would have to hold it away from the iron.  She tried using the glove, but could not accurately hold her hair in place, and would still get burned anyway (it&#x27;s a pretty thin glove.)  She has already gone back to her clamp style curling iron, and is not burning her fingers anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The keratin coating doesn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference over all, probably just a gimmicky thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I would not recommend a no clamp curling iron at all.  However, if you are dying to try a no clamp curling iron, try this one.  It&#x27;s not terribly expensive, and well not make you regret spending $100 or more.</li>
            <li> The wand get very hot quickly and works better than my expensive  Sedu wand.</li>
            <li> My hair rarely holds a curl. Especially without a lot of product in it. If it does hold the curl, it doesn&#x27;t last long. I used this curling iron and wow, my curl was amazing and lasted all night! My hair was still curly even when I woke up the next morning.</li>
            <li> My curling wand did not work! I was so disappointed when I went to go use this item, and it would not turn on. This was such a waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: now they want me to pay $10 to ship the broken thing back! So disappointed!! Do not recommend buying from this company!</li>
            <li> I got my curling wand yesterday and was so excited to use it. It gave me the perfect loose curls I wanted. I have long, naturally straight hair. I work in a very busy emergency room and the curls held all night! I got home and they still looked just as beautiful as when I curled my hair before work. Everyone was complimenting me on how great my hair looked. If you&#x27;re looking for tight curls, then you need a smaller curling wand. But if you&#x27;re looking for those beautiful loose curls then I really suggest this! Great product.</li>
            <li> Before getting this curling iron, I&#x27;d had one with a clip for years. It finally died and I had to search for a new one. Luckily, I found this one just in time. It&#x27;s worked great for me so far. Here are some things I took note of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Quick heat up. My previous curling iron took forever and I would always start it and then do something else while it heated up. I don&#x27;t find myself having to do that with this one. It&#x27;s very quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Automatic Turn Off. This feature has saved my butt a million times, I&#x27;m sorry to say. I haven&#x27;t had to take advantage of this feature with this particular curling iron yet, but it definitely makes me feel safer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The ceramic barrel is really nice. It helps even out the heat. I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ve noticed a real difference in the quality of my curls, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Cool tip &amp; glove. Both are helpful and have been used every time. Not everyone relies on being able to hold the tip, but I find that it helps me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Lack of Clip. I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave dents or bumps or creases. The curls are smooth every time. It did, however, take me a while to get used to curling without the clip. I watched YouTube videos, had a friend help improve my technique, and practiced a lot. Eventually, you get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Variable heat settings. I don&#x27;t know if everyone actually uses this, because I usually just stick to one setting, but they&#x27;re there.</li>
            <li> This is a Very nice curling iron.  My hair feels smooth and soft after using it; maybe the keratin coating, maybe the lack of a traditional curling iron clamp ... either way, I must say, it&#x27;s nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This takes a bit of finesse to use, I&#x27;m so used to a regular iron.  The first time I used it my hair kept slipping right back off ... I&#x27;ve since gotten the hang of it, it now takes the same amount of time to curl my mane as it does with my old iron, with the added bonus of a quick heating iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawbacks, as far as I can tell, are the fact that wearing the glove makes sectioning hair more difficult and I worry about loosing the glove (I&#x27;m really doubting this can be used properly without it).</li>
            <li> This curling wand is definitely not for someone who is looking for a fast, easy way to curl their hair and is not overly experienced with a range of products on the market. I&#x27;ve used curing irons and heated curlers before, but never one without a way to secure the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curling wand came with a glove to help prevent burns on the hand you use to wrap your hair around the barrel. It may be that my hair just wasn&#x27;t long enough or is too fine to use this product to its fullest extent. My hair is just below shoulder length, and though I have a lot of it the texture is fine. As a result, I had a very difficult time wrapping even small portions of hair around the wand. Using hair products to aid in the process didn&#x27;t help either. Since I was not getting anywhere with this curling wand, I let my sister use it during a recent visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her experience was quite different from mine. Her hair is a bit longer, and its texture is naturally curly. She uses hair tools even less than I do, but she had an easier time getting her hair to wrap around and stay in place around the barrel. She did burn herself a couple of times even with using the glove. The glove does help but isn&#x27;t as heatproof as it needs to be. She couldn&#x27;t say if the keratin helped her hair any as she didn&#x27;t notice any additional smoothness after using this wand for a little over a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried again after she left but was still unsuccessful in getting much of my hair to curl in a uniform fashion. I did find that if someone else were wielding the curling wand with my hair, it did create a lovely head of loose, soft curls. It wasn&#x27;t as awkward to use on another person&#x27;s hair as it was on my own. Unfortunately my husband isn&#x27;t willing to be my personal hair dresser every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand heated up very quickly and I didn&#x27;t experience any temperature fluctuations like I sometimes do with a typical curling iron. There are no heat level markings, so be prepared for trial and error for what will work for you. I liked that the cord was a long enough length to be able to maneuver the wand without pulling the plug out of the wall. I also liked that it is attached to the base by a swivel, which helps keep the cord from tangling. The glove is meant to fit on the left hand, so some users may need to adapt the way they use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fine hair that isn&#x27;t long enough to wrap around the barrel several times, other users may encounter the same difficulties I did. For people with normal or courser hair this product seemed to work better as the hair didn&#x27;t keep slipping off the barrel even when wound around it three to four times. It makes beautiful curls and volume when you get it to work, but it will take time, patience and practice to use for the best results, especially for those of us who depend on the curling iron clip to keep our hair secure while we curl. I&#x27;ve not completely given up on curling wands, and would like to try a 1/2\\&quot; barrel that may be more suited for my hair type and length.error for what will work for you.

            <li> The Remington keratin therapy curling iron has been a great tool for me. The curls come out great and hold strong for at least 5-6 hours with no product being used. i have very straight, long(over 24\\&quot; hair) and i have been able to effectively use this wand on my hair. it heats up quickly and has adjustable settings. my hair doesnt feel damaged in any way after using this wand over 10 times. i would recommend this to others without hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to those who do not like that there is no clip: i find it very easy to use after you get the hang of it. my best tip would be, the next time you are at the mall, watch how the girls who are selling those $80 curling wands do it. i always glance at them when i see them and they have a very specific technique they use with clip-less curling wands. watch a couple you tube videos. you have to get a lock of hair, make it flat, then as you wrap it around the wand, keep it flat to make as much hair as possible have contact with the wand. you cannot just wad all your hair over the same spot and expect it to heat your hair enough to create curls. there IS technique involved and watching someone who knows what they&#x27;re doing makes all the difference. i am by no means good at doing hair, in fact before i got this wand i hadn&#x27;t curled my hair in years! now i love curling it, and the only reason i knew how was by watching the girls at the mall.</li>
            <li> It is rather hard to use.  Hair slips around very easily.  The glove helps, but . . I&#x27;d not buy it again.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this particular iron as her beautician had the same one. She loves this iron and states it takes only minutes to get beautiful girls.</li>
            <li> My gf didn&#x27;t like this for her hair. She complained that it didn&#x27;t get hot enough for her to get the curl that she wanted.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I should probably clarify that I naturally have type 2A/2B (&amp;#34;wurly&amp;#34;) hair that holds curls really well without styling products or hairspray -- so I can&#x27;t really comment on whether or not this works with straight hair, since I use this hair tool primarily to make my wavy/curly hair more uniform and polished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, this is my favorite curling wand, and I absolutely love it. I own another 1&amp;#34; curling iron that&#x27;s similar in design, however I loathed the clamp, which makes it difficult to work with. Fortunately, the elimination of the clamp in favor of the wand has made a huge difference in terms of handling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that it heats very quickly. The heat setting is adjusted via a dial -- which is extremely convenient -- but unfortunately doesn&#x27;t include a digitized window or marker to let you know the exact temperature. This isn&#x27;t really that big a deal because in the end there&#x27;s only three temperatures: hot, really-fricking-hot, and everything in between. For me, the low to low-mid temperature does the job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle isn&#x27;t cumbersome, but it is large -- larger than the actual barrel, which is fairly large on it&#x27;s own. I&#x27;m pretty certain that unless you have long hair, that this wand will not work out well for you (and that&#x27;s only the 1&amp;#34; -- I can&#x27;t imagine how difficult it would be to use the 1 1/2&amp;#34; on shorter lengths). So, if you have short or medium hair, then you might want to pass on this wand (though I do highly recommend Remington&#x27;s &amp;#34;pearl&amp;#34; curling wand -- it&#x27;s sleeker and more tapered and works excellently with shorter hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion I really like the design -- which is better suited for longer lengths -- and that this wand heats quickly and includes multiple heat settings. I&#x27;m very pleased with the curls and waves the 1&amp;#34; barrel creates (side note: do not underestimate how big the barrel is!), which are beautiful and polished and lasting. It&#x27;s an uncomplicated curling wand that&#x27;s easy to handle (thank God for swivel cords) and I&#x27;m really pleased with the low price.</li>
            <li> I love love love love this wand! It heats up quickly and the curls last all day! My hair used to be very curly, and as I&#x27;ve gotten older and my hair longer, it&#x27;s more of a limp wave. This wand gives me body and shine. I just crank it up to the highest heat level (the one drawback is you can&#x27;t tell the temp b/c it isn&#x27;t indicated) and let it roll.</li>
            <li> Love this wand! Best iv ever used and my hair is long and thick, and it holds the curl in great!!!</li>
            <li> It curls very well! And is a nice price compared to others. I would recommend this if you are into the medium sized curls.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying that I am hairstyle-challenged. I didn&#x27;t even use a blow-dryer until a couple of years ago, and have been slowly taking on new hair challenges since then :) I had finally almost figured out how to make my hair look presentable with my regular curling iron, but was always frustrated when it wouldn&#x27;t look natural and my curls would fall out and look ratty just hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured that my hair just wasn&#x27;t meant to be curled, and I started looking for a curling wand that would help me achieve a curl closer to my scalp in hopes that if my curls weren&#x27;t going to last, at least they&#x27;d look a little better before they went away :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost bought this one on amazon but ended up trying out the non-keratin elliptical model (also Remington) instead after seeing it in a youtube tutorial. It was just ok; the elliptical shape of that one made strange dents in my hair and made my ends look dry and frizzy. I was feeling discouraged, but then happened upon the Keratin Curling Wand on clearance at Target for $19 and decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curling wand is INCREDIBLE! It&#x27;s super easy to use once you master the wrapping technique (the fact that even I have managed to curl my hair with this without ever burning my hand, without a glove, is testimony to that) and delivers soft, bouncy curls. I have no idea if the keratin thing is really what&#x27;s doing the job, but my hair looks healthier/shinier AFTER I curl it than before. It transforms my thin, stick-straight boring hair into gorgeous victorias secret hair and it lasts! I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I woke up the next morning with curly hair--sure, not as curly as the night before, but still enough to be presentable in public without looking like I slept in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use this with Not-Your-Mother&#x27;s Dry Shampoo to add a little texture and volume, and then a really light spritzing of chi hairspray. Works like a charm and I get so many compliments on my hair! This isabsolutely the BEST $20 I&#x27;ve ever spent on my hair and you won&#x27;t regret buying this tool either! :)</li>
            <li> I was pretty unsure about this whole curling wand thing but this was really great! Easy to use and curled my hair well.</li>
            <li> Finally! My hair never holds a curl here in humid Florida. Before I get to the office, my hair is a frizzy mess with most curlers. But with this one, my hair holds enough wave to at least not get totally frizzed out. I&#x27;m talking about a scenario where most mornings I&#x27;m walking through wet fog. In a more hospitable environment, I&#x27;m sure it would last much longer. I I like the automatic off so I don&#x27;t have to turn the car around on mornings when I can&#x27;t remember for sure.</li>
            <li> I can only say that I think this product will be very nice IF I can get used to the technique.  I&#x27;m sort of an old dog, so I&#x27;m just not sure about learning this new trick.  But, the product itself is very nice and works well, it&#x27;s just the user that doesn&#x27;t get a very good review.  If you&#x27;re not wanting to learn a new trick, then this might not be the product for you...but if you&#x27;re wanting this type of product, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> so not only does it help my hair to hold a curl all day but i am able to style it into the 40s look i love so much and a friend of mine said her daughters hair just doesn&#x27;t hold a curl so i told her to try this and she bought one herself.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my 12 year old for her birthday last month and so far she says it&#x27;s the greatest ever!!!! Her hair looks fabulous in no time at all. It seems to beat the old style with the clamp.</li>
            <li> I really despised using this machine. It sounds simple enough but wrapping your hair around this thing properly to achieve curl AND w/o burning yourself will take a miracle. I couldn&#x27;t get the entire length of my hair wrapped around the rod. If I wanted to avoid my ends being straight, I had to actually hold the end pieces of my hair down on the rod. Ouch! The glove was useless for me since it got in the way of me separating my hair and taking it off and on in between curling each strand is strictly tedious. The curl or better, coil, had a straight end, which bugged me to no degree. The curl didn&#x27;t hold very well either. I usually get well defined curls when I use an iron, and this gave me weird waves. I did notice my hair was shinier than normal but using this cumbersome tool wasn&#x27;t worth the shine. I&#x27;ll stick to my curling irons of all sizes, which give me any type and size curl I want w definition.</li>
            <li> It burned a chunk of my girlfriends hair off within a few seconds of use. Remington have said they will provide refund.</li>
            <li> Love this curling wand! I am usually hopeless when it comes to curling my hair - my hair will not hold a curl from a regular curling iron - and I feel like a beauty queen every time I use this. I was recommended this by one of my co-workers, now every girl in the office has one. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This remington keratin therapy curling wand was not what I expected, it didn&#x27;t leave a curl more like a wave and it didn&#x27;t last long. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my first clampless curling wand. I LOVE IT. It really took some time to get used to it, but after that it seemed effortless. I have a lot of hair, so this saves me a lot of time. It takes much longer when using a regular clamp curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I do my hair with the wand is super quick and gives my hair a perfect, relaxed, beachy curl. This one comes with a glove, which is nice even though I honestly only used it when getting used to the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing wand at a great price. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This wand is a great value and works excellently. It comes with a glove to protect your hand and definitely gets hot enough to make a curl that will hold. The only thing that I don&#x27;t love is having to hold the hair while the curl heats, but the end result makes curls that look much more natural than those made with a traditional curling iron with a clamp. Overall, I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> A few months ago, I reviewed the Goody Heat Wave Creator Iron for Amazon. I&#x27;ve been using that one ever since and eagerly looked forward to trying out this Remington. Sad to say, it was a disappointment. First, some background: my hair is straight and goes to my shoulders, and has a slight wave. It normally responds very easily to any curling iron. Strangely enough, the Remington was way too gentle for my hair. After I had wrapped my long, fairly thick tresses around the clipless wand for about 5 minutes, I found that the curls came out too soft and loose. The Goody Iron took only 2 minutes to give me strong, definite curls. The Remington did give my hair more volume, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the addition of Keratin is the reason why this product didn&#x27;t work for my hair as well as it should. This added ingredient made my hair feel definitely softer but paradoxically harder to curl. I also tried different settings and, even at a higher temperature, the results were more or less the same - very loose curls that didn&#x27;t hold their shape too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included black glove was a nice touch, but please note it&#x27;s made for the left hand and assumes you&#x27;ll be holding the wand on your right. So if you&#x27;re left-handed, it might feel awkward.</li>
            <li> I saw this was one of the more cheaper wands on Amazon that were 1 inch.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to purchase it without looking around my local stores first. It is $28&lt;br /&gt;The wand came in the mail 2 days later, and it works great!&lt;br /&gt;You can adjust the heat settings, and the light blinks green when you turn it on, and turns solid green when its at the right temperature.&lt;br /&gt;I was upset to find out my local Target was selling a wand with a larger barrell(for longer hair) by a different brand (BedHead) for $17!!&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you do some looking around before settling with this one.&lt;br /&gt;One might be on sale at a local retailer of yours!!</li>
            <li> While this product was not for me, it was for a member of my household.  She was extremely excited to try it.  The Remington Keratin Therapy Curling Wand seeks to protect your hair during the curling process.  Who doesn&#x27;t want to protect their hair during this process?  Or so I am told.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clip-less wands seem to be the current great new feature of curling wands according to my family.  Unfortunately, despite the excitement they had over the product, over time, she has found herself returning to a wand with the clamp.  She feels she can use a lower heat and get better curls with the clamp.  With this product, while of high quality, using the glove and wrap technique, she finds requires more temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a quality and well put together curling wand.  If you have previously used and liked clip-less curling wands, you will likely be satisfied with this product.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> My wife has owned Remington products before, making this an easy choice since we know what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CI5325 curling wand gets hot very fast, making it a must for those rushed mornings when time is short. It has the feel of a good quality product, not cheap or rattley like some products that are available at the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were great. We recommend this curling wand with five stars. Expect the best.</li>
            <li> Great price - received quickly.  Such a good value - and really holds a curl!</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron a few months back. It was great, I loved it. The barrel was just the perfect size for the type of curls I liked and it even heated up fast.&lt;br /&gt;But then one day it decided to melt in my hands. http://i1153.photobucket.com/albums/p518/Annika_Pakarinen/IMAG0228_zps656aed7b.jpg&lt;br /&gt;(Excuse my confused/pissed off face there in the mirror)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not entitled to return the product anymore as the return date passed quite a while back and I don&#x27;t know how to contact the seller either so here I am, writing a positive, yet negative review.&lt;br /&gt;My tip with this curling iron is that you do NOT wait for it to heat up while holding it sideways, which is how my curling iron melted off to the side.&lt;br /&gt;If it had not melted in my hands, I would be giving it a five star rating.</li>
            <li> I plugged this in and it didn&#x27;t even work...</li>
            <li> New to the whole curling hair scene but this wand is perfect. I have long thin hair and this gives me a nice curl, nothing too tight. I don&#x27;t use the glove that came with it as I tend to switch hands as I curl</li>
            <li> Very good curl iron and very light. I liked it and I recommned it.</li>
            <li> It curls well but the curls are not tight as I wanted them</li>
            <li> I got the smaller wand a few weeks ago. I had previously been using a regular curling iron, but felt like it didn&#x27;t give me the curl I was going for and it never lasted more than an hour. This wand has worked magic on my hair! I have fine hair, but a TON of it and all I do is spray a small amount of hairspray in my hair before wrapping my hair around the barrel, my curls last the entire day. There was a short learning curve to wrapping my hair, but I watched a couple you tube videos and got the hang of it pretty quickly. I can do my hair in about 10 minutes. My curls are bouncy and shiny, the curling iron I was using always left my hair frizzy. I love this wand! I&#x27;m going to purchase the larger barrel as well so I can do loose waves with that one.</li>
            <li> I love the inch curler for my hair, works perfect, and as good as any curling iron will do, but if you use 1 &amp; 1/2 inches you&#x27;re going to have to use hair spray definitely</li>
            <li> Great price! &amp; works perfect</li>
            <li> I honestly have to say that I did not have good luck with this.  It&#x27;s probably me more than the tool, but I only used it once.  It was hard to wrap my hair around and I burned my finger several times trying to curl it.  The gloves are useless.  Unless you are really good with tools, stick to a curling iron.  This takes a lot of practice to get the hang of it and do it without burning yourself.</li>
            <li> There seems to be a very long and difficult learning curve with this product, so be prepared to spend a lot of time practicing and possibly getting burned (literally) along the way despite the glove they include. My daughter first purchased this curling wand and her hair looked great AFTER about a month of almost daily use, thus practice. She uses this curling wand now with more ease although initially she had difficulty and suffered some burns despite using the provided glove. I thought I would give it a try although months later I&#x27;m still struggling to get a decent curl, get that curl to start closer to the crown of my head rather than at my temple, which then leaves my hair flat on top and curly at the bottom and isn&#x27;t a really good look. Both my daughter and I have long hair, both have a few layers although her layers are closer together and I think that helps with ease of use and quality of curl? The wand just doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to handle layers and the process of trying to curl is tedious at best, first gather a thin strip of same length hair, hold wand in one hand and with other hand wind strip of hair around wand, leave in place for about 30 seconds then turn wand vertically and unwind hair down wand. There is a lot of work involved in using this wand and my arms are tired by the time I&#x27;m finished with only one side of my head, yet even so I am left with sporadic partial waves, definitely not nice spiral curls or anything close. Not sure this is the magical answer to those beautiful spiral curls I was seeking because thus far I haven&#x27;t been able to achieve any decent looking curl from this wand.</li>
            <li> Great product for a good price. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Bought this curling wand for my daughter and she loves it.  Easy to use and creates nice, soft curls with her hair.  It comes with a glove to protect your hand from getting burned.  It&#x27;s a good product at a nice price.</li>
            <li> Love this wand! It gives the perfect curls and it heats up fast</li>
            <li> The product works amazing and gives me full beach curls that I love.  What I loved even more was their service. After receiving my product, I noticed a scratch on the wand and it had been confirmed as New so I wrote them and asked if I could exchange it for one without any damage.  They did not even make me send the other one back, they sent me a brand new one, no questions asked! I really appreciated their trust and honor.  I would definitely order from them again :)</li>
            <li> This wand is really good and heats up really fast and you can do many hairstyles with it💇👒</li>
