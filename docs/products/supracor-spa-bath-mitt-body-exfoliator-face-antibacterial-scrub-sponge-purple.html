            <li>The body scrubber is the greatest back scratcher ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As I got used to them, I found myself scrubbing more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not inexpensive, but worth the price!!</li>
            <li>I purchased the mitt and body scrubber a year ago for myself and love the clean feeling I get when I use them.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only having to replace it because my dog successfully tore my original one to pieces.  </li>
            <li>Makes you feel fresh without any irritation!</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t feel really clean without it.</li>
            <li>love the gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much smoother and more even since I began using this.  </li>
            <li>It feels clean and fresh after using it.</li>
            <li>They rinse clean and fresh, and have not worn at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It may not look like much, but this little sponge is incredible.</li>
            <li>Great exfoliator but not to harsh.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Also, the seller shipped quickly and the product came in exact as described.</li>
            <li>I think my spray tan lasts a day or two longer if I use this right before.  </li>
            <li>I really felt so clean after using them.  </li>
            <li>My absolute FAVORITE part though is the nice scratchy feeling you get all over with this little bugger.  </li>
            <li>My original mitt was still looking AND WORKING like new after 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that this isn&#x27;t likely to get moldy, unlike loofahs.</li>
            <li>I have since ordered the facial sponge and absolutely love it as well.</li>
            <li>I first found this product at the ( Spa Shop) at Four Seasons Spa in Maui.</li>
            <li>and I have had the first one for over two years.</li>
            <li>This bath mitt looks odd, but the honeycombs are like magic!  </li>
            <li>And the large surface area makes it easy to reach all over the back.  </li>
            <li>Good to have not only for the winter when our skin is dry</li>
            <li>just purchased several sets as gifts and hope my friends enjoy them as much as I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t explain how it is feel.  </li>
            <li>It dries fast, doesn&#x27;t hold any odor and it stays like new for years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I can give myself a little scrub-down :)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After a year of hanging in my shower, these products still look brand new.</li>
            <li>the perfect  bath mitt ever clean no more  bad smells the color</li>
            <li>BUT (she wasn&#x27;t- she was genuinely that in love with this crazy thing).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like getting a mini back scratch all over your whole body.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was skeptical due to the higher price, but you will more than get your money&#x27;s worth with this bath mitt.</li>
            <li>Works much better than scrubs and is less cumbersome I will be purchasing other products from this line</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel softer and smoother and really decreases the occurrence of razor bumps and dry patches.  </li>
            <li>Bought the whole set (Facial, Mitt and Back).</li>
            <li>This picture clearly shows a 3 pc set while only selling one.  </li>
            <li>If it feels harsh at first, you will soon get used to it.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the box, I thought This was going to be a waste of money but decided to keep it anyway.</li>

            <li> I was dissapointed with the purchase, I thought I was purchasing the long back scrubber.  </li>
            <li> I no longer have rough patches or bumps on the back of my arms - or anywhere.</li>
            <li> It has also helped me combat the dry and itchy skin</li>
            <li> cool product, way less expensive than at the spa</li>

            <li> It was a little weird feeling on my skin when I used them for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I have traveled quite a bit lately, and take the mitt with me because I don&#x27;t get the same feeling with any other products!</li>
            <li> It does wonders for the skin, no more dry patches and it also got rid of the little hard bumps on the backs of my thighs that have been there forever.  </li>
            <li> but all yar round.</li>
            <li> It takes off all of the dirt and dead skin.</li>
            <li> It will also outlast those little mesh puffy things you find at the drug stores or the mall by 20 times!  </li>
            <li> so... $30 seemed a small price to pay if it helped me out of this miserableness.  </li>
            <li> No more moldy sponges or wash cloths.</li>
            <li> Yet to see any discoloring and deterioration after some hard scrubbing.</li>
            <li> The only disappointing thing is that I got four at $32 each</li>
            <li> The photo is confusing.</li>
            <li> This winter in Chicago was the worst I&#x27;ve been through in my entire life and left my skin dry, itchy and very angry</li>
            <li> and now they&#x27;re only $25 :-(</li>
            <li> i think it&#x27;s an annoying waste of time</li>
            <li> I was so WRONG!</li>

            <li> Nice, clean feeling after showering! I love that this isn&#x27;t likely to get moldy, unlike loofahs. The only disappointing thing is that I got four at $32 each and now they&#x27;re only $25 :-( Oh well.</li>
            <li> This mitt is an excellent exfoliator... Works much better than scrubs and is less cumbersome I will be purchasing other products from this line</li>
            <li> I use this daily in the shower.  If it feels harsh at first, you will soon get used to it. Now I don&#x27;t feel really clean without it. I no longer have rough patches or bumps on the back of my arms - or anywhere.</li>
            <li> without the smell.  love the gentle exfoliation. love that it has a hanger that helps with drying without molding.  good product</li>
            <li> I love this mitt!  My skin is so much smoother and more even since I began using this.  It has also helped me combat the dry and itchy skin I get every winter.  Another bonus is that it makes a little soap go a long way!</li>
            <li> Best bath mitt I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim.  When I first opened the box, I thought This was going to be a waste of money but decided to keep it anyway. I was so WRONG! It may not look like much, but this little sponge is incredible. I have since ordered the facial sponge and absolutely love it as well.</li>
            <li> My co-worker sent an email to a group of us raving about this thing.  It sounded like an infomercial and I was convinced she started selling the things and was trying to rope us in to one of those spa-product scam things.  BUT (she wasn&#x27;t- she was genuinely that in love with this crazy thing). This winter in Chicago was the worst I&#x27;ve been through in my entire life and left my skin dry, itchy and very angry so... $30 seemed a small price to pay if it helped me out of this miserableness.  Low and behold- this thing is something else.  It does wonders for the skin, no more dry patches and it also got rid of the little hard bumps on the backs of my thighs that have been there forever.  It&#x27;s perfect for pre-shaving and pre spray tanning.  I think my spray tan lasts a day or two longer if I use this right before.  My absolute FAVORITE part though is the nice scratchy feeling you get all over with this little bugger.  It&#x27;s like getting a mini back scratch all over your whole body.  I&#x27;m not a shower-person...i think it&#x27;s an annoying waste of time but I actually look forward to getting in so I can give myself a little scrub-down :)  And the large surface area makes it easy to reach all over the back.  I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.  I know what my friends/family are getting for christmas and b-day gifts from now on!  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Best product I have ever used. I use it every time I take a shower. It feels clean and fresh after using it.</li>
            <li> This really scrubs wonderfully well. It is easy to rinse too! Yet to see any discoloring and deterioration after some hard scrubbing. Bought the whole set (Facial, Mitt and Back). Now thinking of getting for my kids too. :)</li>
            <li> This bath mitt does exfoliate well.  Good to have not only for the winter when our skin is dry but all yar round.</li>
            <li> I purchased the mitt and body scrubber a year ago for myself and love the clean feeling I get when I use them.  I have traveled quite a bit lately, and take the mitt with me because I don&#x27;t get the same feeling with any other products! The body scrubber is the greatest back scratcher ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a year of hanging in my shower, these products still look brand new. They rinse clean and fresh, and have not worn at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased several sets as gifts and hope my friends enjoy them as much as I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not inexpensive, but worth the price!!</li>
            <li> Best bath mit by far that I have gotten my hands on. It takes off all of the dirt and dead skin. It leaves your skin so fresh and clean. Amazing product. I buy it as a gift and always get rave reviews from everyone that i get one for. It is a MUST have.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like being tricked.  This picture clearly shows a 3 pc set while only selling one.  Yes, the&lt;br /&gt;script only names one but the picture visually tricked us into ordering.  Never thought this would&lt;br /&gt;happen with Amazon.  Fool me once shame on you; fool me twice, not gonna happen.</li>
            <li> This bath mitt looks odd, but the honeycombs are like magic!  It&#x27;s the second one for me.  I&#x27;m only having to replace it because my dog successfully tore my original one to pieces.  My original mitt was still looking AND WORKING like new after 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great for exfoliation - you can forget buying bath/shower \\&quot;scrubs\\&quot; - because this will do the job with any soap or shower gel.  It makes your skin feel softer and smoother and really decreases the occurrence of razor bumps and dry patches.  It will also outlast those little mesh puffy things you find at the drug stores or the mall by 20 times!  It dries fast, doesn&#x27;t hold any odor and it stays like new for years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical due to the higher price, but you will more than get your money&#x27;s worth with this bath mitt.</li>
            <li> I was dissapointed with the purchase, I thought I was purchasing the long back scrubber.  The photo is confusing. The Photo should match the discription.  The photo indicates otherwise, and not specific enough.  It works well on the skin.</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself and my three daughters.  Will change the way you shower!  Makes you feel fresh without any irritation!</li>
            <li> I first found this product at the ( Spa Shop) at Four Seasons Spa in Maui. After trying it, I was so happy with the product that I sent one to my sister. She loves it. Also, the seller shipped quickly and the product came in exact as described. Will do business with this company again.</li>
            <li> It was a little weird feeling on my skin when I used them for the first time.  As I got used to them, I found myself scrubbing more.  I really felt so clean after using them.  I really can&#x27;t explain how it is feel.  You should try and see it yourself.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliator but not to harsh. Easy to use and keep clean. No more moldy sponges or wash cloths. Wonderful!!</li>
            <li> cool product, way less expensive than at the spa</li>
            <li> I received this for my birthday and then bought another for our cabin. It makes wonderful suds enought to easily shave your legs with. Never gets smelly and I have had the first one for over two years.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;lovely\\&quot;. the perfect  bath mitt ever clean no more  bad smells the color the size all is perfect, im really happy with my  new buy</li>
