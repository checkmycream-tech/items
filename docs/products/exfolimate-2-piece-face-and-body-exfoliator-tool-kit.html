            <li>It is easy to use when not in use and travels well!</li>
            <li>I’m so excited to have the opportunity to try and share with you all my “New Exfolimate, Your Best Mate for Silky Smooth Skin Review!”</li>
            <li>The price is great compared to how much you would spend buying a bead or salt exfoliator.</li>
            <li>I received product for free to give my honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt or anything, but I could not see a difference between using it and not using, maybe others will have better luck than me.</li>
            <li>Safe for all skin types</li>
            <li>He was so impressed that he used Exfolimate the next time he showered.</li>
            <li>I personally love it.y run it under water and then hang to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I personally love it.</li>
            <li>It will be interesting to see if this product can assist in reducing appearance of cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many times we deal with rashes, breakouts, funky products but nevertheless rashes or not we do it for our love of beauty and for our fans.</li>
            <li>As it did with my latest reviewed item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I personally think it works best when you use it after soaking in a salt bath though.</li>
            <li>So as most know you should use some sort of exfoliating brush or tool when cleaning your face and body.</li>
            <li>I like most people was using a loofa.</li>
            <li>It looks and feels healthier and almost glows on most days.</li>
            <li>My knees and elbows have never looked better.</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed how this has made my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Use a bit of your favorite face cleanser, or body wash, and put the product to use afterwards.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it feels like all the creams and cleansers and lotions and potions are overwhelming, though.</li>
            <li>I have been eager to discover healthy, safe methods to care for my skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Exfolimate has many applications and benefits:&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Each time I use them, it seems the results are better</li>
            <li>and I notice my skin looking better.  </li>
            <li>worked perfect and there wasn’t any make up residue left</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe for all skin types, and leaves my skin feeling softer and noticeably brighter and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for new products that are going to give me beautiful, glowing skin.</li>
            <li>but this ish really WORKS!!!!</li>
            <li>If you suffer from dry flaky skin,  I found an answer to your problem, this awesome 2 piece tool is just what you need.</li>
            <li>However, no hair was removed, and as I used it more I became more comfortable with it.  </li>
            <li>It is best to use this in the shower after your skin is very wet and &amp;#34;supple&amp;#34; because it opens up your pours and softens your pours so the gunk can more easily be removed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will say though that it&#x27;s not the most comfortable tool to use if you have acne.</li>
            <li>Exfolimate uses innovative microgroove technology etched into the smooth metal edge of the tool to lift and remove lingering skin cells, dirt out and debris.</li>
            <li>My wife was able to review the Exfolimate for free.</li>
            <li>This significantly removes more gunk off my face, and I feel it noticeably cleaner than when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that it would be easy to skip that area of your face, bot for me</li>
            <li>Using Exfolimate on your face is easy, except for the nose area.</li>
            <li>Its so easy to use and just with a minute a day I can enhance the way I look and</li>
            <li>She said the directions were easy to follow and the product was easy to use.</li>
            <li>Exfolimate is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>With cords included for attaching to your wrist and hanging in the shower, they are easy to use and store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use, 2 sizes, each labeled for their intended use (face or body).  </li>
            <li>Most people have had better success than I did</li>
            <li>Believe it or not this thing is really easy to use.</li>
            <li>This product is hands down the best thing I have ever found for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;• Reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles&lt;</li>
            <li>~ It can help provide deeper cleansing for enhanced exfoliation, which leads to reduction of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although I will honestly admit that when I first received this product I was a bit intimidated by the way that it looked, I am very happy that I gave them both a try.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they do remind me of little paint scrapers.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed that my skin looks younger or reduced wrinkles or fine lines, probably mostly because I&#x27;m still fairly</li>
            <li>The edges aren&#x27;t sharp and the sensation is kind of soothing and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Now he is a huge Exfolimate fan as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This tool is amazing because we only have to use warm water.</li>
            <li>I was sent this product for free for review purposes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a free exfolimate kit for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li>utilize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
            <li>It is a chemical free way to exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Why is exfoliation so important, you might wonder.</li>
            <li>used this on my legs in the shower, and afterwards they felt so much smoother, more supple, and just BETTER.</li>
            <li>In addition to deeper cleansing, Exfolimate offers users enhanced exfoliation and superior moisturization by improving the absorption of Skincare products.</li>
            <li>, REALLY WELL!!!</li>
            <li>After the first use of exfolimate it seemed to free most of the ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>I love using is instead of a pumice stone (honestly it works way better), and my rough feet were drastically softer after a couple days.</li>
            <li>This tool works great and really leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to make sure I use this first.</li>
            <li>The body one is also pretty boss, but it&#x27;s a lot more time consuming</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and clear-really love the Exfolimate!</li>
            <li>and I would see no difference on my skin but to my surprise I did specially using after removing my make up in the shower</li>
            <li>It glides smoothly across my face and body for a fresh clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, most people know how to save and it&#x27;s very similar.</li>
            <li>I find it doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference on most of my body, except my face and feet.</li>
            <li>Fits perfectly in my hand with out slipping and leaves my skin looking healthier and younger, what is not to love?</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I used a lotion on my face and body after my shower and could feel it absorbing so much better than it used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>These are very fun to use, I use mine right before I jump into the shower.</li>
            <li>but as I mentioned earlier, adding a scrub first is the most effective use of this</li>
            <li>This is a great option for anyone who uses an RV (where you don&#x27;t want to send pumice scrubs, etc down the drain).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have to say that I love this new way to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use both on the face and body and it clears the pores really well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Exfolimate is a fascinating tool for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I also noticed an improvement in ingrown hairs as the tool removed a top layer of dry skin and exposed healthy skin underneath.</li>
            <li>I love how handy this little tool is, makes it tons</li>
            <li>Using patented Smooth edge micro groove technology, exfolimate gently releases dirt, and oil embedded beneath your skin&#x27;s surface.</li>
            <li>I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>I think this is well worth the money and investment of time.</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>one of the things I loved about the product was how soft my skin felt after every use super friendly follow directions , my skin wasnt as dry as it tents to be during the winter time.</li>
            <li>some say baby oil it works and glides right over skin if your skin is thinking out as we age</li>
            <li>I did not utilize strings included in the box as I found the tool comfortable and easy to use after following directions.</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily and this seemed to do a great job of opening my pores up and getting the trapped excess oil out.</li>
            <li>patented tool is a natural, affordable, and easy to use tool that is truly going to transform the home beauty industry.</li>
            <li>The best thing about using the Exfolimate is there is no fuss with using scrubs or loofahs that might be too harsh on your face, only thinking this will scrub away the damage to your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fact we grow it over night, and piles up, if not removed over time, can make your skin dry and itchy, so time by time is great to have a better tool to use, with less scrubbing involved.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use, one simply holds the Exfolimate and glides it across the skin at a 90 degree angle while in the shower or hot bath.  </li>
            <li>still haven&#x27;t used the face one that was included because I have a facial exfoliator I already am in love with, but if you&#x27;re looking for something that works, give it a try.</li>
            <li>with the body tool.&lt;br /&gt;They come with a plastic red cord that you can use around your wrist to hang onto the either tool better in the shower.</li>
            <li>admit that when I first heard of Exfolimate</li>
            <li>My skin was so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>At first glance, the product seemed intimidating.</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed my skin was smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Remember when he first came out with his hair line?</li>
            <li>I though at first it would hurt or irritate my skin but that was not the case at all.</li>
            <li>First things first</li>
            <li>A month later now my skin has never looked so healthy.</li>
            <li>used it for the first time and immediately felt, and saw, a difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Skeptical at first, I didn&#x27;t think this product would work.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought this product wasn’t going to work</li>
            <li>it makes my skin so smooth and soft</li>
            <li>Recommend for all that tan regularly :)</li>
            <li>The Exfolimate&#x27;s innovative micro-groove technology gently lifts and removes lingering skin cells/debris to reveal your fresher younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>Now it doesn&#x27;t look dry and it feels so very smooth.</li>
            <li>It is pretty gently.</li>
            <li>The first time I tested this product, I first washed my face free of makeup, then did a deep pour cleanse, then used the metal exfoliator on my face, even after 2 face washes, that exfoliator still got a TON of gunk off my face.  </li>
            <li>At first I was a bit concerned it would remove hair as the edge looks much like a razor blade.  </li>
            <li>I personally have a mirror in my shower which it makes it easy to see what I&#x27;m doing</li>
            <li>Simply put, it does what it says, it is easy to use and there is NO prep work needed.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a pretty important step in your daily routine.</li>
            <li>This radical deep-cleanse dramatically improves tone and texture, while reducing pore size, (which I love that part because I have these large pores), and oily Patches, dry areas and visible signs of ageing.  </li>
            <li>I have used body scrubs like sugar scrubs before, but those large grains tore up my legs a bit.</li>
            <li>I am certain you could register Exfolimate as a weapon in certain countries.</li>
            <li>There are no creams or scrubs needed, just pure water and this tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it happens to be the part of my face which is the most dry, so I didn&#x27;t get much use during my breakout.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to strip my skin clean and bare of all those chemicals and treatments and just let it breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t do that at all, which I&#x27;m really thankful</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take too much time, around a minute for me.</li>
            <li>My skin did feel much smoother after using this</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t something you really have to “get the hang of” using.</li>
            <li>absolutely smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this idea</li>
            <li>Very unimpressed.</li>
            <li>So the chance to get my skin back to its ultra smooth self, I’m all for it.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t have to apply much pressure and it will still do the job.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>I really notice a difference on my legs and arms.</li>
            <li>I don’t notice it as much on my face, but I think that is because I already use exfoliating cleanser and moisturizer on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Exfolimate is made with surgical grade stainless steel and will not harbor germs, bacteria or chemicals like loofahs, sponges and shower gloves.</li>
            <li>I didn’t really know what else to use…until now.</li>
            <li>I didn’t really know what else to use…until now.</li>
            <li>while I consider myself to be really even headed there are products that change my thinking.</li>
            <li>It is a hand held nonelectric tool that has micro grooves in the edge of the tool that gently exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li>This product takes away the unhealthy skin and makes her look great.</li>
            <li>Exfolimate simply works with water and the light pressure you apply.</li>
            <li>Then you hold it at a 90-degree angle and run the stainless steel edge along your skin.</li>
            <li>As much as I wanted to like this, it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much from using this...</li>
            <li>REALLY</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s so fast to use.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried the Exfolimate, my skin felt physically so textured but not smooth, though it looked smooth in most spots, dry in others.</li>
            <li>The Exfolimate it a smooth clean face and body tool used to remove deep down dirt and dead skin to reveal smooth healthy glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To clean it, you simply run it under water and then hang to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I tested that I didn&#x27;t notice as much stuff coming off my skin, but my skin has been smoother, my leg shaving is better, with less ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>Even with a 4 month old razor it left me with soft and silky smooth legs for days!</li>
            <li>so this thing gets my skin looking fab &amp; not all dry looking again really quickly!</li>
            <li>Exfolimate looks like a blade but was gentle, yet effective enough to relieve my dry skin by removing the dead top layer of skin on my body and face to allow moisture to rehydrate it.</li>
            <li>It made his skin feel much better and less oily.</li>
            <li>Your face is quick, but using this on your entire body takes some time.</li>
            <li>experience so far has been positive.  </li>
            <li>Great for any parts of the body, the little one for face, and the big one for the body, but it doesn’t matter really, they both do the same anyways.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to try it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>bought this product from another retailer for $15, so the price on Amazon seems high and I deducted one star for this.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this little tool.</li>
            <li>, I used Exfolimate exclusively on my right arm and did not exfoliate my left arm (I just washed it with soap).</li>
            <li>product is incredible and if you suffer from very dry skin like me, you know how frustrating it is to get moisture into your skin and keep it there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>check out all the bonuses to using the New Exfolimate:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try Exfolimate on my arms because I have Keratosis Pilaris (KP) which is a skin condition where tiny white bumps appear on the skin.</li>
            <li>She automatically noticed softer skin after the first use, After a week, there was a noticeable healthiness to her facial skin.</li>
            <li>Aside from giving your skin an overall smoother and more youthful appearance, it helps with your other beauty endeavors.</li>
            <li>I tested my face first, and WOW, completely surprised that it actually works.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so clear and</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it actually reduces signs of aging, but as far as cleaning, it absolutely works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also quite possible that maybe I was applying too much pressure when using Exfolimate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t recommend running this across or near your nose unless you can see what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>experimental purposes</li>
            <li>I have noticed the skin of my face so soft and smoother</li>
            <li>have tried countless exfoliating scrubs and tools, but never found anything that showed much promise… Until now.</li>
            <li>I used a lot of pressure on my sensitive skin in varying directions and found the product to be completely safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t you just wish you could scrap, or really clean away that dried skin on your face, maybe your legs and neck at home?</li>
            <li>Do not worry the edge is almost soft and is not sharp.</li>
            <li>First, you let your skin get wet in the shower</li>
            <li>I had pretty high expectations for this product, based on a few articles and reviews I had read.</li>
            <li>So, now is the time to purchase your set of Exfolimate&#x27;s and show off your new skin, your younger looking skin without any chemicals to ever use again.</li>
            <li>While your skin is wet, you hold the tool at a 90 degree angle and drag it along your skin applying light</li>
            <li>It is simply a tool that gently yet deeply cleanses your skin.</li>
            <li>I moisturized as usual but the next morning my skin felt wonderfully soft and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>No other washes, scrubs or lotions are needed, no worries of irritation or sensitivity.</li>
            <li>The metal edge is NOT sharp, so no need to worry about shaving off any peach fuzz, or hair on your face.</li>
            <li>These two plastic pieces with metal blade, but it is not sharp and will not cut you.</li>
            <li>Exfolimate is a new breakthrough in Skincare technology, and as far as I&#x27;m concerned you can use it anywhere on your body if there&#x27;s dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It has a hard but smooth plastic outer shell encasing a metal edge.</li>
            <li>I do not use any type of special face or body wash just the usual.  </li>
            <li>My upper legs frequently used to get ingrown hairs to the point where it was embarassing.</li>
            <li>It was simply crazy to grasp because we loved our lather.</li>
            <li>No more dry ashy spots, just smooth soft skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the New Exfolimate you can get back the younger, fresher looking and feeling skin.</li>
            <li>I can tell after 2 weeks of using this on my legs, they are softer, holds moisture better, less need of lotion, and the puff ball doesn’t have dead skin on it.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a good chance that I would buy this to use on my face as I am rather crazy about exfoliating my face regularly.</li>
            <li>I was completely ready to give this product a thumbs down, but I can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>The dry winter months are fast approaching, and with them, dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>use the one on my face pretty often because it exfoliates so well, removes my dead skin and extra dirt that is deeply embedded.</li>
            <li>This type of facial technology allows for hidden dirt and pores to gently be lifted, while removing all those lingering skin cells.</li>

            <li> I’m so excited to have the opportunity to try and share with you all my “New Exfolimate, Your Best Mate for Silky Smooth Skin Review!”</li>

            <li> I received product for free to give my honest unbiased opinion.</li>

            <li> He was so impressed that he used Exfolimate the next time he showered.</li>

            <li> I personally love it.</li>
            <li> It will be interesting to see if this product can assist in reducing appearance of cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many times we deal with rashes, breakouts, funky products but nevertheless rashes or not we do it for our love of beauty and for our fans.</li>
            <li> As it did with my latest reviewed item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally think it works best when you use it after soaking in a salt bath though.</li>
            <li> So as most know you should use some sort of exfoliating brush or tool when cleaning your face and body.</li>
            <li> I like most people was using a loofa.</li>
            <li> It looks and feels healthier and almost glows on most days.</li>
            <li> My knees and elbows have never looked better.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed how this has made my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Use a bit of your favorite face cleanser, or body wash, and put the product to use afterwards.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it feels like all the creams and cleansers and lotions and potions are overwhelming, though.</li>
            <li> I have been eager to discover healthy, safe methods to care for my skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Exfolimate has many applications and benefits:&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Each time I use them, it seems the results are better</li>
            <li> and I notice my skin looking better.  </li>
            <li> worked perfect and there wasn’t any make up residue left</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe for all skin types, and leaves my skin feeling softer and noticeably brighter and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for new products that are going to give me beautiful, glowing skin.</li>
            <li> but this ish really WORKS!!!!</li>
            <li> If you suffer from dry flaky skin,  I found an answer to your problem, this awesome 2 piece tool is just what you need.</li>
            <li> However, no hair was removed, and as I used it more I became more comfortable with it.  </li>
            <li> It is best to use this in the shower after your skin is very wet and &amp;#34;supple&amp;#34; because it opens up your pours and softens your pours so the gunk can more easily be removed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say though that it&#x27;s not the most comfortable tool to use if you have acne.</li>
            <li> Exfolimate uses innovative microgroove technology etched into the smooth metal edge of the tool to lift and remove lingering skin cells, dirt out and debris.</li>
            <li> My wife was able to review the Exfolimate for free.</li>
            <li> This significantly removes more gunk off my face, and I feel it noticeably cleaner than when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that it would be easy to skip that area of your face, bot for me</li>
            <li> Using Exfolimate on your face is easy, except for the nose area.</li>
            <li> Its so easy to use and just with a minute a day I can enhance the way I look and</li>
            <li> She said the directions were easy to follow and the product was easy to use.</li>
            <li> Exfolimate is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> With cords included for attaching to your wrist and hanging in the shower, they are easy to use and store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use, 2 sizes, each labeled for their intended use (face or body).  </li>
            <li> Most people have had better success than I did</li>
            <li> Believe it or not this thing is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product is hands down the best thing I have ever found for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;• Reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles&lt;</li>
            <li> ~ It can help provide deeper cleansing for enhanced exfoliation, which leads to reduction of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I will honestly admit that when I first received this product I was a bit intimidated by the way that it looked, I am very happy that I gave them both a try.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they do remind me of little paint scrapers.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed that my skin looks younger or reduced wrinkles or fine lines, probably mostly because I&#x27;m still fairly</li>
            <li> The edges aren&#x27;t sharp and the sensation is kind of soothing and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Now he is a huge Exfolimate fan as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This tool is amazing because we only have to use warm water.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product for free for review purposes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a free exfolimate kit for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> utilize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
            <li> It is a chemical free way to exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Why is exfoliation so important, you might wonder.</li>
            <li> used this on my legs in the shower, and afterwards they felt so much smoother, more supple, and just BETTER.</li>
            <li> In addition to deeper cleansing, Exfolimate offers users enhanced exfoliation and superior moisturization by improving the absorption of Skincare products.</li>
            <li> , REALLY WELL!!!</li>
            <li> After the first use of exfolimate it seemed to free most of the ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> I love using is instead of a pumice stone (honestly it works way better), and my rough feet were drastically softer after a couple days.</li>
            <li> This tool works great and really leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to make sure I use this first.</li>
            <li> The body one is also pretty boss, but it&#x27;s a lot more time consuming</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and clear-really love the Exfolimate!</li>
            <li> and I would see no difference on my skin but to my surprise I did specially using after removing my make up in the shower</li>
            <li> It glides smoothly across my face and body for a fresh clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, most people know how to save and it&#x27;s very similar.</li>
            <li> I find it doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference on most of my body, except my face and feet.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly in my hand with out slipping and leaves my skin looking healthier and younger, what is not to love?</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I used a lotion on my face and body after my shower and could feel it absorbing so much better than it used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> These are very fun to use, I use mine right before I jump into the shower.</li>
            <li> but as I mentioned earlier, adding a scrub first is the most effective use of this</li>
            <li> This is a great option for anyone who uses an RV (where you don&#x27;t want to send pumice scrubs, etc down the drain).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have to say that I love this new way to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use both on the face and body and it clears the pores really well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Exfolimate is a fascinating tool for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I also noticed an improvement in ingrown hairs as the tool removed a top layer of dry skin and exposed healthy skin underneath.</li>
            <li> I love how handy this little tool is, makes it tons</li>
            <li> Using patented Smooth edge micro groove technology, exfolimate gently releases dirt, and oil embedded beneath your skin&#x27;s surface.</li>
            <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> I think this is well worth the money and investment of time.</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> one of the things I loved about the product was how soft my skin felt after every use super friendly follow directions , my skin wasnt as dry as it tents to be during the winter time.</li>
            <li> some say baby oil it works and glides right over skin if your skin is thinking out as we age</li>
            <li> I did not utilize strings included in the box as I found the tool comfortable and easy to use after following directions.</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily and this seemed to do a great job of opening my pores up and getting the trapped excess oil out.</li>
            <li> patented tool is a natural, affordable, and easy to use tool that is truly going to transform the home beauty industry.</li>
            <li> The best thing about using the Exfolimate is there is no fuss with using scrubs or loofahs that might be too harsh on your face, only thinking this will scrub away the damage to your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fact we grow it over night, and piles up, if not removed over time, can make your skin dry and itchy, so time by time is great to have a better tool to use, with less scrubbing involved.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, one simply holds the Exfolimate and glides it across the skin at a 90 degree angle while in the shower or hot bath.  </li>
            <li> still haven&#x27;t used the face one that was included because I have a facial exfoliator I already am in love with, but if you&#x27;re looking for something that works, give it a try.</li>
            <li> with the body tool.&lt;br /&gt;They come with a plastic red cord that you can use around your wrist to hang onto the either tool better in the shower.</li>
            <li> admit that when I first heard of Exfolimate</li>
            <li> My skin was so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> At first glance, the product seemed intimidating.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed my skin was smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Remember when he first came out with his hair line?</li>
            <li> I though at first it would hurt or irritate my skin but that was not the case at all.</li>
            <li> First things first</li>
            <li> A month later now my skin has never looked so healthy.</li>
            <li> used it for the first time and immediately felt, and saw, a difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Skeptical at first, I didn&#x27;t think this product would work.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought this product wasn’t going to work</li>
            <li> it makes my skin so smooth and soft</li>
            <li> Recommend for all that tan regularly :)</li>
            <li> The Exfolimate&#x27;s innovative micro-groove technology gently lifts and removes lingering skin cells/debris to reveal your fresher younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> Now it doesn&#x27;t look dry and it feels so very smooth.</li>
            <li> It is pretty gently.</li>
            <li> The first time I tested this product, I first washed my face free of makeup, then did a deep pour cleanse, then used the metal exfoliator on my face, even after 2 face washes, that exfoliator still got a TON of gunk off my face.  </li>
            <li> At first I was a bit concerned it would remove hair as the edge looks much like a razor blade.  </li>
            <li> I personally have a mirror in my shower which it makes it easy to see what I&#x27;m doing</li>
            <li> Simply put, it does what it says, it is easy to use and there is NO prep work needed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pretty important step in your daily routine.</li>
            <li> This radical deep-cleanse dramatically improves tone and texture, while reducing pore size, (which I love that part because I have these large pores), and oily Patches, dry areas and visible signs of ageing.  </li>
            <li> I have used body scrubs like sugar scrubs before, but those large grains tore up my legs a bit.</li>
            <li> I am certain you could register Exfolimate as a weapon in certain countries.</li>
            <li> There are no creams or scrubs needed, just pure water and this tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it happens to be the part of my face which is the most dry, so I didn&#x27;t get much use during my breakout.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to strip my skin clean and bare of all those chemicals and treatments and just let it breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do that at all, which I&#x27;m really thankful</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take too much time, around a minute for me.</li>
            <li> My skin did feel much smoother after using this</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t something you really have to “get the hang of” using.</li>
            <li> absolutely smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this idea</li>
            <li> Very unimpressed.</li>
            <li> So the chance to get my skin back to its ultra smooth self, I’m all for it.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t have to apply much pressure and it will still do the job.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I really notice a difference on my legs and arms.</li>
            <li> I don’t notice it as much on my face, but I think that is because I already use exfoliating cleanser and moisturizer on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Exfolimate is made with surgical grade stainless steel and will not harbor germs, bacteria or chemicals like loofahs, sponges and shower gloves.</li>
            <li> I didn’t really know what else to use…until now.</li>
            <li> I didn’t really know what else to use…until now.</li>
            <li> while I consider myself to be really even headed there are products that change my thinking.</li>
            <li> It is a hand held nonelectric tool that has micro grooves in the edge of the tool that gently exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li> This product takes away the unhealthy skin and makes her look great.</li>
            <li> Exfolimate simply works with water and the light pressure you apply.</li>
            <li> Then you hold it at a 90-degree angle and run the stainless steel edge along your skin.</li>
            <li> As much as I wanted to like this, it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much from using this...</li>
            <li> REALLY</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s so fast to use.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried the Exfolimate, my skin felt physically so textured but not smooth, though it looked smooth in most spots, dry in others.</li>
            <li> The Exfolimate it a smooth clean face and body tool used to remove deep down dirt and dead skin to reveal smooth healthy glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To clean it, you simply run it under water and then hang to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I tested that I didn&#x27;t notice as much stuff coming off my skin, but my skin has been smoother, my leg shaving is better, with less ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> Even with a 4 month old razor it left me with soft and silky smooth legs for days!</li>
            <li> so this thing gets my skin looking fab &amp; not all dry looking again really quickly!</li>
            <li> Exfolimate looks like a blade but was gentle, yet effective enough to relieve my dry skin by removing the dead top layer of skin on my body and face to allow moisture to rehydrate it.</li>
            <li> It made his skin feel much better and less oily.</li>
            <li> Your face is quick, but using this on your entire body takes some time.</li>
            <li> experience so far has been positive.  </li>
            <li> Great for any parts of the body, the little one for face, and the big one for the body, but it doesn’t matter really, they both do the same anyways.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to try it</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> bought this product from another retailer for $15, so the price on Amazon seems high and I deducted one star for this.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this little tool.</li>
            <li> , I used Exfolimate exclusively on my right arm and did not exfoliate my left arm (I just washed it with soap).</li>
            <li> product is incredible and if you suffer from very dry skin like me, you know how frustrating it is to get moisture into your skin and keep it there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> check out all the bonuses to using the New Exfolimate:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try Exfolimate on my arms because I have Keratosis Pilaris (KP) which is a skin condition where tiny white bumps appear on the skin.</li>
            <li> She automatically noticed softer skin after the first use, After a week, there was a noticeable healthiness to her facial skin.</li>
            <li> Aside from giving your skin an overall smoother and more youthful appearance, it helps with your other beauty endeavors.</li>
            <li> I tested my face first, and WOW, completely surprised that it actually works.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so clear and</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it actually reduces signs of aging, but as far as cleaning, it absolutely works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also quite possible that maybe I was applying too much pressure when using Exfolimate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t recommend running this across or near your nose unless you can see what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> experimental purposes</li>
            <li> I have noticed the skin of my face so soft and smoother</li>
            <li> have tried countless exfoliating scrubs and tools, but never found anything that showed much promise… Until now.</li>
            <li> I used a lot of pressure on my sensitive skin in varying directions and found the product to be completely safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you just wish you could scrap, or really clean away that dried skin on your face, maybe your legs and neck at home?</li>
            <li> Do not worry the edge is almost soft and is not sharp.</li>
            <li> First, you let your skin get wet in the shower</li>
            <li> I had pretty high expectations for this product, based on a few articles and reviews I had read.</li>
            <li> So, now is the time to purchase your set of Exfolimate&#x27;s and show off your new skin, your younger looking skin without any chemicals to ever use again.</li>
            <li> While your skin is wet, you hold the tool at a 90 degree angle and drag it along your skin applying light</li>
            <li> It is simply a tool that gently yet deeply cleanses your skin.</li>
            <li> I moisturized as usual but the next morning my skin felt wonderfully soft and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> No other washes, scrubs or lotions are needed, no worries of irritation or sensitivity.</li>
            <li> The metal edge is NOT sharp, so no need to worry about shaving off any peach fuzz, or hair on your face.</li>
            <li> These two plastic pieces with metal blade, but it is not sharp and will not cut you.</li>
            <li> Exfolimate is a new breakthrough in Skincare technology, and as far as I&#x27;m concerned you can use it anywhere on your body if there&#x27;s dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It has a hard but smooth plastic outer shell encasing a metal edge.</li>
            <li> I do not use any type of special face or body wash just the usual.  </li>
            <li> My upper legs frequently used to get ingrown hairs to the point where it was embarassing.</li>
            <li> It was simply crazy to grasp because we loved our lather.</li>
            <li> No more dry ashy spots, just smooth soft skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the New Exfolimate you can get back the younger, fresher looking and feeling skin.</li>
            <li> I can tell after 2 weeks of using this on my legs, they are softer, holds moisture better, less need of lotion, and the puff ball doesn’t have dead skin on it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a good chance that I would buy this to use on my face as I am rather crazy about exfoliating my face regularly.</li>
            <li> I was completely ready to give this product a thumbs down, but I can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> The dry winter months are fast approaching, and with them, dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> use the one on my face pretty often because it exfoliates so well, removes my dead skin and extra dirt that is deeply embedded.</li>
            <li> This type of facial technology allows for hidden dirt and pores to gently be lifted, while removing all those lingering skin cells.</li>
            <li> He was shocked at the huge improvement to my right arm.</li>
            <li> My face also seems a little less dull after I use it, but its important to be gentle or you&#x27;ll just hurt your skin.</li>
            <li> and then you use the tool in a 90 degree angle up and down your arms, legs, and other body parts, with or without first using a scrub</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually take a whole lot of time in the shower and it seems to be quicker to just use a scrub on my skin rather than to take the time to use Exfolimate.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how sharp the metal edges were!</li>
            <li> I had a huge breakout from a medication I started to take and it was almost painful in certain areas of my face to use.</li>
            <li> You do have to clean the Exfolimate every few strokes with your fingers and the water, otherwise the dead skin will build up and make the tools harder to use.</li>
            <li> Apparently they are sharp enough to remove arm hair, but not textured enough to buff away rough patches on feet.</li>
            <li> It was gross, cool, and weird all at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I especially noticed results on normal rough patches, like my elbows, knees and heels where dead skin seems to collect.  </li>
            <li> Exfolimate did a fantastic job in removing dry skin, which was starting to feel itchy and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often take long showers or baths in which I would have the time to use this on my body.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and silky soft after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I tend to breakout because they have a lot of ingredients, and the scrub is so heavy to exfoliate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Not much of an expert in the beauty department, I am essentially a novice.  </li>
            <li> This tool with ease removes that dry skin from your body leaving your skin feeling</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> Reduces dry spots and oily patches&lt;</li>
            <li> my skin is not as dry as it once was.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I suffer from extremely dry skin and it seems that no matter what I do, I cannot get my skin to stay moisturized or to stop itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In return, your face will look younger and younger everyday this product is used.</li>
            <li> When she first opened it, she was confused until she read the directions.</li>
            <li> During the winter months I tend to get dry patches, but not anymore!</li>
            <li> It did make my skin a little red afterwards.</li>
            <li> I used mine with a wet body and bio oil</li>
            <li> Also, it did nothing for the rough area around the heel of my foot.</li>
            <li> You can actually SEE the dead skin cells you are removing on the tool, proving that it is working.</li>
            <li> and it just gets worse as I get older.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t do much other than scrubbing my body with a loofah.</li>
            <li> but any oil will due</li>
            <li> It is not a razor even though it appears sharp.</li>
            <li> It is a true transforming cutting edge tool.</li>
            <li> The Exfolimate is a small enough skin care product you can take with you</li>
            <li> When my wife told me about the Exfolimate I was skeptical, but using it for the first I was sold.</li>
            <li> The straps included to allow for holding require someone who understands complex knots as it will come loose in the shower with a simple knot.</li>
            <li> I could definitely see little bits of dead skin etc being flaked off as I used the tool.</li>
            <li> Exfolimate is meant to remove dead, dry skin cells and other debris that clog up your skin.</li>
            <li> No more rough or dry patches for me.</li>
            <li> I simply took a shower and, before any shaving or other skincare, I slowly pulled the Exfolimate across my skin at a 90 degree angle.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the least efficient tools with which to injure yourself - it&#x27;s in the same category as spoons.  </li>
            <li> When you pass the tool over your wet skin you can see how all the dead cells stay in the metal.</li>
            <li> and I even noticed that my skin felt a little softer after using other skincare products after using this.</li>
            <li> I mean dang, where has this product been the last twenty years of my life!  </li>
            <li> I used the exfolimate on my feet because that is my worst area, I have otherwise smooth and soft skin.</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t see any buildup on the Exfolimate when using it on my legs, I did notice I had considerably less ingrown hairs on my legs when using the Exfolimate before shaving.  </li>
            <li> so I use it less...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot less harsh than scrubbing</li>
            <li> It is a piece of metal on plastic that does not remove dead</li>
            <li> u never realize how much dead skin cells we walk around with</li>
            <li> After using the Exfolimate for a few days, I asked my Husband to feel each arm.</li>
            <li> It removed so much dead skin that it clogged my razor with every stroke.</li>
            <li> I was always concerned about germs being left behind in the loofa and being passed from body part to body</li>
            <li> ~ It removes dead skin for smoother, softer feeling skin that looks brighter and improves skin tone and texture.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Get all the dead skin, pulls out the dryness in my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> times easier to remove the dead skin vs using sugar scrub.</li>
            <li> read a few reviews where people suggested that they cut themselves or shaved hair from their skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dull metal edge, that  glides over your face, to remove any dead skin, or debris you might have linger, that you might not otherwise remove using a loofa, or wash cloth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I noticed small, but immediate results and was awe struck.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel crazy soft</li>
            <li> With the Exfolimate I do not have to worry about germs sitting around in a sponge ready to get e sick.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this metal piece actually working, and worried that it was sharp and would be slicing or cutting open my skin.  </li>
            <li> I learned that the hard way (;</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause pain, unless you push too hard.</li>
            <li> I mean truly transform what we believe a product is and should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can do every area on your face, even the crevices along the sides of your nose and behind your ears as well.</li>
            <li> And it removed those annoying bumps on the back of my arms - Keratosis Pilaris.</li>
            <li> This product is useless, save your money.</li>
            <li> Everything that we where told about shampooing our hair was wrong.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> Remember he was telling us lather is bad and our eyes could not believe it.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and using scrubs is so bad for my skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I received Exfolimate for review last month - JUST IN TIME. The dry winter months are fast approaching, and with them, dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my legs in the shower, and afterwards they felt so much smoother, more supple, and just BETTER. I have used body scrubs like sugar scrubs before, but those large grains tore up my legs a bit. This didn&#x27;t do that at all, which I&#x27;m really thankful for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still haven&#x27;t used the face one that was included because I have a facial exfoliator I already am in love with, but if you&#x27;re looking for something that works, give it a try. I can say definitively that the body one works wonders.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:e870b5ea594e1870d2fe84f716fdea43]] I received this for review purposes, however all opinions are my own!</li>
            <li> *Disclaimer* I was sent this product for free for review purposes. ALL opinions and thoughts are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this on and off for a just about a month. I do like the Exfolimate, however, I find that I don&#x27;t always have time to use this on every part of my body. I don&#x27;t usually take a whole lot of time in the shower and it seems to be quicker to just use a scrub on my skin rather than to take the time to use Exfolimate. I have liked using Exfolimate on my face though. It doesn&#x27;t take too much time, around a minute for me. My skin did feel much smoother after using this and I even noticed that my skin felt a little softer after using other skincare products after using this. I haven&#x27;t noticed that my skin looks younger or reduced wrinkles or fine lines, probably mostly because I&#x27;m still fairly young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say though that it&#x27;s not the most comfortable tool to use if you have acne. I had a huge breakout from a medication I started to take and it was almost painful in certain areas of my face to use. I&#x27;d say that it would be easy to skip that area of your face, bot for me it happens to be the part of my face which is the most dry, so I didn&#x27;t get much use during my breakout. It&#x27;s also quite possible that maybe I was applying too much pressure when using Exfolimate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some good things about Exfolimate. The price is great compared to how much you would spend buying a bead or salt exfoliator. While the Exfolimate doesn&#x27;t last forever, buying it once a year saves quite a bit in comparison. It is very easy to use, most people know how to save and it&#x27;s very similar. This isn&#x27;t something you really have to “get the hang of” using. Using this on your face is quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things I didn&#x27;t like about Exfolimate. One is the time it takes to use. Your face is quick, but using this on your entire body takes some time. It&#x27;s definitely not something I can do everyday or really even every week. I don&#x27;t often take long showers or baths in which I would have the time to use this on my body. Using Exfolimate on your face is easy, except for the nose area. I personally have a mirror in my shower which it makes it easy to see what I&#x27;m doing but I don&#x27;t recommend running this across or near your nose unless you can see what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have mixed feelings about this product. I do like it for the face, when I&#x27;m not having a breakout, but not for the body. I think that Exfolimate should be offered not only as a 2 piece but you  should also have the option to purchase face only or body only. I&#x27;m not sure if I would have purchased this on my own with both in the set. I generally don&#x27;t do much other than scrubbing my body with a loofah. There&#x27;s a good chance that I would buy this to use on my face as I am rather crazy about exfoliating my face regularly.</li>
            <li> purchased for my sister for christmas. in her words, a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> This product is useless, save your money. It is a piece of metal on plastic that does not remove dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I promptly returned</li>
            <li> Not impressed....save your money!</li>
            <li> If you suffer from dry flaky skin,  I found an answer to your problem, this awesome 2 piece tool is just what you need. I used the exfolimate on my feet because that is my worst area, I have otherwise smooth and soft skin. I used this tool and my feet were singing and dancing.This tool with ease removes that dry skin from your body leaving your skin feeling absolutely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received product for free to give my honest unbiased opinion.*</li>
            <li> I really like this idea u never realize how much dead skin cells we walk around with I used mine with a wet body and bio oil but any oil will due some say baby oil it works and glides right over skin if your skin is thinking out as we age you can use this with no worries!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for me, either I have no need to exfoliate or am challenged in using this product. The straps included to allow for holding require someone who understands complex knots as it will come loose in the shower with a simple knot. It doesn&#x27;t hurt or anything, but I could not see a difference between using it and not using, maybe others will have better luck than me.</li>
            <li> I will make offer for you i want 4 tool kit with 25$  for each do you agree?!!</li>
            <li> I had pretty high expectations for this product, based on a few articles and reviews I had read. While this product didn&#x27;t turn out to be a miracle, it still serves its purpose well. I find it doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference on most of my body, except my face and feet. I love using is instead of a pumice stone (honestly it works way better), and my rough feet were drastically softer after a couple days. My face also seems a little less dull after I use it, but its important to be gentle or you&#x27;ll just hurt your skin. I learned that the hard way (;</li>
            <li> This tool says that it&#x27;s not a shaver and will not remove hair, but it definitely took some of my arm hair off. Also, it did nothing for the rough area around the heel of my foot. I was too terrified to try it on my face after seeing what it did to my arm hair so I can&#x27;t speak on that. I was surprised at how sharp the metal edges were! Apparently they are sharp enough to remove arm hair, but not textured enough to buff away rough patches on feet. Very unimpressed. I will stick to my pumice stone for my feet, my exfoliating gloves for my body and my face brush for my face. I was hoping to find a product that would be an all in one solution, but this is not it at all.</li>
            <li> This tool works great and really leaves skin soft and smooth. It is easy to use both on the face and body and it clears the pores really well. My skin is soft and clear-really love the Exfolimate!</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and it just gets worse as I get older. I seem to manage it enough but it still wasn&#x27;t what I wanted it to be. I am so glad I tried the Exfolimate, my skin felt physically so textured but not smooth, though it looked smooth in most spots, dry in others. Now it doesn&#x27;t look dry and it feels so very smooth. I love it!</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t see any buildup on the Exfolimate when using it on my legs, I did notice I had considerably less ingrown hairs on my legs when using the Exfolimate before shaving.  My upper legs frequently used to get ingrown hairs to the point where it was embarassing. After the first use of exfolimate it seemed to free most of the ingrown hairs.  When I used it on my face I could see the buildup  on the edge of the exfolimate.  My skin is very oily and this seemed to do a great job of opening my pores up and getting the trapped excess oil out.</li>
            <li> I’m so excited to have the opportunity to try and share with you all my “New Exfolimate, Your Best Mate for Silky Smooth Skin Review!” Since after all the traveling I’ve done across the U.S. I’ve literally tortured my skin with all the possible elements. So the chance to get my skin back to its ultra smooth self, I’m all for it. With the New Exfolimate you can get back the younger, fresher looking and feeling skin. With instant exfoliation and pore clarification without all the fuss of scrubs and loofahs you know Australia was on to something when they created this. The Exfolimate&#x27;s innovative micro-groove technology gently lifts and removes lingering skin cells/debris to reveal your fresher younger looking skin. Its so easy to use and just with a minute a day I can enhance the way I look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus check out all the bonuses to using the New Exfolimate:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Provides deeper cleansing, enhanced exfoliation and superior moisturisation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Cleanses, refreshes and revives skin&lt;br /&gt;• Reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;• Leaves skin feeling softer and looking brighter&lt;br /&gt;• Improves skin tone and texture&lt;br /&gt;• Reduces dry spots and oily patches&lt;br /&gt;• Increases the absorption of skin care products&lt;br /&gt;• Safe for all skin types</li>
            <li> Although I will honestly admit that when I first received this product I was a bit intimidated by the way that it looked, I am very happy that I gave them both a try.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they do remind me of little paint scrapers. But they are great.&lt;br /&gt;I use the one on my face pretty often because it exfoliates so well, removes my dead skin and extra dirt that is deeply embedded. It doesn&#x27;t cause pain, unless you push too hard. You really don&#x27;t have to apply much pressure and it will still do the job. You can do every area on your face, even the crevices along the sides of your nose and behind your ears as well. Then whatever comes off, you can just wash off the tool and continue to another area.&lt;br /&gt;Same with the body tool.&lt;br /&gt;They come with a plastic red cord that you can use around your wrist to hang onto the either tool better in the shower. Also, you can hang them on a plastic suction hook, if you have one already, in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I like both of these. I especially use the face one though. My skin feels really nice and exfoliated. Very nice products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a free exfolimate kit for reviewing purposes. All opinions expressed are solely my own.</li>
            <li> Exfolimate uses innovative microgroove technology etched into the smooth metal edge of the tool to lift and remove lingering skin cells, dirt out and debris. This unveils younger and fresher skin. While your skin is wet, you hold the tool at a 90 degree angle and drag it along your skin applying light pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit that when I first heard of Exfolimate I was very skeptical. I read the Amazon reviews and I NEEDED to try it. So, I agreed to review it myself.  Exfolimate comes with two different tools; one for your face and one for your body. It also comes with two adjustable plastic cords to hang the Exfolimate tools in your shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was really excited to try Exfolimate on my arms because I have Keratosis Pilaris (KP) which is a skin condition where tiny white bumps appear on the skin. Basically, it always looks like I have “goosebumps” on my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For experimental purposes, I used Exfolimate exclusively on my right arm and did not exfoliate my left arm (I just washed it with soap). I noticed a difference almost immediately. After using the Exfolimate for a few days, I asked my Husband to feel each arm. He was shocked at the huge improvement to my right arm. My skin was so soft and smooth. The bumps on my arm were so much smaller and almost gone. He kept walking up to me and rubbing my arm. He was so impressed that he used Exfolimate the next time he showered. It made his skin feel much better and less oily. Now he is a huge Exfolimate fan as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the initial experiment, I started using Exfolimate on my entire body. My skin is so much softer and smoother. I really notice a difference on my legs and arms. I don’t notice it as much on my face, but I think that is because I already use exfoliating cleanser and moisturizer on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exfolimate is made with surgical grade stainless steel and will not harbor germs, bacteria or chemicals like loofahs, sponges and shower gloves. To clean it, you simply run it under water and then hang to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I used to use an exfoliating glove in the shower. I have heard that exfoliating gloves and washcloths are too abrasive and can actually damage your skin and make it oilier. I didn’t really know what else to use…until now. I am so happy that I found Exfolimate. I will definitely continue to use this product. You may even see me in some tank tops (well….maybe after I learn Michelle Obama’s arm workout).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend giving Exfolimate a try! I personally love it.y run it under water and then hang to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I used to use an exfoliating glove in the shower.

            <li> I am certain you could register Exfolimate as a weapon in certain countries. At first glance, the product seemed intimidating. It was my own ignorance for thinking this would be more of a exfoliating brush than a tool. Here is my pleasant and surprising experience with Exfolimate:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions provided as superb and user-friendly. I did not utilize strings included in the box as I found the tool comfortable and easy to use after following directions. You have to hold the tool at a directed angle. It is not a razor even though it appears sharp. The blade portion glides over your wet and hydrated skin to remove the top layer of unhealthy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exfolimate is a fascinating tool for dry skin. I immediately noticed my skin was smooth and soft. We had recently returned from a beach trip and I had patches of sunburnt, drying skin. Exfolimate did a fantastic job in removing dry skin, which was starting to feel itchy and uncomfortable. I also noticed an improvement in ingrown hairs as the tool removed a top layer of dry skin and exposed healthy skin underneath. I moisturized as usual but the next morning my skin felt wonderfully soft and silky smooth. It will be interesting to see if this product can assist in reducing appearance of cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would encourage you to give Exfolimate a try. I feel like the product has opened my eyes in terms of skincare tools. There is also a smaller tool included in this kit for your face, which I have not had a chance to fully utilize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Being a beauty blogger is not always as glamorous as it seems. Many times we deal with rashes, breakouts, funky products but nevertheless rashes or not we do it for our love of beauty and for our fans. In  between those moments are products that just knock us off our feet. I mean truly transform what we believe a product is and should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now while I consider myself to be really even headed there are products that change my thinking. Like for example Wen Hair Care Products. Remember when he first came out with his hair line? Remember he was telling us lather is bad and our eyes could not believe it. Everything that we where told about shampooing our hair was wrong. It was simply crazy to grasp because we loved our lather. But then we kept tuning in and before we knew it we called and ordered. Now while it took us a second to catch on to what Wen&#x27;s creator Chaz Dean was telling us; the evidence spoke for itself. As it did with my latest reviewed item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I recently tried the Exfoliate. A face and body exfoliation tool. It is a hand held nonelectric tool that has micro grooves in the edge of the tool that gently exfoliate your skin. It is a true transforming cutting edge tool. It gets you to rethink a deep cleanse. No electricity, no damage to skin, no recovery time, and no products. It is simply a tool that gently yet deeply cleanses your skin. Perfect to use before your skin care regiment like moisturizer and serums. Also perfect before you shave, for those crusty feet and elbows, or use before spray tanning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This patented tool is a natural, affordable, and easy to use tool that is truly going to transform the home beauty industry. Mark my words. The verdict is in. Get your Exfolimate today.</li>
            <li> My wife was able to review the Exfolimate for free. She is middle-aged and wanted to use a product to enhance her skin. She said the directions were easy to follow and the product was easy to use. When she first opened it, she was confused until she read the directions. This is a product that you should follow the directions if you want to use it correctly. She automatically noticed softer skin after the first use, After a week, there was a noticeable healthiness to her facial skin. Her face looks younger which makes her look younger. This product takes away the unhealthy skin and makes her look great. This is a great product that my wife is glad she had the chance to use.</li>
            <li> Loved it! It worked wonders on my skin! Even with a 4 month old razor it left me with soft and silky smooth legs for days! Next time I get a spray tan I&#x27;m going to make sure I use this first. I personally think it works best when you use it after soaking in a salt bath though. It removed so much dead skin that it clogged my razor with every stroke. Impressive. And no bacteria growth like with loofahs, sponges, poof balls, or rags. And it removed those annoying bumps on the back of my arms - Keratosis Pilaris. Would recommend to my friends!</li>
            <li> So as most know you should use some sort of exfoliating brush or tool when cleaning your face and body. I like most people was using a loofa. I was always concerned about germs being left behind in the loofa and being passed from body part to body part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  With the Exfolimate I do not have to worry about germs sitting around in a sponge ready to get e sick. The Exfolimate it a smooth clean face and body tool used to remove deep down dirt and dead skin to reveal smooth healthy glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It is unlike anything I have ever used before. It has a hard but smooth plastic outer shell encasing a metal edge. Do not worry the edge is almost soft and is not sharp. I though at first it would hurt or irritate my skin but that was not the case at all. It glides smoothly across my face and body for a fresh clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have noticed since using the Exfolimate my skin is not as dry as it once was. It looks and feels healthier and almost glows on most days. My knees and elbows have never looked better. No more dry ashy spots, just smooth soft skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I use my Exfolimate twice a day. Once in the morning and once before bed. I use it on both my face and my body. I do not use any type of special face or body wash just the usual.  I absolutely love this little tool. Fits perfectly in my hand with out slipping and leaves my skin looking healthier and younger, what is not to love?</li>
            <li> First things first-THIS IS NOT A RAZOR! Exfolimate is meant to remove dead, dry skin cells and other debris that clog up your skin. It is a chemical free way to exfoliate your skin. No other washes, scrubs or lotions are needed, no worries of irritation or sensitivity. Exfolimate simply works with water and the light pressure you apply. My skin is smoother and silky soft after just a few uses. No more rough or dry patches for me. I have really enjoyed how this has made my skin feel. During the winter months I tend to get dry patches, but not anymore! Simply put, it does what it says, it is easy to use and there is NO prep work needed. It is easy to use when not in use and travels well! In my book it is a must have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you just wish you could scrap, or really clean away that dried skin on your face, maybe your legs and neck at home? Well, now you can without spending an arm and a leg to go to a day spa. The Exfolimate was created and designed in Australia for ladies everywhere. The Exfolimate is a small enough skin care product you can take with you wherever you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will instantly exfoliate your skin, while reducing those unkind pores showing up on your face. The best thing about using the Exfolimate is there is no fuss with using scrubs or loofahs that might be too harsh on your face, only thinking this will scrub away the damage to your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Exfolimate is made with these things called micro-grooves. This type of facial technology allows for hidden dirt and pores to gently be lifted, while removing all those lingering skin cells. In return, your face will look younger and younger everyday this product is used. It is a win-win situation. So, now is the time to purchase your set of Exfolimate&#x27;s and show off your new skin, your younger looking skin without any chemicals to ever use again.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I love this new way to exfoliate. I have oily skin and using scrubs is so bad for my skin. I tend to breakout because they have a lot of ingredients, and the scrub is so heavy to exfoliate my sensitive skin. This tool is amazing because we only have to use warm water. It is pretty gently. When you pass the tool over your wet skin you can see how all the dead cells stay in the metal. I have noticed the skin of my face so soft and smoother and my pores are smaller. I highly recommend to try it&lt;br /&gt;@MakeupByOne</li>
            <li> 2 Exfolimate - face and body exfoliation was a surprise to me in the way that it works. I have used things to exfoliate my skin before but never anything like this. It gets that junk off of your skin and helps it to breathe and look and feel smoother.</li>
            <li> When my wife told me about the Exfolimate I was skeptical, but using it for the first I was sold. I noticed small, but immediate results and was awe struck. A month later now my skin has never looked so healthy. My face glows it&#x27;s so clear and those embarrassing in grown hairs anywhere, gone.&lt;br /&gt;By simple routine this simple product did what thousands in exfoliating products could not.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I am a man&#x27;s man, beard, musk and labor intensive job. Let that speak for this amazing product.</li>
            <li> I am definitely loving this product. I use it about 10 minutes after getting in the shower, to allow my skin to absorb the water, and moisten my skin. The metal edge is NOT sharp, so no need to worry about shaving off any peach fuzz, or hair on your face. It is not a razor. It&#x27;s dull metal edge, that  glides over your face, to remove any dead skin, or debris you might have linger, that you might not otherwise remove using a loofa, or wash cloth. This significantly removes more gunk off my face, and I feel it noticeably cleaner than when I don&#x27;t use it. I can&#x27;t say it actually reduces signs of aging, but as far as cleaning, it absolutely works. Use a bit of your favorite face cleanser, or body wash, and put the product to use afterwards. I use the orange PVC strings to hang the Exfolimate in my shower, so those come in handy. I&#x27;m absolutely loving this. I hope it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I suffer from extremely dry skin and it seems that no matter what I do, I cannot get my skin to stay moisturized or to stop itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried countless exfoliating scrubs and tools, but never found anything that showed much promise… Until now. This product is hands down the best thing I have ever found for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time and immediately felt, and saw, a difference. You can actually SEE the dead skin cells you are removing on the tool, proving that it is working. I combined the Exfolimate with a body scrub, as was recommended, and got amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Exfolimate looks like a blade but was gentle, yet effective enough to relieve my dry skin by removing the dead top layer of skin on my body and face to allow moisture to rehydrate it. I used a lotion on my face and body after my shower and could feel it absorbing so much better than it used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is incredible and if you suffer from very dry skin like me, you know how frustrating it is to get moisture into your skin and keep it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Exfolimate is so easy to use. First, you let your skin get wet in the shower and then you use the tool in a 90 degree angle up and down your arms, legs, and other body parts, with or without first using a scrub but as I mentioned earlier, adding a scrub first is the most effective use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a separate, smaller tool for facial exfoliation. Both tools come with a convenient plastic cord that attaches to each of them to keep them hanging in the shower after use. You do have to clean the Exfolimate every few strokes with your fingers and the water, otherwise the dead skin will build up and make the tools harder to use. All in all, this a great product and an awesome value. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for new products that are going to give me beautiful, glowing skin. Sometimes it feels like all the creams and cleansers and lotions and potions are overwhelming, though. I&#x27;d like to strip my skin clean and bare of all those chemicals and treatments and just let it breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Exfolimate seems kind of perfect for that. There are no creams or scrubs needed, just pure water and this tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Exfolimate extremely simple to use. The two-piece set comes with one tool for your body and a smaller tool for your face. You can us them in the bath or shower, once your skin is supple with moisture. Then you hold it at a 90-degree angle and run the stainless steel edge along your skin. The edges aren&#x27;t sharp and the sensation is kind of soothing and pleasant. I could definitely see little bits of dead skin etc being flaked off as I used the tool. It&#x27;s a lot less harsh than scrubbing and I think it&#x27;s made a difference in the overall health and appearance of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is exfoliation so important, you might wonder. Aside from giving your skin an overall smoother and more youthful appearance, it helps with your other beauty endeavors. From making an even surface for your spray tan to adhere to, to making sure your makeup goes on smoothly, to clearing the way for shaving and waxing and even making sure your feet are perfectly pedicured- it&#x27;s a pretty important step in your daily routine. I think this is well worth the money and investment of time.</li>
            <li> Surprising results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skeptical at first, I didn&#x27;t think this product would work.  I was caught by surprise.  I was very skeptical about this metal piece actually working, and worried that it was sharp and would be slicing or cutting open my skin.  I tested my face first, and WOW, completely surprised that it actually works.  The first time I tested this product, I first washed my face free of makeup, then did a deep pour cleanse, then used the metal exfoliator on my face, even after 2 face washes, that exfoliator still got a TON of gunk off my face.  It was gross, cool, and weird all at the same time.  So then I decided to test out the body exfoliator.  When I tested that I didn&#x27;t notice as much stuff coming off my skin, but my skin has been smoother, my leg shaving is better, with less ingrown hairs.  So its working.  It works.  Surprisingly it works WELL.  I have to recommend this product because it works.  I am still so baffled that it does.  I was completely ready to give this product a thumbs down, but I can&#x27;t.  This  product can be used daily or periodically in the shower or bath...basically you can use it as often as you want without it causing damage or harming your skin.  It is best to use this in the shower after your skin is very wet and &amp;#34;supple&amp;#34; because it opens up your pours and softens your pours so the gunk can more easily be removed.</li>
            <li> I have been eager to discover healthy, safe methods to care for my skin.  Not much of an expert in the beauty department, I am essentially a novice.  When I had the chance to try Exfolimate, I went for it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exfolimate is an exfoliator for the face and body.  Intended for use prior to any skincare, shaving or hair removal treatments in order to exfoliate.  Super easy to use, one simply holds the Exfolimate and glides it across the skin at a 90 degree angle while in the shower or hot bath.  With cords included for attaching to your wrist and hanging in the shower, they are easy to use and store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exfolimate has many applications and benefits:&lt;br /&gt;  ~ It can be used pre-shave to lift ingrown hairs and provide a smoother shave.&lt;br /&gt;  ~ It removes dead skin for smoother, softer feeling skin that looks brighter and improves skin tone and texture.&lt;br /&gt;  ~ It can help provide deeper cleansing for enhanced exfoliation, which leads to reduction of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience so far has been positive.  I especially noticed results on normal rough patches, like my elbows, knees and heels where dead skin seems to collect.  I simply took a shower and, before any shaving or other skincare, I slowly pulled the Exfolimate across my skin at a 90 degree angle.  At first I was a bit concerned it would remove hair as the edge looks much like a razor blade.  Using it on my face scared me.  However, no hair was removed, and as I used it more I became more comfortable with it.  After using the product, I applied moisturizer as directed and that was it!  Easy to use, 2 sizes, each labeled for their intended use (face or body).  Each time I use them, it seems the results are better and I notice my skin looking better.  Definitely keeping these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> one of the things I loved about the product was how soft my skin felt after every use super friendly follow directions , my skin wasnt as dry as it tents to be during the winter time.At first I thought this product wasn’t going to work and I would see no difference on my skin but to my surprise I did specially using after removing my make up in the shower worked perfect and there wasn’t any make up residue left , I also used it to removed tanning spray skin left over it makes my skin so smooth and soft I recommend this product list price $29.99 now $20.00 saving you a 40% discount on a product that works wonder on your skin doesn’t get better than that!.</li>
            <li> These two plastic pieces with metal blade, but it is not sharp and will not cut you. Great for any parts of the body, the little one for face, and the big one for the body, but it doesn’t matter really, they both do the same anyways. These are very fun to use, I use mine right before I jump into the shower. Get all the dead skin, pulls out the dryness in my arms and legs. I love how handy this little tool is, makes it tons times easier to remove the dead skin vs using sugar scrub. Great tools for your body, the blades are non harmful and get the job done when you need it. I can tell after 2 weeks of using this on my legs, they are softer, holds moisture better, less need of lotion, and the puff ball doesn’t have dead skin on it. The fact we grow it over night, and piles up, if not removed over time, can make your skin dry and itchy, so time by time is great to have a better tool to use, with less scrubbing involved.</li>
            <li> Great tool that travels well.  I used the face and body tools and loved them both.  I&#x27;ll definitely be traveling with my exfolimate in lieu of exfoliating scrubs. This is a great option for anyone who uses an RV (where you don&#x27;t want to send pumice scrubs, etc down the drain).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a few reviews where people suggested that they cut themselves or shaved hair from their skin.  I cannot even imagine how that could have happened.  This is one of the least efficient tools with which to injure yourself - it&#x27;s in the same category as spoons.  I used a lot of pressure on my sensitive skin in varying directions and found the product to be completely safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product from another retailer for $15, so the price on Amazon seems high and I deducted one star for this.</li>
            <li> Exfolimate is a new breakthrough in Skincare technology, and as far as I&#x27;m concerned you can use it anywhere on your body if there&#x27;s dry skin.  No, if you use it on your face it doesn&#x27;t take away the hair where if you were shaving as you know, once you start you can&#x27;t stop because the hair will grow back heavier.  This is NOT the same principle.  Using patented Smooth edge micro groove technology, exfolimate gently releases dirt, and oil embedded beneath your skin&#x27;s surface. This radical deep-cleanse dramatically improves tone and texture, while reducing pore size, (which I love that part because I have these large pores), and oily Patches, dry areas and visible signs of ageing.  Oh no, NOT AGING!  YES, AGING!  We all do it.  In addition to deeper cleansing, Exfolimate offers users enhanced exfoliation and superior moisturization by improving the absorption of Skincare products. It&#x27;s safe for all skin types, and leaves my skin feeling softer and noticeably brighter and refreshed.  I mean dang, where has this product been the last twenty years of my life!  SHEESH!</li>
            <li> This product comes with two tools, a smaller one for the face and a larger one for the body. I used  this during the shower as it suggested and all you need to do is slide the metal side against your skin. It did make my skin a little red afterwards. As much as I wanted to like this, it&#x27;s just not for me. The concept is great and all, though. I just noticed that my skin wasn&#x27;t as exfoliated as I wanted it to be. Most people have had better success than I did so I still do recommend that you give it try.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not this thing is really easy to use. I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much from using this...but this ish really WORKS!!!! REALLY, REALLY WELL!!! It makes my skin feel crazy soft &amp; it&#x27;s so fast to use. The body one is also pretty boss, but it&#x27;s a lot more time consuming so I use it less... I tan a lot so this thing gets my skin looking fab &amp; not all dry looking again really quickly! Recommend for all that tan regularly :)</li>
