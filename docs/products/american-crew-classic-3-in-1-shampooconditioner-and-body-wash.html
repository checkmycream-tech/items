            <li>This is great stuff and helped me consolidate the bottles!</li>
            <li>Having said that, it&#x27;s very good soap from a functional standpoint.</li>
            <li>It works great just as a shampoo/conditioner which is how I use it; I don&#x27;t use it as a body wash.</li>
            <li>It also has a great fragrance.</li>
            <li>Great everything in one shampoo.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s every bit as good as the stylist told me it would be, now I use it all the time you get what you pay for thats for sure.</li>
            <li>good product good price free shipping makes it even better</li>
            <li>would use it more for body wash than shampoo/conditioner at this point.</li>
            <li>used the shampoo earlier and was very impressed with the product.</li>

            <li>Perfect for the lazy ones out there.</li>
            <li>It smells just like the Farrah Fawcett Shampoo from back in the day, so nice!</li>
            <li>My teenaged son emerges from a shower clean with  no overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li>Packaging was good, bubble wrapped like the other reviewer mentioned, but mine had tape over the top to keep it from exploding</li>
            <li>I have been using this for awhile, nice clean smell, leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I use it regularly and it has a good smell and works well.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find this stuff, I have super sensitive skin and normally anything with perfumes in it will immediately make me break out.  </li>
            <li>I have used American Crew (Classic) for many years and was delighted when I saw this 3-in-1.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly</li>
            <li>This one has a great, unique smell that I get compliments on and leaves my hair feeling soft and definitely prevents dryness.</li>
            <li>Not sure why so many dudes here think this stuff smells so good.</li>
            <li>This is more than twice the price but works as well as the old Pantene formula.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend the tea tree kind of American Crew as well.</li>
            <li>Soap + shampoo + conditioner in 1 is right up his alley.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find a more pleasant fragrance in men&#x27;s personal care products than the American Crew Classic line of products.  </li>
            <li>I first bought it at the barber shop and thought it was over priced ,but you know what?</li>
            <li>This actually seems to keep me pretty moisturized and is easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>He loves the fresh clean smell and it that he only needs one bottle to do three jobs.</li>
            <li>Love American Crew stuff and I should have stuck with the Classic shampoo/conditioner but thought I would try this combo out.</li>
            <li>It has a nice mild scent though and leaves your hair soft and less greasy throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean and leaves hair soft with no tangles or built up sticky residue (unlike the new Pantene formula).  </li>
            <li>I really like this 3in 1</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about two years and really like it.  </li>
            <li>I  really like using this.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The seller did their part with fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like using tis at the gym.</li>
            <li>They both have dry scalp, but their hair gets oily easy and this has cured this issue.</li>
            <li>I am returning the product but it would be a hassle for me to return it as the bottle is sticky as outside is full of shampoo</li>
            <li>Smell is refreshing but all in all not worth 3 times the price of a high street brand.</li>
            <li>It requires a small amount that goes a long way, and my pooches smell great.</li>
            <li>The regular body wash by American Crew smells more manly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other American Crew products in the past, but was a bit wary of how good a 3-in-1 would be; however, once I tried this stuff, I realized quickly how great it is.  </li>
            <li>The new Pantene formula smells medicinal.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>his skin and hair are always soft after.</li>
            <li>American Crew Men Classic 3-In-1 Shampoo</li>
            <li>I thought  &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34; was large, and this 1/2 size was the same price as the much larger bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying another when the bottle gets a little more empty.</li>
            <li>I just wouldn&#x27;t personally consider this a very masculine scent.</li>
            <li>I had to find a new shampoo/conditioner after Pantene switched to a cheap and inferior formula for their volumizing shampoo/conditioner for thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I will go back the the Classic products or even try the Tea Tree shampoo next by American Crew.</li>
            <li>I have some dandruff now that their other products didn&#x27;t do as much.</li>
            <li>American Crew has a subtle, clean scent that can&#x27;t be beat.</li>

            <li> Bought it for about ten bucks locally, but it&#x27;s new and sometimes difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> Since this is one of the few grooming products I use - I&#x27;m not a big freak about it -</li>

            <li> No, it&#x27;s not too expensive considering how long a bottle last with daily use</li>
            <li> The shampoo was packed in Amazon small box without any bubble wrap cover and when I received it, half of the content was already spilled into the box and outside of the bottle.</li>

            <li> My hair seem to have less volume</li>
            <li> Its rather concentrated so the least amount will give lots of suds.</li>
            <li> very unhappy as they shipped me American Crew- &amp;#34;Supplier for Men&amp;#34; when it says &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Expensive lesson -</li>
            <li> I Have Posted my review, Bad Shampoo</li>
            <li> No...very disappointed</li>
            <li> My bad!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought this for my teenage son. He loves that it&#x27;s a 3-in-1 and the smell of it. Definitely will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Love American Crew stuff and I should have stuck with the Classic shampoo/conditioner but thought I would try this combo out. It smells nice and lathers generously but I feel like it is drying my scalp out a bit. I have some dandruff now that their other products didn&#x27;t do as much. Maybe it is the shampoo/conditioner combo instead of separates like I&#x27;m used to, but this stuff has definitely given me flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use it more for body wash than shampoo/conditioner at this point. I will go back the the Classic products or even try the Tea Tree shampoo next by American Crew. This one won&#x27;t be purchased again. It has a nice mild scent though and leaves your hair soft and less greasy throughout the day. I just need to try something else for the flakage. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, manly scent, good for hair, body wash... Everything</li>
            <li> The shampoo was packed in Amazon small box without any bubble wrap cover and when I received it, half of the content was already spilled into the box and outside of the bottle. I hope next time Amazon pack the item properly. I am returning the product but it would be a hassle for me to return it as the bottle is sticky as outside is full of shampoo and I can&#x27;t use the same box as it is already unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the shampoo earlier and was very impressed with the product.</li>
            <li> Not sure why so many dudes here think this stuff smells so good. To me it smells rather androgynous. Having said that, it&#x27;s very good soap from a functional standpoint. Because I don&#x27;t care for the scent, I ended up giving my two dogs a bath with it. For that, it is 10 times better than any pet shampoo I&#x27;ve used before. It requires a small amount that goes a long way, and my pooches smell great. I just wouldn&#x27;t personally consider this a very masculine scent. The regular body wash by American Crew smells more manly. Just my two scents there...get it?</li>
            <li> American Crew makes great products and this one is no exception. This 3-in-1 product is very convenient and has a nice manly scent.</li>
            <li> This three-in-one shampoo, conditioner, and body wash is awesome.  Bought it for about ten bucks locally, but it&#x27;s new and sometimes difficult to find.  I have used American Crew (Classic) for many years and was delighted when I saw this 3-in-1.  Actually, for me, it&#x27;s a 4-in-1 because I use it to shave with too.  I have yet to find a more pleasant fragrance in men&#x27;s personal care products than the American Crew Classic line of products.  After a shower there&#x27;s no need for aftershave or cologne.  American Crew has a subtle, clean scent that can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for awhile, nice clean smell, leaves my hair feeling soft. Its rather concentrated so the least amount will give lots of suds. No, it&#x27;s not too expensive considering how long a bottle last with daily use</li>
            <li> I really like this 3in 1 shampoo I first bought it at the barber shop and thought it was over priced ,but you know what? it&#x27;s every bit as good as the stylist told me it would be, now I use it all the time you get what you pay for thats for sure.</li>
            <li> This product is convenient as it shampoos and conditions hair and can be used as a body wash.  My teenaged son emerges from a shower clean with  no overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> I Have Posted my review, Bad Shampoo</li>
            <li> My husband loves the 3 in 1 and, it cuts down on shower clutter. I love the scent</li>
            <li> Great product leaves hair with good body</li>
            <li> The 3 in 1 is just ok. My hair seem to have less volume and I didn&#x27;t like the way I smelled after using it for bodywash. I didn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li> I enterd the search terms in Amazon for a &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34; American Crew Men Classic 3-In-1 Shampoo, what I got instead was a medium sized 15 oz. bottle at the same price as the  1000Ml/33.8Oz. My bad! Expensive lesson - I thought  &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34; was large, and this 1/2 size was the same price as the much larger bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two years and really like it.  I like the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; in my scalp and that it smells good.  Since this is one of the few grooming products I use - I&#x27;m not a big freak about it - I  really like using this.  I bought it from Amazon because I could no longer find it in my home town.</li>
            <li> I used this daily for over a month. Yes, it is a good product and works as a shampoo and shower gel. Smell is refreshing but all in all not worth 3 times the price of a high street brand. When it ran out I just switched back.</li>
            <li> so much cheaper then hair store.works great for a complete clean and fresh shower experience.shipped very safe and fast.thanks again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other American Crew products in the past, but was a bit wary of how good a 3-in-1 would be; however, once I tried this stuff, I realized quickly how great it is.  I love being able to just grab one bottle to bring to the gym instead of three, plus it smells great and doesn&#x27;t overly dry out my skin.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed for the price I paid.  Will probably just stick with whatever is on sale next time I go to CVS.</li>
            <li> My stylist gave me a sample bottle of Crew 3 in 1 to take on a short airline flight.  It works great just as a shampoo/conditioner which is how I use it; I don&#x27;t use it as a body wash. I had to find a new shampoo/conditioner after Pantene switched to a cheap and inferior formula for their volumizing shampoo/conditioner for thin hair.  This is more than twice the price but works as well as the old Pantene formula.  It rinses clean and leaves hair soft with no tangles or built up sticky residue (unlike the new Pantene formula).  It also has a great fragrance. The new Pantene formula smells medicinal.  I recommend this Crew product.</li>
            <li> I used to be a heads and shoulders guy. But after trying crew a couple of years ago, I am fully sold. Hair is soft and easy, great product.</li>
            <li> Great everything in one shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this stuff, I have super sensitive skin and normally anything with perfumes in it will immediately make me break out.  This actually seems to keep me pretty moisturized and is easy to travel with.  Packaging was good, bubble wrapped like the other reviewer mentioned, but mine had tape over the top to keep it from exploding so I didn&#x27;t have that issue. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my college-aged son so he didn&#x27;t need several products in his dorm bathroom. He loves the fresh clean smell and it that he only needs one bottle to do three jobs. The seller did their part with fast shipping.</li>
            <li> good product good price free shipping makes it even better</li>
            <li> very unhappy as they shipped me American Crew- &amp;#34;Supplier for Men&amp;#34; when it says &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have always been a crew fan and this product is one of their best! Tried other products, but this one beats all others.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff and helped me consolidate the bottles!</li>
            <li> I really like using tis at the gym. You only need to carry one product instead of three. Smells good and does the job.</li>
            <li> First time to use it good Crew  3 in 1 shampoo conditioner and body wash and will reorder and fast service</li>
            <li> Seems to last a long time. Smells good. I&#x27;ll be buying another when the bottle gets a little more empty.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the lazy ones out there. Instead of stocking a shampoo, conditioner and a soap...this is packed in 1. I use it regularly and it has a good smell and works well. Recommended...especially for saving space.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my husband and he loves it. Soap + shampoo + conditioner in 1 is right up his alley. Great scent. Arrived quickly</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff. We were getting it at Freddy&#x27;s for twice the price and they quit selling it. Really good price on a good product!</li>
            <li> No...very disappointed</li>
            <li> All I can say is my husband smells so good every day he uses it and his skin and hair are always soft after.</li>
            <li> My son and my brother both use this shampoo/body wash ... and love it. They both have dry scalp, but their hair gets oily easy and this has cured this issue.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. One, it works. Two, it has a great aroma. Three, I just wish they had bar soap to use at the gym. Other than that it is what I use at home.</li>
            <li> WOW! It smells just like the Farrah Fawcett Shampoo from back in the day, so nice!</li>
            <li> I actually only use this as a shampoo + conditioner, but the American Crew lineup has served me well over the past. This one has a great, unique smell that I get compliments on and leaves my hair feeling soft and definitely prevents dryness. I&#x27;d recommend the tea tree kind of American Crew as well.</li>
            <li> Great 3 in 1 shampoo for man.</li>
