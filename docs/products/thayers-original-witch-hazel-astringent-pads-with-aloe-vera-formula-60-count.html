            <li>I love these Thayers Witch Hazel pads!</li>
            <li>Strong astringent, great for post work-outs and oily face.</li>
            <li>It is best to buy a bottle instead and get pure cotton swabs or splash it on your face.</li>
            <li>Amazing for stubborn acne.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I use the Thayers Rose Witch Hazel</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>I use this as a non-drying alternative to popular products like &amp;#34;boo-boo zap&amp;#34; and clearasil.  </li>
            <li>I buy these for my teenagers who prefer to not have to have cotton balls handy.  </li>
            <li>very convenient, great for travel!  </li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, the waffle texture of the pads themselves is great, and they do exactly what they are meant to do.</li>
            <li>Work great, high quality, and great price.  </li>
            <li>Great replacement for washing your face every night - use these, slap on some lotion and go to bed with a clean, moisturized face.  </li>
            <li>This item has a strong alcohol smell, not as good as bottle toners.</li>
            <li>I purchased the rose toner in the bottle before but opted for the pads this time around and these are just more convenient.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and there is not an overpowering alcohol odor like many astringents have.</li>
            <li>It only comes in scent-free and I miss that wonderful rose and peach fragrance.</li>
            <li>They are refreshing without any of that \\&quot;mint sting\\</li>
            <li>, but I think I like the &#x27;flavor&#x27; of the witch hazel that comes in these pads even better.</li>
            <li>I am truly satisfied.</li>
            <li>I just didnt love these pads.  </li>
            <li>It has evened out my skin tone, the pores on my nose are no longer visible, and I swear my wrinkles even look better.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered another batch of these pads, because I really do love them.  </li>
            <li>3 more words</li>
            <li>I thought with these ingredients, I wouldn&#x27;t have any problems and the pads were so much more convenient, but I kept noticing my face and neck kept accumulating bumpy flesh-colored texture every time I washed.</li>
            <li>This product is OK.  </li>
            <li>and I love that.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>These are better than some of &#x27;high-end&#x27; toning pads I&#x27;ve tried, and way more affordable.</li>
            <li>Love the witch hazel pads.</li>
            <li>Because of the size, sometimes I have to use more than one.  </li>
            <li>I use Dr. Thayers witch hazel toner twice a day every day and my skin is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>Love these Witch Hazel pads.  </li>
            <li>I CAN:)</li>
            <li>I love them and plan to continue using them.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>My face never has a reaction from it it helps with my oily t zone love it.</li>
            <li>I love these witch hazel pads.</li>
            <li>I love that it is nature.  </li>
            <li>They are very cool and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>Quality appears fine, works well, and Thayer&#x27;s is a reputable brand.</li>
            <li>My face feels really refreshed, tingly and bright after use.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really refreshing and a nice item to have on the go when it gets hot</li>
            <li>I bought these to use for camping &amp; they&#x27;ve turned out to be one of the best products I have purchased as there are other uses besides the face.</li>
            <li>I love these pads because it allows me to quickly clean my face.</li>
            <li>I found that I went through a bottle much faster than the wipes, which made the pads more cost effective for me.  </li>
            <li>The jar is fine for the desk drawer</li>
            <li>They like it just fine.  </li>
            <li>This is great for the skin, it doesn&#x27;t dry complexion out, makes it more even and pimple free.</li>
            <li>Aloe Alcohol Free - 12 oz]]</li>
            <li>the go&amp;#34; toner, but it is NOT alcohol free</li>
            <li>But also, my fault I didnt pay attention that it was not alcohol free.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found out that witch hazel is great for drying my skin and removing pimples within the same day of using it.</li>
            <li>Whenever I use these pads no matter how lightly I sweep them across my face they seem to scratch my face.  </li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t buy this again if dickinson&#x27;s witch hazel pads are available.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>and they do a great job of freshening me up after a long day</li>
            <li>also great for long trips in between showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my skin more oily, though not at first.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Also, I wish that this product was eligible for the free super savings, but it was not when I made the purchase.  </li>
            <li>I, myself, prefer the rose scented bottle, but I&#x27;m the biggest lover of witch hazel in ANY form, so was glad to find something my picky teens would use daily.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to clean my cat&#x27;s ears-</li>
            <li>The pads are very moist and provide some abrasion to wash away dirt and keep hairs (if you&#x27;re a man like me) from becoming ingrown too easily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a true value.</li>
            <li>Vet said it was allergies rather than full anal glands.  </li>
            <li>This helped to clear my skin nicely.</li>
            <li>so you can use it with your own textured cotton pads long after the original pads are gone!</li>
            <li>Leaves a clean fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE Thayers Products, especially the witch hazel, lavender toner.  </li>
            <li>And normally I just the bottle of witch hazel and normal cleansing pads, but this is 10x better!</li>
            <li>I also used a pad to get old scotch tape off of a window that had been there for many years.</li>
            <li>the Vitamin E and Witch Hazel natural cleanser gives you a good, natural skin cleansing.  </li>
            <li>I switched from buying the bottled witch hazel and my own facial cotton swipes to the container of moistened pads.  </li>
            <li>the full five stars is because the pads would be better if they were slightly bigger.  </li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s a pleasant aroma..not the bitter scent of pure witch</li>
            <li>, this is an overall good natural product.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more.  </li>
            <li>But I can never find it anywhere except a whole foods store, and can rarely find it.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not to say they won&#x27;t work for the next person :)</li>
            <li>They clean up leftover makeup after regular washing and they leave you skin feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>They leave my skin feeling clean and soft without drying it out.</li>
            <li>Totally love it, so simple and cheap but better than more expensive pads I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The container has more then enough witch hazel to keep the pads moist, there is so much in there that in have to wring the pads out before using them.</li>
            <li>Finally decided to go the Amazon route, and it&#x27;s a nice little add-on item so you can get free shipping on it if you are already placing an order!</li>
            <li>Secret to beautiful, glowing skin.  </li>
            <li>I did notice some drying the first week of use and used a light facial lotion</li>
            <li>Be very careful with this product and make sure you do a patch test first.</li>
            <li>Now I can take a presoaked pad out and wipe down my face before I moisturize and its super easy.  </li>
            <li>Fast makeup remover refreshes and brightens skin</li>
            <li>really really like these, has made any blemishes history</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very convenient to use also.</li>
            <li>The witch hazel is gentle on my skin</li>
            <li>This stuff is better suited for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>I get a much deeper clean with these textured pads than with the witch hazel alone on regular cotton pads.</li>
            <li>They are convenient, affordable, made with natural ingredients with no harsh chemicals, and they do not have this overwhelming fruity smell like most other astrigents or facial cleansers.  </li>
            <li>I was happily surprised how much I really like the Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel with Aloe Pads.</li>
            <li>These are rather larger -- too large for the use I need, really -- but they get the job done.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your skin toned and very soft.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend it for someone with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After a couple of minutes, it gets more oily faster than it usually does.</li>
            <li>smell of the product is a little on the strong side as well so</li>
            <li>with two pads I removed all the make-up on my face, leaving my skin feeling not only clean, but actually refreshed.  </li>
            <li>good product, i only wish the pads were a bit bigger, i usually end up using 2.</li>
            <li>My only wish, which isn&#x27;t worthy of taking any stars from it, is that they offered the pads in the same fragrances that the bottled version comes in.  </li>
            <li>It gets rid of the pimples quickly and without causing other issues like over-drying of the skin.</li>
            <li>Still I must say that THAYER TONERs are amazing products, they were game changers for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping if it keeps going in this direction to be clear in a month or two.</li>
            <li>I use them after a workout to get the excess oils off and start with a less soiled face to clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mixed so my skin can get very oily for no reasons</li>
            <li>I suggest you do not waste your money and but the bottle.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you have a sensitive sniffer you might wanna hold your breath while using these.</li>
            <li>They are gentle, and I have noticed that my pores are looking smaller.</li>
            <li>It has the same texture as an oxy pad, which is very inappropriate for the product.</li>
            <li>, you can go from feeling \\&quot;soiled\\&quot; to fresh and tight-skinned in 30 sec without leaving your desk.  </li>
            <li>The pad is a bit on the rough side but that helps to clean deep into my pores.</li>
            <li>but I use them twice a day right out of the shower and before bed with the other soaps.</li>
            <li>They are the only new item I&#x27;ve introduced since the issue began.</li>
            <li>I personally like that because I feel like that, but if you want something with a softer texture or have very sensitive skin, you might want to try bottled witch hazel with cotton balls instead.</li>
            <li>I prefer Thayer&#x27;s to other brands that don&#x27;t have a moisturizer or a pretty scent.</li>
            <li>and I want mine to be as clear as possible.</li>
            <li>The pads are textured both sides to softly scrub &amp; they do remove any debris left on your skin even after washing.</li>
            <li>quite natural apart from the alcohol, so this is definitely a keeper.  </li>
            <li>They do not dry out your skin</li>
            <li>Which means they will not dry</li>
            <li>But the smell of these pads was unpleasant and a little harsh (kind of like jars of acne pads) and left a sticky residue on my skin after every use, so the feeling wasn&#x27;t very clean.</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;ve found out that witch hazel is great for drying my skin and removing pimples within the same day of using it.</li>
            <li> Whenever I use these pads no matter how lightly I sweep them across my face they seem to scratch my face.  </li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t buy this again if dickinson&#x27;s witch hazel pads are available.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> and they do a great job of freshening me up after a long day</li>
            <li> also great for long trips in between showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my skin more oily, though not at first.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Also, I wish that this product was eligible for the free super savings, but it was not when I made the purchase.  </li>
            <li> I, myself, prefer the rose scented bottle, but I&#x27;m the biggest lover of witch hazel in ANY form, so was glad to find something my picky teens would use daily.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to clean my cat&#x27;s ears-</li>
            <li> The pads are very moist and provide some abrasion to wash away dirt and keep hairs (if you&#x27;re a man like me) from becoming ingrown too easily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a true value.</li>
            <li> Vet said it was allergies rather than full anal glands.  </li>
            <li> This helped to clear my skin nicely.</li>
            <li> so you can use it with your own textured cotton pads long after the original pads are gone!</li>
            <li> Leaves a clean fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE Thayers Products, especially the witch hazel, lavender toner.  </li>
            <li> And normally I just the bottle of witch hazel and normal cleansing pads, but this is 10x better!</li>
            <li> I also used a pad to get old scotch tape off of a window that had been there for many years.</li>
            <li> the Vitamin E and Witch Hazel natural cleanser gives you a good, natural skin cleansing.  </li>
            <li> I switched from buying the bottled witch hazel and my own facial cotton swipes to the container of moistened pads.  </li>
            <li> the full five stars is because the pads would be better if they were slightly bigger.  </li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s a pleasant aroma..not the bitter scent of pure witch</li>
            <li> , this is an overall good natural product.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more.  </li>
            <li> But I can never find it anywhere except a whole foods store, and can rarely find it.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not to say they won&#x27;t work for the next person :)</li>
            <li> They clean up leftover makeup after regular washing and they leave you skin feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> They leave my skin feeling clean and soft without drying it out.</li>
            <li> Totally love it, so simple and cheap but better than more expensive pads I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The container has more then enough witch hazel to keep the pads moist, there is so much in there that in have to wring the pads out before using them.</li>
            <li> Finally decided to go the Amazon route, and it&#x27;s a nice little add-on item so you can get free shipping on it if you are already placing an order!</li>
            <li> Secret to beautiful, glowing skin.  </li>
            <li> I did notice some drying the first week of use and used a light facial lotion</li>
            <li> Be very careful with this product and make sure you do a patch test first.</li>
            <li> Now I can take a presoaked pad out and wipe down my face before I moisturize and its super easy.  </li>
            <li> Fast makeup remover refreshes and brightens skin</li>
            <li> really really like these, has made any blemishes history</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very convenient to use also.</li>
            <li> The witch hazel is gentle on my skin</li>
            <li> This stuff is better suited for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> I get a much deeper clean with these textured pads than with the witch hazel alone on regular cotton pads.</li>
            <li> They are convenient, affordable, made with natural ingredients with no harsh chemicals, and they do not have this overwhelming fruity smell like most other astrigents or facial cleansers.  </li>
            <li> I was happily surprised how much I really like the Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel with Aloe Pads.</li>
            <li> These are rather larger -- too large for the use I need, really -- but they get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your skin toned and very soft.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend it for someone with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After a couple of minutes, it gets more oily faster than it usually does.</li>
            <li> smell of the product is a little on the strong side as well so</li>
            <li> with two pads I removed all the make-up on my face, leaving my skin feeling not only clean, but actually refreshed.  </li>
            <li> good product, i only wish the pads were a bit bigger, i usually end up using 2.</li>
            <li> My only wish, which isn&#x27;t worthy of taking any stars from it, is that they offered the pads in the same fragrances that the bottled version comes in.  </li>
            <li> It gets rid of the pimples quickly and without causing other issues like over-drying of the skin.</li>
            <li> Still I must say that THAYER TONERs are amazing products, they were game changers for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping if it keeps going in this direction to be clear in a month or two.</li>
            <li> I use them after a workout to get the excess oils off and start with a less soiled face to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixed so my skin can get very oily for no reasons</li>
            <li> I suggest you do not waste your money and but the bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you have a sensitive sniffer you might wanna hold your breath while using these.</li>
            <li> They are gentle, and I have noticed that my pores are looking smaller.</li>
            <li> It has the same texture as an oxy pad, which is very inappropriate for the product.</li>
            <li> , you can go from feeling \\&quot;soiled\\&quot; to fresh and tight-skinned in 30 sec without leaving your desk.  </li>
            <li> The pad is a bit on the rough side but that helps to clean deep into my pores.</li>
            <li> but I use them twice a day right out of the shower and before bed with the other soaps.</li>
            <li> They are the only new item I&#x27;ve introduced since the issue began.</li>
            <li> I personally like that because I feel like that, but if you want something with a softer texture or have very sensitive skin, you might want to try bottled witch hazel with cotton balls instead.</li>
            <li> I prefer Thayer&#x27;s to other brands that don&#x27;t have a moisturizer or a pretty scent.</li>
            <li> and I want mine to be as clear as possible.</li>
            <li> The pads are textured both sides to softly scrub &amp; they do remove any debris left on your skin even after washing.</li>
            <li> quite natural apart from the alcohol, so this is definitely a keeper.  </li>
            <li> They do not dry out your skin</li>
            <li> Which means they will not dry</li>
            <li> But the smell of these pads was unpleasant and a little harsh (kind of like jars of acne pads) and left a sticky residue on my skin after every use, so the feeling wasn&#x27;t very clean.</li>
            <li> Not drying like other astringents on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but too big to stuff in your carry-on for long or overseas</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pricey and they dry out.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed shaving irritation redness and small acne-like bumps seemed to clear up some with repeated use.</li>
            <li> Then today, those bumps have not only spread but are now red little tiny little rashes.</li>
            <li> but I have an issue with black heads and this is the only product that has helped to minimize my blackheads as well as tighten my pores.</li>
            <li> , there is a little alcohol, but I would not say that the skin is left dry and taut.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they don&#x27;t scratch my face so much that there are red marks or anything</li>
            <li> Careful not to get in your eye though, it does sting a bit.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be easier than a cotton ball and witch hazel but not really.</li>
            <li> I do wish they were a little larger, but other than that they work!</li>
            <li> I kept assuming the problem was other items I was using.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Unlike with other pads where you feel there is a residue, so that you have not cleaned the skin, just wiped</li>
            <li> You need moisturizer as with any other astringent, but that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems</li>
            <li> and I have not had any issues with sensitivity or with dry skin like I have in the past with the cleansers that you buy at the drug store.</li>
            <li> Its benefit is that it is less harsh than other witch hazel brands, yet while pads are convenient, they can be a bit harsh.</li>
            <li> Without any products its just an oily mess.</li>
            <li> Now I use cooled pads on his behind every other day or so and the &amp;#34;scoootching&amp;#34; has stopped, also so has numerous trips to the Vet.</li>
            <li> I suspect that without it, it would not clean so well.</li>
            <li> I have tried other Thayers witch hazel toners in the past and never had any luck with them (made skin greasy/oily and bumpy)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these pads for a little over a month</li>
            <li> and i felt the pad was a bit harsh.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything for a few years after suffering a hormonal acne breakout that has persisted and not gone away.</li>
            <li> Waste of $$.</li>
            <li> I tried alcohol, but it was too harsh for her.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is they&#x27;re very thin and a little rough feeling.</li>
            <li> This product helps soothe irritation, but not sure if it helps eliminate the skin iriitation.</li>
            <li> No more messing with cotton pads and a bottle that could leak.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slow process</li>
            <li> So, the pads are on the small size and quite thin.  </li>
            <li> They give my skin a pick me up half through the day when my pores decide it&#x27;s time to start churning out the oil.  </li>
            <li> The pads are really thin so its hard to just grab one pad to use.  </li>
            <li> Definitely soothes the area, but not experiencing any eliminating of bumps :(</li>
            <li> or if I work very late.  </li>
            <li> &quot; so can use these year round without my skin feeling overly cold or too tingly.</li>
            <li> The pads are thin but well saturated with the witch hazel.  </li>
            <li> My face is difficult.</li>
            <li> IT MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE</li>
            <li> The pads also have a very rough texture which I think must have also irritated my skin very badly.</li>
            <li> The witch hazel pads work, cutting oiliness and getting grime off my face.  </li>
            <li> I hate to TMI here</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product helps soothe irritation, but not sure if it helps eliminate the skin iriitation. I bought it to alleviate or rid myself of bumps caused by shaving (ingrown hairs). Definitely soothes the area, but not experiencing any eliminating of bumps :(</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised how much I really like the Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel with Aloe Pads. They are refreshing without any of that \\&quot;mint sting\\&quot; so can use these year round without my skin feeling overly cold or too tingly. I bought these to use for camping &amp; they&#x27;ve turned out to be one of the best products I have purchased as there are other uses besides the face. The pads are textured both sides to softly scrub &amp; they do remove any debris left on your skin even after washing. They do not leave any lint plus there&#x27;s plenty of liquid in the jar. I also bought the bottle of Thayer&#x27;s Cucumber Witch Hazel [[ASIN:B003RC8ZQO Henry Thayer Company - Witch Hazel Cucumber Aloe Alcohol Free - 12 oz]], but I think I like the &#x27;flavor&#x27; of the witch hazel that comes in these pads even better.</li>
            <li> and I want mine to be as clear as possible. This product is excellent. It&#x27;s a true value. It cleans, tones and conditions. I will definitely re-order. I am truly satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is great for the skin, it doesn&#x27;t dry complexion out, makes it more even and pimple free. Also face looks refreshed and younger. Totally love it, so simple and cheap but better than more expensive pads I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I keep these on my desk at work.  They give my skin a pick me up half through the day when my pores decide it&#x27;s time to start churning out the oil.  They do not dry out your skin and there&#x27;s a pleasant aroma..not the bitter scent of pure witch hazel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus perk..the witch hazel is organic.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE Thayers Products, especially the witch hazel, lavender toner.  I ordered this as a &amp;#34;on the go&amp;#34; toner, but it is NOT alcohol free and i felt the pad was a bit harsh.  It felt like it scratched the skin.  Still I must say that THAYER TONERs are amazing products, they were game changers for my skin.  I just didnt love these pads.  But also, my fault I didnt pay attention that it was not alcohol free.</li>
            <li> Secret to beautiful, glowing skin.  I have been using these astringent pads nightly for weeks.  It has evened out my skin tone, the pores on my nose are no longer visible, and I swear my wrinkles even look better.    I will definitely be buying more.  UPDATE:  I&#x27;ve ordered another batch of these pads, because I really do love them.  However, after recommending them to several people, several have told me they find the pads a bit scratchy.  I personally like that because I feel like that, but if you want something with a softer texture or have very sensitive skin, you might want to try bottled witch hazel with cotton balls instead.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a portable jar of pads/wipes to refresh my face.  The witch hazel pads work, cutting oiliness and getting grime off my face.  I will purchase these again!  Reapply sunscreen if you&#x27;re doing outdoorsy stuff, though.</li>
            <li> I like to keep a jar of witch hazel pads in my desk... I have oily skin and they do a great job of freshening me up after a long day or if I work very late.  THey&#x27;re also great for long trips in between showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to get \\&quot;Dickinson&#x27;s\\&quot; but it seems they no longer make pads.  These are rather larger -- too large for the use I need, really -- but they get the job done.  The jar is fine for the desk drawer but too big to stuff in your carry-on for long or overseas flights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stil, you can go from feeling \\&quot;soiled\\&quot; to fresh and tight-skinned in 30 sec without leaving your desk.  Pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> Got this product within 3 days of ordering it. And normally I just the bottle of witch hazel and normal cleansing pads, but this is 10x better! I&#x27;m mixed so my skin can get very oily for no reasons and I&#x27;ve found out that witch hazel is great for drying my skin and removing pimples within the same day of using it. Also! I had my nose pierced twice so it works for my healing process.</li>
            <li> I have found these pads to give me almost immediate results. I would and have recommended them to friends as well. They&#x27;re the best.</li>
            <li> A great help for wounds</li>
            <li> good product, i only wish the pads were a bit bigger, i usually end up using 2. 3 more words</li>
            <li> Be very careful with this product and make sure you do a patch test first. I thought with these ingredients, I wouldn&#x27;t have any problems and the pads were so much more convenient, but I kept noticing my face and neck kept accumulating bumpy flesh-colored texture every time I washed. I kept assuming the problem was other items I was using. Then today, those bumps have not only spread but are now red little tiny little rashes. I realized its from these pads. They are the only new item I&#x27;ve introduced since the issue began. The pads also have a very rough texture which I think must have also irritated my skin very badly. I have tried other Thayers witch hazel toners in the past and never had any luck with them (made skin greasy/oily and bumpy) so now I know that this brand just does not work well for me and will go back to Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel.&lt;br /&gt;So just be sure to patch test!</li>
            <li> They do what it says, but if you have oily skin like I do then I suggest getting something else. This stuff makes my skin more oily, though not at first. After a couple of minutes, it gets more oily faster than it usually does. This stuff is better suited for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> These worked great postpartum.  I now often give as a postpartum care package to friends.  Only ones I could find without extra additives that i did not want.</li>
            <li> My face is difficult. Without any products its just an oily mess. I love these pads because it allows me to quickly clean my face. They&#x27;re really refreshing and a nice item to have on the go when it gets hot and my face starts gleaming. I purchased the rose toner in the bottle before but opted for the pads this time around and these are just more convenient.</li>
            <li> Works great on ass-teroids!  Could be larger though.</li>
            <li> This product is OK.  I purchased this because I use the Thayers Rose Witch Hazel and I love that. The pads are really thin so its hard to just grab one pad to use.  Also, it&#x27;s not soothing like the Witch hazel from the bottle.  I suggest you do not waste your money and but the bottle.</li>
            <li> These are so convenient for home and travel instead of the bottle of witch hazel and cotton pads.  Quality appears fine, works well, and Thayer&#x27;s is a reputable brand.</li>
            <li> Nice. Good for travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Thayers and have been using them daily for several years now. Finally I discovered the cleaning pads! I get a much deeper clean with these textured pads than with the witch hazel alone on regular cotton pads. More scents in the jar form, please!</li>
            <li> I used these pads on my dog.  He was continually &amp;#34;scootching&amp;#34; across the carpet,  Vet said it was allergies rather than full anal glands.  Now I use cooled pads on his behind every other day or so and the &amp;#34;scoootching&amp;#34; has stopped, also so has numerous trips to the Vet.</li>
            <li> Amazing for stubborn acne. I&#x27;ve tried everything for a few years after suffering a hormonal acne breakout that has persisted and not gone away. I started using cetaphil antibacterial bar with panoxyl body wash and I finally started noticing a difference but the breakouts on my shoulders wouldn&#x27;t go away. I started using the witch hazel pads and within a week the breakouts started clearing up. It&#x27;s a slow process and I&#x27;m already into my 2nd jar but I use them twice a day right out of the shower and before bed with the other soaps. I&#x27;m hoping if it keeps going in this direction to be clear in a month or two. And after years of trying to find something that will allow me to wear tank tops again it&#x27;s the best news in years. And it&#x27;s inexpensive. Buy them now!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  But I can never find it anywhere except a whole foods store, and can rarely find it.  Finally decided to go the Amazon route, and it&#x27;s a nice little add-on item so you can get free shipping on it if you are already placing an order!</li>
            <li> Fast makeup remover refreshes and brightens skin</li>
            <li> I bought these for postpartum care, but ended up having a c-section so they weren&#x27;t needed for that. I have used them on my face and on my baby for drying baby acne on face and neck. Works great and they don&#x27;t irritate. I do wish they were a little larger, but other than that they work!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived without these before! The smell is pleasant, the waffle texture of the pads themselves is great, and they do exactly what they are meant to do. These are better than some of &#x27;high-end&#x27; toning pads I&#x27;ve tried, and way more affordable. Also, there is a lot of liquid left in the jar, after the pads are gone...so you can use it with your own textured cotton pads long after the original pads are gone!</li>
            <li> Great Product, I love it</li>
            <li> Love the witch hazel pads. So convenient. I also used a pad to get old scotch tape off of a window that had been there for many years. Awesome stuff.</li>
            <li> Witch Hazel Pads recieved four stars because they are what I was looking for in an astrigent pad.They are convenient, affordable, made with natural ingredients with no harsh chemicals, and they do not have this overwhelming fruity smell like most other astrigents or facial cleansers.  The reason why I did not give this product the full five stars is because the pads would be better if they were slightly bigger.  Because of the size, sometimes I have to use more than one.  Also, I wish that this product was eligible for the free super savings, but it was not when I made the purchase.  Other than that, this is an overall good natural product.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin toned and very soft.  I prefer Thayer&#x27;s to other brands that don&#x27;t have a moisturizer or a pretty scent.</li>
            <li> I use thayers witch hazel as a face toner and decided to try the pads. My only complaint is they&#x27;re very thin and a little rough feeling. I would not recommend it for someone with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use this as a non-drying alternative to popular products like &amp;#34;boo-boo zap&amp;#34; and clearasil.  It gets rid of the pimples quickly and without causing other issues like over-drying of the skin.</li>
            <li> This item has a strong alcohol smell, not as good as bottle toners. And I don&#x27;t what I can do with it.</li>
            <li> I use Dr. Thayers witch hazel toner twice a day every day and my skin is phenomenal.  I needed an easier way to take it with me on camping trips and these are perfect! Now I can take a presoaked pad out and wipe down my face before I moisturize and its super easy.  No more messing with cotton pads and a bottle that could leak.  I will keep buying these, I love them!  Careful not to get in your eye though, it does sting a bit.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pricey and they dry out.  Not a fan. I thought they would be easier than a cotton ball and witch hazel but not really.</li>
            <li> I use these at night as a face cleanser and they work great.  There is some alcohol content but the Vitamin E and Witch Hazel natural cleanser gives you a good, natural skin cleansing.  The pads are very moist and provide some abrasion to wash away dirt and keep hairs (if you&#x27;re a man like me) from becoming ingrown too easily etc...,    Great replacement for washing your face every night - use these, slap on some lotion and go to bed with a clean, moisturized face.  I also noticed shaving irritation redness and small acne-like bumps seemed to clear up some with repeated use.</li>
            <li> Love these Witch Hazel pads.  I use them at morning and night.  Work great, high quality, and great price.  Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> So, the pads are on the small size and quite thin.  That&#x27;s a con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they are dripping in witch hazel!  Which means they will not dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with two pads I removed all the make-up on my face, leaving my skin feeling not only clean, but actually refreshed.  Unlike with other pads where you feel there is a residue, so that you have not cleaned the skin, just wiped it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so here.  All the benefits of WH are there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, there is a little alcohol, but I would not say that the skin is left dry and taut.  Feels quite supple.  You need moisturizer as with any other astringent, but that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems quite natural apart from the alcohol, so this is definitely a keeper.  I suspect that without it, it would not clean so well.</li>
            <li> They are very cool and refreshing.  I use them after a workout to get the excess oils off and start with a less soiled face to clean. The pads are thin but well saturated with the witch hazel.  I thought it was a good value and a quality product.  I also like that the witch hazel is not drying to the skin.</li>
            <li> Whenever I use these pads no matter how lightly I sweep them across my face they seem to scratch my face.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they don&#x27;t scratch my face so much that there are red marks or anything BUT it does leave my face red after I use them and I can feel them like they are pulling at the skin on my face.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these pads for a little over a month and they don&#x27;t seem to be doing anything for me.  That&#x27;s not to say they won&#x27;t work for the next person :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the product is a little on the strong side as well so if you have a sensitive sniffer you might wanna hold your breath while using these.</li>
            <li> Cannot even open jar! I tried everything, but the jar won&#x27;t open. Waste of $$.</li>
            <li> Thayers Witch Hazel Pads are great for cleaning the excess oil produced is the skin on my face. It reduces my acne by 70%.</li>
            <li> really really like these, has made any blemishes history</li>
            <li> Leaves a clean fresh feeling. Almost no odor.</li>
            <li> Strong astringent, great for post work-outs and oily face. Smells good too</li>
            <li> I love these Thayers Witch Hazel pads! They leave my skin feeling clean and soft without drying it out. I didn&#x27;t have acne before but still had a couple break outs here and there. Since I started using these (over a year) I haven&#x27;t had any blemishes. Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> FOR SOME REASON THIS PRODUCT HAS ELIMINATED BLOTCHES AND AGE MARKS ON MY FACE...PEOPLE HAVE SAID WHAT GREAT SKIN I HAVE ... FOR A MAN IT MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE BUT HEY AT MY AGE I&#x27;LL TAKE ALL THE COMPLIMENTS I CAN:)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got excellent aim, buy this..  if you&#x27;re more &#x27;life size&#x27; than a barbie doll... you might want to get a larger product.</li>
            <li> I have been using witch hazel for a while and like the bottled lavender version of this brand. But the smell of these pads was unpleasant and a little harsh (kind of like jars of acne pads) and left a sticky residue on my skin after every use, so the feeling wasn&#x27;t very clean. I probably won&#x27;t buy this again if dickinson&#x27;s witch hazel pads are available.</li>
            <li> I am hooked on these witch hazel pads!  They clean up leftover makeup after regular washing and they leave you skin feeling clean and refreshed.  Have been using them for about 4 months now and I have noticed a difference in my skin tone.  Very convenient to use also.</li>
            <li> These are great! The pad is a bit on the rough side but that helps to clean deep into my pores. I hate to TMI here but I have an issue with black heads and this is the only product that has helped to minimize my blackheads as well as tighten my pores. The witch hazel is gentle on my skin and I have not had any issues with sensitivity or with dry skin like I have in the past with the cleansers that you buy at the drug store. The container has more then enough witch hazel to keep the pads moist, there is so much in there that in have to wring the pads out before using them. At the time of writing this review I am using my third container of these wipes. Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have witch hazel toner in a bottle, but these pads are so convenient. My face feels really refreshed, tingly and bright after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel in a bottle for two years now.  I use it as a toner, after cleaning my face and before applying moisturizer.  It works wonderfully and rumor has it that I don&#x27;t look my age (37).  I switched from buying the bottled witch hazel and my own facial cotton swipes to the container of moistened pads.  I found that I went through a bottle much faster than the wipes, which made the pads more cost effective for me.  I love them and plan to continue using them.  My only wish, which isn&#x27;t worthy of taking any stars from it, is that they offered the pads in the same fragrances that the bottled version comes in.  It only comes in scent-free and I miss that wonderful rose and peach fragrance.</li>
            <li> I buy these for my teenagers who prefer to not have to have cotton balls handy.  They like it just fine.  I, myself, prefer the rose scented bottle, but I&#x27;m the biggest lover of witch hazel in ANY form, so was glad to find something my picky teens would use daily.</li>
            <li> Witch hazel is a great toner for oily skin I love it.  I been using witch hazel for years.  My face never has a reaction from it it helps with my oily t zone love it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very good for removing oil or makeup from the face.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to clean my cat&#x27;s ears- she gets a medication via gel in her ear and regular cleaning is imperative.  I tried alcohol, but it was too harsh for her.</li>
            <li> I love these witch hazel pads. I use it twice a day on my face. They are gentle, and I have noticed that my pores are looking smaller.</li>
            <li> very convenient, great for travel!  I bought it for my delivery hospital bag. Works great on hemroids.  I love that it is nature.  Kinda wasteful though.</li>
            <li> Simple and works well on the go. A must for those with acne. Not drying like other astringents on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Its benefit is that it is less harsh than other witch hazel brands, yet while pads are convenient, they can be a bit harsh. It is best to buy a bottle instead and get pure cotton swabs or splash it on your face. It has the same texture as an oxy pad, which is very inappropriate for the product.</li>
            <li> This helped to clear my skin nicely. I did notice some drying the first week of use and used a light facial lotion but my skin adjusted by week 2 of use. Smells nice and there is not an overpowering alcohol odor like many astringents have.</li>
