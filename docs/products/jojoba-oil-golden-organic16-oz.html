            <li>Huge bottle!</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing Dr. Adorable Inc products for quite some time.  </li>
            <li>Each time I order, I order with confidence that I will be pleased and should I have any questions, I&#x27;ve been assured they will be answered promptly.&lt;br /&gt;~anita</li>
            <li>I saw so many pieces of fibers...like fabric fibers.</li>
            <li>It goes even better if you use disposable nitrile or latex gloves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found nothing better</li>
            <li>Everyone who has left great comments is right-on about Jojoba Oil!</li>

            <li>Love the oil.</li>
            <li>I love what this oil has done for my hair</li>
            <li>More greasy than moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This is just what I wanted and at a fantastic price!  </li>
            <li>will be ordering more  </li>
            <li>will be ordering more  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>After buying the Dr. Adorable&#x27;s jojoba oil</li>
            <li>Perfect oil for my facial needs, my skin laps it up!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t got any complaints about the product, it just doesn&#x27;t stand out as exceptional or extraordinary in any way.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, great value, and high quality!  </li>
            <li>I am also pleased that this is packaged in an amber bottle to prevent oxidation.  </li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more from Dr. Adorable Inc.</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>So much for a great price.  </li>
            <li>and she claimed jojoba oil as her favorite product.  </li>
            <li>well, this company filled the bottle up all the way!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure).</li>
            <li>The bottle was delivered in tact/was appropriately packaged.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s most definitely top quality.</li>
            <li>This Dr. Adorable oil was just over $1 an ounce and so seemed a screaming bargain, but worried it might be diluted or inferior based on the price.</li>
            <li>So I could feel confident there were no pesticides traces</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased but would like to have a better smell</li>
            <li>This is my favorite carrier oil.</li>
            <li>, I cannot use it during the day, but it is PERFECT to use by itself as a nightly moisturizer, or with added Essential oils.</li>
            <li>Love this oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Jojoba oil however has made my face more balanced than ever.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t remember being this satisfied with them.  </li>
            <li>My favorite Jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>I have also had NOW Foods and for this reason have given this brand four stars, as their&#x27;s is a bit more refined.</li>
            <li>But this is a better value for the price.</li>
            <li>Perhaps one of those caps that you press on might work better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a product maker and we love this jojoba.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used much of it but the oil is very nice.</li>
            <li>Best oil I&#x27;ve ever worked with - easy to add essential oils for scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful astringent for your skin and scalp, great moisturizer for stretching piercings, great base for essential oils, all around perfect.</li>
            <li>wonderful rich carrier for my essential oils.</li>
            <li>This stuff is natural and works great to moisture skin.</li>
            <li>I loved the butter so much that I began using their oils as well.</li>
            <li>I bought some Arbordoun&#x27;s Calendula cream and it&#x27;s so good that I use it too much.</li>
            <li>A pump top of flip top would have been resolution for this problem, luckily this can be added on by the buyer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>particular oil is  of GREAT quality, the nice sturdy bottle came very well packaged.</li>
            <li>This rich organic oil is top quality and feels like silk on the skin.</li>
            <li>This came quickly and was full to the top - yay!  </li>
            <li>great deal on high quality jojoba oil... great for skin, soaks right in and within days, baby soft skin..... will be using this forever!</li>
            <li>I love that it is a smooth and light oil.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t have any issues with the packaging like many have complained about Perfect for what i was looking for!:)</li>
            <li>I can even put it on my face under my make-up and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>But this jojoba makes it shine, keeps it growing fine.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more, quick shipping</li>
            <li>thanks all around to Dr. Adorable, Rochleigh and Amazon!</li>
            <li>Mix with pure Aloe Vera for a nice skin treatment.</li>
            <li>I believe the price reflects the product accurately.</li>
            <li>smooth, moist skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face looking silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I have always used jojoba Oil for all kinds of skin treatment, and after using so many different products, I must say this one is truly the best so far....</li>
            <li>I buy all my oils from this company if they are available.</li>
            <li>But, it is almost a light chocolate smell</li>
            <li>I use it as my primary carrier oil in my EO blends.</li>
            <li>Will no wonder its cheap.</li>
            <li>Great, still have alot left in bottle</li>
            <li>so I guess it&#x27;s what you want it for that is important.</li>
            <li>Always good and arrives early</li>
            <li>Great to mix with other fine oils!</li>
            <li>I am not a easy person to say this is great!</li>
            <li>and I did a lot of research before buying this particular kind of oil.</li>
            <li>Large bottle and very fine quality oil.</li>
            <li>This was such an amazing purchase!</li>
            <li>Emu oil absorbs into the skin incredibly well, but I&#x27;d read that Jojoba oil is also very like our natural sebum, and so easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>I first purchased my avocado butter from this company because one of my favorite youtubers gets hers from here.  </li>
            <li>Adorable&#x27;s jojoba oil was quoted as one of the higher quality oils out there.</li>
            <li>Was excited about the price, so inexpensive, but you often get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited to keep using the oil.   </li>
            <li>This is a great carrier oil and brings it&#x27;s own unique benefits in terms of soft skin and overall improved tone.  </li>
            <li>It as a good fresh aroma, is nice and full-bodied, not like some thinner jojoba oils I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>-in-all though, definitely worth your attention!</li>
            <li>I received my order and was very happy to find there is no strong odor, reported with some brands I noticed in my search, it has a rich golden color and it applied smoothly and was absorbed easily.</li>
            <li>See my dermatologist yearly for clean bill of health.</li>
            <li>I did insert a pump so it was not so messy when using it right from the bottle which works great!</li>
            <li>This is the oil to use with your special creams.</li>
            <li>In fairness, It will take some time to see if I notice the same results as with Emu Oil, but so far I&#x27;m very happy with the product and also happy I didn&#x27;t spend 4 times as much, with no likely upside for the price difference.</li>
            <li>Jojoba has so many uses and this is a really bug size for the money.</li>
            <li>Really helps keep it moisturized and helps it to grow healthy (along with my hair regimen</li>
            <li>i make my own salt scrub with it and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and nice after beginning to use exclusively jojoba oil instead of lotions.  </li>
            <li>It is thick and wonderful!  </li>
            <li>I really hope it continues to be available and doesn&#x27;t change!</li>
            <li>Looks exactly as the image and arrived really quickly!  </li>
            <li>I have used this oil and it has transformed my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li>Lucky me.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin smooth, hydrated, and protects from the sun (really!).</li>
            <li>- Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>An interesting aside is that, I imagined the name of this company was an effort to sound cute and fuzzy, but evidently, there is actually a female doctor whose last name is Adorable.</li>
            <li>Really moisturizers and I love that it is just pure jojoba.  </li>
            <li>Really great for when my hair gets frizzy from the heavy Florida humidity.</li>
            <li>Rub them together to emulsify and light apply to your skin... as much as you need.</li>
            <li>Apply to skin, then on top lather up some Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap, bar soap, or any natural soap - and shave - awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because it is organic, it has a more natural smell to it versus some of the oils out there with additives.  </li>
            <li>and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricy but worth every dime.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>I might be putting on my skin to be absorbed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it as a key ingredient in making my own shampoos, soaps, and body butters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was right on time for me too.</li>
            <li>my esthetician recommended and she was right</li>
            <li>Also A quick tip, keep out of the sun and store in fridge if you want to last longer :)</li>
            <li>I love it, it was shipped fastly and it&#x27;s even better than was expected</li>
            <li>The price is remarkable cheaper than any other Natural food stores and websites!!!</li>
            <li>Massage, and cosmetic uses are perfect, and I use in the shower with a little bit of lavender oil mixed in as part of my shampoo.</li>
            <li>works magic repairing even the most crusty, dried lips.  </li>
            <li>Adorable Inc also fills the bottle to the BRIM, so you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth for this organic products.  </li>
            <li>I stated earlier, I&#x27;m sure this product will work well for most general purposes as jojoba oil can be used alone, or diluted.</li>
            <li>organic oil is lite and very gentle for skin.</li>
            <li>The smell of pure jojoba is very bland however, so I mixed a little yang-ylang oil into it for a nice, light aroma and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Helps to keep fine hair in place with a soft look and feel.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>It was as though I had my first sample [20 years ago] in my hand.</li>
            <li>My Texas skin started softening with the first application.</li>
            <li>i am 100% satisfied and they definitely deserve 5 stars..</li>
            <li>Initially, I received this product but wasn&#x27;t satisfied.</li>
            <li>I use it for so many different things.</li>
            <li>; that is my first impression.  </li>
            <li>This is the first jojoba oil I have used</li>
            <li>It was delivered extremely fast!</li>
            <li>Wife buys some stuff in a smaller bottle that smells much better.</li>
            <li>But the first time nothing happened.</li>
            <li>now they are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Think she&#x27;s aging pretty well and found this encouraging.  </li>
            <li>and I could not believe the price was so reasonable which was a welcomed bonus!  </li>
            <li>Also, I like the container it comes in; based on amber tint, I am able to use/reuse bottle with essential oils.</li>
            <li>I will buy more from them in the future!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products over the years.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>I have purchased my 2nd bottle and I am still pleased with the quality of this oil.</li>
            <li>This oil is a little more viscus than I&#x27;m used to, but it works just fine.</li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;ve read, Jojoba oil is the oil that is MOST similar to our own natural, secreted bodily oil.  </li>
            <li>I was extremely pleased to open it and see that it was filled to the literal top with no free space!</li>
            <li>You will probably want a pump for this first of all because it comes out fast.</li>
            <li>The price is a little high but the quality is good.  </li>
            <li>Overall, very satisfied and would recommend it, especially for the cost per ounce.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I used this in my dry hair before washing, this provide me an hydration and shine, sometimes y used in all my body before a shower or after an exfoliating</li>
            <li>It makes my skin &amp; hair super soft.</li>
            <li>I am in my 30s and have suffered from mild acne, oiliness, and sensitive skin since my teens.  </li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;ve searched high and low for pure jojoba at a reasonable cost</li>
            <li>...this product is not 100% pure jojoba oil, it&#x27;s that simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don;t think I&#x27;ve used organic or pure oil before</li>
            <li>If you are looking for pure jojoba</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard that this is good for wrinkles, but I have not used it long enough to know if it really works for that.</li>
            <li>very highly recommend that you MIX pure Jojoba Oil with 100% pure Aloe Vera Gel - to use as a moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And everything&#x27;s working fine except my hair&#x27;s still white.</li>
            <li>Will see how much shine my hair gets as I use it.</li>
            <li>I use these oils for my family&#x27;s hair and they always work very well and we have never had a problem with any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything and it all disappears much too fast.</li>
            <li>Possibly cut with canola oil or something cheap.</li>
            <li>As well as the quality, which my friend, being a Cosmetologist, is very picky about.&lt;br /&gt;Doctor</li>
            <li>very watery</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>It also comes really fast and is packaged to prevent spillage.</li>
            <li>i really like this oil for my kids</li>
            <li>it really does help.</li>
            <li>Is it really jojoba oil or something  else ?</li>
            <li>I really like this product and plan to reorder.</li>
            <li>(I have really curly, frizzy hair).</li>
            <li>Really moisturizing.</li>
            <li>it really works.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Just be careful if you decide to purchase, make sure you look into the bottle every time before using it.</li>
            <li>It goes on your face with an oily sheen but soaks in fast and the shiny- ness goes away within a hour.</li>
            <li>Remember that the skin needs minimum of 24 hrs before bathing to convert the UV into Vitamin D3, so wipe off skin with (paper) towel, OR lightly rinse off with water ONLY!</li>
            <li>I can really tell a difference.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many types of Jojoba oil before, and this one is very processed not pure.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless It seems to be of decent quality as suggested by previous reviewers who are more familiar with jojoba than I am, as I have no previous experience with which to compare to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have also tried putting it in my hair as well as my long hair tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>I then soak a clean washcloth in hot water, wring it out, and apply it to my face for as long as I can.</li>
            <li>other jojoba&#x27;s I&#x27;ve gotten before too, almost smells like chocolate (which I don&#x27;t mind at all :) ).</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, and will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll write an update in a few weeks but so far very satisfied and can recommend is as a 5 star oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to make homemade products.</li>
            <li>It make sense to put precious jojoba in a dark bottle.  </li>
            <li>Again, less is more, I put three drops on my hands, rub them together and rub my hands through my hair.  </li>
            <li>What needed at a decent price.</li>
            <li>Since Jojoba is so similar to our own oils, I can apply as often as I wish during the day, a minimal amount, and my body just absorbs it and heals/hydrates the area.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend and will use often.</li>
            <li>It is said that this oil is more close to our natural body oil than any other oil</li>
            <li>I used the conditioner twice in two days, and my hair is soft and shiny and manageable again!!</li>
            <li>My skin feels best with this oil than any other product I use, including expensive lotions/creams that I receive free and occasionally try.</li>
            <li>normally when i saw it at this price i had to get</li>
            <li>I use a glycerin facial mask as a moisturizer but thats it, and rarely do I have acne</li>
            <li>This brand of Jojoba oil has a very positive difference from the mass produced products that you find in regular stores.</li>
            <li>Hair sprays make hair stiff and cost more.</li>
            <li>It takes my makeup off really well and now with this really positive experience with the seller I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>This is a large bottle of jojoba oil and the texture and smell is comparable to the smaller bottles I&#x27;ve bought in Whole Foods and Trader Joes.  </li>
            <li>I pour the oil into a smaller bottle with a spout as using it straight from this large bottle</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m going to have to pour it into a new container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>MY SKIN IS VERY SOFT FROM USING</li>
            <li>Not sure if the smell means more natural or older?</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li>My hair drank it in and became soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with organic jojoba oil, though I&#x27;ve used regular jojoba oil before.  </li>
            <li>This golden oil is thick and rich.  </li>
            <li>No organic labeling and when I poured the oil into a new container that was clear</li>
            <li>This is only my first week of me using jojoba oil  and so far it hasn&#x27;t made me break out which</li>
            <li>It has a faint and pleasant nut(?)</li>
            <li>It rinses complete and leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>Apply everywhere (including hair), take one last mico-second rinse under the shower - and dry off lightly with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bottle is already half gone so, I will be back for more soon.</li>
            <li>and I apply it in the shower right before I get out and dry off.  </li>
            <li>I spilled when I opened this and having a turning cap for such a large bottle</li>
            <li>I have been allergic to most massage oils which is hard as a masseuse.</li>
            <li>The other problem I have with the cap is that since the opening is so big, it makes it easy for dirt or dust to fall in if the cap is off, (not to mention the disaster it would create if an opened bottle fell on its side.)</li>
            <li>Ok so if your on accutane or any other meds that make your face dry out I would recommend Jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>It is cold pressed, organic and great price.</li>
            <li>I received a damaged bottle and after I posted about the damage and the wasted oil, the seller contacted me directly and offered to send me a replacement free of charge.</li>
            <li>I had a hysterectomy at 28 years old and have no ovaries</li>
            <li>We bought this for my daughter&#x27;s natural hair.</li>
            <li>Second order - fast delivery</li>
            <li>This product has completely replaced lotion for me.</li>
            <li>so I had no expectations, but I have been pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a glow on skin that is natural looking</li>
            <li>IT DOESN&#x27;T KEEP YOU SKIN SOFT AS SUPPLE LIKE IT SHOULD.  </li>
            <li>Lots of organic or natural products being made, I would assume.</li>
            <li>Natural textured hair (4b/cish) and my hair loves this stuff.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and tangle-free.  </li>
            <li>nothing works as well as jojoba oil because it is the closest oil to our natural oil ph.</li>
            <li>AS FAR AS I CAN SEE.</li>
            <li>I have spent a lot of money on  acne product  and moisturizers with out success of finding one that doesn&#x27;t irritate my face.</li>
            <li>This product came highly recommended on several of the natural blogs I read.</li>
            <li>Skin has never felt better, and very little irritation immediately following the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the past, I have tried many different oils for this &amp;#34;oil cleansing method&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Rubbing each other the right way pays off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend overall.</li>
            <li>It works wonders on dried out, damaged skin; better results than anything at the pharmacy, which would be both synthetic and a lot more expensive.  </li>
            <li>Just be careful upon first opening it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried it on my hair, but I have yet to see much improvement to my dry ends.  </li>
            <li>It lacks that nutty smell that jojoba typically comes with--it just smells really fresh.</li>
            <li>I have used it as a staple product in my hair and in my Oil Cleansing Method ( By the way, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it, I have tossed all  expensive industrial scrubs fro my cabinet-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has no scent and isn&#x27;t super heavy.</li>
            <li>The oil is very messy, and hard to clean, and it has a twist cap to open the bottle, which makes it even more of a struggle not to get it everywhere.</li>
            <li>I am African American with hair that is not chemically treated; when wearing natural styles mist my hair with a water mixed with a little of this oil and it is fabulous.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Initially got it for my 2 year old son&#x27;s eczema, but ended up using it for myself just to use it up.</li>
            <li>i would definitely recommend this product to every natural person i know.</li>
            <li>I am left with skin that feels soft, and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>It feels so soothing and is already helping my red face go back to normal from all the damaging chemicals of store products.</li>
            <li>It does have an oily glow for the first few hours and since i have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased and worked with enough jojoba oil to be able to discern the real stuff from the fake.</li>
            <li>Smell is kind of weird</li>
            <li>I ordered three bottles but the caps were not tight enough and when they arrived, all three leaked Jojoba oil and the box it came was drenched in oil at the bottom.  </li>
            <li>, she&#x27;s Black) and looking really hot.</li>
            <li>This oil is one of my hair staples, I use it for hot oil treatments, to massage my scalp and to mix with other essential oils for skin.</li>
            <li>, it gives them a soft and moist skin even in winter weather, it reduces some skin imperfections and help to heal little cut, makes their hair grow fast and shine.</li>
            <li>This is a terrific moisturizer and is apparently one of (if not thee) closest to our natural facial oils.</li>
            <li>I put a very small drop on my forehead, cheeks, nose, and chin and gently smooth it in.  </li>
            <li>It is a thick, rich product at a righteous price.</li>
            <li>non oily feel after application, smooth, and less odor than other brands</li>
            <li>I was looking for a moisturizing oil to replace the Emu oil that I find amazing, but it&#x27;s both expensive and, of course, requires the killing of the big bird to harvest it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it to buy this and a smaller bottle for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed that pricing can vary wildly, with the more expensive ones asking almost $4 an ounce.</li>
            <li>Though it does take consistent use to improve rough or dry patches of skin.  </li>
            <li>What I do is put a bottle in the shower and just before I get out I pour a small handful in my hand and dump it right on my chest</li>
            <li>That may be how the product is supposed to be and not a flaw, so this isn&#x27;t a complaint, but be forewarned that&#x27;s how it is (which is consistent with some, but not other, reviewers&#x27; comments).</li>

            <li> It works wonderfully on the skin -- absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> and I was so happy with this product that I purchased more.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>

            <li> I remember when I was a child and my mother bought conditioner with jojoba oil, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it since - now I can use whatever conditioner I want!</li>

            <li> Arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li> would have liked to see a flip top or pump top, however.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still love, love, loving this oil.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this is the best price I&#x27;ve found, and they delivered it SUPER fast!</li>

            <li> I saw so many pieces of fibers...like fabric fibers.</li>

            <li> After buying the Dr. Adorable&#x27;s jojoba oil</li>
            <li> Perfect oil for my facial needs, my skin laps it up!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t got any complaints about the product, it just doesn&#x27;t stand out as exceptional or extraordinary in any way.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, great value, and high quality!  </li>
            <li> I am also pleased that this is packaged in an amber bottle to prevent oxidation.  </li>
            <li> Will be purchasing more from Dr. Adorable Inc.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  </li>
            <li> So much for a great price.  </li>
            <li> and she claimed jojoba oil as her favorite product.  </li>
            <li> well, this company filled the bottle up all the way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure).</li>
            <li> The bottle was delivered in tact/was appropriately packaged.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s most definitely top quality.</li>
            <li> This Dr. Adorable oil was just over $1 an ounce and so seemed a screaming bargain, but worried it might be diluted or inferior based on the price.</li>
            <li> So I could feel confident there were no pesticides traces</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased but would like to have a better smell</li>
            <li> This is my favorite carrier oil.</li>
            <li> , I cannot use it during the day, but it is PERFECT to use by itself as a nightly moisturizer, or with added Essential oils.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Jojoba oil however has made my face more balanced than ever.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t remember being this satisfied with them.  </li>
            <li> My favorite Jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> I have also had NOW Foods and for this reason have given this brand four stars, as their&#x27;s is a bit more refined.</li>
            <li> But this is a better value for the price.</li>
            <li> Perhaps one of those caps that you press on might work better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a product maker and we love this jojoba.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used much of it but the oil is very nice.</li>
            <li> Best oil I&#x27;ve ever worked with - easy to add essential oils for scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful astringent for your skin and scalp, great moisturizer for stretching piercings, great base for essential oils, all around perfect.</li>
            <li> wonderful rich carrier for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> This stuff is natural and works great to moisture skin.</li>
            <li> I loved the butter so much that I began using their oils as well.</li>
            <li> I bought some Arbordoun&#x27;s Calendula cream and it&#x27;s so good that I use it too much.</li>
            <li> A pump top of flip top would have been resolution for this problem, luckily this can be added on by the buyer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> particular oil is  of GREAT quality, the nice sturdy bottle came very well packaged.</li>
            <li> This rich organic oil is top quality and feels like silk on the skin.</li>
            <li> This came quickly and was full to the top - yay!  </li>
            <li> great deal on high quality jojoba oil... great for skin, soaks right in and within days, baby soft skin..... will be using this forever!</li>
            <li> I love that it is a smooth and light oil.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t have any issues with the packaging like many have complained about Perfect for what i was looking for!:)</li>
            <li> I can even put it on my face under my make-up and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> But this jojoba makes it shine, keeps it growing fine.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more, quick shipping</li>
            <li> thanks all around to Dr. Adorable, Rochleigh and Amazon!</li>
            <li> Mix with pure Aloe Vera for a nice skin treatment.</li>
            <li> I believe the price reflects the product accurately.</li>
            <li> smooth, moist skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face looking silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I have always used jojoba Oil for all kinds of skin treatment, and after using so many different products, I must say this one is truly the best so far....</li>
            <li> I buy all my oils from this company if they are available.</li>
            <li> But, it is almost a light chocolate smell</li>
            <li> I use it as my primary carrier oil in my EO blends.</li>
            <li> Will no wonder its cheap.</li>
            <li> Great, still have alot left in bottle</li>
            <li> so I guess it&#x27;s what you want it for that is important.</li>
            <li> Always good and arrives early</li>
            <li> Great to mix with other fine oils!</li>
            <li> I am not a easy person to say this is great!</li>
            <li> and I did a lot of research before buying this particular kind of oil.</li>
            <li> Large bottle and very fine quality oil.</li>
            <li> This was such an amazing purchase!</li>
            <li> Emu oil absorbs into the skin incredibly well, but I&#x27;d read that Jojoba oil is also very like our natural sebum, and so easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> I first purchased my avocado butter from this company because one of my favorite youtubers gets hers from here.  </li>
            <li> Adorable&#x27;s jojoba oil was quoted as one of the higher quality oils out there.</li>
            <li> Was excited about the price, so inexpensive, but you often get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited to keep using the oil.   </li>
            <li> This is a great carrier oil and brings it&#x27;s own unique benefits in terms of soft skin and overall improved tone.  </li>
            <li> It as a good fresh aroma, is nice and full-bodied, not like some thinner jojoba oils I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> -in-all though, definitely worth your attention!</li>
            <li> I received my order and was very happy to find there is no strong odor, reported with some brands I noticed in my search, it has a rich golden color and it applied smoothly and was absorbed easily.</li>
            <li> See my dermatologist yearly for clean bill of health.</li>
            <li> I did insert a pump so it was not so messy when using it right from the bottle which works great!</li>
            <li> This is the oil to use with your special creams.</li>
            <li> In fairness, It will take some time to see if I notice the same results as with Emu Oil, but so far I&#x27;m very happy with the product and also happy I didn&#x27;t spend 4 times as much, with no likely upside for the price difference.</li>
            <li> Jojoba has so many uses and this is a really bug size for the money.</li>
            <li> Really helps keep it moisturized and helps it to grow healthy (along with my hair regimen</li>
            <li> i make my own salt scrub with it and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and nice after beginning to use exclusively jojoba oil instead of lotions.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and wonderful!  </li>
            <li> I really hope it continues to be available and doesn&#x27;t change!</li>
            <li> Looks exactly as the image and arrived really quickly!  </li>
            <li> I have used this oil and it has transformed my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li> Lucky me.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin smooth, hydrated, and protects from the sun (really!).</li>
            <li> - Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> An interesting aside is that, I imagined the name of this company was an effort to sound cute and fuzzy, but evidently, there is actually a female doctor whose last name is Adorable.</li>
            <li> Really moisturizers and I love that it is just pure jojoba.  </li>
            <li> Really great for when my hair gets frizzy from the heavy Florida humidity.</li>
            <li> Rub them together to emulsify and light apply to your skin... as much as you need.</li>
            <li> Apply to skin, then on top lather up some Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap, bar soap, or any natural soap - and shave - awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because it is organic, it has a more natural smell to it versus some of the oils out there with additives.  </li>
            <li> and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricy but worth every dime.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> I might be putting on my skin to be absorbed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as a key ingredient in making my own shampoos, soaps, and body butters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was right on time for me too.</li>
            <li> my esthetician recommended and she was right</li>
            <li> Also A quick tip, keep out of the sun and store in fridge if you want to last longer :)</li>
            <li> I love it, it was shipped fastly and it&#x27;s even better than was expected</li>
            <li> The price is remarkable cheaper than any other Natural food stores and websites!!!</li>
            <li> Massage, and cosmetic uses are perfect, and I use in the shower with a little bit of lavender oil mixed in as part of my shampoo.</li>
            <li> works magic repairing even the most crusty, dried lips.  </li>
            <li> Adorable Inc also fills the bottle to the BRIM, so you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth for this organic products.  </li>
            <li> I stated earlier, I&#x27;m sure this product will work well for most general purposes as jojoba oil can be used alone, or diluted.</li>
            <li> organic oil is lite and very gentle for skin.</li>
            <li> The smell of pure jojoba is very bland however, so I mixed a little yang-ylang oil into it for a nice, light aroma and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Helps to keep fine hair in place with a soft look and feel.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> It was as though I had my first sample [20 years ago] in my hand.</li>
            <li> My Texas skin started softening with the first application.</li>
            <li> i am 100% satisfied and they definitely deserve 5 stars..</li>
            <li> Initially, I received this product but wasn&#x27;t satisfied.</li>
            <li> I use it for so many different things.</li>
            <li> ; that is my first impression.  </li>
            <li> This is the first jojoba oil I have used</li>
            <li> It was delivered extremely fast!</li>
            <li> Wife buys some stuff in a smaller bottle that smells much better.</li>
            <li> But the first time nothing happened.</li>
            <li> now they are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Think she&#x27;s aging pretty well and found this encouraging.  </li>
            <li> and I could not believe the price was so reasonable which was a welcomed bonus!  </li>
            <li> Also, I like the container it comes in; based on amber tint, I am able to use/reuse bottle with essential oils.</li>
            <li> I will buy more from them in the future!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products over the years.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> I have purchased my 2nd bottle and I am still pleased with the quality of this oil.</li>
            <li> This oil is a little more viscus than I&#x27;m used to, but it works just fine.</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve read, Jojoba oil is the oil that is MOST similar to our own natural, secreted bodily oil.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely pleased to open it and see that it was filled to the literal top with no free space!</li>
            <li> You will probably want a pump for this first of all because it comes out fast.</li>
            <li> The price is a little high but the quality is good.  </li>
            <li> Overall, very satisfied and would recommend it, especially for the cost per ounce.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I used this in my dry hair before washing, this provide me an hydration and shine, sometimes y used in all my body before a shower or after an exfoliating</li>
            <li> It makes my skin &amp; hair super soft.</li>
            <li> I am in my 30s and have suffered from mild acne, oiliness, and sensitive skin since my teens.  </li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;ve searched high and low for pure jojoba at a reasonable cost</li>
            <li> ...this product is not 100% pure jojoba oil, it&#x27;s that simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don;t think I&#x27;ve used organic or pure oil before</li>
            <li> If you are looking for pure jojoba</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that this is good for wrinkles, but I have not used it long enough to know if it really works for that.</li>
            <li> very highly recommend that you MIX pure Jojoba Oil with 100% pure Aloe Vera Gel - to use as a moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And everything&#x27;s working fine except my hair&#x27;s still white.</li>
            <li> Will see how much shine my hair gets as I use it.</li>
            <li> I use these oils for my family&#x27;s hair and they always work very well and we have never had a problem with any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and it all disappears much too fast.</li>
            <li> Possibly cut with canola oil or something cheap.</li>
            <li> As well as the quality, which my friend, being a Cosmetologist, is very picky about.&lt;br /&gt;Doctor</li>
            <li> very watery</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> It also comes really fast and is packaged to prevent spillage.</li>
            <li> i really like this oil for my kids</li>
            <li> it really does help.</li>
            <li> Is it really jojoba oil or something  else ?</li>
            <li> I really like this product and plan to reorder.</li>
            <li> (I have really curly, frizzy hair).</li>
            <li> Really moisturizing.</li>
            <li> it really works.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Just be careful if you decide to purchase, make sure you look into the bottle every time before using it.</li>
            <li> It goes on your face with an oily sheen but soaks in fast and the shiny- ness goes away within a hour.</li>
            <li> Remember that the skin needs minimum of 24 hrs before bathing to convert the UV into Vitamin D3, so wipe off skin with (paper) towel, OR lightly rinse off with water ONLY!</li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many types of Jojoba oil before, and this one is very processed not pure.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless It seems to be of decent quality as suggested by previous reviewers who are more familiar with jojoba than I am, as I have no previous experience with which to compare to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have also tried putting it in my hair as well as my long hair tangles easily.  </li>
            <li> I then soak a clean washcloth in hot water, wring it out, and apply it to my face for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> other jojoba&#x27;s I&#x27;ve gotten before too, almost smells like chocolate (which I don&#x27;t mind at all :) ).</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, and will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll write an update in a few weeks but so far very satisfied and can recommend is as a 5 star oil.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to make homemade products.</li>
            <li> It make sense to put precious jojoba in a dark bottle.  </li>
            <li> Again, less is more, I put three drops on my hands, rub them together and rub my hands through my hair.  </li>
            <li> What needed at a decent price.</li>
            <li> Since Jojoba is so similar to our own oils, I can apply as often as I wish during the day, a minimal amount, and my body just absorbs it and heals/hydrates the area.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend and will use often.</li>
            <li> It is said that this oil is more close to our natural body oil than any other oil</li>
            <li> I used the conditioner twice in two days, and my hair is soft and shiny and manageable again!!</li>
            <li> My skin feels best with this oil than any other product I use, including expensive lotions/creams that I receive free and occasionally try.</li>
            <li> normally when i saw it at this price i had to get</li>
            <li> I use a glycerin facial mask as a moisturizer but thats it, and rarely do I have acne</li>
            <li> This brand of Jojoba oil has a very positive difference from the mass produced products that you find in regular stores.</li>
            <li> Hair sprays make hair stiff and cost more.</li>
            <li> It takes my makeup off really well and now with this really positive experience with the seller I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a large bottle of jojoba oil and the texture and smell is comparable to the smaller bottles I&#x27;ve bought in Whole Foods and Trader Joes.  </li>
            <li> I pour the oil into a smaller bottle with a spout as using it straight from this large bottle</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m going to have to pour it into a new container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> MY SKIN IS VERY SOFT FROM USING</li>
            <li> Not sure if the smell means more natural or older?</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li> My hair drank it in and became soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with organic jojoba oil, though I&#x27;ve used regular jojoba oil before.  </li>
            <li> This golden oil is thick and rich.  </li>
            <li> No organic labeling and when I poured the oil into a new container that was clear</li>
            <li> This is only my first week of me using jojoba oil  and so far it hasn&#x27;t made me break out which</li>
            <li> It has a faint and pleasant nut(?)</li>
            <li> It rinses complete and leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> Apply everywhere (including hair), take one last mico-second rinse under the shower - and dry off lightly with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bottle is already half gone so, I will be back for more soon.</li>
            <li> and I apply it in the shower right before I get out and dry off.  </li>
            <li> I spilled when I opened this and having a turning cap for such a large bottle</li>
            <li> I have been allergic to most massage oils which is hard as a masseuse.</li>
            <li> The other problem I have with the cap is that since the opening is so big, it makes it easy for dirt or dust to fall in if the cap is off, (not to mention the disaster it would create if an opened bottle fell on its side.)</li>
            <li> Ok so if your on accutane or any other meds that make your face dry out I would recommend Jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> It is cold pressed, organic and great price.</li>
            <li> I received a damaged bottle and after I posted about the damage and the wasted oil, the seller contacted me directly and offered to send me a replacement free of charge.</li>
            <li> I had a hysterectomy at 28 years old and have no ovaries</li>
            <li> We bought this for my daughter&#x27;s natural hair.</li>
            <li> Second order - fast delivery</li>
            <li> This product has completely replaced lotion for me.</li>
            <li> so I had no expectations, but I have been pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a glow on skin that is natural looking</li>
            <li> IT DOESN&#x27;T KEEP YOU SKIN SOFT AS SUPPLE LIKE IT SHOULD.  </li>
            <li> Lots of organic or natural products being made, I would assume.</li>
            <li> Natural textured hair (4b/cish) and my hair loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and tangle-free.  </li>
            <li> nothing works as well as jojoba oil because it is the closest oil to our natural oil ph.</li>
            <li> AS FAR AS I CAN SEE.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money on  acne product  and moisturizers with out success of finding one that doesn&#x27;t irritate my face.</li>
            <li> This product came highly recommended on several of the natural blogs I read.</li>
            <li> Skin has never felt better, and very little irritation immediately following the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the past, I have tried many different oils for this &amp;#34;oil cleansing method&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Rubbing each other the right way pays off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend overall.</li>
            <li> It works wonders on dried out, damaged skin; better results than anything at the pharmacy, which would be both synthetic and a lot more expensive.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful upon first opening it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried it on my hair, but I have yet to see much improvement to my dry ends.  </li>
            <li> It lacks that nutty smell that jojoba typically comes with--it just smells really fresh.</li>
            <li> I have used it as a staple product in my hair and in my Oil Cleansing Method ( By the way, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it, I have tossed all  expensive industrial scrubs fro my cabinet-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has no scent and isn&#x27;t super heavy.</li>
            <li> The oil is very messy, and hard to clean, and it has a twist cap to open the bottle, which makes it even more of a struggle not to get it everywhere.</li>
            <li> I am African American with hair that is not chemically treated; when wearing natural styles mist my hair with a water mixed with a little of this oil and it is fabulous.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Initially got it for my 2 year old son&#x27;s eczema, but ended up using it for myself just to use it up.</li>
            <li> i would definitely recommend this product to every natural person i know.</li>
            <li> I am left with skin that feels soft, and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> It feels so soothing and is already helping my red face go back to normal from all the damaging chemicals of store products.</li>
            <li> It does have an oily glow for the first few hours and since i have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased and worked with enough jojoba oil to be able to discern the real stuff from the fake.</li>
            <li> Smell is kind of weird</li>
            <li> I ordered three bottles but the caps were not tight enough and when they arrived, all three leaked Jojoba oil and the box it came was drenched in oil at the bottom.  </li>
            <li> , she&#x27;s Black) and looking really hot.</li>
            <li> This oil is one of my hair staples, I use it for hot oil treatments, to massage my scalp and to mix with other essential oils for skin.</li>
            <li> , it gives them a soft and moist skin even in winter weather, it reduces some skin imperfections and help to heal little cut, makes their hair grow fast and shine.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific moisturizer and is apparently one of (if not thee) closest to our natural facial oils.</li>
            <li> I put a very small drop on my forehead, cheeks, nose, and chin and gently smooth it in.  </li>
            <li> It is a thick, rich product at a righteous price.</li>
            <li> non oily feel after application, smooth, and less odor than other brands</li>
            <li> I was looking for a moisturizing oil to replace the Emu oil that I find amazing, but it&#x27;s both expensive and, of course, requires the killing of the big bird to harvest it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it to buy this and a smaller bottle for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed that pricing can vary wildly, with the more expensive ones asking almost $4 an ounce.</li>
            <li> Though it does take consistent use to improve rough or dry patches of skin.  </li>
            <li> What I do is put a bottle in the shower and just before I get out I pour a small handful in my hand and dump it right on my chest</li>
            <li> That may be how the product is supposed to be and not a flaw, so this isn&#x27;t a complaint, but be forewarned that&#x27;s how it is (which is consistent with some, but not other, reviewers&#x27; comments).</li>
            <li> First discovered at least a thousand years ago, it provides an un-matched ability to blend into human skin, as it contains several of the same amino acids.</li>
            <li> Large size last a long time, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> (She tells me she uses LOTUS OF THE NILE HANDMADE FACE CREME by an artist named Rochleigh who serves only a few celebrity friends in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Las Vegas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> shipping was fast as usual.</li>
            <li> Because you&#x27;ll need to use it sparingly, the bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Admittedly I don&#x27;t use it every day, which is probably a factor, but it will go a long ways if you plan to use it for occasional use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also I like the size, and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil will never go rancid, but after 6 months this stuff grew some sort of strange white scaly looking fungus that over took the oil.</li>
            <li> The product is comparable to any other major jojoba oil brands.</li>
            <li> Still skeptical, I read on Rodale News, a name familiar to health conscious consumers, that QAI is regulated by the USDA and so isn&#x27;t some smoke and mirrors unknown agency.</li>
            <li> but it is the only oil I have found for my severely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently been suffering from a dry scalp and touches of what must be excezma (sp?).  </li>
            <li> Cold pressed it very important.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other oils from local sources, but this one seems to be clearer and last longer.</li>
            <li> Life-long misdiagnosed Celiac Disease substantially impaired my ability to absorb fats, oils, and nutrients for inner and outer hydration...amongst other critical functions.</li>
            <li> The product itself isn&#x27;t a bad product, and should work well as a cheaper alternative to pure, uncut, unfiltered jojoba oil, but it has been either diluted, or refined, which greatly changes the consistency of the oil and the effectiveness of jojoba.</li>
            <li> Its pricey, but it does go a long way.</li>
            <li> But this also lasts a long time, is not greasy, does not get on my clothes, or bother me in the slightest.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s number one because it lasts long</li>
            <li> So I am an 18 year old guy with a red dry face and Small pimples.</li>
            <li> Mixed well with other ingredients for my use.  </li>
            <li> downside with ANY oil is that if slathered on and then you put on a long sleeve shirt/blouse, it WILL stain garment like any oil would!  </li>
            <li> The seal was broken and the envelope was full of oil, I don&#x27;t really trust the inside seens the seal was broken.</li>
            <li> My hair has been twenty years dry, but feels and behaves like it did so long ago!</li>
            <li> , it has lasted me a very very long time.</li>
            <li> Since I do have dry skin</li>
            <li> My forearms looked dry but no longer.</li>
            <li> Use it on dry skin as well as all over when getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry feet and legs</li>
            <li> I have eczema, icthyosis, and chronically dry skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind it since I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I personally have used this specific product for a few years now.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of my staple products for my thick, medium-length 4a-4b natural hair.</li>
            <li> It also has the ability to instantly break down plant resins and should be used by &amp;#34;trimmers&amp;#34; for hand and tool cleaning with no residue, and the non-toxic nature of Jojoba.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so it will last me a while.</li>
            <li> It has a very nutty, and not necessarily pleasant, smell.  </li>
            <li> but there was a tad of spilling in the box &amp; if anyone else picks up the bottle w/o me warning them, there&#x27;s potential for a mess,</li>
            <li> The second time I bought it there was a little spillage.</li>
            <li> The last jojoba I had was a foood grade oil and had little to no scent at all.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint to the company would be to not over fill the bottle and to put a safety seal and different type of cap.</li>
            <li> The oil was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Non-irritating, smooths on without a hitch, and if you apply it while you&#x27;re still wet from the shower, you seal in moisture.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t doing well on a rough patch on my elbow, however.</li>
            <li> Not as moisturizing as I expected.</li>
            <li> I use this for shaving my face daily, just a few drops.</li>
            <li> My skin on the bottom of my feet used to be rough</li>
            <li> Its not really improving my skin.</li>
            <li> I think its not a real Jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> Was everything i expected.</li>
            <li> I keep coming back to this Jojoba oil because it just plain WORKS for me, with substantial savings over buying in stores!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dessert Essences is not a PURE JOJOBA oil.</li>
            <li> If my face still feels oily after a few minutes I blot away the rest, but this only happens if I apply too much as a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> with the soap it makes, it cleans and lathers well with just a little soap, so the bar lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I had a few red marks from previous pimples and they have faded.  </li>
            <li> It has a faint funny smell, so I prefer not to use it on my face.  </li>
            <li> I use this jojoba oil for my face and other hair mixtures.</li>
            <li> I cannot shower every day, so every other day I do this and in between I can use my other bottle to do my hands, arms, legs and feet.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed this didn&#x27;t have a flip top cap.</li>
            <li> I have a shop where I usually get my supplies locally</li>
            <li> I use this ,with some other oils, for my hair  regiment</li>
            <li> I also look forward to trying other oils.</li>
            <li> I have extremely acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of Jojoba oil before</li>
            <li> It is processed and cut with other oils to give it the \\&quot;slip\\&quot; you feel.</li>
            <li> (Jojoba oil, pure, uncut, and unrefined, should solidify around 44°F.</li>
            <li> and it is pure and uncut.</li>
            <li> Packaging  it in a dark bottle, protects the integrity of the oil.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> is a bit inconvenient because it makes it easy to spill and hard to hold.</li>
            <li> , it is so thick that it doesn&#x27;t run off of me and from there I spread it all over continually taking it from my upper chest area, that little handful...</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about the oil is the odor, it is a little odd.  </li>
            <li> I keep it in the shower and while skin is still slightly damp, moisturize head to toe.</li>
            <li> Has kinda a bland smell but after 2 months I was used to the smell.</li>
            <li> the scent of this oil is just a bit odd still viable for use in skin oil and hair oil</li>
            <li> but there is a slight smell to it.</li>
            <li> I feared and I do see a slight improvement in my acne already.</li>
            <li> M&#x27;spouse&#x27;s hair is black</li>
            <li> but it does have a slight odor.</li>
            <li> Trick is to put small to moderate amount of oil on skin at least 1-2 hrs before donning shirt, and it lessens/stops oil staining.</li>
            <li> Or I would put a little peppermint oil into the oil to give it a scent.</li>
            <li> I even put a little in the water I soak my feet in.</li>
            <li> I put three drops in a 2 oz bottle of conditioner (didn&#x27;t want to waste my conditioner if it didn&#x27;t work).</li>
            <li> Bonus points for the opportunity to say jojoba in my everyday life.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops on my face after a shower.</li>
            <li> I use it to wash my face everyday as a replacement for soap or cleanser.</li>
            <li> Raw, I use it on my dried out elbows and knees, and adds to the resiliency of my cuticles.  </li>
            <li> My face has been pealing like crazy and once I started using Jojoba the pealing has almost completely stopped.</li>
            <li> Not sure I want to smell like that after using this, although it does seem to dissipate a bit with time on my body.</li>
            <li> Its not like any jojoba oil I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I received this product, but the bottle  doesn&#x27;t  have any seal &amp; I&#x27;m not sure  what is inside ?</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m giving this one star due to what I feel is false advertising and misrepresentation of their product.</li>
            <li> Just wish is was a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> complaint is the oder.</li>
            <li> I visited their web site and learned that this Jojoba is 100% cold pressed, undiluted, organic (Organic, overseen by QAI, Quality Assurance International)</li>
            <li> I hate reading reviews that don&#x27;t explain the product very well</li>
            <li> I was surprised and disappointed when i opened up the  envelope.</li>
            <li> I am a little skeptical on whether this is /actually/ certified organic.</li>
            <li> There were nasty little flakes floating around in the oil, and because the bottle is a dark color I didn&#x27;t realize it for a while which meant that I was applying this stuff to my face for who knows how long.</li>
            <li> Her hair is locs down to the base of her spine and shines.</li>
            <li> this oil is so expensive</li>
            <li> Crazy expensive</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t a bad smell.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this oil!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This oil is wonder for the hair and face and skin. Large size last a long time, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I LIKE THAT IT IS ORGANIC. THIS IS A PRODUCT I NEED FOR SOME OF MY HOME RECIPES. IWILL BE USING THIS A LOT.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used much of it but the oil is very nice. Will see how much shine my hair gets as I use it. Shipping was right on time for me too.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair. Helps to keep fine hair in place with a soft look and feel. Hair sprays make hair stiff and cost more.</li>
            <li> Very good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I was surprised and disappointed when i opened up the  envelope. The seal was broken and the envelope was full of oil, I don&#x27;t really trust the inside seens the seal was broken.</li>
            <li> Works well.  This oil is thicker than the popular brand, but still absorbs well and is a good moisturizer.  It has a faint funny smell, so I prefer not to use it on my face.  Not sure if the smell means more natural or older? Results are efficable...smooth, moist skin. Also, getting a package from \\&quot;Dr. Adorable\\&quot; makes the neighbors wonder...</li>
            <li> wonderful rich carrier for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> My product arrived within 4 days! I thought that was exceptional considering it&#x27;s the holiday. I have use the oil several times since it arrived last week. I really like it! Well done!!</li>
            <li> I love it!  This golden oil is thick and rich.  It has a faint and pleasant nut(?) aroma that I find relaxing.  Because you&#x27;ll need to use it sparingly, the bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing Dr. Adorable Inc products for quite some time.  The Jojoba oil is of an exceptional quality.  Each time I order, I order with confidence that I will be pleased and should I have any questions, I&#x27;ve been assured they will be answered promptly.&lt;br /&gt;~anita</li>
            <li> No organic labeling and when I poured the oil into a new container that was clear I saw so many pieces of fibers...like fabric fibers. Almost looked like lint ....so I discarded.</li>
            <li> Great product for skin. Leaves my face looking silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful oil. Packaging  it in a dark bottle, protects the integrity of the oil.&lt;br /&gt;It is my JOJOBA OF CHOICE.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more, quick shipping</li>
            <li> This jojoba oil arrived on time and exceeded every expectation! It is a thick, rich product at a righteous price. I am very happy with this purchase and will continue to order more as needed.</li>
            <li> I use this in my homemade soaps, and it&#x27;s good stuff.  It works wonders on dried out, damaged skin; better results than anything at the pharmacy, which would be both synthetic and a lot more expensive.  Raw, I use it on my dried out elbows and knees, and adds to the resiliency of my cuticles.  In soap, I like it&#x27;s anti-fungal properties, as well as its added moisturizing.  This is good stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that this is good for wrinkles, but I have not used it long enough to know if it really works for that.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle! It&#x27;ll last me a long time. I use it for everything!! Carrier oil, hair serum, and in my skin care regime. Really great for when my hair gets frizzy from the heavy Florida humidity.</li>
            <li> great deal on high quality jojoba oil... great for skin, soaks right in and within days, baby soft skin..... will be using this forever!</li>
            <li> Love this oil!  I mix it with my lotion!&lt;br /&gt;It was packaged great and I was so happy with this product that I purchased more.</li>
            <li> This Jojoba oil works great and it is at a good price.  I use this oil to make oil treatments and body butters.</li>
            <li> I have always used jojoba Oil for all kinds of skin treatment, and after using so many different products, I must say this one is truly the best so far....non oily feel after application, smooth, and less odor than other brands</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Adorable oils!! I buy all my oils from this company if they are available. I first purchased my avocado butter from this company because one of my favorite youtubers gets hers from here.  I loved the butter so much that I began using their oils as well. I currently have about 5 or 6 of their oils.  I use these oils for my family&#x27;s hair and they always work very well and we have never had a problem with any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product arrived on time and it was packaged well enough to maintain its integrity throughout the shipment process.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product &amp; good quality.</li>
            <li> I use this jojoba oil for my face and other hair mixtures. I love that it is a smooth and light oil.</li>
            <li> The oil was everything I expected. It was as though I had my first sample [20 years ago] in my hand. My Texas skin started softening with the first application. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Its pricey, but it does go a long way. I bought two bottles to the tune of forty bucks! Crazy expensive but it is the only oil I have found for my severely dry skin. I had a hysterectomy at 28 years old and have no ovaries so I don&#x27;t produce the body oils I should, I have to replace them myself. I&#x27;ve tried everything and it all disappears much too fast. But this also lasts a long time, is not greasy, does not get on my clothes, or bother me in the slightest. I can even put it on my face under my make-up and it works just fine. What I do is put a bottle in the shower and just before I get out I pour a small handful in my hand and dump it right on my chest, it is so thick that it doesn&#x27;t run off of me and from there I spread it all over continually taking it from my upper chest area, that little handful...perhaps two capfuls is enough to cover my entire body, neck and face. It goes even better if you use disposable nitrile or latex gloves. Since I do have dry skin I cannot shower every day, so every other day I do this and in between I can use my other bottle to do my hands, arms, legs and feet. I&#x27;ve found nothing better and I did a lot of research before buying this particular kind of oil.</li>
            <li> Everyone who has left great comments is right-on about Jojoba Oil! But, we here at The Acne Project .com very highly recommend that you MIX pure Jojoba Oil with 100% pure Aloe Vera Gel - to use as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start with equal parts - a 50/50 mix. Just squirt a pump or two of each in your palm. Rub them together to emulsify and light apply to your skin... as much as you need. Allow to absorb and dab off any excess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Vary the proportions of Jojoba Oil and Aloe Vera as you wish for whatever your skin needs at the time.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advanced: use the equal parts mixed in your palm in the shower to pre-moisturize your skin at the end of your shower. Apply everywhere (including hair), take one last mico-second rinse under the shower - and dry off lightly with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super-advanced: Use this 50/50 mix as shaving cream. Apply to skin, then on top lather up some Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap, bar soap, or any natural soap - and shave - awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(We recommend Aloe Farms Aloe Vera Gel by the way)</li>
            <li> well what more can i say.. Dr Adorable is my one stop shop for oils. i just keep coming back as the quality is excellent. shipping was fast as usual. oil is top grade and i have lost count as to how many times i have been ordering. i am 100% satisfied and they definitely deserve 5 stars.. i recommend all my clients to this seller.. i am gonna .order the aloe vera oil soon and see if i like it</li>
            <li> This brand of Jojoba oil has a very positive difference from the mass produced products that you find in regular stores.</li>
            <li> This oil is one of my hair staples, I use it for hot oil treatments, to massage my scalp and to mix with other essential oils for skin. Really nice product and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it morning and night and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in the bottle. I use it to remove my makeup and as a moisturizer and I absolutely love how it makes my skin feel. You will not be disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Non-irritating, smooths on without a hitch, and if you apply it while you&#x27;re still wet from the shower, you seal in moisture. My forearms looked dry but no longer. It isn&#x27;t doing well on a rough patch on my elbow, however.</li>
            <li> Initially, I received this product but wasn&#x27;t satisfied. All of the oil had leaked out into the plastic bag. I contacted  the seller requesting a refund. The seller immediately responded and re-sent the oil. I will continue ordering all my oils from this seller!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Best ever for old skin. Brings the youthful look back to your skin. Everyone over the age of 50 should be using this as body oil..I love it.</li>
            <li> Jojoba has so many uses and this is a really bug size for the money.</li>
            <li> We bought this for my daughter&#x27;s natural hair. It is a great value and her hair and scalp love it. The item arrived ahead of schedule. I also love that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent organic jojoba oil.  I will definitely be buying it again.  Because it is organic, it has a more natural smell to it versus some of the oils out there with additives.  But, it is almost a light chocolate smell and it isn&#x27;t a bad smell.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many types of Jojoba oil before, and this one is very processed not pure. Possibly cut with canola oil or something cheap.</li>
            <li> I used a several times for my face and hair. I liked this product it makes my skin feel smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I bought this last year, I wanting to find the cheapest jojoba oil that was still pure/ organic on amazon, which I believe this must be. I am a little skeptical on whether this is /actually/ certified organic. Nonetheless It seems to be of decent quality as suggested by previous reviewers who are more familiar with jojoba than I am, as I have no previous experience with which to compare to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the bottle is only for personal use and I&#x27;m not using it to make soap or anything, it has lasted me a very very long time. I&#x27;ve had it for months and it will probably last me all year if not longer. Admittedly I don&#x27;t use it every day, which is probably a factor, but it will go a long ways if you plan to use it for occasional use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have liked to see a flip top or pump top, however. The oil is very messy, and hard to clean, and it has a twist cap to open the bottle, which makes it even more of a struggle not to get it everywhere. The other problem I have with the cap is that since the opening is so big, it makes it easy for dirt or dust to fall in if the cap is off, (not to mention the disaster it would create if an opened bottle fell on its side.) A pump top of flip top would have been resolution for this problem, luckily this can be added on by the buyer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the amount and quality I believe the price reflects the product accurately. Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> Love the oil. Smooth, works great on rashes, sunburns, etc.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this again. The product is comparable to any other major jojoba oil brands. No problem in recommending it.</li>
            <li> I put three drops in a 2 oz bottle of conditioner (didn&#x27;t want to waste my conditioner if it didn&#x27;t work). I used the conditioner twice in two days, and my hair is soft and shiny and manageable again!! My hair has been twenty years dry, but feels and behaves like it did so long ago! I remember when I was a child and my mother bought conditioner with jojoba oil, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it since - now I can use whatever conditioner I want! I love what this oil has done for my hair - Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> Not as moisturizing as I expected. More greasy than moisturizing. Initially got it for my 2 year old son&#x27;s eczema, but ended up using it for myself just to use it up. Didn&#x27;t work for his eczema.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I use it for so many different things. It&#x27;s a wonderful astringent for your skin and scalp, great moisturizer for stretching piercings, great base for essential oils, all around perfect. And it&#x27;s a very fair price for the quality and quantity. Also, I would recommend putting the excess in an airtight container if you don&#x27;t plan on using it all in a fairly short period of time (6 months-1 year), it can get milky.</li>
            <li> Ok so if your on accutane or any other meds that make your face dry out I would recommend Jojoba oil. This stuff is natural and works great to moisture skin. My face has been pealing like crazy and once I started using Jojoba the pealing has almost completely stopped. Also It works great on lips. This combined with Dan&#x27;s Cortibalm works magic repairing even the most crusty, dried lips.  Well, Yes I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This came quickly and was full to the top - yay!  The only reason I review it at 3 stars is I personally don&#x27;t like the smell.  It has a very nutty, and not necessarily pleasant, smell.  Not sure I want to smell like that after using this, although it does seem to dissipate a bit with time on my body. That may be how the product is supposed to be and not a flaw, so this isn&#x27;t a complaint, but be forewarned that&#x27;s how it is (which is consistent with some, but not other, reviewers&#x27; comments).</li>
            <li> very good product- she loves it! Second order - fast delivery</li>
            <li> This product has completely replaced lotion for me. (Both face an body) 2nd time buying it and will continue. I keep it in the shower and while skin is still slightly damp, moisturize head to toe. When applied to face, it is wonderful under makeup as well (smooth application.) LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Looks exactly as the image and arrived really quickly!  I have yet to try the product, but I have faith it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed this didn&#x27;t have a flip top cap.; that is my first impression.  Will start using it today.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly and in good condition.  No complaints with packaging or the bottle.  This is the first jojoba oil I have used so I had no expectations, but I have been pleasantly surprised.  It works wonderfully on the skin -- absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy residue.  Though it does take consistent use to improve rough or dry patches of skin.  I can even use it on my face with no breaking out, unlike almost every commercial moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve also tried it on my hair, but I have yet to see much improvement to my dry ends.  Overall, very satisfied and would recommend it, especially for the cost per ounce.</li>
            <li> Great quality oil. This size was split between 2 people, and we are both extremely happy with both the price and the quantity. As well as the quality, which my friend, being a Cosmetologist, is very picky about.&lt;br /&gt;Doctor Adorable delivered a great product.</li>
            <li> This is just what I wanted and at a fantastic price!  will be ordering more  will be ordering more  will be ordering more</li>
            <li> Great service , just wish there where no shipping cost. I have a shop where I usually get my supplies locally but they run out of things and she has to wait on her suppliers. I guess she has to pay shipping and includes it in the cost of her products. So what I&#x27;m I trying to say ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a good price. I use it as my primary carrier oil in my EO blends. Bottle is already half gone so, I will be back for more soon. Thank you!</li>
            <li> ...this product is not 100% pure jojoba oil, it&#x27;s that simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased and worked with enough jojoba oil to be able to discern the real stuff from the fake. The product itself isn&#x27;t a bad product, and should work well as a cheaper alternative to pure, uncut, unfiltered jojoba oil, but it has been either diluted, or refined, which greatly changes the consistency of the oil and the effectiveness of jojoba. (Jojoba oil, pure, uncut, and unrefined, should solidify around 44°F. This product does not.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I stated earlier, I&#x27;m sure this product will work well for most general purposes as jojoba oil can be used alone, or diluted. However, I&#x27;m giving this one star due to what I feel is false advertising and misrepresentation of their product.</li>
            <li> Good quality: no funky smell and absorbs well. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m really enjoying this product and what a great value. i would definitely recommend this product to every natural person i know.</li>
            <li> Works great for mixing with my face lotion!</li>
            <li> Can,t believe the great price I,m very happy with itSeems like a great oil can,t wait to use it in my shampoo.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use put in trash can</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing! I use it for pimple serums or face lotion recipes and it works wonders. I see a difference in just a couple of days</li>
            <li> MY SKIN IS VERY SOFT FROM USING</li>
            <li> my sink look so much better after just 2 week of this .</li>
            <li> I am so very pleased with purchasing this Jojoba! It was delivered extremely fast! Large bottle and very fine quality oil. Great to mix with other fine oils!</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t have any issues with the packaging like many have complained about Perfect for what i was looking for!:)</li>
            <li> I love it, it was shipped fastly and it&#x27;s even better than was expected</li>
            <li> very watery and i wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Works great. I&#x27;m sure I will be ordering more soon. Thank you so much. Highly recommend and will use often.</li>
            <li> I use this for shaving my face daily, just a few drops. Skin has never felt better, and very little irritation immediately following the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is the oder. Wife buys some stuff in a smaller bottle that smells much better.</li>
            <li> Great product works great for my eczema. Has kinda a bland smell but after 2 months I was used to the smell. Or I would put a little peppermint oil into the oil to give it a scent. It also comes really fast and is packaged to prevent spillage. The second time I bought it there was a little spillage. But the first time nothing happened.</li>
            <li> my kids skin and hair just drink and like this oil, it gives them a soft and moist skin even in winter weather, it reduces some skin imperfections and help to heal little cut, makes their hair grow fast and shine. i really like this oil for my kids and i recommend it</li>
            <li> used this in a soap recipe,  it makes an excellent soap .  with the soap it makes, it cleans and lathers well with just a little soap, so the bar lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I am not a easy person to say this is great! I have used this oil and it has transformed my skin tremendously. This is the oil to use with your special creams. I bought some Arbordoun&#x27;s Calendula cream and it&#x27;s so good that I use it too much. After buying the Dr. Adorable&#x27;s jojoba oil I blend the two together and can stretch my calendula cream farther. This jojoba oil is so great I am thrilled at what it does. My skin on the bottom of my feet used to be rough now they are soft and smooth. I have tried so many oils and creams and this is the best I&#x27;ve found. If it works on my feet it will work on anyone. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this oil!!! It&#x27;s number one because it lasts long and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> This product came highly recommended on several of the natural blogs I read. I wanted to start &amp;#34;oil cleansing&amp;#34; my face to help control acne and even out my skin tone. Dr.Adorable&#x27;s jojoba oil was quoted as one of the higher quality oils out there. I rub about a teaspoon of oil in my hands and apply it in circular motions on my face. I then soak a clean washcloth in hot water, wring it out, and apply it to my face for as long as I can. After doing this to all parts of my face, I wipe the oil off.  It rinses complete and leaves my skin feeling very soft. I have oily skin, and it&#x27;s counterintuitive to use oil to fight oily skin, but do your homework-- it really does help.</li>
            <li> Its not really improving my skin. I think its not a real Jojoba oil. Will no wonder its cheap.</li>
            <li> Perfect oil for my facial needs, my skin laps it up!</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular, it&#x27;s ok.  I haven&#x27;t got any complaints about the product, it just doesn&#x27;t stand out as exceptional or extraordinary in any way.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I used this in my dry hair before washing, this provide me an hydration and shine, sometimes y used in all my body before a shower or after an exfoliating</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for a carrier oil for essential oils. It does not have a smell to it and it isn&#x27;t as oily as coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works great in making my soaps and creams.</li>
            <li> I ordered three bottles but the caps were not tight enough and when they arrived, all three leaked Jojoba oil and the box it came was drenched in oil at the bottom.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product a good price.</li>
            <li> Great, still have alot left in bottle</li>
            <li> this product is very nice as a moisturizer for your face. It is said that this oil is more close to our natural body oil than any other oil</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, great value, and high quality!  Cold pressed it very important.  I am also pleased that this is packaged in an amber bottle to prevent oxidation.  I use this daily for oil cleansing my face and as a moisturizer.  Will be purchasing more from Dr. Adorable Inc.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific moisturizer and is apparently one of (if not thee) closest to our natural facial oils. Why go with the chemicals?</li>
            <li> Was excited about the price, so inexpensive, but you often get what you pay for. Its not like any jojoba oil I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. Does have nice looking bottle.</li>
            <li> great product great price</li>
            <li> this oil is a great moisturizer for the face and body. Leaves a glow on skin that is natural looking</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this oil and with this seller. I received a damaged bottle and after I posted about the damage and the wasted oil, the seller contacted me directly and offered to send me a replacement free of charge. This has made my experience really great and I&#x27;m excited to keep using the oil.   I&#x27;m using it to make homemade makeup remover and face moisturizer and so far I love it. It takes my makeup off really well and now with this really positive experience with the seller I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Always good and arrives early</li>
            <li> I love the product.  So much for a great price.  It makes my skin &amp; hair super soft. I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> IT DOESN&#x27;T KEEP YOU SKIN SOFT AS SUPPLE LIKE IT SHOULD.  IT&#x27;S NOT EVEN WORKING WELL IN MY HAIR.  I WON&#x27;T BUY THIS AGAIN.</li>
            <li> This is a large bottle of jojoba oil and the texture and smell is comparable to the smaller bottles I&#x27;ve bought in Whole Foods and Trader Joes.  I like that this is organic and I apply it in the shower right before I get out and dry off.  I&#x27;ve used it on my face and have never had any issues with breakouts or clogged pores (and I do not have perfect skin that never breaks out, so this is good).  I&#x27;ve been using this product for years (since my 20s and in my 30s now), but recently read an article interviewing Marissa Tomei and she claimed jojoba oil as her favorite product.  Think she&#x27;s aging pretty well and found this encouraging.  I pour the oil into a smaller bottle with a spout as using it straight from this large bottle is a hassle.  It&#x27;s worth it to buy this and a smaller bottle for everyday use.  Would highly recommend overall.</li>
            <li> good quality and quantity for the price.  Use it on dry skin as well as all over when getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I have just started using Jojoba oil since Christmas and I love it! It makes your skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li> What needed at a decent price.</li>
            <li> I use Jojoba oil daily and I could not believe the price was so reasonable which was a welcomed bonus!  I did insert a pump so it was not so messy when using it right from the bottle which works great!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a vat of jojoba oil for use this is it.  The only complaint I have about the oil is the odor, it is a little odd.  The last jojoba I had was a foood grade oil and had little to no scent at all.  the scent of this oil is just a bit odd still viable for use in skin oil and hair oil but there is a slight smell to it.</li>
            <li> Great for skin and hair to help keep them moisturized and in great looking condition. Just wish is was a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> Great product!! I use this ,with some other oils, for my hair  regiment I mix together.  I am very pleased with it!</li>
            <li> Very good quality for the price!  Package arrived timely and was well sealed; no leakage.  Also, I like the container it comes in; based on amber tint, I am able to use/reuse bottle with essential oils. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> There was a boom and a hike in price with Jojoba oil a couple of years ago. Lots of organic or natural products being made, I would assume. Anyway, this is the best price I&#x27;ve found, and they delivered it SUPER fast! I will buy more from them in the future!</li>
            <li> I use this oil all the time.  It is great for skin, reduces scars and wrinkles, reduces acne and I use it under my arms instead of deodorant.  A doctor suggested we use this and we were happy we followed his advice!</li>
            <li> Jojoba is one of my BELOVED oils for hair. I have used it as a staple product in my hair and in my Oil Cleansing Method ( By the way, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it, I have tossed all  expensive industrial scrubs fro my cabinet-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS particular oil is  of GREAT quality, the nice sturdy bottle came very well packaged. I will continue to indulge in gorgeous oils from this company for their price, service and excellent quality of product.</li>
            <li> This was such an amazing purchase! My hair drank it in and became soft and shiny! It has no smell. The best part is, it was delivered in my mailbox and did not leak! I was extremely pleased to open it and see that it was filled to the literal top with no free space! WOW! I have always said that products should either be in smaller packages or companies should fill them up....well, this company filled the bottle up all the way! Thank you Dr. Adorable!! You just made a customer for life! I am so glad I discovered this oil! YAY!</li>
            <li> I received this product, but the bottle  doesn&#x27;t  have any seal &amp; I&#x27;m not sure  what is inside ? Is it really jojoba oil or something  else ?</li>
            <li> Natural textured hair (4b/cish) and my hair loves this stuff. Really helps keep it moisturized and helps it to grow healthy (along with my hair regimen I&#x27;m sure). Def recommend. Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> This is good quality oil. You will not be disappointed with this purchase. Very good product for a good price</li>
            <li> I use it in everything I make!! I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to make homemade products. Awesome!!</li>
            <li> This was the best-priced jojoba for the amount that I could find. It&#x27;s a great bulk value buy for those that are looking for a lot of jojoba. The bottle was delivered in tact/was appropriately packaged.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and plan to reorder. I also look forward to trying other oils. I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Different than Argan oil though so I guess it&#x27;s what you want it for that is important.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this jojoba oil. i make my own salt scrub with it and my skin is so soft. Would buy it again in a heart beat. Was everything i expected.</li>
            <li> Great for the skin. I use it daily.</li>
            <li> really good stuff excellent quality</li>
            <li> this oil is so expensive normally when i saw it at this price i had to get but i thought the quality would not be that good but it was great quality i use it in all my hair mixes.</li>
            <li> We use it to dilute essentials oils.  This is a great carrier oil and brings it&#x27;s own unique benefits in terms of soft skin and overall improved tone.  The price is a little high but the quality is good.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> It make sense to put precious jojoba in a dark bottle.  It as a good fresh aroma, is nice and full-bodied, not like some thinner jojoba oils I&#x27;ve tried.  Also I like the size, and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This oil is a little more viscus than I&#x27;m used to, but it works just fine. I use it as a body oil and for my hair (I have really curly, frizzy hair). The smell is different than other jojoba&#x27;s I&#x27;ve gotten before too, almost smells like chocolate (which I don&#x27;t mind at all :) ). I don;t think I&#x27;ve used organic or pure oil before so I suppose that could account for the difference in texture/smell.</li>
            <li> Really moisturizing. Great for my hair and skin as I used it for my hair creme and my body butter.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I received it early and in very good order well packed bottle was sealed no leaks like others stated. Mixed well with other ingredients for my use.  Dave from Rhode Island</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry feet and legs and this stuff works. I even put a little in the water I soak my feet in.</li>
            <li> I have never used any brand of Jojoba Oil before so I have nothing to compare it with.  However, this product is amazing.  I am in my 30s and have suffered from mild acne, oiliness, and sensitive skin since my teens.  I have tried many different products over the years.  After a bit of research I decided to try Jojoba Oil in hopes that it would improve my skin.  I have been using it for a week, and it has improved already.  I use it as a moisturizer after cleansing and toning both morning and evening.  Although it seems counterintuitive to put oil on oily skin (I know this is not a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; oil, but it feels like it) it really works.  I put a very small drop on my forehead, cheeks, nose, and chin and gently smooth it in.  If my face still feels oily after a few minutes I blot away the rest, but this only happens if I apply too much as a little goes a long way.  It soaks into my skin brilliantly.  I am left with skin that feels soft, and not greasy.  Incidentally, it appears to be smoothing out my skin tone too - I had a few red marks from previous pimples and they have faded.  I have also tried putting it in my hair as well as my long hair tangles easily.  Again, less is more, I put three drops on my hands, rub them together and rub my hands through my hair.  It makes my hair soft and tangle-free.  This product is amazing, and will last a long time.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Really moisturizers and I love that it is just pure jojoba.  Use it for hands, hair and face.  Mix with pure Aloe Vera for a nice skin treatment.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but I feel like everyone needs a heads up. Jojoba oil will never go rancid, but after 6 months this stuff grew some sort of strange white scaly looking fungus that over took the oil. There were nasty little flakes floating around in the oil, and because the bottle is a dark color I didn&#x27;t realize it for a while which meant that I was applying this stuff to my face for who knows how long. Gross, I know. Just be careful if you decide to purchase, make sure you look into the bottle every time before using it. I would recommend the Desert Essence organic oil instead.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter who has eczema.&lt;br /&gt;It seems like healing.&lt;br /&gt;This organic oil is lite and very gentle for skin.</li>
            <li> The best! My skin is so soft and nice after beginning to use exclusively jojoba oil instead of lotions.  This bottle is the cheapest you&#x27;ll ever find and it&#x27;s most definitely top quality. Will be a repeat customer for times to come.</li>
            <li> So I am an 18 year old guy with a red dry face and Small pimples. I have spent a lot of money on  acne product  and moisturizers with out success of finding one that doesn&#x27;t irritate my face. I hate reading reviews that don&#x27;t explain the product very well so I&#x27;m going to try my best to explain. You will probably want a pump for this first of all because it comes out fast. It goes on your face with an oily sheen but soaks in fast and the shiny- ness goes away within a hour. It feels so soothing and is already helping my red face go back to normal from all the damaging chemicals of store products. This is only my first week of me using jojoba oil  and so far it hasn&#x27;t made me break out which I feared and I do see a slight improvement in my acne already. So what have you got to lose from trying this?  It is a bit pricy but worth every dime.  Also A quick tip, keep out of the sun and store in fridge if you want to last longer :)</li>
            <li> Keeping me skin hydrated after shower time.  Smell is kind of weird but it&#x27;s worth it.  Bonus points for the opportunity to say jojoba in my everyday life.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to traditional moisturizer again. I&#x27;ve had a lot of problems with my skin, it&#x27;s either shiny or flaky. I&#x27;ve finally found a balance with this oil, it moisturizes without leaving a sheen. I wish I could get everyone to ditch the store bought stuff and try this.</li>
            <li> This is alot of oil for what you pay for. A little goes a long way so it will last me a while.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to use for massage therapy along with the Eden Gardens essential oils.  Great oil for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Best oil I&#x27;ve ever worked with - easy to add essential oils for scent. I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a moisturizing oil to replace the Emu oil that I find amazing, but it&#x27;s both expensive and, of course, requires the killing of the big bird to harvest it. Emu oil absorbs into the skin incredibly well, but I&#x27;d read that Jojoba oil is also very like our natural sebum, and so easily absorbed. Next came choosing a brand to order and I noticed that pricing can vary wildly, with the more expensive ones asking almost $4 an ounce.This Dr. Adorable oil was just over $1 an ounce and so seemed a screaming bargain, but worried it might be diluted or inferior based on the price. I visited their web site and learned that this Jojoba is 100% cold pressed, undiluted, organic (Organic, overseen by QAI, Quality Assurance International) Still skeptical, I read on Rodale News, a name familiar to health conscious consumers, that QAI is regulated by the USDA and so isn&#x27;t some smoke and mirrors unknown agency. So I could feel confident there were no pesticides traces I might be putting on my skin to be absorbed.  I received my order and was very happy to find there is no strong odor, reported with some brands I noticed in my search, it has a rich golden color and it applied smoothly and was absorbed easily. In fairness, It will take some time to see if I notice the same results as with Emu Oil, but so far I&#x27;m very happy with the product and also happy I didn&#x27;t spend 4 times as much, with no likely upside for the price difference. An interesting aside is that, I imagined the name of this company was an effort to sound cute and fuzzy, but evidently, there is actually a female doctor whose last name is Adorable. I&#x27;ll write an update in a few weeks but so far very satisfied and can recommend is as a 5 star oil. (One clarification; including the shipping cost into the price brings the per ounce cost to $1.43 at the time of this review)</li>
            <li> This product is what I use to mix my massage oils for aromatherapy.  I have tried other oils from local sources, but this one seems to be clearer and last longer.</li>
            <li> Awesome oil! It lacks that nutty smell that jojoba typically comes with--it just smells really fresh. It is thick and wonderful!  I will order from seller again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased but would like to have a better smell 😔</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I found this oil. It is cold pressed, organic and great price. I use it after shower for body...my esthetician recommended and she was right, it is great!</li>
            <li> Works well for Me!  Great price, quality oil. Keeps my skin smooth, hydrated, and protects from the sun (really!). My skin feels best with this oil than any other product I use, including expensive lotions/creams that I receive free and occasionally try. I have eczema, icthyosis, and chronically dry skin. Life-long misdiagnosed Celiac Disease substantially impaired my ability to absorb fats, oils, and nutrients for inner and outer hydration...amongst other critical functions. I keep coming back to this Jojoba oil because it just plain WORKS for me, with substantial savings over buying in stores!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside with ANY oil is that if slathered on and then you put on a long sleeve shirt/blouse, it WILL stain garment like any oil would!  Trick is to put small to moderate amount of oil on skin at least 1-2 hrs before donning shirt, and it lessens/stops oil staining. If using for sun bathing, then slather it on!  I tan nicely and NEVER burn when using it! Remember that the skin needs minimum of 24 hrs before bathing to convert the UV into Vitamin D3, so wipe off skin with (paper) towel, OR lightly rinse off with water ONLY! No soap! I&#x27;ve been using it this way for 8 years. See my dermatologist yearly for clean bill of health.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite carrier oil. I have tried coconut oil and I do not like the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; of it, this jojoba oil has no scent and is very good on my sensitive skin. I have extremely acne prone skin and i can use this on my face every night with no problem. It does have an oily glow for the first few hours and since i have naturally oily skin, I cannot use it during the day, but it is PERFECT to use by itself as a nightly moisturizer, or with added Essential oils. Love this item!</li>
            <li> This is great jojoba oil. I use a few drops on my face after a shower. Great for sinus/facial massage, too. At this price, there&#x27;s no competition.</li>
            <li> This rich organic oil is top quality and feels like silk on the skin. The smell of pure jojoba is very bland however, so I mixed a little yang-ylang oil into it for a nice, light aroma and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly! Great quality oil!</li>
            <li> Good product and good service.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. The price is remarkable cheaper than any other Natural food stores and websites!!!</li>
            <li> I personally have used this specific product for a few years now. I use it to wash my face everyday as a replacement for soap or cleanser. In the past, I have tried many different oils for this &amp;#34;oil cleansing method&amp;#34;. nothing works as well as jojoba oil because it is the closest oil to our natural oil ph. Coconut and olive oil tend to leave your skin feeling greasy after removing and I had difficulty getting my skin balanced with those options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba oil however has made my face more balanced than ever. I use a glycerin facial mask as a moisturizer but thats it, and rarely do I have acne Before when I used traditional cleansing methods that was always an issue. It&#x27;s a great body moisturizer as well and i only have to buy this product maybe 2ce per year!</li>
            <li> I have been allergic to most massage oils which is hard as a masseuse. Dr. Adorable works for me and no itching!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with organic jojoba oil, though I&#x27;ve used regular jojoba oil before.  I can really tell a difference. This oil is sssooo moisturizing. I am African American with hair that is not chemically treated; when wearing natural styles mist my hair with a water mixed with a little of this oil and it is fabulous. I will definitely purchase again.  I&#x27;m still love, love, loving this oil. I&#x27;ve used other brands of Jojoba oil before but I don&#x27;t remember being this satisfied with them.  I have purchased my 2nd bottle and I am still pleased with the quality of this oil. I really hope it continues to be available and doesn&#x27;t change!</li>
            <li> Smells great, and my hair drinks this stuff like water!  This is definitely one of my staple products for my thick, medium-length 4a-4b natural hair.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my and my kids&#x27; skin and hair. It works great and our skin absorbs it quick, but leaving our skin and hair moisturized. I will continue to use this product, especially at this price.</li>
            <li> My favorite Jojoba oil. I will order again</li>
            <li> Oil for external only that has a hundred uses if it has one. First discovered at least a thousand years ago, it provides an un-matched ability to blend into human skin, as it contains several of the same amino acids. It also has the ability to instantly break down plant resins and should be used by &amp;#34;trimmers&amp;#34; for hand and tool cleaning with no residue, and the non-toxic nature of Jojoba. I have also had NOW Foods and for this reason have given this brand four stars, as their&#x27;s is a bit more refined.But this is a better value for the price. Massage, and cosmetic uses are perfect, and I use in the shower with a little bit of lavender oil mixed in as part of my shampoo. Amazing feeling of relaxation for the skin and scalp.</li>
            <li> This oil is thicker than the one I used to buy from Desert Essence and a lot greaser. I don&#x27;t mind it since I have dry skin and I only apply at night. For the price this is a great deal.  My only complaint to the company would be to not over fill the bottle and to put a safety seal and different type of cap. I spilled when I opened this and having a turning cap for such a large bottle is a bit inconvenient because it makes it easy to spill and hard to hold. Perhaps one of those caps that you press on might work better.</li>
            <li> And everything&#x27;s working fine except my hair&#x27;s still white. But this jojoba makes it shine, keeps it growing fine. M&#x27;spouse&#x27;s hair is black (no surprise, she&#x27;s Black) and looking really hot. Her hair is locs down to the base of her spine and shines. Everything about her shines. Lucky me. Rubbing each other the right way pays off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH, WE RUB JOJOBA ON OUR SKIN TOO - YES, GREAT FUN, GOOD EXERCISE TOO - SHE HAS NO WRINKLES ON HER FACE, OR ANYWHERE ELSE AS FAR AS I CAN SEE. (She tells me she uses LOTUS OF THE NILE HANDMADE FACE CREME by an artist named Rochleigh who serves only a few celebrity friends in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Las Vegas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So thanks all around to Dr. Adorable, Rochleigh and Amazon! Of course, m&#x27;wife&#x27;s genes and maybe me too...</li>
            <li> I noticed a lot of the reviews are comparing this to commercial jojoba brands like Dessert Essences. Dessert Essences is not a PURE JOJOBA oil. It is processed and cut with other oils to give it the \\&quot;slip\\&quot; you feel. If you are looking for pure jojoba this is literally the best deal on the web and it is pure and uncut. I&#x27;m a product maker and we love this jojoba. It&#x27;s not diluted and there are no chemicals or filler oils in it. Works wonders in body product, skincare,and soap making. :) I&#x27;ve searched high and low for pure jojoba at a reasonable cost and I always come back to this one. Love it!</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve read, Jojoba oil is the oil that is MOST similar to our own natural, secreted bodily oil.  I&#x27;ve recently been suffering from a dry scalp and touches of what must be excezma (sp?).  Since Jojoba is so similar to our own oils, I can apply as often as I wish during the day, a minimal amount, and my body just absorbs it and heals/hydrates the area.  I spritz my scalp and face with water (if I&#x27;m not washing them) so my skin will have moisture to absorbs and then I apply the Jojoba.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve found that it is a great &amp;#34;carrier oil&amp;#34; to have.  It has no scent and isn&#x27;t super heavy. I&#x27;ve been using it as a key ingredient in making my own shampoos, soaps, and body butters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Adorable Inc also fills the bottle to the BRIM, so you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth for this organic products.  Just be careful upon first opening it so you don&#x27;t spill before you even get the chance to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that the cap on the bottle was damaged.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m leaving 4 out of 5 stars.  Great product, but there was a tad of spilling in the box &amp; if anyone else picks up the bottle w/o me warning them, there&#x27;s potential for a mess, so I&#x27;m going to have to pour it into a new container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all though, definitely worth your attention!</li>
            <li> Good Price but it does have a slight odor. The more expensive Jojoba Oil are more expensive and have no odor.</li>
