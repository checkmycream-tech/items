            <li>This VS Sassoon hair straightener works surprisingly well.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s a really good iron</li>
            <li>I used to think it did a good job.</li>

            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>when i first used the product it was great!</li>
            <li>I was so happy that my hair looked great and all, however all of sudden the heating</li>
            <li>it worked great the first two weeks</li>
            <li>I have decided that I am willing to pay more for an iron that makes my hair more beautiful and won&#x27;t pull out hair.</li>
            <li>It was very cheap and it works like magic.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Multiple heat settings are great for thinner hair too!</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll be satisfied and amazed at how well it works.</li>
            <li>it still works wonderful, but recently i dropped it and cracked the frame so now the plates dont stay in.</li>
            <li>The stylist, using a much better iron, got my hair the silkiest I have EVER felt.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this hair straightener.</li>
            <li>This one is perfect for anyone who wants to get a straight head of hair in no time at all!</li>
            <li>I am getting rid of this cheap one for a better one.</li>
            <li>This iron is good for getting the hair straight, but along with that comes the harmful effects of metal straightening irons, were talking</li>
            <li>But for the first year (with not regular use) it was excellent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had problems with the light flickering and going off on me.</li>
            <li>I really love this iron, I really think it has become a legend!</li>
            <li>It does heat up quickly.</li>
            <li>Because the plates are so large, I can straightening my hair fast and it is easy to grip in my hand.</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron hands down.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased this item and I was happy with it for about a month,(which means a total usage of about 4-5 times)  </li>
            <li>Since it does get extremely hot, it tends to burn out after about a year or so, so you have to replace, however, it is economical enough to be able to do that.</li>
            <li>I had a Revlon straightener before, and i thought my hair was straight, but now I can see it can get straighter!  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no website that I am aware of where I can let the co. know of this malfunction</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also sure that I can&#x27;t be the only one that this has happened to.  </li>
            <li>for the first 3 mounths then it died on me.</li>
            <li>I first got this iron as a gift.</li>
            <li>But now I got another one because I love how hot it gets and how big that plates are.</li>
            <li>When I first tried it, the straightening had worked automatically.</li>
            <li>First I bough Conair 4 in 1 hair kit</li>
            <li>but after I tried it, it was smooth silk, moisture, soft and straight!</li>
            <li>It straightens very well and gets to be quite hot.</li>
            <li>I am a very dissatisfied customer.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s perfectly straight.</li>
            <li>I already have straight hair</li>
            <li>My hair does not get stuck on the plates and slide smoothly even when I clamp the flat part.   </li>
            <li>and after I was done straightening about one quarters of my hair, the heat totally died down from hot to warm, and it didn&#x27;t have any effect on my hair.</li>
            <li>These metal irons really arent healthy for one who does some serious straightening, ones who just run in through maybe once a week they are ok, but if u constantly straighten your hair, stay away from this iron. ...</li>
            <li>if only it will last longer then Enron did.:)</li>
            <li>I know that its salon price worthy, but when it was 29.99 when i had boughten it i was willing to pay the extra 20 dollars for a new one, but i dont know about an extra 45 dollars.</li>
            <li>right - i buy another on and the same thing happened!</li>
            <li>Even though its a bit pricy, its worth every single penny!</li>
            <li>I used to have to wake up 2 hours early before work to do my hair, but know it takes 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>We all used it last night and wnt to bed, and our hair is still straight today.  </li>
            <li>and I use it every day with no trouble.</li>
            <li>and my hair is FREQUENTLY getting caught in it.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I am not exactly sure how hot the plates get, but it is one step down from the professional plates used in most hair salons and the beauty is that I have NEVER once burned my hair with these.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little confused because I loved it SO MUCH until it just died on me.</li>
            <li>Same as all the other reviews said, the red light flickers, and just goes off.</li>
            <li>I am African American with \\&quot;softer\\&quot; super curly long hair and this iron WORKS!!   </li>
            <li>Yet, all of a sudden that heat keep dying on me and the little red light would flicker on and off.</li>
            <li>vs sasoon professional hair straightening iron works extreamly well, it quickly staightens my thick banana curls in 10 minutes flat!</li>
            <li>the red light would flicker on and off- not good at all.</li>

            <li> vs sasoon professional hair straightening iron works extreamly well, it quickly staightens my thick banana curls in 10 minutes flat! I used to have to wake up 2 hours early before work to do my hair, but know it takes 10 minutes. I would recomend this product to everyone, it works extreamly well.</li>
            <li> This straightener is great.  I am at a sleepover with all my friends and we all used it and it worked great.  We all used it last night and wnt to bed, and our hair is still straight today.  I had a Revlon straightener before, and i thought my hair was straight, but now I can see it can get straighter!  My friend has this one, and I am definitly going to buy it!!! You should too!!!</li>
            <li> This item works great!  Doesn&#x27;t take long to heat to desired setting and takes MINIMAL time to straighten rough, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> does what its supposed to do. one bad thing is on both of the longer edges of the gold plate, the hair gets caught on it. (meaning the edges are not smoothed off...which makes it very frustrating to use sometimes).</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item and I was happy with it for about a month,(which means a total usage of about 4-5 times)  Now the thing doesn&#x27;t work, i plugged it in and set the temp to where I usually have it and nothing, no heat!!!

There&#x27;s no website that I am aware of where I can let the co. know of this malfunction I&#x27;m also sure that I can&#x27;t be the only one that this has happened to.  I say spend the extra $ and go somewhere else!!</li>
            <li> This straightner has been working for me for over a year now and I use it every day with no trouble. It straightens very well and gets to be quite hot. I would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;m a little confused because I loved it SO MUCH until it just died on me. Same as all the other reviews said, the red light flickers, and just goes off. But for the first year (with not regular use) it was excellent. I&#x27;ll probably just order another.</li>
            <li> I really love this iron, I really think it has become a legend! With very thick, wavy, LONG hair, this is one of the only irons (costing less than a million bucks it seems) that I have found reasonably priced. They say Gold plated was d/c due to the damage to the hair, but in my opinion my hair looks worse &amp; less healthy when I&#x27;m spraying it with lots of heat protectant product(buildup &amp; harsh clarifying shampoos) &amp; going over the same section  multiple times (breakage, dents, splitends). I&#x27;m not a beauty expert but I use this iron &amp; one glide per section &amp; it&#x27;s perfectly straight. With long hair (middle back) I don&#x27;t have hours to spend trying to iron my hair. This straightener is becomming very hard to find(even online) since it was discontinued years ago. I recommend this iron to anyone, If you just want straight hair (duh) just excuse the slightly outdated bulky design but it will get the job done! Multiple heat settings are great for thinner hair too!</li>
            <li> This VS Sassoon hair straightener works surprisingly well.  The one I&#x27;d been using before this one pales in comparison to it.  It heats up in seconds, requires no water, and flattens on the spot.  I have hard-to-manage thick hair, and this straightener makes it so much easier for me to style.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  I think you&#x27;ll be satisfied and amazed at how well it works.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t use this product, as I was looking for it for a friend who couldn&#x27;t find it.  She was happy though.</li>
            <li> Hi,...&lt;br /&gt;I had to return this hair straightener in three weeks after I bought it. I wasn&#x27;t too happy with it,..infact I bought it at a very good price of 14.99 from Fry&#x27;s electronics,...it worked great the first two weeks I was so happy that my hair looked great and all, however all of sudden the heating stopped,...it would heat up and after I was done straightening about one quarters of my hair, the heat totally died down from hot to warm, and it didn&#x27;t have any effect on my hair.I thought may be the thermostat turned off and it would turn back on again,...but NO!! it was gone! I had to return it,..thinking about buying the other one by VS, but not sure after reading the review,...could anyone make any suggestions?</li>
            <li> when i first used the product it was great! for the first 3 mounths then it died on me. i hardly used it -maybe every weekend to tough up the flyaways that my blowdrier left behind. no big deal right - i buy another on and the same thing happened! 4 months goes by and an electrical problem. the red light would flicker on and off- not good at all. i would never recomend this to anyone! its terrible</li>
            <li> I first got this iron as a gift. It lasted a few months and my hair was terriic. Yet, all of a sudden that heat keep dying on me and the little red light would flicker on and off. But now I got another one because I love how hot it gets and how big that plates are. So it&#x27;s a really good iron if only it will last longer then Enron did.:)</li>
            <li> This iron is good for getting the hair straight, but along with that comes the harmful effects of metal straightening irons, were talking frizz, damage, and split ends galore. These metal irons really arent healthy for one who does some serious straightening, ones who just run in through maybe once a week they are ok, but if u constantly straighten your hair, stay away from this iron. ...</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron hands down.  I bought this iron in 2006 and I just dropped it for the 100th time today and it is still working despite the fact that the unit is split in half.    I am African American with \\&quot;softer\\&quot; super curly long hair and this iron WORKS!!   Functionality: 5 stars Superb. Because the plates are so large, I can straightening my hair fast and it is easy to grip in my hand. I am not exactly sure how hot the plates get, but it is one step down from the professional plates used in most hair salons and the beauty is that I have NEVER once burned my hair with these.  The setting goes up to 20 and I usually use it around 15.    I suggest that before you go out and spend money on those expensive ceramic irons, to try this one first..it will not disappoint.  My hair does not get stuck on the plates and slide smoothly even when I clamp the flat part.   Durability: 5 stars Superb.  Price: 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have had this straightener for over 5 years. it still works wonderful, but recently i dropped it and cracked the frame so now the plates dont stay in. I was checking a few months a go to see if they still made them because i wanted to get a new one, and one for my sister. a few months a go it was only 49.99 and i was about to buy two, but things came up where i couldnt, and now with everything back in order, they are 76 dollars. how can it have gone up so much in a few months? I know that its salon price worthy, but when it was 29.99 when i had boughten it i was willing to pay the extra 20 dollars for a new one, but i dont know about an extra 45 dollars.</li>
            <li> I have had this straightener for a few years now. I would use it maybe once a or twice a week. I used to think it did a good job. It does heat up quickly. I&#x27;ve never had problems with the light flickering and going off on me. But when I started trying to use it a lot, I noticed that it would pull on my hairs. There are gaps in the plastic that holds the plates together and my hair is FREQUENTLY getting caught in it. I end up pulling my hair out.     Anyway, I had my hair straightened after getting it cut a few months ago. The stylist, using a much better iron, got my hair the silkiest I have EVER felt. I didn&#x27;t even know my hair could look so good. This iron doesn&#x27;t even come close. I am getting rid of this cheap one for a better one. I have decided that I am willing to pay more for an iron that makes my hair more beautiful and won&#x27;t pull out hair.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this hair straightener. I already have straight hair but when it&#x27;s at  shoulder length, it flips at the ends and is uncontrolable. When I first tried it, the straightening had worked automatically. It heats up in a mintue too! It was very cheap and it works like magic. I have also seen others that are more expensive and don&#x27;t work. This one is perfect for anyone who wants to get a straight head of hair in no time at all!</li>
            <li> Wow. Forget Conair or Revelon. First I bough Conair 4 in 1 hair kit but I was displeased. Only the curling works. The straightener didn&#x27;t even straightened a single hair. It never heats it! Vidal Sassoon heats up in 60 seconds but the Conair will probably take 60 minutes.&lt;BR&gt;Vidal Sassoon will straighten your hair in about 5 minutes. My hair was very wavy and a little dry but after I tried it, it was smooth silk, moisture, soft and straight! Even though its a bit pricy, its worth every single penny!</li>
