            <li>This product is, hands-down, the best anti-itch cream I have ever tried for getting relief from those pesky bug bites.  </li>

            <li>SO HAPPY to have found on Amazon !!!!</li>
            <li>It calmed the itching and redness around my eyes beautifully.  </li>
            <li>This contains calomine and promoxine which is an anesthetic and works great for anything itchy.</li>
            <li>great price</li>
            <li>It also does a great job clearing up a rash.</li>
            <li>Aveeno Calamine Cream is great stuff.  </li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>Great consistency and application.</li>
            <li>Works good on rashes and itches.</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>I love this cream!</li>
            <li>My dog has skin allergies and this is the best cream I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>works ok.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t find it at the local Walmart or grocery store anymore, so I was really happy to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>This product works for all but the most dastardly itches.</li>
            <li>OUTSTANDING SERVICE AND EXCELLENCE..</li>
            <li>Found it on line with free shipping!  </li>
            <li>Pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>I was able to get all over me in a 5 minute stretch of time picking up some free firewood in a brushy side of the road.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s cheap and saves a trip to the store.</li>
            <li>I had a light case of shingles and it helped with the redness and pain.</li>
            <li>Good for bites on sensitive skin toddlers</li>
            <li>smells kind of funny, but it dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>Love this and in this form, not the large bottle.  </li>
            <li>I get a full nights sleep</li>
            <li>Rather than this Aveeno Eczema dry theraphy is better and effective.</li>
            <li>It immediately soothes itchy skin from eczema, and it works great to stop the itch from mosquito bites (I live in the southern part of the U.S.).  </li>
            <li>This product is a bit pink because of the calamine in it, but it rubs in fairly well.  </li>
            <li>it is worth buying it.</li>
            <li>was useful while it lasted.</li>
            <li>its good controls dryness of skin due to allergy</li>
            <li>I suppose calamine lotion (one of the main ingredients) is a bit \\&quot;old school\\&quot;, but between that and the proxamine, this cream really does provide an amazing amount of relief.  </li>
            <li>After one application, the bites don&#x27;t itch for 2-3 hours, whereas with products containing either hydrocortisone (Cort Aid) or diphenyhydramine (Benedryl), it seemed as if the relief was only momentary or that the bites started itching even more.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and it comes in handy on a frequent basis, especially in the summer.</li>
            <li>My daughter is super sensitive to mosquito bites and this really helped the itch.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for this.</li>
            <li>H. REIB AVEENO IS THE REAL CATS MEOW...</li>
            <li>IT REALLY DOES DO THE JOB</li>
            <li>I like this one better than other calamine creams because of that reason.  </li>
            <li>The Aveno product works better than anything we have tried -- and we have tried 20 or 30 other products.</li>
            <li>Better than any other cream we tried.</li>
            <li>The standard treatment is with extremely powerful cortisone so powerful that it can burn fair skin leaving you with a cure worse than the disease.  </li>
            <li>cream saved my sanity last year, though, so its worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We live in Panama and there are a gazillion things that can bite you -- both seen and unseen.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and have been using it for years, but it is getting hard to find this type (without cortisone) in stores.  </li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t get here fast enough.</li>
            <li>I put it on constantly, and couldn&#x27;t have fabric touch the spots, but it really helped.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for another tube of this wonder cream.  </li>
            <li>After initial treatment with the prescription, which eventually started to burn my skin, I found my old tube of Aveeno and started using it.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the tube runs out pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Long time user and frequent buyer.  </li>
            <li>I have used this as my favorite for bites and cold sore like eruptions (herpes whatever ?) and itches of various kinds ... better than calamine and lately could not find at Walgreens, Target etc etc.</li>

            <li> It also does not leave a pink spot where you put it</li>

            <li> It looks pink, so it helps tone down the redness as well, but the color blends well on skin, almost like a color correcting primer.  </li>
            <li> If bug bites are driving you crazy, pick up a tube of this, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>

            <li> I have Lichen Sclerosis, a potentially devastating autoimmune disorder similar to psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my dad who had a weird rash on both forearms.  </li>
            <li> Easier to travel with, but so difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> The entire world has gone STUPID!!!  </li>
            <li> This product WILL stop the itch when cortisone products fail.</li>

            <li> This product is, hands-down, the best anti-itch cream I have ever tried for getting relief from those pesky bug bites.  I suppose calamine lotion (one of the main ingredients) is a bit \\&quot;old school\\&quot;, but between that and the proxamine, this cream really does provide an amazing amount of relief.  After one application, the bites don&#x27;t itch for 2-3 hours, whereas with products containing either hydrocortisone (Cort Aid) or diphenyhydramine (Benedryl), it seemed as if the relief was only momentary or that the bites started itching even more.  The cream itself is pink but disappears upon application, and even after several applications you don&#x27;t feel as if the cream is building up on itself, as you do with some creams.  If bug bites are driving you crazy, pick up a tube of this, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> its good controls dryness of skin due to allergy</li>
            <li> I have tried calamine lotion with minimal success plus it leaves my skin pink which is not cool. This contains calomine and promoxine which is an anesthetic and works great for anything itchy. It also does not leave a pink spot where you put it so I will definitely buy this again. great price</li>
            <li> This product is a bit pink because of the calamine in it, but it rubs in fairly well.  I like this one better than other calamine creams because of that reason.  It also does a great job clearing up a rash.</li>
            <li> works ok. smells kind of funny, but it dries quickly.  i prefer pramoxine for topical applications.  it&#x27;s cheap and saves a trip to the store.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for another tube of this wonder cream.  I have Lichen Sclerosis, a potentially devastating autoimmune disorder similar to psoriasis.  Unfortunately this itchy, painful scaring condition appears in very tender areas of the body, including membranous areas such as in the genitalia area.  The standard treatment is with extremely powerful cortisone so powerful that it can burn fair skin leaving you with a cure worse than the disease.  After initial treatment with the prescription, which eventually started to burn my skin, I found my old tube of Aveeno and started using it.  Relief!!!!!!  This is a miracle tube of relief that should be in every woman&#x27;s bathroom medicine cabinet.  By the way, it also relieves eyelid edema caused by salty tears.  Not finding it in any local stores, I have ordered a tube through Amazon.  It can&#x27;t get here fast enough.</li>
            <li> Best cream I&#x27;ve used for any type of rash or irritation.  I had a light case of shingles and it helped with the redness and pain.</li>
            <li> Works good on rashes and itches.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and have been using it for years, but it is getting hard to find this type (without cortisone) in stores.  It immediately soothes itchy skin from eczema, and it works great to stop the itch from mosquito bites (I live in the southern part of the U.S.).  I keep a tube of this in my purse and it comes in handy on a frequent basis, especially in the summer.</li>
            <li> It took some of the redness away dealing with my rash on both of the back of my legs.</li>
            <li> We live in Panama and there are a gazillion things that can bite you -- both seen and unseen.  My wife is especially prone to bites and hers were festering a lot.  So, I wanted to find a product that dried a &amp;#34;wet bite&amp;#34;.  The Aveno product works better than anything we have tried -- and we have tried 20 or 30 other products.</li>
            <li> Got this for my dad who had a weird rash on both forearms.  A little applied every day cleared him up in less than a week.  This is an excellent product.  It healed his rash and eliminated the itch.</li>
            <li> Love this and in this form, not the large bottle.  Easier to travel with, but so difficult to find.  Are they phasing this out?  Not a good idea!</li>
            <li> It calmed the itching and redness around my eyes beautifully.  It looks pink, so it helps tone down the redness as well, but the color blends well on skin, almost like a color correcting primer.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> It didnt soothed my itching problems. Rather than this Aveeno Eczema dry theraphy is better and effective. Though it is small to carry but it didnt served the purpose.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for a number of skin issues:&lt;br /&gt;bug bites, chafing, allergy outbreaks~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when I had shingles last year, it was the only thing that worked on the little spots from the&lt;br /&gt;shingles. I put it on constantly, and couldn&#x27;t have fabric touch the spots, but it really helped.&lt;br /&gt;My shingles were on my leg and foot, so I don&#x27;t know how another part of the body would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream saved my sanity last year, though, so its worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find it at the local Walmart or grocery store anymore, so I was really happy to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I always use Cortaid to help me with my skin problem.  I find this cream does just the same as Cortaid but its cheaper.</li>
            <li> Good for bites on sensitive skin toddlers</li>
            <li> My daughter is super sensitive to mosquito bites and this really helped the itch. Better than any other cream we tried.</li>
            <li> Aveeno Calamine Cream is great stuff.  I have the shingles and I don&#x27;t know what I would have done without this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;It is so soothing-does the trick.  Thanks so much for this.</li>
            <li> I tried prescription used tea tree I just received it 3days ago it seems to be working I get a full nights sleep it is worth buying it.</li>
            <li> This product works for all but the most dastardly itches. If they bdon&#x27;t work for you----I suggest see a doctor.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! I bought it to help the red dots on my face! It&#x27;s already improving a lot! Thanks!</li>
            <li> My dog has skin allergies and this is the best cream I&#x27;ve found so far. It reduces the redness in just a few days and helps with the itching. My only complaint is that the tube runs out pretty fast.</li>
            <li> OUTSTANDING SERVICE AND EXCELLENCE..H. REIB AVEENO IS THE REAL CATS MEOW... IT REALLY DOES DO THE JOB IT ADVERTISES.THANK YOU..</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Mom use to but caladryl cream (years ago) they no longer make it and the replacement doesn&#x27;t do the trick.  Took a chance on your product and MOM is happy again!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great consistency and application. Absorbs and moisturizes along with the itch relief. I would recommend it and buy it again.</li>
            <li> product was quoted @ 6-pack of one oz tubes for thirty-odd dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;received a single one oz tube in a raggedy shrinkwrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;was charged at the six-pack price !!</li>
            <li> Pretty good deal. Good value. Prompt delivery. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews who stated this is the best anti itch cream any place. I have &amp;#34;itchy&amp;#34; skin and this is the only product that worked for me in 40 years of testing. The purple AVEENO does not help a bit.  I must add that the seller states this is $5.31 oz. That is false. The tube holds one ounce and the price is $8.49. The entire world has gone STUPID!!!  Anyhow, this stuff works and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Long time user and frequent buyer.  This product WILL stop the itch when cortisone products fail.</li>
            <li> I had tried the product previously (it came as a freebie with some lotion) so I knew it would perform well.  The problem lay in the fact that no one local carried it.  Found it on line with free shipping!  Yeah!  Arrived when promised in perfect condition.  Will not hesitate to order again.</li>
            <li> I have used this as my favorite for bites and cold sore like eruptions (herpes whatever ?) and itches of various kinds ... better than calamine and lately could not find at Walgreens, Target etc etc. SO HAPPY to have found on Amazon !!!!</li>
            <li> The expiry date was a month from the delivery date. was useful while it lasted.</li>
            <li> Not sure why but this stuff is helping  so well  with a very, very, nasty case of poison ivy I was able to get all over me in a 5 minute stretch of time picking up some free firewood in a brushy side of the road. It does outperform the OTC hydrocortisone cream, but I also have been taking one Benadryl at night so perhaps that is helping out as well.</li>
