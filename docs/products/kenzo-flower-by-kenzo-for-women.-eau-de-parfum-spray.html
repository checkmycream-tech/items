            <li>amazing.  </li>
            <li>, i&#x27;m recomended this seller, amazing.</li>
            <li>It is no an over powering kind of parfum.  </li>
            <li>She liked the Kenzo Summer.</li>
            <li>It is can be descibed as being a tom boyish kind of cologne</li>
            <li>People have complimented me and asked me what kind of perfume I&#x27;m wearing repeatedly.</li>
            <li>I really liked the smell in Sephora, but kind of over it now.  </li>
            <li>My favorite perfume in the world got for good price and received in timley matter.  </li>
            <li>My co-worker tried this one because she liked it on me, but it didn&#x27;t work for her.</li>
            <li>Nice scent - lasts all day.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume...very good product</li>
            <li>Still smells very feminine and the price was GREAT!!!  </li>
            <li>Even people that find perfume somewhat offensive comment how nice it.</li>
            <li>#34;flammable or hazardous material can not be returned&amp;#34;!----so</li>
            <li>safe, hope price more cheaper, good choice.</li>
            <li>I speak for no one but myself, but for a household with many hundreds of fragrances in circulation, for a new one to have THIS distinctive and impressive impact really kind of stands for itself.</li>
            <li>I speak for no one but myself, but for a household with many hundreds of fragrances in circulation, for a new one to have THIS distinctive and impressive impact really kind of stands for itself.</li>
            <li>Powdery, light, and fairly long-lasting (lasted through my day, though had to replenish for evening).  </li>
            <li>I guess  everybody need to find own favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering me my own bottle, which is absolutely lovely....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to find one that smells true to the scent on anybody and lasts more than 8hrs.</li>
            <li>Not too strong and has staying power!</li>
            <li>This product is very nice for a person who likes light smells, the presentation of this bottle is very nice and shipping was fast and on time</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest, the fact that florals aren&#x27;t dominant in this scent is what I love most about it.</li>
            <li>I think she likes it a great deal, and it&#x27;s my new favorite for her!</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and in good order.  </li>
            <li>This perfume has a nice aroma that&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>The bottle is simply classic and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Very feminine, very sexy!</li>
            <li>It smells like a huge pile of baby powder that has been doused with hair spray!</li>
            <li>Our my favorite perfume!&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>I love this parfum.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Item arrived on time and I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>and I have to admit, I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>sexy bouquet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve bottled it here. :)</li>
            <li>My favorite parfum for quite a while...</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>But in all fairness, im sure</li>
            <li>but yet it captures the spirit of a well confident woman.     </li>
            <li>My favorite perfume ever.</li>
            <li>Kenzo makes some of my favorite perfumes by the way.</li>
            <li>Sutle, exotic, just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I immediately fell in love with the scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing kenzo flowers for many years and always get compliments on the scent, the bottles are now refillable</li>
            <li>i love this perfume!!!&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>My wife loves this, and I love it on her</li>
            <li>love it and its size..</li>
            <li>This is definitely my favorite perfume for about 7-8 years already.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy that Amazon carried it, and the price was very fair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot pick up the top note floral.</li>
            <li>I can get floral, okay.</li>
            <li>In restaurants, women passing on the way to their tables will stop and ask what you&#x27;re wearing, men go goofy trying to nonchalantly smell your elbow.</li>

            <li>I love it when I smell it on her :).</li>

            <li>but if like Chanel you will also love this baby powder, flowery scent....m.m.m.</li>

            <li>Received it in the mail ahead of schedule, very satisfied with the whole experience!</li>
            <li>SEXY, SMOOTH, AND INTOXICATING.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m pretty sure it landed me my job!</li>
            <li>and I really love the scent, just know in advance that the bottle is uniquely shaped and over 12\\</li>
            <li>This is one of the most unique fragrances I have ever had.</li>
            <li>and I may make a special request for this fragrance to be part of her wardrobe on our special night! :)</li>
            <li>I love Kenzo&#x27;s Flower eau de parfum and am happy with the larger size and also that it is refillable.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was very quick, no problems at all</li>
            <li>A signature scent of my girlfriend&#x27;s, this is an incredible price for such a fantastic fragrance.</li>
            <li>Also shopping was easy with amazon</li>
            <li>it is such a great smell,I get so many compliments on this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, smells really great and is lasting, stays on even after showering.</li>
            <li>I smelled it from the bottle and felt like this was a strong perfume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a teacher and don&#x27;t like to wear perfumes that are strong.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend buying from this seller as I will do so again and again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty enthusiastic collector of fragrances.</li>
            <li>As a man, many florals are sickeningly sweet to me.</li>
            <li>can I say, very simple that I would love some!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived with no problems, fast delivery, perfect price, sealed and important ...</li>
            <li>lesson learned...read the fine print and don&#x27;t order perfume from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I specially love this one, because the first time I had it, it was becase, it&#x27; s been a gift from my husband!</li>
            <li>This is such a beautiful clean flowery scent.  </li>
            <li>I got the 3.4 size, it was wrapped in bubble wrap and placed in a huge box.</li>
            <li>A great light and flowery fragrance with lasting scent.</li>
            <li>HUGE bottle with generous sprayer.</li>
            <li>The REAL perfume is amazing.</li>
            <li>If you like light, powdery scents, this is for you.  </li>
            <li>It has a clear, bright, &#x27;watery&#x27; rose note very similar to Le Labo Rose 31, but there&#x27;s iris, chrysanthemum.</li>
            <li>However, nothing I have tried since then has even come close to matching this fragrance&#x27;s light, powdery scent -- or the compliments I received while wearing it.</li>
            <li>I am loving this perfume so much</li>
            <li>found it in a duty free shop at the airport.  </li>
            <li>and I enjoy it on her.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just another light, floral based fragrance</li>
            <li>It is light &amp;</li>
            <li>THANK YOU FOR HAVING IT AVAILABLE</li>
            <li>Smells great, way cheaper than the big make-up stores.</li>
            <li>hope this perfume is popular enough that they keep selling it, but not so popular that it&#x27;s no longer a unique product for me to wear.</li>
            <li>I was excited to come across it on Amazon and find such a great price.</li>
            <li>And it turned out to be the most favorite perfume in my collection of more than 50 different kinds of perfume.</li>
            <li>The bottle itself is also unique.</li>
            <li>This does not smell like the original Flower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Flower by Kenzo is a very elegant and sensual perfume, soft and not overbearing . . .</li>
            <li>i think it&#x27;s gone, but a stranger will smile and ask!  </li>
            <li>100% original</li>
            <li>I originally purchased Kenzo Flower in a 3.4 ounce / 100 ml bottle through Amazon and</li>
            <li>Its very soothing and pleasant to wear for almost any regular work day or a special occasion !!</li>
            <li>It has a really cool bottle design.</li>
            <li>Bought the larger size as gift for my wife, it arrived in good shape.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet but not cloying, so when I say \\&quot;flower syrup\\</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s sweet, but not cloying.</li>
            <li>, IT STAYS FOR MANY HOURS, IT  IS ALSO VERY SENSUAL &amp; ALL</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even like Flower all that much, although every component scent I mentioned is a favorite.</li>
            <li>Many thanks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet and sofisticadate.</li>
            <li>This perfume has a flowery sweet scent that captivated me the firsst time I smelled it on an airplain trip.  </li>
            <li>It delivers a not too sweet aroma of...</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if it would have been made clear that perfume can not be returned when ordering.  </li>
            <li>my girlfriend loved this perfume bought a smaller version of this a yr  1/2 ago  </li>
            <li>A nice clean and fresh wow.</li>
            <li>Clean and fresh</li>
            <li>As usual, buying a Kenzo fragance is a pleasant eperience!</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick, but the cap of bottle came cracked.  </li>
            <li>If you like a floral scent that&#x27;s not too mild</li>
            <li>Actually, my wife love&#x27;s it, so I guess in a way, I love it...</li>
            <li>it won&#x27;t rub off or evaporate too quickly.</li>
            <li>I figured that since I love Amazon and had total trust in them, that I would get the authentic purfume...</li>
            <li>I use it for special ocasion since has a bold body and tend to be a tiny bit strong yet love it.</li>
            <li>It is a very soft elegant scent for any woman.</li>
            <li>I immediately fell in love with it and have not changed to a different one since I used it for the first time more than a year ago.</li>
            <li>I recently discovered this fragrance and fell in love!  </li>
            <li>MY FRIENDS [MALE] LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Very light and soft.</li>
            <li>The real thing at a fine price</li>
            <li>As an international buyer I am aware that besides the great deals in this kind of products I have to consider all the costs related to shipping and taxes to get it in my country, nevertheless having made all the calculations it as still so much cheaper than buying it here.</li>
            <li>Bottle is much larger than I expected, and very attractive.  </li>
            <li>Kenzo, Issey Miyake and Success de Paris are some of my own favorites, bar none (including my various high-end bottles from Amouage, L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur, Le Labo, Montale and so on).</li>
            <li>Since I travel a lot, I tested it a few times to make sure I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>Very light, simple and clean.</li>
            <li>I found this to be pretty relaxing and at the same time provocative which is why I like it the most!</li>
            <li>But Flower just smells clean and fresh (and yes, powdery) without the more obvious notes of citrus that seem to accompany \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scents.</li>
            <li>His other florals like Kenzo de Kenzo (Ca sent Beau), Perfume D&#x27;ete, and Le Monde Est Beau are just gorgeous.</li>
            <li>and I received it right away.  </li>
            <li>This one is just right.</li>
            <li>This perfume is amazing and you get a ton of it for the price which is significantly cheaper here than other stores.</li>
            <li>starts off very powdery, then progresses to a clean floral.</li>
            <li>It was the poppies on the box that first attracted me, the soft scent made it one of my favorites :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually put on any perfume unless I&#x27;m going out for a special occasion, but I had smelt this in a store and immediately loved it.</li>
            <li>Thank you, goods received, very much.</li>
            <li>AT A VERY REASONABLE PRICE.&lt;br /&gt;JUDY</li>
            <li>Excelent perfume, very fast delivery</li>
            <li>I have to add that while my friends use the perfume that smells great and lasts long on them, I can use the same one</li>
            <li>That is exactly what my husband did.  </li>
            <li>It is was the first time I had worn the scent.    </li>
            <li>It was exactly what my wife wanted.</li>
            <li>Will get some more on next visit.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this I know that I had to have it.....</li>
            <li>the powdery light scent is effective enough to last all day yet does not overpower the senses.</li>
            <li>My best friend is always talking about perfumes and she gave me the hint that she would like this one but was too expensive for her :</li>
            <li>bought my first bottle while visiting Paris,France.</li>
            <li>Well this is the real deal and the price is right.</li>
            <li>With Mother&#x27;s Day right around the corner,  delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li>Soft and feminine yet clean.</li>
            <li>For those who are Kenzo lovers, this is a much more reasonable price than that at local retailers.</li>
            <li>my favorite parfum: very feminine and French....</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and secured, the fragrance is nice, however I was not aware that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is soft and feminine without being sickly sweet or cloying.</li>
            <li>Eau de Toilettes I find somewhat more tolerable, but they fade so quickly they hardly seem worth the money.</li>
            <li>That took more than 2 weeks after the day the package arrived to customs, not being able to give the present in my girlfriend&#x27;s birthday and at the end of the day, paying almost exactly the same as if I was going  to buy it in my local Mall.</li>
            <li>&quot; I mean something more like a finely crafted attar.</li>
            <li>I really like this parfum</li>
            <li>It is not an intense floral fragrance.</li>
            <li>The price was extremly reasonable.</li>
            <li>It has a perfectly reasonable balance of ambergris.</li>
            <li>Its very floral but hides something much deeper that antagonized my scent glands to no end.  </li>
            <li>It has a light floral smell that is perceived only when someone comes close to you.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Flowers by Kenzo Parfum!</li>
            <li>And some of my friends also told me that it doesn&#x27;t really go well with them like it does on me.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t really like the body lotion though.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t worn perfume very often before</li>
            <li>So much for the Fragrance Defense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>otherwise I&#x27;ll be swimming in too much scent.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>Fast shipping even though it had to go ground.</li>
            <li>D. She really enjoys this fragrance</li>
            <li>forgot how very sensual this fragrance is</li>
            <li>Although the tall bottle turns the perfume some awkward to manipulate and store, it is a very sweet an pleasant fragance.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and get it through Sephora, don&#x27;t be fooled by the price like me and many other reviewers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lost my sense of smell unfortunately, but I know this one always smelt good on me, so I stick with it!</li>
            <li>The scent is first and foremost very baby powder soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a beautiful scent and different from the other perfumes out there.</li>
            <li>Romantic ocasion or special ones.</li>
            <li>kenzo from Macy&#x27;s, 2-3 sprays, its on me most of the day, it lasts on my scarves and coat for days, THIS, that I got here, doesn&#x27;t last even hours, the scent is very light and not as serious as the real stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That was perfectly ok until he moment my courier company sent me an e-mail telling me that this kind of products, along with food and other stuff, has to be carefully revised by our Ministry of Health and Environment, almost like your EPA in the U.S., that meant doing a lot of paperwork, filling some documents, having to pay an additional extra to Customs, etc.</li>
            <li>Received as a sample and ordered full size next day.  </li>
            <li>A new summer classic for me!</li>
            <li>I am NOT a perfume person and I find most scents at best cloying and overpowering, and at worst the cause of skin, nose, and eye irritation.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite and getting so much for so little on Amazon, I can wear all the time.  </li>
            <li>The strength seems just right - enough that people can smell it, but not so much that the smell stays in the room</li>
            <li>If you really want a romantic evening to kick off the right way...indulge in this item for the wife or girlfriend...</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this perfume.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It smells very flowery and classy.</li>
            <li>It has a fore front of a powdery, soft floral scent overtone, but gently enhanced by the undertones of vanilla.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the early Mother&#x27;s Day gift to myself.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I am so glad that I was able to find Kenzo for such a reasonable price here on Amazon, and I can&#x27;t wait until it arrives!</li>
            <li>The scent is light, fresh and not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I think this fragrance is going to put a new spark in our marriage because a woman smelling like this... yum.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new fragrance</li>
            <li>It is a perfume with a scent inexplicable if I can buy it because it has no comparison, the 100 x 100% recommend to all women of this world, especially for use in a wonderful evening ...!</li>
            <li>I doesn&#x27;t last much you can smell it on you up to 12 hours, yet doesn&#x27;t still the whole day.</li>
            <li>I will be more careful in the future when ordering from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product the first time and the smell lasted forever, the second time i bought it once you sprayed it</li>
            <li>Entirely satisfied!This is the second time i made this purchase and there will most definitely be a third!</li>
            <li>I am actually looking forward to winter when I will probably wear it full-time (now I wear the kenzo summer when it is hot, since the kenzo flower seems a bit ornate for tshirts and flip-flops).</li>
            <li>I had admired this perfume for a while in duty free shops, and had looked into buying it from Sephora (and several other department-type stores); I am so glad I checked amazon since their largest size is priced comprable to Sephora&#x27;s middle-size which was much less</li>
            <li>The value is fantastic compared to $97 at department stores, but the odd size is tipsy on my shelf.</li>
            <li>This is half the price of what you would find at the airport&#x27;s duty free shops.</li>
            <li>To keep it even more subtle, I usually spray at the nape of the neck or under the neckline of a top rather than on the wrists.</li>
            <li>I has a soft powder, vanilla/flower scent.  </li>
            <li>I ride a motorcycle, a cruiser, and believe me the juxtaposing of my scent and riding my bike drives my husband wild.     </li>
            <li>It is a very playful cologne but yet very mysterious and alluring.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just surprised that no one else finds this chemical and aldehydic.</li>
            <li>Since the item was a gift, I could not open the plastic wrapping around the box, until after the gift was given (for Christmas), at which point I felt I lost the opportunity to return the item and get a not broken one....</li>
            <li>but I get compliments on this one frequently.  </li>
            <li>However, when I found it on Amazon, I was surprised by the price.  </li>
            <li>, this happens when you put it direct in the skin and always particulas of perfum spread through the blouse.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is a floral scent - smells of innocence and soft femininity.</li>
            <li>This perfume is so soft but lingers all day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used only about half of it in two years (another downside to EdTs--they don&#x27;t keep their scent over time!), but I still love it.</li>
            <li>but she&#x27;s not tremendously adventurous with fragrances and has ended up ignoring about a dozen I&#x27;ve given her in favor of one of the very first I bought her, a long time ago, D&amp;G Light Blue.</li>
            <li>The new, cheaper version of the scent does not last.  </li>
            <li>This is counterfeit - the smell is not quite the same and (fortunately) evaporates within just a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I saved about $20 bucks, this usually $80 at major retailers.</li>
            <li>I wanted to buy at a major department store.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;this was made in a 3.3 ounce / 100 ml bottle, not sure if the original.  </li>
            <li>however I really like the smell, not really flowers</li>
            <li>A little vanilla and, when the wind is right and the barometer cooperates and Leo is in retrograde, for all I know, some ginger and musk.</li>
            <li>My son gifted me with it a few Mother&#x27;s Days ago, it&#x27;s replaced my other scents!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little overwhelming afte a few uses</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how enormous the bottle would be, but it certainly will last me a long, long time.</li>
            <li>We found this here on Amazon in the 3.4oz bottle for $55.00 and fast shipping, I received this in less than 3 days via UPS.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>, the smell is soft and long last</li>
            <li>In my opinion I couldn&#x27;t wear it everyday because it could be to strong for everyday use.</li>

            <li> It is can be descibed as being a tom boyish kind of cologne</li>
            <li> People have complimented me and asked me what kind of perfume I&#x27;m wearing repeatedly.</li>
            <li> I really liked the smell in Sephora, but kind of over it now.  </li>
            <li> My favorite perfume in the world got for good price and received in timley matter.  </li>
            <li> My co-worker tried this one because she liked it on me, but it didn&#x27;t work for her.</li>
            <li> Nice scent - lasts all day.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume...very good product</li>
            <li> Still smells very feminine and the price was GREAT!!!  </li>
            <li> Even people that find perfume somewhat offensive comment how nice it.</li>
            <li> #34;flammable or hazardous material can not be returned&amp;#34;!----so</li>
            <li> safe, hope price more cheaper, good choice.</li>
            <li> I speak for no one but myself, but for a household with many hundreds of fragrances in circulation, for a new one to have THIS distinctive and impressive impact really kind of stands for itself.</li>
            <li> I speak for no one but myself, but for a household with many hundreds of fragrances in circulation, for a new one to have THIS distinctive and impressive impact really kind of stands for itself.</li>
            <li> Powdery, light, and fairly long-lasting (lasted through my day, though had to replenish for evening).  </li>
            <li> I guess  everybody need to find own favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering me my own bottle, which is absolutely lovely....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to find one that smells true to the scent on anybody and lasts more than 8hrs.</li>
            <li> Not too strong and has staying power!</li>
            <li> This product is very nice for a person who likes light smells, the presentation of this bottle is very nice and shipping was fast and on time</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest, the fact that florals aren&#x27;t dominant in this scent is what I love most about it.</li>
            <li> I think she likes it a great deal, and it&#x27;s my new favorite for her!</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and in good order.  </li>
            <li> This perfume has a nice aroma that&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> The bottle is simply classic and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Very feminine, very sexy!</li>
            <li> It smells like a huge pile of baby powder that has been doused with hair spray!</li>

            <li> and I have to admit, I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> sexy bouquet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve bottled it here. :)</li>
            <li> My favorite parfum for quite a while...</li>
            <li> I love this scent.</li>
            <li> But in all fairness, im sure</li>
            <li> but yet it captures the spirit of a well confident woman.     </li>
            <li> My favorite perfume ever.</li>
            <li> Kenzo makes some of my favorite perfumes by the way.</li>
            <li> Sutle, exotic, just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I immediately fell in love with the scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing kenzo flowers for many years and always get compliments on the scent, the bottles are now refillable</li>

            <li> I was so happy that Amazon carried it, and the price was very fair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot pick up the top note floral.</li>
            <li> I can get floral, okay.</li>
            <li> In restaurants, women passing on the way to their tables will stop and ask what you&#x27;re wearing, men go goofy trying to nonchalantly smell your elbow.</li>

            <li> I love it when I smell it on her :).</li>

            <li> Beautiful soft fragrance.</li>

            <li> Received it in the mail ahead of schedule, very satisfied with the whole experience!</li>
            <li> SEXY, SMOOTH, AND INTOXICATING.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m pretty sure it landed me my job!</li>
            <li> and I really love the scent, just know in advance that the bottle is uniquely shaped and over 12\\</li>
            <li> This is one of the most unique fragrances I have ever had.</li>
            <li> and I may make a special request for this fragrance to be part of her wardrobe on our special night! :)</li>
            <li> I love Kenzo&#x27;s Flower eau de parfum and am happy with the larger size and also that it is refillable.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was very quick, no problems at all</li>
            <li> A signature scent of my girlfriend&#x27;s, this is an incredible price for such a fantastic fragrance.</li>
            <li> Also shopping was easy with amazon</li>
            <li> it is such a great smell,I get so many compliments on this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, smells really great and is lasting, stays on even after showering.</li>
            <li> I smelled it from the bottle and felt like this was a strong perfume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a teacher and don&#x27;t like to wear perfumes that are strong.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend buying from this seller as I will do so again and again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty enthusiastic collector of fragrances.</li>
            <li> As a man, many florals are sickeningly sweet to me.</li>
            <li> can I say, very simple that I would love some!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived with no problems, fast delivery, perfect price, sealed and important ...</li>
            <li> lesson learned...read the fine print and don&#x27;t order perfume from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I specially love this one, because the first time I had it, it was becase, it&#x27; s been a gift from my husband!</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful clean flowery scent.  </li>
            <li> I got the 3.4 size, it was wrapped in bubble wrap and placed in a huge box.</li>
            <li> A great light and flowery fragrance with lasting scent.</li>
            <li> HUGE bottle with generous sprayer.</li>
            <li> The REAL perfume is amazing.</li>
            <li> If you like light, powdery scents, this is for you.  </li>
            <li> It has a clear, bright, &#x27;watery&#x27; rose note very similar to Le Labo Rose 31, but there&#x27;s iris, chrysanthemum.</li>
            <li> However, nothing I have tried since then has even come close to matching this fragrance&#x27;s light, powdery scent -- or the compliments I received while wearing it.</li>
            <li> I am loving this perfume so much</li>
            <li> found it in a duty free shop at the airport.  </li>
            <li> and I enjoy it on her.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just another light, floral based fragrance</li>
            <li> It is light &amp;</li>
            <li> THANK YOU FOR HAVING IT AVAILABLE</li>
            <li> Smells great, way cheaper than the big make-up stores.</li>
            <li> hope this perfume is popular enough that they keep selling it, but not so popular that it&#x27;s no longer a unique product for me to wear.</li>
            <li> I was excited to come across it on Amazon and find such a great price.</li>
            <li> And it turned out to be the most favorite perfume in my collection of more than 50 different kinds of perfume.</li>
            <li> The bottle itself is also unique.</li>
            <li> This does not smell like the original Flower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Flower by Kenzo is a very elegant and sensual perfume, soft and not overbearing . . .</li>
            <li> i think it&#x27;s gone, but a stranger will smile and ask!  </li>
            <li> 100% original</li>
            <li> I originally purchased Kenzo Flower in a 3.4 ounce / 100 ml bottle through Amazon and</li>
            <li> Its very soothing and pleasant to wear for almost any regular work day or a special occasion !!</li>
            <li> It has a really cool bottle design.</li>
            <li> Bought the larger size as gift for my wife, it arrived in good shape.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet but not cloying, so when I say \\&quot;flower syrup\\</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s sweet, but not cloying.</li>
            <li> , IT STAYS FOR MANY HOURS, IT  IS ALSO VERY SENSUAL &amp; ALL</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even like Flower all that much, although every component scent I mentioned is a favorite.</li>
            <li> Many thanks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet and sofisticadate.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a flowery sweet scent that captivated me the firsst time I smelled it on an airplain trip.  </li>
            <li> It delivers a not too sweet aroma of...</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if it would have been made clear that perfume can not be returned when ordering.  </li>
            <li> my girlfriend loved this perfume bought a smaller version of this a yr  1/2 ago  </li>
            <li> A nice clean and fresh wow.</li>
            <li> Clean and fresh</li>
            <li> As usual, buying a Kenzo fragance is a pleasant eperience!</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick, but the cap of bottle came cracked.  </li>
            <li> If you like a floral scent that&#x27;s not too mild</li>
            <li> Actually, my wife love&#x27;s it, so I guess in a way, I love it...</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t rub off or evaporate too quickly.</li>
            <li> I figured that since I love Amazon and had total trust in them, that I would get the authentic purfume...</li>
            <li> I use it for special ocasion since has a bold body and tend to be a tiny bit strong yet love it.</li>
            <li> It is a very soft elegant scent for any woman.</li>
            <li> I immediately fell in love with it and have not changed to a different one since I used it for the first time more than a year ago.</li>
            <li> I recently discovered this fragrance and fell in love!  </li>
            <li> MY FRIENDS [MALE] LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Very light and soft.</li>
            <li> The real thing at a fine price</li>
            <li> As an international buyer I am aware that besides the great deals in this kind of products I have to consider all the costs related to shipping and taxes to get it in my country, nevertheless having made all the calculations it as still so much cheaper than buying it here.</li>
            <li> Bottle is much larger than I expected, and very attractive.  </li>
            <li> Kenzo, Issey Miyake and Success de Paris are some of my own favorites, bar none (including my various high-end bottles from Amouage, L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur, Le Labo, Montale and so on).</li>
            <li> Since I travel a lot, I tested it a few times to make sure I really liked it.  </li>
            <li> Very light, simple and clean.</li>
            <li> I found this to be pretty relaxing and at the same time provocative which is why I like it the most!</li>
            <li> But Flower just smells clean and fresh (and yes, powdery) without the more obvious notes of citrus that seem to accompany \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scents.</li>
            <li> His other florals like Kenzo de Kenzo (Ca sent Beau), Perfume D&#x27;ete, and Le Monde Est Beau are just gorgeous.</li>
            <li> and I received it right away.  </li>
            <li> This one is just right.</li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing and you get a ton of it for the price which is significantly cheaper here than other stores.</li>
            <li> starts off very powdery, then progresses to a clean floral.</li>
            <li> It was the poppies on the box that first attracted me, the soft scent made it one of my favorites :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually put on any perfume unless I&#x27;m going out for a special occasion, but I had smelt this in a store and immediately loved it.</li>
            <li> Thank you, goods received, very much.</li>
            <li> AT A VERY REASONABLE PRICE.&lt;br /&gt;JUDY</li>
            <li> Excelent perfume, very fast delivery</li>
            <li> I have to add that while my friends use the perfume that smells great and lasts long on them, I can use the same one</li>
            <li> That is exactly what my husband did.  </li>
            <li> It is was the first time I had worn the scent.    </li>
            <li> It was exactly what my wife wanted.</li>
            <li> Will get some more on next visit.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this I know that I had to have it.....</li>
            <li> the powdery light scent is effective enough to last all day yet does not overpower the senses.</li>
            <li> My best friend is always talking about perfumes and she gave me the hint that she would like this one but was too expensive for her :</li>
            <li> bought my first bottle while visiting Paris,France.</li>
            <li> Well this is the real deal and the price is right.</li>
            <li> With Mother&#x27;s Day right around the corner,  delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li> Soft and feminine yet clean.</li>
            <li> For those who are Kenzo lovers, this is a much more reasonable price than that at local retailers.</li>
            <li> my favorite parfum: very feminine and French....</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and secured, the fragrance is nice, however I was not aware that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is soft and feminine without being sickly sweet or cloying.</li>
            <li> Eau de Toilettes I find somewhat more tolerable, but they fade so quickly they hardly seem worth the money.</li>
            <li> That took more than 2 weeks after the day the package arrived to customs, not being able to give the present in my girlfriend&#x27;s birthday and at the end of the day, paying almost exactly the same as if I was going  to buy it in my local Mall.</li>
            <li> &quot; I mean something more like a finely crafted attar.</li>
            <li> I really like this parfum</li>
            <li> It is not an intense floral fragrance.</li>
            <li> The price was extremly reasonable.</li>
            <li> It has a perfectly reasonable balance of ambergris.</li>
            <li> Its very floral but hides something much deeper that antagonized my scent glands to no end.  </li>
            <li> It has a light floral smell that is perceived only when someone comes close to you.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Flowers by Kenzo Parfum!</li>
            <li> And some of my friends also told me that it doesn&#x27;t really go well with them like it does on me.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t really like the body lotion though.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t worn perfume very often before</li>
            <li> So much for the Fragrance Defense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> otherwise I&#x27;ll be swimming in too much scent.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Fast shipping even though it had to go ground.</li>
            <li> D. She really enjoys this fragrance</li>
            <li> forgot how very sensual this fragrance is</li>
            <li> Although the tall bottle turns the perfume some awkward to manipulate and store, it is a very sweet an pleasant fragance.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and get it through Sephora, don&#x27;t be fooled by the price like me and many other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost my sense of smell unfortunately, but I know this one always smelt good on me, so I stick with it!</li>
            <li> The scent is first and foremost very baby powder soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a beautiful scent and different from the other perfumes out there.</li>
            <li> Romantic ocasion or special ones.</li>
            <li> kenzo from Macy&#x27;s, 2-3 sprays, its on me most of the day, it lasts on my scarves and coat for days, THIS, that I got here, doesn&#x27;t last even hours, the scent is very light and not as serious as the real stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That was perfectly ok until he moment my courier company sent me an e-mail telling me that this kind of products, along with food and other stuff, has to be carefully revised by our Ministry of Health and Environment, almost like your EPA in the U.S., that meant doing a lot of paperwork, filling some documents, having to pay an additional extra to Customs, etc.</li>
            <li> Received as a sample and ordered full size next day.  </li>
            <li> A new summer classic for me!</li>
            <li> I am NOT a perfume person and I find most scents at best cloying and overpowering, and at worst the cause of skin, nose, and eye irritation.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite and getting so much for so little on Amazon, I can wear all the time.  </li>
            <li> The strength seems just right - enough that people can smell it, but not so much that the smell stays in the room</li>
            <li> If you really want a romantic evening to kick off the right way...indulge in this item for the wife or girlfriend...</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this perfume.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It smells very flowery and classy.</li>
            <li> It has a fore front of a powdery, soft floral scent overtone, but gently enhanced by the undertones of vanilla.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the early Mother&#x27;s Day gift to myself.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am so glad that I was able to find Kenzo for such a reasonable price here on Amazon, and I can&#x27;t wait until it arrives!</li>
            <li> The scent is light, fresh and not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I think this fragrance is going to put a new spark in our marriage because a woman smelling like this... yum.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new fragrance</li>
            <li> It is a perfume with a scent inexplicable if I can buy it because it has no comparison, the 100 x 100% recommend to all women of this world, especially for use in a wonderful evening ...!</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t last much you can smell it on you up to 12 hours, yet doesn&#x27;t still the whole day.</li>
            <li> I will be more careful in the future when ordering from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product the first time and the smell lasted forever, the second time i bought it once you sprayed it</li>
            <li> Entirely satisfied!This is the second time i made this purchase and there will most definitely be a third!</li>
            <li> I am actually looking forward to winter when I will probably wear it full-time (now I wear the kenzo summer when it is hot, since the kenzo flower seems a bit ornate for tshirts and flip-flops).</li>
            <li> I had admired this perfume for a while in duty free shops, and had looked into buying it from Sephora (and several other department-type stores); I am so glad I checked amazon since their largest size is priced comprable to Sephora&#x27;s middle-size which was much less</li>
            <li> The value is fantastic compared to $97 at department stores, but the odd size is tipsy on my shelf.</li>
            <li> This is half the price of what you would find at the airport&#x27;s duty free shops.</li>
            <li> To keep it even more subtle, I usually spray at the nape of the neck or under the neckline of a top rather than on the wrists.</li>
            <li> I has a soft powder, vanilla/flower scent.  </li>
            <li> I ride a motorcycle, a cruiser, and believe me the juxtaposing of my scent and riding my bike drives my husband wild.     </li>
            <li> It is a very playful cologne but yet very mysterious and alluring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just surprised that no one else finds this chemical and aldehydic.</li>
            <li> Since the item was a gift, I could not open the plastic wrapping around the box, until after the gift was given (for Christmas), at which point I felt I lost the opportunity to return the item and get a not broken one....</li>
            <li> but I get compliments on this one frequently.  </li>
            <li> However, when I found it on Amazon, I was surprised by the price.  </li>
            <li> , this happens when you put it direct in the skin and always particulas of perfum spread through the blouse.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a floral scent - smells of innocence and soft femininity.</li>
            <li> This perfume is so soft but lingers all day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used only about half of it in two years (another downside to EdTs--they don&#x27;t keep their scent over time!), but I still love it.</li>
            <li> but she&#x27;s not tremendously adventurous with fragrances and has ended up ignoring about a dozen I&#x27;ve given her in favor of one of the very first I bought her, a long time ago, D&amp;G Light Blue.</li>
            <li> The new, cheaper version of the scent does not last.  </li>
            <li> This is counterfeit - the smell is not quite the same and (fortunately) evaporates within just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I saved about $20 bucks, this usually $80 at major retailers.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy at a major department store.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this was made in a 3.3 ounce / 100 ml bottle, not sure if the original.  </li>
            <li> however I really like the smell, not really flowers</li>
            <li> A little vanilla and, when the wind is right and the barometer cooperates and Leo is in retrograde, for all I know, some ginger and musk.</li>
            <li> My son gifted me with it a few Mother&#x27;s Days ago, it&#x27;s replaced my other scents!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little overwhelming afte a few uses</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how enormous the bottle would be, but it certainly will last me a long, long time.</li>
            <li> We found this here on Amazon in the 3.4oz bottle for $55.00 and fast shipping, I received this in less than 3 days via UPS.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> , the smell is soft and long last</li>
            <li> In my opinion I couldn&#x27;t wear it everyday because it could be to strong for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It seems that there are too make fake products on the market, I tried some from sellers and only one was original!</li>
            <li> (Although it does beg the question of why one would order an expensive product like perfume without trying it out in a real store first.</li>
            <li> I left it unused for a long time.</li>
            <li> and it last a long time.</li>
            <li> When he bent down to take my license and so on, he said \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li> It last very long</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have to refill for a long while.</li>
            <li> A long, slender bottle with a poppy is flower on the side.</li>
            <li> long after you&#x27;ve left.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fragrance lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much larger bottle than I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna keep this fragrance out all year long</li>
            <li> this is even at the end of a long day, 8 hours plus from application!</li>
            <li> (I was not guilty on the grounds that I would never have done it if I knew there was a cop car behind me.)</li>
            <li> I only use half a spritz</li>
            <li> /&lt;br /&gt;Ive worn Kenzo for some time, I usually buy from department store, I should have known when it was priced half of what I normally pay that it wasn&#x27;t what it was supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> it was almost empty</li>
            <li> So be careful with every country&#x27;s regulation.</li>
            <li> it got delivered before expected date.&lt;br</li>
            <li> does the job as expected</li>
            <li> Finally a scent I can wear and found it on Amazon for half the price of Macy&#x27;s !</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume as my go to fragrance for the past several years.</li>
            <li> I keep order this one from Amazon, and sometimes I find it cheaper at other online perfume store</li>
            <li> this smells like alcohol...and some other funky mess.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a bottle at the fragrance store at the mall at a cheaper price and it was watered down</li>
            <li> it appeared watered down.</li>
            <li> It has an subtle floral fragrance that I cannot get enough of.</li>
            <li> The product is half the price of Macy&#x27;s, Nordstroms, and Sephora.</li>
            <li> It seems a little insipid.</li>
            <li> The floral scent is a little stronger than Issey Myake perfume.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t read the fine print and didn&#x27;t realize that I would be unable to return this product.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and have done so for years.</li>
            <li> wear it almost everyday to work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few years now.</li>
            <li> This is not an everyday perfum.</li>
            <li> I took a break from Kenzo Flower these past few months, frustrated by the high prices commanded for it by retail stores like Sephora.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t expect to wear it often, I bought the really small bottle.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how to rate this product.  </li>
            <li> One day, a really mean, leathery-faced motorcycle cop pulled me over for making an illegal left turn.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is really hard to find, but is definately a \\&quot;MUST</li>
            <li> but she says that about every floral scent, and to my nose, it&#x27;s not the least powdery.</li>
            <li> sucks.</li>
            <li> Having read some negative reviews, I&#x27;ll grant that if you&#x27;re buying this because it&#x27;s called \\&quot;Flower,\\&quot; this isn&#x27;t the scent for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ok, aside from waxing poetic (and failing, miserably so in fact), the fragrance itself: I can&#x27;t speak to top/mid/base note differences.</li>
            <li> Actually I hate revealing my new scent.  </li>
            <li> Subtle floral notes with a powder note.</li>
            <li> Subtle but not dilute.</li>
            <li> Has a very loud flawers scent that can be a bit annoying to allergic person, I&#x27;m one of those but till now a try no over put on me.</li>
            <li> this item was weak in it&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t mean you have to buy it there!</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;d done a poor job selecting.</li>
            <li> Color me confused and befuddled.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, since the world loves Flower and I&#x27;m just confused by it, I&#x27;m giving it five stars.</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, on delivery day, my package was damaged and had to be returned.</li>
            <li> Disappointed :(</li>
            <li> My favorite....never disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> But I can speak to the base note.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> WRONG!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The REAL perfume is amazing. This is counterfeit - the smell is not quite the same and (fortunately) evaporates within just a few minutes. Do yourself a favor and get it through Sephora, don&#x27;t be fooled by the price like me and many other reviewers. Disappointed :(</li>
            <li> Everything good, arrive on time and perfect</li>
            <li> Beautiful soft fragrance. The only one I use now. Light fresh and beautifully presented in unique bottle</li>
            <li> It is a perfume with a scent inexplicable if I can buy it because it has no comparison, the 100 x 100% recommend to all women of this world, especially for use in a wonderful evening ...!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is really hard to find, but is definately a \\&quot;MUST HAVE!\\&quot; If you like  smelling like a bouquet of roses this scent is for you!!!!!</li>
            <li> Bottle is much larger than I expected, and very attractive.  It arrived quickly and in good order.  I was very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Our my favorite perfume!&lt;br /&gt;What can I say, very simple that I would love some!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived with no problems, fast delivery, perfect price, sealed and important ...&lt;br /&gt;Worshiping him ... hehehe</li>
            <li> If you like light, powdery scents, this is for you.  Subtle floral notes with a powder note. Love it!</li>
            <li> The product arrived on the date promised. Excellent!</li>
            <li> I really like this parfum, the smell is soft and long last</li>
            <li> So, I bought this perfume a year ago based on my friend&#x27;s recommendation. I smelled it from the bottle and felt like this was a strong perfume. I left it unused for a long time. Recently, I decided to try it on my body just to see how it would turn out. And it turned out to be the most favorite perfume in my collection of more than 50 different kinds of perfume. It smells very flowery and classy. A very unique scent. And it lasts the longest among all my perfume. My job requires me to run around all day. At the end of my 8hrs working day, when I walked out, I still got compliments from people who walked by me. I have to add that while my friends use the perfume that smells great and lasts long on them, I can use the same one but it doesn&#x27;t smell the same. I&#x27;m so happy to find one that smells true to the scent on anybody and lasts more than 8hrs.</li>
            <li> I love this parfum.  I has a soft powder, vanilla/flower scent.  It is no an over powering kind of parfum.  It has a really cool bottle design.</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume.  My wife will always carry it with her whenever we are on our holidays.  Very good price as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product the first time and the smell lasted forever, the second time i bought it once you sprayed it, you smelled it and then it started to fade.</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful clean flowery scent.  I love it.  Item arrived on time and I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Who knew the combination of powder and flowers could so provide such an understated scent yet make you turn around to find the location of the scent.  That is exactly what my husband did.  We met at a department store and he said he just followed the scent and found me! It is was the first time I had worn the scent.    The bottle is so beautiful.  And again understated. I feel so feminine when I wear it.  I ride a motorcycle, a cruiser, and believe me the juxtaposing of my scent and riding my bike drives my husband wild.     Actually I hate revealing my new scent.  I like mystery.  Cheers!</li>
            <li> Bought the larger size as gift for my wife, it arrived in good shape.  And, it was instantly put to use.  Neat package design although it stands quite tall.</li>
            <li> I have been using this fragrance for years and love it! Came packaged and wrapped in plastic so it wasn&#x27;t tampered with at all.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Loved it! Loved it! Loved it!Loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome smell, very nice and mellow and the bottle is very big</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent but its really expensive in the dept stores.I had purchased a bottle at the fragrance store at the mall at a cheaper price and it was watered down so I was skeptical. Well this is the real deal and the price is right. I definitely recommend buying from this site,, if you love the scent,, which I do!!!</li>
            <li> As usual, buying a Kenzo fragance is a pleasant eperience! I specially love this one, because the first time I had it, it was becase, it&#x27; s been a gift from my husband!</li>
            <li> This seller delivered a great product for the best price and I received it right away.  I love Kenzo&#x27;s Flower eau de parfum and am happy with the larger size and also that it is refillable.  I shouldn&#x27;t have to refill for a long while.</li>
            <li> I get compliments from both genders when I wear this fragrance.  It is not an intense floral fragrance. Subtle but not dilute.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother as a christmas gift. She just loves the scent. The price was extremly reasonable. It is a very soft elegant scent for any woman.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty enthusiastic collector of fragrances. I buy one for my wife now and then but she&#x27;s not tremendously adventurous with fragrances and has ended up ignoring about a dozen I&#x27;ve given her in favor of one of the very first I bought her, a long time ago, D&amp;G Light Blue. It&#x27;s a pleasant but thoroughly unexceptional fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I recently got her Kenzo D&#x27;Ete and that sort of sparked something. I guess I&#x27;d done a poor job selecting. She likes that one. Kenzo, Issey Miyake and Success de Paris are some of my own favorites, bar none (including my various high-end bottles from Amouage, L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur, Le Labo, Montale and so on). She liked the Kenzo Summer. So I picked up Kenzo Flower. She likes it a great deal... and I have to admit, I LOVE it. I think this fragrance is going to put a new spark in our marriage because a woman smelling like this... yum. Yum yum, scrumptious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, aside from waxing poetic (and failing, miserably so in fact), the fragrance itself: I can&#x27;t speak to top/mid/base note differences. But I can speak to the base note. It&#x27;s a syrupy flower. Flower syrup. It&#x27;s in the same vein as Kenzo Power for men... it&#x27;s a kung-pow punch to your nose of impossibly pleasant flowery serum. It&#x27;s sweet but not cloying, so when I say \\&quot;flower syrup\\&quot; I mean something more like a finely crafted attar. It has a clear, bright, &#x27;watery&#x27; rose note very similar to Le Labo Rose 31, but there&#x27;s iris, chrysanthemum. My wife thought it was powdery but she says that about every floral scent, and to my nose, it&#x27;s not the least powdery. It has a perfectly reasonable balance of ambergris. So it&#x27;s sweet, but not cloying. It&#x27;s appropriate, and the sweetness is a background to this one-two knockout punch of delightful and just... ugh... sexy bouquet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, I&#x27;m sold. I think she likes it a great deal, and it&#x27;s my new favorite for her! Our 11th anniversary is coming up and I may make a special request for this fragrance to be part of her wardrobe on our special night! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a husband smelling this on his wife, I&#x27;m giving it a 5-star rating, and if I could give it 6, I would. I speak for no one but myself, but for a household with many hundreds of fragrances in circulation, for a new one to have THIS distinctive and impressive impact really kind of stands for itself. Consider yourself... warned? Informed? Encouraged? Well whatever it is. Get yourself (or your spouse) one if romance is in the air. They&#x27;ve bottled it here. :)obe on our special night! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a husband smelling this on his wife, I&#x27;m giving it a 5-star rating, and if I could give it 6, I would.

            <li> My favorite parfum for quite a while... Good stuff..</li>
            <li> I took a break from Kenzo Flower these past few months, frustrated by the high prices commanded for it by retail stores like Sephora. However, nothing I have tried since then has even come close to matching this fragrance&#x27;s light, powdery scent -- or the compliments I received while wearing it. I even display the old empty bottles on my vanity. Needless to say, I am so glad that I was able to find Kenzo for such a reasonable price here on Amazon, and I can&#x27;t wait until it arrives!</li>
            <li> I love this scent. I don&#x27;t usually put on any perfume unless I&#x27;m going out for a special occasion, but I had smelt this in a store and immediately loved it. I ordered from Amazon and have been putting it on almost every day. It&#x27;s such a beautiful scent and different from the other perfumes out there.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this stuff one iota!  I cant put my finger on why its not for me but it&#x27;s not.  Its very floral but hides something much deeper that antagonized my scent glands to no end.  I frankly couldn&#x27;t wait for the scent to ware off.  But in all fairness, im sure its for somebody out there but not for me.</li>
            <li> Powdery, light, and fairly long-lasting (lasted through my day, though had to replenish for evening).  A new summer classic for me!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance! I use it everyday and have done so for years. I&#x27;m a teacher and don&#x27;t like to wear perfumes that are strong. This one is just right. It has a light floral smell that is perceived only when someone comes close to you. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this perfume as I was trying out others. I immediately fell in love with it and have not changed to a different one since I used it for the first time more than a year ago. I get a lot of compliments on this one with people asking where to get one for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;I wear it almost everyday to work and it seems to last the entire day. It has an subtle floral fragrance that I cannot get enough of.</li>
            <li> I first experienced this wonderful perfume in a sample of a leading make up company. It captured my attention immediately.  It has a fore front of a powdery, soft floral scent overtone, but gently enhanced by the undertones of vanilla. It is a very playful cologne but yet very mysterious and alluring. It is can be descibed as being a tom boyish kind of cologne but yet it captures the spirit of a well confident woman.     The bottle itself is also unique. A long, slender bottle with a poppy is flower on the side. Once this delicious cologne is gone, the bottle can be refilled so there is not another bottle to throw away.  The bottle is simply classic and beautiful.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume ever. Always get compliments when wearing it. Not too strong and has staying power!</li>
            <li> Thank you, goods received, very much.</li>
            <li> I am loving this perfume so much</li>
            <li> I want a scent that is clean/fresh smelling without being overpowering.  Kenzo Flowers is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I found it in a duty free shop at the airport.  Since I travel a lot, I tested it a few times to make sure I really liked it.  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I recently discovered this fragrance and fell in love!  I found the best price on Amazon and placed my order.  I received the product in very short order.  I&#x27;m really enjoying the light floral fragrance.  I also love the fact that it stays with me throughout the day!  I highly recommend Flowers by Kenzo Parfum!</li>
            <li> This juice is just eat-up with stank! Where are the flowers?! It smells like a huge pile of baby powder that has been doused with hair spray! I just can&#x27;t figure out why my nose will not detect any flowers. What&#x27;s more, why is this perfume so dang popular?! Color me confused and befuddled. Kenzo makes some of my favorite perfumes by the way. His other florals like Kenzo de Kenzo (Ca sent Beau), Perfume D&#x27;ete, and Le Monde Est Beau are just gorgeous. Based on those scents I was expecting the scent of actual flowers, not synthetic ones floating in a talcum stew. I&#x27;m just surprised that no one else finds this chemical and aldehydic.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick, but the cap of bottle came cracked.  Since the item was a gift, I could not open the plastic wrapping around the box, until after the gift was given (for Christmas), at which point I felt I lost the opportunity to return the item and get a not broken one....</li>
            <li> Sutle, exotic, just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This perfume is one of America&#x27;s best kept beauty secrets.  I was given a sample when we were in Paris, but I didn&#x27;t try the perfume until I got home.  I immediately fell in love with the scent.  Imagine my pleasant surprise when I found Kenzo Flower on Amazon--for a great price, too.  I highly recommend this perfume.</li>
            <li> this item was weak in it&#x27;s scent. it appeared watered down. i conpared it to what ws left of a store bought item.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a nice aroma that&#x27;s not too strong. People have complimented me and asked me what kind of perfume I&#x27;m wearing repeatedly. Unfortunately, on delivery day, my package was damaged and had to be returned. I waited two weeks for perfume and didn&#x27;t get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing kenzo flowers for many years and always get compliments on the scent, the bottles are now refillable so eco friendly a nice plus</li>
            <li> This does not smell like the original Flower. It seems that there are too make fake products on the market, I tried some from sellers and only one was original! Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent. My wife lovesit and I enjoy it on her. The quantity for the price is unbeatable at our local stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad about this item! Thank you!</li>
            <li> One of my all time favorites.  Purchased at a good price.</li>
            <li> This product is very nice for a person who likes light smells, the presentation of this bottle is very nice and shipping was fast and on time</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume as my go to fragrance for the past several years. Everyone loves it, my female co-workers, my boyfriend, friends. The scent is soft and feminine without being sickly sweet or cloying. The strength seems just right - enough that people can smell it, but not so much that the smell stays in the room long after you&#x27;ve left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this perfume is popular enough that they keep selling it, but not so popular that it&#x27;s no longer a unique product for me to wear.</li>
            <li> i love this perfume!!!&lt;br /&gt;and the quantity was great for the price,&lt;br /&gt;i already used it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;friends are asking me what kind of perfume i am wearing.&lt;br /&gt;i love it!</li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing and you get a ton of it for the price which is significantly cheaper here than other stores.</li>
            <li> I love it!  I&#x27;ve used it for a few years now.</li>
            <li> FOR  DAYTIME  IS  PERFECT, IT STAYS FOR MANY HOURS, IT  IS ALSO VERY SENSUAL &amp; ALL MY FRIENDS [MALE] LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> The Kenzo Flower parfum bottle and packaging is beautiful &amp; impressive.Five stars.&lt;br /&gt;I had never smelled this fragrance prior to ordering so I was&lt;br /&gt;taking a chance. HOWEVER I only rate the fragrance as three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kate&lt;br /&gt;California</li>
            <li> My wife says the smells like baby powder which it&#x27;s sort of does however I really like the smell, not really flowers</li>
            <li> My favorite....never disappointed. Amazon hit a home run with this one!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this, and I love it on her</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume as a christmas gift for my wife and she loves It... It has a very sweet esence and a very nice bottle.</li>
            <li> Great price for the size, the 3.3 is huge! I really liked the smell in Sephora, but kind of over it now.  It&#x27;s a little overwhelming afte a few uses</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume in the world got for good price and received in timley matter.  That&#x27;s the best you can ask for</li>
            <li> My mom loves this fragrance and can&#x27;t get enough of it. So I&#x27;ll regularly be ordering this as soon as its finished.</li>
            <li> awesome perfume.. love it and its size.. best bargain.</li>
            <li> This is definitely my favorite perfume for about 7-8 years already. I keep order this one from Amazon, and sometimes I find it cheaper at other online perfume store then I order it from there too. This works very good for me, but I guess it depends on the person. My co-worker tried this one because she liked it on me, but it didn&#x27;t work for her. And some of my friends also told me that it doesn&#x27;t really go well with them like it does on me. I guess  everybody need to find own favorite perfume. This one works for me great in Eau De Parfum, Eau De Toilette, or whatever. But I don&#x27;t really like the body lotion though.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift. Recipient loved it and it was used up in no time!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  Clean and fresh</li>
            <li> This is 1 of my favorite scents! It&#x27;s beautiful light mix of flowers &amp; powder. I always get compliments from it &amp; I&#x27;m pretty sure it landed me my job! Lol. I was excited to come across it on Amazon and find such a great price. I put in my order Sunday and received it this afternoon(Tuesday). I got the 3.4 size, it was wrapped in bubble wrap and placed in a huge box. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and will be purchasing again. Thank you! I saved about $20 bucks, this usually $80 at major retailers.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance! Received it in the mail ahead of schedule, very satisfied with the whole experience!</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, great  price, great shipping time. Entirely satisfied!This is the second time i made this purchase and there will most definitely be a third!</li>
            <li> I had admired this perfume for a while in duty free shops, and had looked into buying it from Sephora (and several other department-type stores); I am so glad I checked amazon since their largest size is priced comprable to Sephora&#x27;s middle-size which was much less volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t worn perfume very often before but I get compliments on this one frequently.  I am actually looking forward to winter when I will probably wear it full-time (now I wear the kenzo summer when it is hot, since the kenzo flower seems a bit ornate for tshirts and flip-flops).</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Kenzo Flower for Women along with a hair product I purchased and I fell in love with it! I was so happy that Amazon carried it, and the price was very fair.&lt;br /&gt;Flower by Kenzo is a very elegant and sensual perfume, soft and not overbearing . . . and the spray bottle is gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves it and everyone keeps saying  . . . &amp;#34;Oooh, you smell so good!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Bought this for my beautiful wife and she loves it! She smells so good in it. Very light, simple and clean.</li>
            <li> Great product. My wife loves it!</li>
            <li> Flower by Kenzo is not a mysterious fragrance. It&#x27;s just another light, floral based fragrance that&#x27;s all about the flower...but that&#x27;s where the mystery comes in. What flower? I cannot pick up the top note floral. It defies my nose. I can get floral, okay. And orange. A little vanilla and, when the wind is right and the barometer cooperates and Leo is in retrograde, for all I know, some ginger and musk. Maybe some woodsmoke? If they are there, they are gossamer light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is like a chameleon. I&#x27;m always thinking \\&quot;Aha, there&#x27;s the ginger...\\&quot; and then it&#x27;s gone. I don&#x27;t even like Flower all that much, although every component scent I mentioned is a favorite. Somehow all together there is no \\&quot;there\\&quot; there. It seems a little insipid. But what do I know is this: Every time I wear Flower (which I admit, was purchased because of the bottle...who could resist), people stop me in the street and want to sniff my shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an elevator, a Flower wearer is mobbed. In restaurants, women passing on the way to their tables will stop and ask what you&#x27;re wearing, men go goofy trying to nonchalantly smell your elbow. One day, a really mean, leathery-faced motorcycle cop pulled me over for making an illegal left turn. (I was not guilty on the grounds that I would never have done it if I knew there was a cop car behind me.) When he bent down to take my license and so on, he said \\&quot;Wow you smell good.\\&quot; Didn&#x27;t stop him from writing the ticket though. So much for the Fragrance Defense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, since the world loves Flower and I&#x27;m just confused by it, I&#x27;m giving it five stars. Smell it yourself, try it on. Could be I just am Flower-challenged. I like the attention Flower gets, but in my heart of hearts, I think if I were wearing Bulgari Blu, I&#x27;da gotten away with the hinky left turn.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what my wife wanted.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000C1Z6VA Kenzo Flower By Kenzo For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this for my wife. She loves this. The fragrance lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course, it&#x27;s cheaper than buying from the stores like Nordstrom.</li>
            <li> If you like a floral scent that&#x27;s not too mild this is the perfume for you.  I like it.  The floral scent is a little stronger than Issey Myake perfume.  I have received nothing but compliments.  At the time of purchase it was cheaper that list price on Sephora.</li>
            <li> love this fragrance.  Very light and soft. I wanted to buy at a major department store.  However, when I found it on Amazon, I was surprised by the price.  This seller is amazing.  The product is half the price of Macy&#x27;s, Nordstroms, and Sephora. With Mother&#x27;s Day right around the corner,  delivery was fast.  I would strongly recommend buying from this seller as I will do so again and again.  Thanks for the early Mother&#x27;s Day gift to myself.</li>
            <li> The wife loves it! I love it when I smell it on her :).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost my sense of smell unfortunately, but I know this one always smelt good on me, so I stick with it! Bought it in the US to take home to the UK. Excellent value, well packaged and promptly delivered. Many thanks. Will get some more on next visit.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.  Received as a sample and ordered full size next day.  Light and perfect for daytime.  Not overpowering but very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Actually, my wife love&#x27;s it, so I guess in a way, I love it...LOL.  Shipping was very quick, no problems at all</li>
            <li> I found this to be pretty relaxing and at the same time provocative which is why I like it the most! Whenever you have this on you, you&#x27;ll be noticed as soon as you enter the room! I love it!</li>
            <li> I boughyt this parfum for fall and winter. I think that is perfect for this season. It&#x27;s sweet and sofisticadate.</li>
            <li> Very authentic odor. I use it for special ocasion since has a bold body and tend to be a tiny bit strong yet love it. Has a very loud flawers scent that can be a bit annoying to allergic person, I&#x27;m one of those but till now a try no over put on me. Perfect for winter. Romantic ocasion or special ones. This is not an everyday perfum. In my opinion I couldn&#x27;t wear it everyday because it could be to strong for everyday use. I doesn&#x27;t last much you can smell it on you up to 12 hours, yet doesn&#x27;t still the whole day. Smell very nice the scent in my close, this happens when you put it direct in the skin and always particulas of perfum spread through the blouse.&lt;br /&gt;I recommended.</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> &#x3D;/&lt;br /&gt;Ive worn Kenzo for some time, I usually buy from department store, I should have known when it was priced half of what I normally pay that it wasn&#x27;t what it was supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;My kenzo from Macy&#x27;s, 2-3 sprays, its on me most of the day, it lasts on my scarves and coat for days, THIS, that I got here, doesn&#x27;t last even hours, the scent is very light and not as serious as the real stuff.&lt;br /&gt;VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love flower by Kenzo</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance.  I had never heard of it until my employer gave it as a gift when he and his family vacationed in France several years ago.  When I ran out, I was happy to be able to replace it online.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> My mother loves the scent on her, and she said just a tiny squirt lingers all day.  She&#x27;s happy, so I am too.</li>
            <li> Much larger bottle than I expected. I love the fragrance and the bottle is beautiful. I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Nice scent - lasts all day.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume. I scored lots of points with  Kenzo. Great deal and great value. The bottle is very nice as well. Thanks.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this I know that I had to have it.....It last very long and I get quite a bit of complements too.</li>
            <li> A signature scent of my girlfriend&#x27;s, this is an incredible price for such a fantastic fragrance. For those who are Kenzo lovers, this is a much more reasonable price than that at local retailers. A great light and flowery fragrance with lasting scent.</li>
            <li> This was always a scent that lasted on me and attracted compliments. The new, cheaper version of the scent does not last.  It is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> amazing.  starts off very powdery, then progresses to a clean floral.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume! We have been purchasing this locally for $44.00 for the 1.0oz bottle.  When the place we were getting it discontinued it, we had to look elsewhere and I am glad we did!! We found this here on Amazon in the 3.4oz bottle for $55.00 and fast shipping, I received this in less than 3 days via UPS.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great deal!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve always been a fan of this fragrance and it continues to be one of my favorites. the powdery light scent is effective enough to last all day yet does not overpower the senses. i have received many compliments while wearing this perfume. when my son was just a baby, i used to wear this all the time and it never bothered his skin. i can also wear this to work and no one complains (i am a nurse).</li>
            <li> You will LOVE Flower if you love BonBon perfume.  It&#x27;s got the same candy-sweet scent with a touch of something fruity.  Very feminine, very sexy!</li>
            <li> The price is competitive and the ease of ordering is great. This is the only perfume that my daughter in law loves.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance..get lots of compliments!!!</li>
            <li> I loved it.  Also shopping was easy with amazon</li>
            <li> mmmm i dont think its authentic. sucks.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. It is light &amp; the scent is wonderful. This is my favorite.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume...very good product</li>
            <li> HUGE bottle with generous sprayer. I didn&#x27;t realize how enormous the bottle would be, but it certainly will last me a long, long time. I only use half a spritz otherwise I&#x27;ll be swimming in too much scent.</li>
            <li> I simply love this perfume! I will always recommend it!</li>
            <li> This perfume has a flowery sweet scent that captivated me the firsst time I smelled it on an airplain trip.  Still smells very feminine and the price was GREAT!!!  Will be back to buy again as soon as this bottle finishes.</li>
            <li> For my wife, too big bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll recommend for my friend.&lt;br /&gt;Packing safe, hope price more cheaper, good choice.</li>
            <li> Fragrance itself is a personal thing and I really love the scent, just know in advance that the bottle is uniquely shaped and over 12\\&quot; tall!  The value is fantastic compared to $97 at department stores, but the odd size is tipsy on my shelf.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Fast delivery</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance!!! It has become my daily fragrance this season.  The scent is not overpowering and it lasts through the day.</li>
            <li> This is half the price of what you would find at the airport&#x27;s duty free shops.</li>
            <li> Got a sample when I was in Toronto a couple of months ago, love the smell.  Got it for a birthday present for my daughter.  Will be ordering me my own bottle, which is absolutely lovely....Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Awesome perfume. It smells as luxurious as Chanel No. 5. It sells at Macys for $97.00 big ones--large bottle. So I&#x27;m thinking Amazon.com...but if like Chanel you will also love this baby powder, flowery scent....m.m.m.</li>
            <li> Finally a scent I can wear and found it on Amazon for half the price of Macy&#x27;s !</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume ever!!!!</li>
            <li> best perfume!! it is such a great smell,I get so many compliments on this fragrance. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I do love this perfume! and so do many others!! walking into a room, giving someone a hug, standing in a checkout line, teaching children at Sonshine Club! Installing Wallpaper or Painting! Comments from male and female!  Oh! you smell so nice! what are you wearing? Smiling I say, &amp;#34;Flower by Kenzo&amp;#34;!  this is even at the end of a long day, 8 hours plus from application! i think it&#x27;s gone, but a stranger will smile and ask!  So, after going through 2- 1.7 bottles, i bought the big 3.3 and L*O*V*E it!  My son gifted me with it a few Mother&#x27;s Days ago, it&#x27;s replaced my other scents!  Even people that find perfume somewhat offensive comment how nice it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping even though it had to go ground. excellent price. just what i was expecting. i would order this again if the price remains consistend (56.00)</li>
            <li> My best friend is always talking about perfumes and she gave me the hint that she would like this one but was too expensive for her :S . I bought it to her for Christmas present :D. She really enjoys this fragrance</li>
            <li> I love everything poppy... So I may be a bit biased. The scent is first and foremost very baby powder soft. It is a floral scent - smells of innocence and soft femininity. It&#x27;s a summer scent... Think garden party and white lace summer dresses.</li>
            <li> Smells so good! spray it and let it set it gets better in about an hour.</li>
            <li> Excellent 100% recomended</li>
            <li> It has been my favorite for years</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO EXQUISITO AROMA HERMOSO ENVASE ADEMAS SE PUEDE VOLVER A USAR LO RECOMIENDO TOTALMENTE VOLVER&amp;Iacute;A A COMPRARLO BUEN&amp;Iacute;SIMO .</li>
            <li> All excellent , the product arrived on time, I recommend fully</li>
            <li> This is one of the best floral perfumes to waft its way into my nose in many years. As a man, many florals are sickeningly sweet to me. Not this one. It delivers a not too sweet aroma of...what is it&#x27;s name?... Oh yeah! Flower! A nice clean and fresh wow. The fragrance durability is good too.&lt;br /&gt;Gentlemen, take a note: this was the best received Christmas present this year. You are welcome.</li>
            <li> 5 Star all the way...and then some.  If you really want a romantic evening to kick off the right way...indulge in this item for the wife or girlfriend...</li>
            <li> Once you try this you will keep purchasing!</li>
            <li> Excelente prducto. 100% original</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cologne</li>
            <li> Two BIG issues&lt;br /&gt;1. I have kenzo Flower purchased from a store, and bought this since I will be running out soon... this perfume smells nothing like the kenzo I have.&lt;br /&gt;2. When I looked up how to return, it stated that &amp;#34;flammable or hazardous material can not be returned&amp;#34;!----so I guess I&#x27;m out my money....I will be more careful in the future when ordering from Amazon.  It would have been nice if it would have been made clear that perfume can not be returned when ordering.  So, be forewarned if purchasing perfume, and I&#x27;d try another seller for sure!</li>
            <li> I personally love this fragrance so I purchased it as a Christmas gift for a friend and she loved it as well!  The scent is light, fresh and not overwhelming.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my sister-in-law, and she loves it. She said it&#x27;s the same as department store ones.</li>
            <li> Although the tall bottle turns the perfume some awkward to manipulate and store, it is a very sweet an pleasant fragance.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend loved this perfume bought a smaller version of this a yr  1/2 ago  it was almost empty so when this arrived @ 1/2 the price fo the nrstoms price I was very happy and so is my girlfriend</li>
            <li> Very good!!! Excellent product!!!</li>
            <li> Ever since I got a cardboard sample of Flower when I used to work at the mall, I&#x27;ve been in love with this scent. Having read some negative reviews, I&#x27;ll grant that if you&#x27;re buying this because it&#x27;s called \\&quot;Flower,\\&quot; this isn&#x27;t the scent for you. (Although it does beg the question of why one would order an expensive product like perfume without trying it out in a real store first. Doesn&#x27;t mean you have to buy it there! Save yourself the money next time and try it at somewhere like Sephora, then hit up Amazon for the savings.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, the fact that florals aren&#x27;t dominant in this scent is what I love most about it. I am NOT a perfume person and I find most scents at best cloying and overpowering, and at worst the cause of skin, nose, and eye irritation. I don&#x27;t even use scented lotions or creams! Eau de Toilettes I find somewhat more tolerable, but they fade so quickly they hardly seem worth the money. But Flower just smells clean and fresh (and yes, powdery) without the more obvious notes of citrus that seem to accompany \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; scents. I even get compliments when I wear it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t expect to wear it often, I bought the really small bottle. I&#x27;ve used only about half of it in two years (another downside to EdTs--they don&#x27;t keep their scent over time!), but I still love it. To keep it even more subtle, I usually spray at the nape of the neck or under the neckline of a top rather than on the wrists. It also lasts longer if you spray it somewhere it won&#x27;t rub off or evaporate too quickly.</li>
            <li> just pulled this fragrance out for summer. bought it a year ago last summer. Omg!!! forgot how very sensual this fragrance is and it last a long time. I&#x27;m gonna keep this fragrance out all year long it&#x27;s my signature fragrance and I&#x27;m ordering another bottle so I won&#x27;t run out:)</li>
            <li> Purchased for my mother and she loves it. Darn smell is nice that i may consider purchasing it for myself!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, that means I love the way my girlfriend smells when she uses it. I have to say that I didn&#x27;t buy it because I am a good guesser, I knew before that this fragrance was one of her favorites and also it was a bargain. As an international buyer I am aware that besides the great deals in this kind of products I have to consider all the costs related to shipping and taxes to get it in my country, nevertheless having made all the calculations it as still so much cheaper than buying it here. That was perfectly ok until he moment my courier company sent me an e-mail telling me that this kind of products, along with food and other stuff, has to be carefully revised by our Ministry of Health and Environment, almost like your EPA in the U.S., that meant doing a lot of paperwork, filling some documents, having to pay an additional extra to Customs, etc. That took more than 2 weeks after the day the package arrived to customs, not being able to give the present in my girlfriend&#x27;s birthday and at the end of the day, paying almost exactly the same as if I was going  to buy it in my local Mall. So be careful with every country&#x27;s regulation. Otherwise the product is great.</li>
            <li> Presentaci&amp;oacute;n muy estilizada y elegante, ideal como para regalo, tiene un llora floral muy delicada, lo recomiendo sin ning&amp;uacute;n problema</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and this is one of the best perfumes I have smelled on a lady.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. Soft and feminine yet clean.</li>
            <li> Just love the way this smells! :)  I was looking for a new fragrance and this is a good one!</li>
            <li> my favorite parfum: very feminine and French....</li>
            <li> this fragance it&#x27;s great on wowen. I bought for a gift because I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Smell is off this planet, my girl loves it. Stays on the body for about 36 hours hence a bottle can last over 12 months. Gf still appreciates it and I has boosted things in between the sheets. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> product came in good condition. it got delivered before expected date.&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend love the perfume. i recommend buy</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t read the fine print and didn&#x27;t realize that I would be unable to return this product.  I have been wearing Flowers By Kenzo for the last six years and this doesn&#x27;t smell like it at all...this smells like alcohol...and some other funky mess. I figured that since I love Amazon and had total trust in them, that I would get the authentic purfume...WRONG!!! And I am stuck with it!&lt;br /&gt;Well lesson learned...read the fine print and don&#x27;t order perfume from Amazon.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE PARFUM.  DELIGHTFUL FRAGRANCE.  NOT AN OVERPOWERING, HEADACHE INDUCING SCENT.  SEXY, SMOOTH, AND INTOXICATING. I RECOMMEND THIS FRAGRANCE TO ANYONE!  THANK YOU FOR HAVING IT AVAILABLE AT A VERY REASONABLE PRICE.&lt;br /&gt;JUDY</li>
            <li> Love this cologne,have been using it for years,  bought my first bottle while visiting Paris,France. It was the poppies on the box that first attracted me, the soft scent made it one of my favorites :)</li>
            <li> This is one of the most unique fragrances I have ever had. Its very soothing and pleasant to wear for almost any regular work day or a special occasion !! I am almost in love with it :)</li>

            <li> does the job as expected</li>
            <li> This perfume is so soft but lingers all day.  This is my new favorite and getting so much for so little on Amazon, I can wear all the time.  I even spray my pj&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Smells great, way cheaper than the big make-up stores.</li>
            <li> Very nice perfume its not swett smell like clean and fresh all the time i love it</li>
            <li> I wear this scent each day. Additionally, I wear it to bed every night after a bath. It smells so good. I will forever purchase this fragrance.</li>
            <li> My wife has used Kenzo flowers for years. The perfume I received has the same fragrance. HOWEVER, the perfume doe NOT last.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I can not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excelent perfume, very fast delivery, i&#x27;m recomended this seller, amazing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, smells really great and is lasting, stays on even after showering.</li>
            <li> Big winner at Christmas! Love it!</li>
            <li> I am not sure how to rate this product.  I originally purchased Kenzo Flower in a 3.4 ounce / 100 ml bottle through Amazon and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;received a 3.3 ounce / 100 ml bottle. The shipping was fast and secured, the fragrance is nice, however I was not aware that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this was made in a 3.3 ounce / 100 ml bottle, not sure if the original.  I am still waiting for what I ordered and paid for, Kenzo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flower in a 3.4 ounce bottle.</li>
