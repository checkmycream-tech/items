    <ol>
            <li>and it has the perfect amount of coverage for me.</li>
            <li>It makes it look like I&#x27;m not wearing powder which is awesome, but it provides excellent coverage.</li>
            <li>Provides perfect coverage without looking like makeup and getting caked.</li>
            <li>Best value for the price.</li>
            <li>Excellent!</li>
            <li>This stuff feels so good on your skin!!</li>
            <li>Though this mineral makeup does feel wonderful going on, I just didn&#x27;t like its coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the best Mineral powder that exist</li>
            <li>Goes on great with a off brand brush!  </li>
            <li>I have had perfect strangers come up to me and comment on how beautiful my skin is.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very fair with freckles</li>
            <li>This is very good mineral powder.</li>
            <li>Works really great with revlon 24 hour stay foundation.</li>
            <li>It lasts me about two months as well, so it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li>Great color.</li>
            <li>Great with or without a liquid foundation under.</li>
            <li>Its a great powder, but just pick it up at a conveniency store.</li>
            <li>Covers well and feels great (cools as it goes on).  </li>
            <li>Great product and price</li>
            <li>this has to b the best powder foundation ever i love it</li>
            <li>Hydrates, blends perfectly, evens out my skin tone and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Revlon has good foundations, but this product is just not for me.</li>
            <li>I think this product has been discontinued in the stores around me, but i love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>i use my own brush rather than the one in the lid</li>
            <li>Glad I could buy it here, for a good price and delivered at my door in no time.</li>
            <li>This version contains talc and a kind of glittery quality.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>shade was a nice match, but I had to use much more of it to cover whatever I was trying to hide.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easy, and stays on!</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best product for light, refreshing coverage and a matte finish.</li>
            <li>But I found it is very comfortable when you apply it on face.</li>
            <li>This feels nice, with a kind of cool packaging</li>
            <li>absolutely love this mineral makeup..</li>
            <li>At my age (70), I&#x27;ve tried most mineral makeups, as I prefer them over liquids or creams.</li>
            <li>I love mineral foundation so much more than liquid.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>, I love that it has moisture in it, which most powders don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>My favorite makeup.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the &amp;#34;water-base&amp;#34; feel on my face.</li>
            <li>Feels fantastic on my skin!</li>
            <li>My favorite drugstore mineral brand.</li>
            <li>I love it, just hope Revlon does not discontinue the product like they did with my favorite lipstick.</li>
            <li>But after that, it looks perfect, matches my skin tone (kind of beige light/medium), and really blends well, so it looks natural.</li>
            <li>the powder is the way to go feel soft and covers all the thing I don&#x27;t want people to see on my face feels like nothing is on my face love this great price love amazon</li>
            <li>It was a good price with fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The color matches true!</li>
            <li>so easy to dust on..</li>
            <li>I love the cool, moist feeling when you apply it.  </li>
            <li>I love the cool feeling it has when it goes on.</li>
            <li>So light and discreet, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This came extremely quickly and this is my all time favorite powder.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make pores look huge like some powder foundations.</li>
            <li>Suits my skin color, feels light, and my skin doesn&#x27;t break out.  </li>
            <li>I am somewhat older and many powder collect in wrinkles and make them look deeper, this seems to slide over the top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a unique product that I&#x27;ve never seen before.</li>
            <li>For a 67 year old women--that&#x27;s pretty amazing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application brush in the picture is accurate and isn&#x27;t good for use on big areas.  </li>
            <li>so you have to use a lot if you need full coverage.  </li>
            <li>The glitter is also a minus to me, as I aim to look like having naturally beautiful skin, not a fake \\&quot;glowing\\</li>
            <li>Have tried other minerals, but this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this product out due to all the good reviews and feedback it was receiving.</li>
            <li>I bought it in order to make my whole purchase illegible for free shipping.</li>
            <li>tone but for the summer the &amp;#34;light medium&amp;#34; looked more natural.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Even on a hot summer day, I don&#x27;t need to touch up my face.</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because I liked the packaging, but other thank than I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light that you barely feel it on your face.</li>
            <li>Feels cool and smooth like a velvety liquid foundation but is completely dry!</li>
            <li>This foundation does a good job at covering my slight imperfections while still looking natural.</li>
            <li>I used it on top of the Revlon Whipped Foundation and as soon as I started to put it on it felt really wet.</li>
            <li>But, it really didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>; since this product appears to have been discontinued, it&#x27;s only a matter of time before it&#x27;s not even available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The powder is interesting because it feels wet when you put it on.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised when I first tried this product.</li>
            <li>Every time I use it, it feels kind of strange, because it really gives a feeling of getting your face wet.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite foundation, I always keep a few on hand</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty light coverage; definitely not as &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; as other mineral powders I have used.</li>
            <li>I still have good skin, few wrinkles, and find this makeup preferable to all other mineral makeups.</li>
            <li>The only cautionary note is that you must make sure you tightly close the jar after each use.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t need much of to cover my facial flaws completely.  </li>
            <li>always looks natural and smooths out the lines and patchy skin..</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going out after work, I just blot myself with an oil absorbing sheet and go, but that&#x27;s not even always necessary.</li>
            <li>The powder, although it felt dewy when you first apply on, is dry and cakey.</li>
            <li>I will say that it does feel good going on, you can feel that water-like experience that so many mention, but the coverage was horrible.</li>
            <li>I bought this in because it contains this tiny, soft brush and looks like it will work.</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals or L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not much coverage as it&#x27;s pretty sheer</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally use loose powder, but thought I give it a go with this product.</li>
            <li>but I like that for the summer and spring when it&#x27;s too hot to wear heavy makeup</li>
            <li>Mineral makeup takes a different kind of touch and application from regular powders, and this brush is laughable.  </li>
            <li>The brush is high quality and does leave bristles like other products do.</li>

            <li> It stick on there once your brush is touched to your face, and there is ABSOLUTELY No way you can make it look even.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t wet, it just feels wet.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this in-store, but like some have mentioned, this does feel wet when you apply it on your face.</li>
            <li> It feels like you&#x27;re applying it with a wet brush, but it&#x27;s the powder that&#x27;s the issue.</li>
            <li> It is not dry, and it feels that there are small drops inside the power.</li>
            <li> Other mineral powders I use</li>
            <li> Still was a a little flakey on my dry skin even with coconut water.</li>
            <li> Goes on more like a finishing powder than a mineral base powder.</li>
            <li> Looks like I used a watered down tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really odd.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my everyday makeup.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase makeup in a &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I like that this has a small brush built in.  </li>
            <li> I usually need to touch up at least once a day but have noticed I do not need to when I use this powder.</li>
            <li> Otherwise too thick, wasted product in sink!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe it&#x27;s a powder.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to find a foundation that matches this well.</li>
            <li> I will not go back to reg base</li>
            <li> I know that it&#x27;s supposed to feel hydrating, but to me it was an uncomfortable feeling.</li>
            <li> so I needed to pay in total £11.40 to collect from post office, very expensive !!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really unfortunate that we can&#x27;t find it in Quebec since 1st Q, 2013</li>
            <li> Totally shocked at poor quality.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> absolutely love this mineral makeup.. always looks natural and smooths out the lines and patchy skin.. so easy to dust on..i use my own brush rather than the one in the lid..brilliant!</li>
            <li> At my age (70), I&#x27;ve tried most mineral makeups, as I prefer them over liquids or creams. I still have good skin, few wrinkles, and find this makeup preferable to all other mineral makeups.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing. This powder does not stay on at all. Totally shocked at poor quality. I will say that it does feel good going on, you can feel that water-like experience that so many mention, but the coverage was horrible.</li>
            <li> Goes on more like a finishing powder than a mineral base powder. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this Mineral Makeup to anyone who will listen.  I love the cool, moist feeling when you apply it.  It&#x27;s hard to believe it&#x27;s a powder.  The only cautionary note is that you must make sure you tightly close the jar after each use.  The brush that comes with the makeup is satisfactory and lasts for the duration of the jars supply of makeup. I usually purchase makeup in a &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; tone but for the summer the &amp;#34;light medium&amp;#34; looked more natural.  I have had perfect strangers come up to me and comment on how beautiful my skin is.  For a 67 year old women--that&#x27;s pretty amazing!</li>
            <li> Works really great with revlon 24 hour stay foundation.</li>
            <li> I love mineral foundation so much more than liquid. This stuff doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling like I&#x27;m wearing a mask and it has the perfect amount of coverage for me. This foundation does a good job at covering my slight imperfections while still looking natural. My skin is very fair with freckles so it&#x27;s hard to find a foundation that matches this well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite foundation, I always keep a few on hand so I don&#x27;t run out.  Hydrates, blends perfectly, evens out my skin tone and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product out due to all the good reviews and feedback it was receiving. I went to my local drugstore to pick it up just in case I didn&#x27;t like it it would be easier to return and I&#x27;m glad I did. I used it on top of the Revlon Whipped Foundation and as soon as I started to put it on it felt really wet. I know that it&#x27;s supposed to feel hydrating, but to me it was an uncomfortable feeling. It didn&#x27;t even feel like it was being spread out evenly. I gave it 3 stars because I liked the packaging, but other thank than I didn&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s going back to the store ASAP.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy, and stays on! Even on a hot summer day, I don&#x27;t need to touch up my face. If I&#x27;m going out after work, I just blot myself with an oil absorbing sheet and go, but that&#x27;s not even always necessary. It lasts me about two months as well, so it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> This came extremely quickly and this is my all time favorite powder. It makes it look like I&#x27;m not wearing powder which is awesome, but it provides excellent coverage. Also this stays on all day and my face never looks sweaty/shiny with it on, I love that it has moisture in it, which most powders don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear foundation, but this made me change my mind. So light and discreet, easy to apply. I was so disapointed when I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. Glad I could buy it here, for a good price and delivered at my door in no time.</li>
            <li> My favorite makeup. Provides perfect coverage without looking like makeup and getting caked. It&#x27;s my everyday makeup.</li>
            <li> I never tried this before so I got it and I love it I will not go back to reg base the powder is the way to go feel soft and covers all the thing I don&#x27;t want people to see on my face feels like nothing is on my face love this great price love amazon</li>
            <li> I have re-ordered three times. Great color. This is very sheer so you have to use a lot if you need full coverage.  Stays on for hours too. Best value for the price.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised when I first tried this product. It&#x27;s a powder that once hits your skin, melts into a matte foundation with shimmer. It&#x27;s really a unique product that I&#x27;ve never seen before. The powder has shimmer in it so that the matte quality of it doesn&#x27;t make you look like pancake face. It&#x27;s so light that you barely feel it on your face. There&#x27;s not much coverage as it&#x27;s pretty sheer but I like that for the summer and spring when it&#x27;s too hot to wear heavy makeup anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the brush was a little bigger or extended a little longer but the bristles are so soft! Love it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is very good mineral powder. I love the &amp;#34;water-base&amp;#34; feel on my face. It was a good price with fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Feels fantastic on my skin! Great with or without a liquid foundation under. My favorite drugstore mineral brand.</li>
            <li> Item shipped promptly. However, this item is not what is currently sold in stores. This version contains talc and a kind of glittery quality.&lt;br /&gt;What is currently sold in stores does not include those ingredients. Its a great powder, but just pick it up at a conveniency store.</li>
            <li> Have used this for quite awhile. I obviously like it.</li>
            <li> Postage was short £3 so I needed to pay in total £11.40 to collect from post office, very expensive !!!</li>
            <li> Excellent! As expected</li>
            <li> I think this product has been discontinued in the stores around me, but i love it! I love the cool feeling it has when it goes on. The color matches true! The brush is high quality and does leave bristles like other products do. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I bought this in because it contains this tiny, soft brush and looks like it will work. But, it really didn&#x27;t. The powder, although it felt dewy when you first apply on, is dry and cakey. It stick on there once your brush is touched to your face, and there is ABSOLUTELY No way you can make it look even. The coverage is realy nothing, and on the contrast to conceal it actually makes you look like you have larger pores than you actually do. The glitter is also a minus to me, as I aim to look like having naturally beautiful skin, not a fake \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li> I bought it in order to make my whole purchase illegible for free shipping. But I found it is very comfortable when you apply it on face. It is not dry, and it feels that there are small drops inside the power.</li>
            <li> Have tried other minerals, but this is by far the best.  Covers well and feels great (cools as it goes on).  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use loose powder, but thought I give it a go with this product. Every time I use it, it feels kind of strange, because it really gives a feeling of getting your face wet. But after that, it looks perfect, matches my skin tone (kind of beige light/medium), and really blends well, so it looks natural. Would buy it again!</li>
            <li> Great product and price</li>
            <li> This stuff feels so good on your skin!! A dry powder, but it feels moist going on.</li>
            <li> This feels nice, with a kind of cool packaging but it offers little to no coverage. Looks like I used a watered down tinted moisturizer. Still was a a little flakey on my dry skin even with coconut water. Not for acne coverage at all. Definitely going to return.</li>
            <li> this has to b the best powder foundation ever i love it and yeah, just get it today lovley finish</li>
            <li> Feels cool and smooth like a velvety liquid foundation but is completely dry! Doesn&#x27;t make pores look huge like some powder foundations. Love it!</li>
            <li> Though this mineral makeup does feel wonderful going on, I just didn&#x27;t like its coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application brush in the picture is accurate and isn&#x27;t good for use on big areas.  Mineral makeup takes a different kind of touch and application from regular powders, and this brush is laughable.  There is no possibility for swirling with this brush, and mineral makeup users get my meaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shade was a nice match, but I had to use much more of it to cover whatever I was trying to hide.  Other mineral powders I use, I don&#x27;t need much of to cover my facial flaws completely.  I&#x27;ve tried four different mineral powders, and of them, this one stands out as an underperformer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try Bare Minerals or L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s line of mineral powders instead; since this product appears to have been discontinued, it&#x27;s only a matter of time before it&#x27;s not even available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best product for light, refreshing coverage and a matte finish. I am somewhat older and many powder collect in wrinkles and make them look deeper, this seems to slide over the top. I usually need to touch up at least once a day but have noticed I do not need to when I use this powder. I love it, just hope Revlon does not discontinue the product like they did with my favorite lipstick.</li>
            <li> I like that this has a small brush built in.  The powder is interesting because it feels wet when you put it on.  That&#x27;s the &amp;#34;Aqua&amp;#34; part.  It isn&#x27;t wet, it just feels wet.  I like this makeup.</li>
            <li> No problems with de purchase. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in-store, but like some have mentioned, this does feel wet when you apply it on your face. It&#x27;s really odd. It feels like you&#x27;re applying it with a wet brush, but it&#x27;s the powder that&#x27;s the issue. It&#x27;s pretty light coverage; definitely not as &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; as other mineral powders I have used. Revlon has good foundations, but this product is just not for me.</li>
            <li> What I need, when I needed it.  Suits my skin color, feels light, and my skin doesn&#x27;t break out.  Got a winner.</li>
            <li> This is the best Mineral powder that exist and it&#x27;s really unfortunate that we can&#x27;t find it in Quebec since 1st Q, 2013</li>
            <li> Goes on great with a off brand brush!  Otherwise too thick, wasted product in sink!</li>
