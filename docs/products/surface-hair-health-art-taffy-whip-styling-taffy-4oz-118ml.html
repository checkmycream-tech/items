    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>works quite well, though it isn&#x27;t perfect.</li>
            <li>It is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>once I got rid of that it worked great</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, gives my hair that finished look</li>
            <li>Taffy is a good word to describe it, when you squeeze it out of the tube, it is quite sticky.</li>
            <li>Not as good.</li>
            <li>Much better!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I think this would be an excellent product for someone who needs to control their hair but doesn&#x27;t have much problem with frizz.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised, very happy.  </li>
            <li>Since my old hair gel was taken off the market, this is the best replacement product I have found.  </li>
            <li>If you have fine hair you will love this product!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Upon inspection, I noticed the top of the tube said &amp;#34;10% of profits from this purchase go to support Earth Day 2012&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Salon version had a lot more fibers in the formula</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li>My hair is not any more frizzy than with the previous gel I was using (Deva Curls), but it isn&#x27;t as great as John Frieda&#x27;s Frizzease Hair Serum (I haven&#x27;t found anything that is paraben and phthalate free that is as good).</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s easy with no fess.</li>
            <li>Great product, works better when hair is partially/fully dry.</li>
            <li>and I always enjoy them.  </li>
            <li>I attempt to use products that are paraben and phthalate free, and if its sulfate free, that&#x27;s a bonus.</li>
            <li>The product is paraben free, but it doesn&#x27;t not state that it is phthalate free</li>
            <li>This is the only product that makes my curls happy</li>
            <li>Perfect for adding some texture to short hair while still feeling very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>The product worked ok, it&#x27;s just that this supplier sells old products.  </li>
            <li>Very sticky but having said that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy or anything.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use too much of the product though - only use a little bit at a time and then build up if you need more.</li>
            <li>This is such a fun product to use!  </li>
            <li>My stylist turned me on to this stuff and now I can&#x27;t live with out it!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to be able to order this on amazon vs paying an arm and a leg at my salon, but unfortunately it arrived and when I opened it a bunch of liquid came out.</li>
            <li>The only thing I did not like when I first got it there was a lot of liquid in the tube</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that&#x27;s been colored for years; so most products weigh it down, making it look worse.  </li>
            <li>I like it much better than gel or mouse because my hair does not get hard or crusty.</li>
            <li>(although no phthalates are clearly listed, they often hide under the term &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>My hair still feels soft when I use this</li>
            <li>This is very light-weight, with no odor, yet allows me to style my hair for an entire day.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a little pricey and a little more sticky than the last product I was using.</li>

            <li> Use very little; too much will make your style look greasy.  </li>

            <li> I saw that others used it on dry hair, and I tried that</li>
            <li> I started using this when Pureology got stupid and discontinued &amp;#34;texture twist&amp;#34; after selling out and discontinued it (along with another one of their best-selling products).&lt;br /&gt;This taffy whip is very similar but it&#x27;s better than texture twist.  </li>
            <li> You have to be careful and keep your hands close to your hair.</li>
            <li> I use it after the shower while my hair is still fairly wet.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look wet or crunchy as gels can do (if I apply it while my hair is wet).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it.  </li>
            <li> and I was looking for something other than gel to tame frizz and bring out the curls.</li>
            <li> When putting the whip in my hair, it does tend to leave little spirals floating around.  </li>
            <li> (pulled the curl out, made my hair heavy and greasy-looking).</li>
            <li> I get compliments everyday.</li>
            <li> unfortunately for me I have to send this back :(</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect for adding some texture to short hair while still feeling very lightweight.  My hair still feels soft when I use this and that&#x27;s every day.  I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The only thing I did not like when I first got it there was a lot of liquid in the tube once I got rid of that it worked great</li>
            <li> I like this product but it&#x27;s a little pricey and a little more sticky than the last product I was using.</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair every day to spike the front up. I like it much better than gel or mouse because my hair does not get hard or crusty.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair you will love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m posting this under my husband&#x27;s account. My stylist turned me on to this stuff and now I can&#x27;t live with out it! I have very short and I&#x27;m a mother of 3 so I need some that&#x27;s easy with no fess. This stuff is great, gives my hair that finished look and I&#x27;m out the door!</li>
            <li> Use very little; too much will make your style look greasy.  I like the effect and I especially like the smell.</li>
            <li> I started using this when Pureology got stupid and discontinued &amp;#34;texture twist&amp;#34; after selling out and discontinued it (along with another one of their best-selling products).&lt;br /&gt;This taffy whip is very similar but it&#x27;s better than texture twist.  Much better!  This advise is for anyone who may have been using Pureology&#x27;s texture twist and refuses to be ripped off by people selling texture twist for over $100 now that it&#x27;s no longer being made.  It&#x27;s not worth it.  Use this instead.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that&#x27;s been colored for years; so most products weigh it down, making it look worse.  This is very light-weight, with no odor, yet allows me to style my hair for an entire day.  I was very surprised, very happy.  Been using it for a year now.</li>
            <li> The product worked ok, it&#x27;s just that this supplier sells old products.  Upon inspection, I noticed the top of the tube said &amp;#34;10% of profits from this purchase go to support Earth Day 2012&amp;#34;.  Last I checked, that was two years ago.</li>
            <li> Great product, works better when hair is partially/fully dry.</li>
            <li> Since my old hair gel was taken off the market, this is the best replacement product I have found.  When putting the whip in my hair, it does tend to leave little spirals floating around.  You have to be careful and keep your hands close to your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product! When my hair dresser used it on me, I could wait to buy it. She told me to put some on my palms and clap my hands.  Problem is I think my arms are too short! Anyway, I just rub it between my hands before applying it to my hair. Works wonders. Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> This is such a fun product to use!  I&#x27;ve used several surface products before and I always enjoy them.  It&#x27;s easy to use too much of the product though - only use a little bit at a time and then build up if you need more.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this.  It&#x27;s pretty good.  Very sticky but having said that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy or anything.  I have very thin hair and it works well.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to be able to order this on amazon vs paying an arm and a leg at my salon, but unfortunately it arrived and when I opened it a bunch of liquid came out. I tried to &amp;#34;shake&amp;#34; it up and knead it so that it might re-mix or something but it did NOT work. unfortunately for me I have to send this back :(</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair and I was looking for something other than gel to tame frizz and bring out the curls. I attempt to use products that are paraben and phthalate free, and if its sulfate free, that&#x27;s a bonus. The product is paraben free, but it doesn&#x27;t not state that it is phthalate free (although no phthalates are clearly listed, they often hide under the term &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;This works quite well, though it isn&#x27;t perfect. My hair is not any more frizzy than with the previous gel I was using (Deva Curls), but it isn&#x27;t as great as John Frieda&#x27;s Frizzease Hair Serum (I haven&#x27;t found anything that is paraben and phthalate free that is as good). Taffy is a good word to describe it, when you squeeze it out of the tube, it is quite sticky. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot. I use it after the shower while my hair is still fairly wet. I saw that others used it on dry hair, and I tried that but it didn&#x27;t work well for me (pulled the curl out, made my hair heavy and greasy-looking). It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look wet or crunchy as gels can do (if I apply it while my hair is wet). But I think I will try something else when I finish this.I think this would be an excellent product for someone who needs to control their hair but doesn&#x27;t have much problem with frizz.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the product depicted.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product. Gives an opportunity for different looking styles. I have white hair, and it does not show. I would be lost without it. I get compliments everyday.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that makes my curls happy</li>
            <li> It was a different formula than the tube I purchased in the salon. The scent was the same but the texture was not the same. Not as good. Salon version had a lot more fibers in the formula</li>
    </ol>
