            <li> I had fun coming up with a way to do my nails around these cute pearly bows. They&#x27;re pretty sturdy and surprisingly well made! The curve of the bow didn&#x27;t exactly fit my nail perfectly, so I had to use some extra nail glue, but overall I am very happy with these. They even came before the estimated delivery date. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> These Nail Art bows are just what I was looking for.  I purchased them for my upcoming wedding, so I have not tried them yet.  I don&#x27;t know how well they will stay on, but hopefully they will.</li>
