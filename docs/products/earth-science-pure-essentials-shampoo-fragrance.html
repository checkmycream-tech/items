            <li>IF SO, WHAT IS THE BEST UNSCENTED MOISTURIZING SHAMPOO?</li>
            <li>Best shampoo I ever bought for my hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is the the perfect balance.</li>
            <li>Very good unscented shampoo and body soap.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t bother me at all and works great.</li>
            <li>This one does a great job on both.</li>
            <li>Great Shampoo.</li>
            <li>Works great to.</li>
            <li>A Great shampoo .  </li>
            <li>Works well if you&#x27;re on a safari and trying to avoid mosquitos - unscented and makes hair feel good.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>If it smells good, I&#x27;m probably allergic to it.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m delighted to find a reasonably-priced fragrance-free shampoo that works well.</li>
            <li>Nothing fancy about it--just a good shampoo that cleans your hair and doesn&#x27;t trigger allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product feels good, lathers good, and I had no itching after 2 shampoos without any odor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But again, this shampoo is a good product, so I&#x27;ve rated it 5-stars.</li>
            <li>It was good, did what it supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>* effectively in my hair (I seem to be &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; in terms of how oily my hair is).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo--the best fragrance free one I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>A very effective and yet, very gentle shampoo!  </li>
            <li>Earth Science has no smell that I can detect, and is easy on my skin!</li>
            <li>This product is not the best for my hair, but would probably work great if you just have normal straight hair...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rating it a 3 because some of the shampoo leaked through the top during shipment.</li>
            <li>Now that I am using Earth Science, I don&#x27;t have that problem and am enjoying washing my hair.</li>
            <li>However, I have course curly hair so probably need something more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>so I tried convincing my wife to use it...</li>
            <li>There are better alternatives out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I came across this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love it; need it to for my scratchy head.  </li>
            <li>Love the product; shipment was timely; just what was advertised.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This was the most affordable one I could find.</li>
            <li>I am now making my own fragrance free shampoo bar.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to most fragrances, and this had no fragrance to bother my allergies.  </li>
            <li>Effective, fragrance free shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have been using Earth Science Fragrance Free Shampoo for years, and am a satisfied repeat customer.  </li>
            <li>My wife is allergic to so many things and so after finding this product and it was fragrance free</li>
            <li>and this is a true find!</li>
            <li>The smell is very mild, perhaps a hint on the &amp;#34;chemically&amp;#34; side.</li>
            <li>even the smallest amount, it lathered well and rinsed easily.</li>
            <li>The shampoo was fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall effectiveness is just fine.</li>
            <li>It lathers just fine.</li>
            <li>Love that it is pure with no added fragrance, great for anyone who is sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple product that works great.  </li>
            <li>Not fragrance free.</li>
            <li>The fragrance free shampoo is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the fragrance free version of this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have been using Earth Science Fragrance Free Shampoo of a couple of weeks now</li>
            <li>work in a fragrance free workplace</li>
            <li>I have to be fragrance free for my daughter</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance free and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>I would buy all fragrance free products if I could.</li>
            <li>So I was looking for fragrance free shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>And I often feel like I have to shampoo twice for my hair to feel clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m delighted with this product and will continue to buy it for regular use.</li>
            <li>but this is a true non flowery and non perfumy shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you need fragrance free, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>It is mild but still bothers my allergies and asthma.</li>
            <li>This item satisfied my expectations but why its price is so high?</li>
            <li>- It really is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>Although this is a bit pricier than other good shampoos, the end of itchiness is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cleans very effectively but does not feel harsh.</li>
            <li>This product is unscented, but that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s right about</li>
            <li>I have been hunting for perfume free shampoo for several months, and finally got wise and searched on the computer.  </li>
            <li>With our fragrance allergies this was exactly what we needed and has worked better than Jason or some of the other fragrance free options we have tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I have to tell you that after sooooo many years of unbearably itchy scalp, this shampoo is the ONLY shampoo I will be using for the rest of my life.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This shampoo has two natural fragrances in it so if you need fragrance free this is not for you.</li>
            <li>First I want to say that this product is what it advertises.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would also recommend this product for those who prefer to choose their own perfume, instead of having a roiling mess of conflicting scents.</li>
            <li>and like many people with MCS it is not easy to find a product that truely has no fragrance.</li>
            <li>and it has been hard to find one that doesn&#x27;t smell and that feels good on my hair.  </li>
            <li>If you want conditioning, too, their fragrance free conditioner also works well, with the same benefits.  </li>
            <li>It has no fragrances and cleans hair both gently and well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been working very well</li>
            <li>I really  like this product and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this  to my friends....</li>
            <li>It lathers *very</li>
            <li>It worked well, though I use a bit more than previous products.  </li>
            <li>But each of us has to choose what works for our particular need.</li>
            <li>There is no cure for SD, however, I can manage the symptoms much better now and I am not constantly scratching at my head or having my scalp come up in gross chunks.</li>
            <li>An Amazon product search turned this one up last year; I&#x27;m now using my third bottle, and ordering more.  </li>
            <li>This stuff has no odor or any strong perfume like other shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Cleans very well, my hair is shiny and soft after using.  </li>
            <li>Switched to a fragrance free shampoo/conditioner recently due to chemical allergies.</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo that I am aware of that does not have an ingredient like cocamidopropyl betaine which is a synthetic surfactant derived from coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Like someone else said, every time i think I need to try something else, I always come back to this Earth Science shampoo because it is the only shampoo that leaves my scalp itch-free and my hair clean and shining, and I&#x27;m really old.  </li>
            <li>Admittedly, my sense of smell isn&#x27;t great, but I can smell almost literally nothing when I hold it right up to my nose (and what smell I do get is just a very faint regular shampoo</li>
            <li>I am assuming that fragrance is only part of the issue, that certain chemicals are also making my hair itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was recommended by Paula Bagoun, the Cosmetic Cop, for someone with a sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li>Does not cause any allergic reactions if you are sensitive to smells, perfumes, detergents, dyes etc.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and manageable without a conditioner.</li>
            <li>hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>We ordered this for our elderly parent who has become increasing sensitive to almost all chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Earth Science made my scalp itchier than Free and Clear, and BOTH dried out my hair a lot.  </li>
            <li>I love it in the winter, when hair and scalp is drier than usual!</li>
            <li>I need to get fragrance free products due to my multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS)....</li>
            <li>There is a definite smell to it now, but not something that bothers us, so I believe it&#x27;s still fragrance free, but it smell like other shampoo bases now...</li>
            <li>Gets my hair clean without being harsh, and avoids the perfumes, etc, to which I am sensitive.  </li>
            <li>We highly recommend it for anybody with similar concerns.</li>
            <li>The expected surfactant odor is extremely faint, and the shampoo is concentrated enough that I can get a good lather with a normal amount of product (unlike Whole Foods&#x27; 365 brand.)  </li>
            <li>Fragrance free shampoo is hard to come by and a Godsend to those of us with perfume intolerance.</li>
            <li>As I shampoo, I think it is pretty average.  </li>
            <li>Only took one small squirt to give me all the suds and cleans my hair squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves hear clear but doesn&#x27;t dry it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I ordered this FANTASTIC shampoo from Amazon yet or not (I certainly will soon)</li>

            <li> The main difference is that the shampoo contains the harsh cleanser sodium myreth sulfate, which damages the hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> It does not perform as well as Dove shampoo, for example in that the cleaning does not last as long.</li>
            <li> On my second bottle (lasts a long time) and could not be happier with the product.</li>
            <li> I am a male with short hair working in an office, so I&#x27;m not really dealing with a lot of problems that others often complain about.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy it as long as I have hair!</li>
            <li> Not sure yet if it is a 5.It doesn&#x27;t leave much body but will have it a little longer.</li>
            <li> Just enough suds....only need a little to go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use conditioner and after my hair dried, it had the same feel and manageability as with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have chemical sensitivites and I used Magick Botanicals fragrance free shampoo previously, but it always left me feeling very ill after use.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals that other brands do.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t remember the other fragrance.</li>
            <li> That all being said, there is a slight sent to this product, but it was well within my comfort zone.</li>
            <li> It has a slight soapy scent in the bottle, but nothing that stayed with my hair.  </li>
            <li> Since I didn&#x27;t have any shampoo, I tried a little bit on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want it to go to waste</li>
            <li> I usually buy six at a time to save on shipping.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how moisturizing it is though.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find a shampoo that DOESNT make my scalp itch and DOESNT dry my hair out.  </li>
            <li> Being a little dermatitis-prone, I look for unscented personal products, and shampoo is all but impossible to find at brick-&#x27;n&#x27;-mortars.  </li>
            <li> A little tough for my arthritic hands to push out the stuff.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding a shampoo that does not flare up my scalp and does not have fragrance.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still expensive to keep using every other day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t suffer from dandruff or dermatitis -- it turned out to be a sensitivity to the ridiculous fragrances found in almost every shampoo on the market.</li>
            <li> I have also used the Whole Foods Fragrance-free shampoo, which was a lot cheaper, but had a horrible smell and didn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> Products with fragrance always tend to make it worse.</li>
            <li> My scalp gets really bad if the shampoo is to moisturizing but dries out and gets flaky if it&#x27;s to drying.</li>
            <li> It smells and I got sick like I always do from perfume.</li>
            <li> IM GOING BROKE TRYING THEM!  :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell of this one</li>
            <li> This product is unscented, but that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s right about it.&lt;br /&gt;The listed ingredients are different than what is actually in the bottle. The main difference is that the shampoo contains the harsh cleanser sodium myreth sulfate, which damages the hair and scalp. This was not listed under the ingredients.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was fine. I&#x27;m rating it a 3 because some of the shampoo leaked through the top during shipment.</li>
            <li> I have chemical sensitivites and I used Magick Botanicals fragrance free shampoo previously, but it always left me feeling very ill after use. Now that I am using Earth Science, I don&#x27;t have that problem and am enjoying washing my hair.</li>
            <li> Switched to a fragrance free shampoo/conditioner recently due to chemical allergies. This is a great shampoo--the best fragrance free one I&#x27;ve used so far. I have also used the Whole Foods Fragrance-free shampoo, which was a lot cheaper, but had a horrible smell and didn&#x27;t work that well. Two thumbs up for this one!</li>
            <li> I have been using Earth Science Fragrance Free Shampoo for years, and am a satisfied repeat customer.  It&#x27;s a simple product that works great.  Gets my hair clean without being harsh, and avoids the perfumes, etc, to which I am sensitive.  If you want conditioning, too, their fragrance free conditioner also works well, with the same benefits.  I usually buy six at a time to save on shipping.  I will continue to buy it as long as I have hair!</li>
            <li> Not fragrance free. It smells and I got sick like I always do from perfume. Will send it back if postage is paid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted with this product and will continue to buy it for regular use.</li>
            <li> For those who don&#x27;t need an overpowering smelly shampoo - this is for you. Leaves hear clear but doesn&#x27;t dry it.</li>
            <li> Finally, a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch. For a while now I had been struggling to prevent scalp itchiness. I didn&#x27;t suffer from dandruff or dermatitis -- it turned out to be a sensitivity to the ridiculous fragrances found in almost every shampoo on the market. Although this is a bit pricier than other good shampoos, the end of itchiness is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall effectiveness is just fine. I am a male with short hair working in an office, so I&#x27;m not really dealing with a lot of problems that others often complain about. The smell is very mild, perhaps a hint on the &amp;#34;chemically&amp;#34; side. It&#x27;s not offensive and doesn&#x27;t linger at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I ordered this FANTASTIC shampoo from Amazon yet or not (I certainly will soon) but I have to tell you that after sooooo many years of unbearably itchy scalp, this shampoo is the ONLY shampoo I will be using for the rest of my life.  It was recommended by Paula Bagoun, the Cosmetic Cop, for someone with a sensitive scalp.  I trust anything she recommends and this shampoo is just a life-saver for me.  Like someone else said, every time i think I need to try something else, I always come back to this Earth Science shampoo because it is the only shampoo that leaves my scalp itch-free and my hair clean and shining, and I&#x27;m really old.  I&#x27;m going to buy the gallon of this on Amazon next week.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well, my hair is shiny and soft after using.  Love that it is pure with no added fragrance, great for anyone who is sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> The fragrance free shampoo is fragrance free.  As I shampoo, I think it is pretty average.  It does not perform as well as Dove shampoo, for example in that the cleaning does not last as long.</li>
            <li> I purchased the fragrance free version of this shampoo and conditioner. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals that other brands do. I&#x27;m not sure how moisturizing it is though. And I often feel like I have to shampoo twice for my hair to feel clean. However, I have course curly hair so probably need something more moisturizing. This product is not the best for my hair, but would probably work great if you just have normal straight hair...</li>
            <li> A very effective and yet, very gentle shampoo!  I love it in the winter, when hair and scalp is drier than usual!</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find a shampoo that DOESNT make my scalp itch and DOESNT dry my hair out.  Earth Science made my scalp itchier than Free and Clear, and BOTH dried out my hair a lot.  I loved Shea Moisture due to its leaving my hair unstripped, but it makes my hair itch like crazy. I am assuming that fragrance is only part of the issue, that certain chemicals are also making my hair itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOES ANYONE HAVE THESE 3 ISSUES (scent, chemicals and drying) IF SO, WHAT IS THE BEST UNSCENTED MOISTURIZING SHAMPOO? IM GOING BROKE TRYING THEM!  :(</li>
            <li> Works well if you&#x27;re on a safari and trying to avoid mosquitos - unscented and makes hair feel good. Good product</li>
            <li> I have been using Earth Science Fragrance Free Shampoo of a couple of weeks now and I love it. I need to get fragrance free products due to my multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS)....and like many people with MCS it is not easy to find a product that truely has no fragrance. That all being said, there is a slight sent to this product, but it was well within my comfort zone. Will definitely keep using and reorder.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It has stopped the itching on my head.  I have been hunting for perfume free shampoo for several months, and finally got wise and searched on the computer.  There it was!</li>
            <li> Fragrance free shampoo is hard to come by and a Godsend to those of us with perfume intolerance. This doesn&#x27;t bother me at all and works great. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who just can&#x27;t do scents. If it smells good, I&#x27;m probably allergic to it. So I&#x27;m delighted to find a reasonably-priced fragrance-free shampoo that works well. Nothing fancy about it--just a good shampoo that cleans your hair and doesn&#x27;t trigger allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also recommend this product for those who prefer to choose their own perfume, instead of having a roiling mess of conflicting scents.</li>
            <li> ingredients I can pronounce, works well on my excema on my scalp. Nothing is ever truly without fragrance but this is a true non flowery and non perfumy shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work in a fragrance free workplace and this is a true find!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I have to be fragrance free for my daughter and it has been hard to find one that doesn&#x27;t smell and that feels good on my hair.  This one does a great job on both.</li>
            <li> Very good unscented shampoo and body soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragrance free and that&#x27;s about it. It feel like washing your hair with motor oil. I didn&#x27;t want it to go to waste so I tried convincing my wife to use it... she tried it once and then she told me to stick it. There are better alternatives out there.</li>
            <li> This item satisfied my expectations but why its price is so high?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I came across this on Amazon. With our fragrance allergies this was exactly what we needed and has worked better than Jason or some of the other fragrance free options we have tried.&lt;br /&gt;We have since been buying this from a co-op that we found selling these, but it seems like the formula has been changed. There is a definite smell to it now, but not something that bothers us, so I believe it&#x27;s still fragrance free, but it smell like other shampoo bases now...</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo (along with the conditioner) because my eczema on my neck has been acting up. Products with fragrance always tend to make it worse. Earth Science has no smell that I can detect, and is easy on my skin! It lathers just fine. I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo. Does not cause any allergic reactions if you are sensitive to smells, perfumes, detergents, dyes etc. This stuff has no odor or any strong perfume like other shampoo&#x27;s. Works great to.</li>
            <li> I have fragrance allergies. this product feels good, lathers good, and I had no itching after 2 shampoos without any odor.&lt;br /&gt;delivery was prompt</li>
            <li> I am allergic to coconut and I was looking for a shampoo without any coconut ingredients or derivatives that are used to make shampoo to lather. This is the only shampoo that I am aware of that does not have an ingredient like cocamidopropyl betaine which is a synthetic surfactant derived from coconut oil. There are arguments on the Internet disputing whether ingredients like cocamidopropyl betaine is an allergen. But each of us has to choose what works for our particular need.</li>
            <li> I would buy all fragrance free products if I could. On my second bottle (lasts a long time) and could not be happier with the product.</li>
            <li> I am getting used to it....Not sure yet if it is a 5.It doesn&#x27;t leave much body but will have it a little longer.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has two natural fragrances in it so if you need fragrance free this is not for you. It has Jojoba amd i can&#x27;t remember the other fragrance. It is mild but still bothers my allergies and asthma.</li>
            <li> Love it; need it to for my scratchy head.  A little tough for my arthritic hands to push out the stuff.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and manageable without a conditioner. It also makes hair shine. I would recommend this shampoo to anyone. Even if you don&#x27;t have allergies.</li>
            <li> First I want to say that this product is what it advertises. It has no fragrances and cleans hair both gently and well. I ran out and tried something different. I use Dove Fragrance-Free moisturizing soap. Since I didn&#x27;t have any shampoo, I tried a little bit on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With even the smallest amount, it lathered well and rinsed easily. I don&#x27;t use conditioner and after my hair dried, it had the same feel and manageability as with the shampoo. It&#x27;s been working very well and you can get 8 bars of the soap for around $10. But again, this shampoo is a good product, so I&#x27;ve rated it 5-stars.</li>
            <li> Love the product; shipment was timely; just what was advertised. Would order again. If you need fragrance free, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> A Great shampoo .  Just enough suds....only need a little to go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> The packaging left alot to be desired. I only got 3/4 a bottle because it leaked out.</li>
            <li> I love it! Best shampoo I ever bought for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis and I am allergic to fragrances. I have had a hard time finding a shampoo that does not flare up my scalp and does not have fragrance. My scalp gets really bad if the shampoo is to moisturizing but dries out and gets flaky if it&#x27;s to drying. This shampoo is the the perfect balance. I am so glad I found it. There is no cure for SD, however, I can manage the symptoms much better now and I am not constantly scratching at my head or having my scalp come up in gross chunks.</li>
            <li> We ordered this for our elderly parent who has become increasing sensitive to almost all chemicals.  This shampoo has been a blessing for her.  It works well with no discernable scent. We highly recommend it for anybody with similar concerns.</li>
            <li> Because of my medical problems had to use without any odor. Odors kick off an attack for me.  Only took one small squirt to give me all the suds and cleans my hair squeaky clean. I really  like this product and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this  to my friends....</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Allergys have dissapeared.</li>
            <li> My wife is allergic to so many things and so after finding this product and it was fragrance free it was a hit....</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed eczema and fragrance allergy. So I was looking for fragrance free shampoo/conditioner. This was the most affordable one I could find. It was good, did what it supposed to do. But it&#x27;s still expensive to keep using every other day. I am now making my own fragrance free shampoo bar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to most fragrances, and this had no fragrance to bother my allergies.  It has a slight soapy scent in the bottle, but nothing that stayed with my hair.  It worked well, though I use a bit more than previous products.  Overall: Effective, fragrance free shampoo.</li>
            <li> Being a little dermatitis-prone, I look for unscented personal products, and shampoo is all but impossible to find at brick-&#x27;n&#x27;-mortars.  An Amazon product search turned this one up last year; I&#x27;m now using my third bottle, and ordering more.  The expected surfactant odor is extremely faint, and the shampoo is concentrated enough that I can get a good lather with a normal amount of product (unlike Whole Foods&#x27; 365 brand.)  Thank you, Earth Science.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. I experiment with different products will buy again</li>
            <li> - It really is fragrance free.  Admittedly, my sense of smell isn&#x27;t great, but I can smell almost literally nothing when I hold it right up to my nose (and what smell I do get is just a very faint regular shampoo smell).&lt;br /&gt;- It lathers *very* effectively in my hair (I seem to be &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; in terms of how oily my hair is).&lt;br /&gt;- It cleans very effectively but does not feel harsh.</li>
