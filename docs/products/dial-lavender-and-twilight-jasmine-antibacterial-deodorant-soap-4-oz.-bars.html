            <li> With that being said, my go-to Dial bar that offers antibacterial AND moisturizing qualities has been Dial Aloe Antibacterial bar soap (the green bar).</li>

All the other antibacterial soaps don&#x27;t smell so great. I discovered this soap a few months ago, now you can&#x27;t find it in the stores. Is it really that popular or are yall discontinuing it Dial? Please don&#x27;t, we love it and I am not a body wash kind of gal. Bar soap all the way!</li>

            <li> left my skin feeling clean and refreshed and smooth not like other antibacterial soaps!</li>
            <li> Dial Soap with a particularly pleasant fragrance.  Nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Dial that smells more floral.  Works like a charm.</li>

            <li> Love the smell, the only problem is dries my skin out to much.  Use it every other day instead of daily.  Love that the soap is lavender purple color.</li>

            <li> I am absolute in love with the scent of this soap! It&#x27;s light, and smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Not too girly for us guys, but not a clinical bacteriacide either.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves me feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Love this bar soap.  Can&#x27;t find it in the stores any more.  Either they have quit making it, or everyone else likes it too!</li>
            <li> Love the smell; I’d say it’s more of a feminine product, due to the lavender/floral aspect. I was happily surprised that this did not dry out my skin. I don’t use the white or gold antibacterial Dial bars due to the fact that they either a) dry out my skin, b) leave a heavy residue on the skin, or c) both. With that being said, my go-to Dial bar that offers antibacterial AND moisturizing qualities has been Dial Aloe Antibacterial bar soap (the green bar). For me, the Dial Lavender bars provide the same results as Dial Aloe. I’m glad that I now have two varieties to select from when I want a moisturizing antibacterial bar soap.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I am so disappointed that it is no longer in stores. I use this product daily and  I have no need to use  insect repellent of any kind with daily use of this product. Mosquitoes and other insects absolutely do not like this product!</li>
            <li> a little over priced but really pleased, can&#x27;t seem to find it in any stores anymore.</li>
            <li> It smells WONDERFUL! I especially like the color. Try it for yourself and you will agree that this is a great product!</li>
