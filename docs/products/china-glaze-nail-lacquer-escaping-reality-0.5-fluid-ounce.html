            <li>Another wonderful color from the China Glaze Cirque collection.  </li>
            <li>Not as great of a color pay off as I had hoped</li>
            <li>It is truly a great color for summer time or anytime.</li>
            <li>Great Polish and color for Spring and Summer</li>
            <li>So I am happy with purchase.</li>
            <li>Another great polish from the cirque collection.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful, bright color that I get tons of compliments on.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so bright but still manages not to be obnoxious.</li>
            <li>It is still a gorgeous color.</li>
            <li>Good color</li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>I really love this as on of my summer colors!</li>
            <li>Love this color!  </li>
            <li>I love this color polish, it&#x27;s bright but not neon.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and looks great if you add on whirled away.</li>
            <li>They packaged the product with  bubble wrap in a nice mailer so the bottle did not break.</li>
            <li>I own a ton of pinks but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>as well I love the price</li>
            <li>and it applied a bit streaky, its ok</li>
            <li>Love love love this color.  </li>
            <li>Ok for my toes I guess...</li>
            <li>China Glaze is my favorite brand of nail polish.  </li>
            <li>This is such an exceptionally perfect spring and summer color.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly as an undercoat for Pink Voltage!</li>
            <li>It chips so easily, within 5 minutes of putting on.  </li>
            <li>Does not chip easy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s other brands that make the exact color, but the formula on this was perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge CG fan and when I saw this color on Amazon while ordering another color</li>
            <li>I did not had any problems with the package and it was cheap</li>
            <li>and it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Also, it chips after only a day, even with a good topcoat.  </li>
            <li>The only good thing I can say is the color is very pretty.  </li>
            <li>It is a very nice pink color with lots of shine.  </li>
            <li>Super coral color not the color in the picture.</li>
            <li>But still a very pretty color</li>
            <li>China glaze polishes so far are okay</li>
            <li>But it is a bright almost Hot Pink.</li>
            <li>Have had it on fake nails now for two weeks and has stayed perfectly.</li>
            <li>I think it is really pretty.</li>
            <li>I am pretty dissapointed.</li>
            <li>PRETTY COLOR  FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li>I really like this nail polish</li>
            <li>I got it fairly fast</li>
            <li>So touch-ups were necessary but as with any nail polish natural nails always need touch up after 2 or more days.</li>
            <li>Pretty pink nail polish in china glaze escaping reality easy to apply and drys fast.shinny for days.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the color is beautiful, but the picture was completely misleading.</li>
            <li>but this is just a fabulous pink!</li>
            <li>The bottle was still sealed and brand new.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a deep fuchsia color, but what I received is more of a neon pink color.</li>
            <li>I am not sure I will be able to let it go as summer turns to fall.</li>
            <li>I have enough hot pinks in my collection.</li>
            <li>Needs a top coat though, has a little shine but not enough for that salon done look.</li>
            <li>On natural nails though (where my nail has grown)</li>
            <li>Not as hot pink as I thought.</li>
            <li>I thought this color appeared to be a bit of a pinkish PURPLE, but instead I got a hot pink.</li>
            <li>A very vibrant almost neon pink.  </li>
            <li>However, the color takes three super thin coats to look halfway decent.  </li>
            <li>Rarely do I find a shade I do not LOVE, and they did not disappoint here.</li>

            <li> I love this color polish, it&#x27;s bright but not neon. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s other brands that make the exact color, but the formula on this was perfect. Looks great in two coats and the polish wasn&#x27;t too thick or thin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge CG fan and when I saw this color on Amazon while ordering another color I knew I had to buy it. I was expecting a deep fuchsia color, but what I received is more of a neon pink color. Not quite what I wanted, but that&#x27;s what I get for choosing something based off of what it looks like on a computer screen. Goes on like any other CG polish, like butter. This particular color lasted about a week and a half before chipping.</li>
            <li> I really like this nail polish I got it fairly fast I did not had any problems with the package and it was cheap as well I love the price</li>
            <li> Not as great of a color pay off as I had hoped and it applied a bit streaky, its ok</li>
            <li> Love love love this color.  It is a very nice pink color with lots of shine.  It is truly a great color for summer time or anytime.</li>
            <li> I own a ton of pinks but this one is my favorite. It&#x27;s so bright but still manages not to be obnoxious.</li>
            <li> Wish I could give 0 stars.  The worst polish ever.  The only good thing I can say is the color is very pretty.  It chips so easily, within 5 minutes of putting on.  I would find it flaking off just typing on my keyboard.  Don&#x27;t Buy!  Definitely a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not as hot pink as I thought. Super coral color not the color in the picture. But still a very pretty color and it goes on smooth. Needs a top coat though, has a little shine but not enough for that salon done look. Have had it on fake nails now for two weeks and has stayed perfectly. On natural nails though (where my nail has grown) the nail polish did not adhere at all! It has all since came off and started to come off within a few days. So touch-ups were necessary but as with any nail polish natural nails always need touch up after 2 or more days. They packaged the product with  bubble wrap in a nice mailer so the bottle did not break. The bottle was still sealed and brand new.</li>
            <li> Great Polish and color for Spring and Summer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful, bright color that I get tons of compliments on.  However, the color takes three super thin coats to look halfway decent.  Also, it chips after only a day, even with a good topcoat.  I was disappointed with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be like a florescent magenta color, but to my surprise it was a barbie pink. It is still a gorgeous color.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as bright as pictured. Sorta looks like a color my Grandma would wear. Ok for my toes I guess...</li>
            <li> China Glaze is my favorite brand of nail polish.  Rarely do I find a shade I do not LOVE, and they did not disappoint here.</li>
            <li> I really love this as on of my summer colors! I am not sure I will be able to let it go as summer turns to fall. I might just have to start a trend!</li>
            <li> Love this color!  Works perfectly as an undercoat for Pink Voltage!</li>
            <li> This nail polish was 1/4 way empty and when I shook it there was no clicking noise (no ball shaker noise) indicating that this may not be a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; bottle of polish.  Very disappointed that the color is not as pictured.  This is plain medium pink, not bright pink as pictured. Nail polish is &amp;#34;non-returnable&amp;#34; per Amazon...</li>
            <li> Good color but had to two to three costs on</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  Color is dull not as lush as the pic. FYI not returnable, so I&#x27;m stuck with it...blah.</li>
            <li> Another wonderful color from the China Glaze Cirque collection.  A very vibrant almost neon pink.  This is a definite must have.</li>
            <li> i never receved this nail polish i receved everything else but this one</li>
            <li> PRETTY COLOR  FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li> The color of it is not as Neon as it shown on picture. In fact it is not neon at all. But it is a bright almost Hot Pink. I think it is really pretty. So I am happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Another great polish from the cirque collection. Goes on smooth and looks great if you add on whirled away. Good buy.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with China Glaze!</li>
            <li> Color is different than pictured&lt;br /&gt;But China glaze polishes so far are okay</li>
            <li> This is such an exceptionally perfect spring and summer color. I do prefer red colors but this is just a fabulous pink!</li>
            <li> I am pretty dissapointed. I thought this color appeared to be a bit of a pinkish PURPLE, but instead I got a hot pink. I have enough hot pinks in my collection. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the color is beautiful, but the picture was completely misleading.</li>
            <li> Pretty pink nail polish in china glaze escaping reality easy to apply and drys fast.shinny for days.Does not chip easy</li>
