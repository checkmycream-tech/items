            <li>It makes my neck and decolletage very smooth and supple and helps get rid of my wrinkled neck.</li>
            <li>but I did notice the texture is better</li>

            <li>Seller shipped quick, packed item well and made it an easy sale.</li>
            <li>Texture is so smooth and absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>I personally feel Oil of Olay is just as good.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny</li>
            <li>I would not use any other product on one of the most important organ of my body - my skin!</li>
            <li>Really does work, the price is worth it.</li>

            <li>I kept it try but have not seen real results.  </li>
            <li>This really helps keep the neck tighter.</li>
            <li>Have tried many other products and I can really see the results.  </li>
            <li>am 68 years old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little expensive, but last a long time and is a very good product.</li>
            <li>Overall, waste of money and not even sure if it&#x27;s the real McCoy given the broken seal.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve thrown all other brands of face cream away and only use Arbonne products.</li>

            <li> It was opened when I received it, the protective seal was not secured to the jar.  I kept it try but have not seen real results.  I personally feel Oil of Olay is just as good. Overall, waste of money and not even sure if it&#x27;s the real McCoy given the broken seal.</li>
            <li> I use this on my neck and chest. It takes away all those lines and wrinkles in that area. I gave it 4 stars becuz of the cost. It is worth every penny but - geez!</li>
            <li> Just as I expected - thank you.</li>
            <li> Was very satisfied with the timely manner in which it arrived.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> love it! Have tried many other products and I can really see the results.  A little expensive, but buying my second container!!</li>
            <li> Same excellence as expected</li>
            <li> I have experienced a 50-60% improvement in firming of my neck with this product. However it takes about 30 days to see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I am 68 years old. It does not take the place of a facelift but, it is helpful.</li>
            <li> Great product doesn&#x27;t burn your neck really gentile and moisturizing! Haven&#x27;t noticed wrinkles are less but I did notice the texture is better</li>

            <li> Since discovering Arbonne, I don&#x27;t use any other products. This really helps keep the neck tighter. It&#x27;s not a miracle so it&#x27;s not like surgery, but it definitely helps. I see a huge difference. I&#x27;ve thrown all other brands of face cream away and only use Arbonne products. Organic, safe and they work.</li>
            <li> The best thing I have found  for age and neck.  This is a great buy</li>

            <li> Great product thank you</li>
            <li> I had a lot of sun damage from years of exposure. It&#x27;s amazing how much of a difference this product has made. I have tried numerous other products, but nothing has come close to the results I get from this product.</li>
            <li> Love this. Texture is so smooth and absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> Love the product! Works great!</li>
