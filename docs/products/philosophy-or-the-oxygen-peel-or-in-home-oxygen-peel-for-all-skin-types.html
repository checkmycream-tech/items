            <li>Then you pour warm water in the cup about ½ way and let it sit for a minute.  </li>
            <li>While its drying I mix the oxygen peel gel using warm water.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;Overall love this product.</li>
            <li>I have only used it once, but I liked the results!!</li>
            <li>i think this product would be great, but wasn&#x27;t able to use it becasue the description of it on this website and on phiolosphy&#x27;s website does&#x27;t give you one tiny bit of information.  </li>
            <li>It was an easy 6 step process.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t like strong, acidic treatments</li>
            <li>The foam tingles at first, which I thought was nice because it meant that it was working.</li>
            <li>Does not effect fine</li>
            <li>The Oxygen Peel does brighten and smooth the skin.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that my pores stayed a lot cleaner on my blackhead prone areas and my skin remained blemish free.</li>
            <li>This is one product that is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I am on a mission to take better care of my skin and starting a peel routine was something I thought would be nice for me.  </li>
            <li>Clean the residue off your face&lt;</li>
            <li>I make sure it is purely a gel not watery.</li>
            <li>I will say that this did NOT cause any further breakouts or aggravate my skin at all though, so it would be great for most sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li>the reason i bought this was to clear up my face, so it would have been nice to know this before i am about to apply it to my skin.</li>
            <li>Now saying the I don&#x27;t use the full pill amount.</li>
            <li>What I was looking for was something that would help with the mild breakouts, even out my skin tone, and just create a healthier appearance.  </li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but this time I felt I needed</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind spending money on something that works, but this isn&#x27;t worth $2 or the time it takes to use it.  </li>
            <li>It looks like several people here loved the results, so if you really want to try it</li>
            <li>My skin was so soft and it looked more even in tone.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin with a dry surface and always have some kind of acne going on, although not severe anymore.</li>
            <li>so I wanted to love this, but when I used it again recently, I still didn&#x27;t see a change after using it until it was depleted.</li>
            <li>I just received this for Christmas and used it 2 days ago for the first time.</li>
            <li>I had the peel applied while at the beauty store and just did my first home application.  </li>
            <li>of Philosophy&#x27;s products are fabulous and if you&#x27;re going to go for this, it works well with the Real Purity facial cleanser to use right after the peel, and</li>
            <li>: I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have mildly oily, tan skin with medium size pores and some adult acne.</li>
            <li>The only difference I saw was that my skin was very blotchy and more breakouts than normal appeared, even on my neck, which never happens.  </li>
            <li>I do have to wonder if some of the reviews were sales people or really suggestable people.  </li>
            <li>but it is too much, I end up filling the container to 1/3.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No matter what product you buy or how good it works, there will always be negative reviews.</li>
            <li>even though the original box was not included, all the necessary items were.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend any of Philosophy&#x27;s skin care line.</li>
            <li>This peel really does a great job on removing dead skin and black heads.  </li>
            <li>One thing, a day after the peel my skin looks a little red/blotchy in places but the day after that it&#x27;s stunning</li>
            <li>It does absolutely nothing for your skin as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t cause any itching or burning, on my skin at least.  </li>
            <li>This is a must to use before big days like weddings or fabulous dates, or when getting back from a grubby camping trip.  </li>
            <li>The first thing you do is break open a capsule with powder in it and pour it in this plastic cup that comes with the kit.  </li>
            <li>This peel truly makes your skin brighter and soft as a babies bottom.</li>
            <li>What I appreciate about Philosophy is that they provide products that are tested and do not irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much lighter and younger my skin looks after a peel.  </li>
            <li>but I after using the whole box, I can&#x27;t see any difference (did not get better or worse).</li>
            <li>I worked in high end skin care for about 6 years throughout college, so I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different brands and peels, and philosophy microderm peel is one of my all time faves.</li>
            <li>No peels or red spots so far.  </li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t see anything other than a product that worked really well and instantly.</li>

            <li> I just didn&#x27;t see anything other than a product that worked really well and instantly.</li>
            <li> This is to help with the exfoliating process, and I noticed my skin looked good right afterward, but the next day, my skin looked terrible.    </li>
            <li> I left it on 5 times as long as recommended, and still nothing.</li>
            <li> My first impression of the product was that it was messy to use as the gel would drip and get on the counter or run down my face.  </li>
            <li> So I can see the work the peel does during the process and the effects long after.  </li>
            <li> use a clay mask before to help dry out the oil in my skin, I use a paint brush to apply a clay mask because it makes it apply evenly.</li>
            <li> Once the clay mask is dry I check on the gel.</li>
            <li> Than pat face dry.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the skin, and I have very sensitive skin, yet removes the tired, dead, and darkening follicles.  </li>
            <li> Not sure which one I will try next, but I definitely will not use it again.</li>
            <li> The last step was to take this little stick and wipe the foam off your face like you are shaving.  </li>
            <li> I will admit I was taken back by how few tablets there were in the kit.</li>
            <li> I also noticed my skin being much less oily too, even a few days later.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why some reviewers feel they did not get the same result.  </li>
            <li> This has helped cut down on my break outs and will brighten your face....</li>
            <li> instructions state that you need to fill the container to half</li>
            <li> I use half the pill and half water.  </li>
            <li> I am giving this product one star because it simply didn&#x27;t work for me and made my skin worse.  </li>
            <li> Messy to</li>
            <li> It was a tad messy also to mix it, but that didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I also saw the dead skin and grime that the peel was removing after each scrape.  </li>
            <li> I have used other company&#x27;s products in the past and found them to be too heavily scented or irritating.  </li>
            <li> I tried it 6 times over the past few months!  </li>
            <li> Waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> Im sorry to say this did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> The gel will be almost if not perfect</li>
            <li> Buy it, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I did use this when my acne was at its worst, and it made no difference.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i think this product would be great, but wasn&#x27;t able to use it becasue the description of it on this website and on phiolosphy&#x27;s website does&#x27;t give you one tiny bit of information.  the very last step, the very last sentence says that you shouldn&#x27;t use this product if you are prone to breakouts because this will cause a severe breakout.  the reason i bought this was to clear up my face, so it would have been nice to know this before i am about to apply it to my skin.</li>
            <li> I am on a mission to take better care of my skin and starting a peel routine was something I thought would be nice for me.  This product has good reviews so I thought I would give it a try.  What I was looking for was something that would help with the mild breakouts, even out my skin tone, and just create a healthier appearance.  Although the product doesn&#x27;t advertise that it would help you with acne, it does say it will even out skin tone and give you that glow.  Based on what I read from the reviews from here, I did the peel three days in a row and I even tried it on my neck too.      The first thing you do is break open a capsule with powder in it and pour it in this plastic cup that comes with the kit.  Then you pour warm water in the cup about ½ way and let it sit for a minute.  After a minute, the product forms a gel that you rub on your skin. The next step would be to use this cream and rub it on your face, which creates a foam.  The foam tingles at first, which I thought was nice because it meant that it was working. My first impression of the product was that it was messy to use as the gel would drip and get on the counter or run down my face.  The last step was to take this little stick and wipe the foam off your face like you are shaving.  This is to help with the exfoliating process, and I noticed my skin looked good right afterward, but the next day, my skin looked terrible.    I did this for three days in a row and I waited for about a week before I decided to write this review giving the product time to make a difference.  The only difference I saw was that my skin was very blotchy and more breakouts than normal appeared, even on my neck, which never happens.  I am giving this product one star because it simply didn&#x27;t work for me and made my skin worse.  Not sure which one I will try next, but I definitely will not use it again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to add this to my facial regimen! I was given an oxygen peel at Macys by a Philosphy consultant and was amazed at the instant results. This peel truly makes your skin brighter and soft as a babies bottom. No lie! Buy it, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but this time I felt I needed to so others don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did.  This product did nothing for me.  I don&#x27;t mind spending money on something that works, but this isn&#x27;t worth $2 or the time it takes to use it.  I left it on 5 times as long as recommended, and still nothing. No sensation what so ever, and no difference in my skin.  I tried it 6 times over the past few months!  I do have to wonder if some of the reviews were sales people or really suggestable people.  Waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> Im sorry to say this did nothing for me. I have oily skin with a dry surface and always have some kind of acne going on, although not severe anymore. I did use this when my acne was at its worst, and it made no difference. I love philosophy, and the microdermabrasion peel is absolutely incredible so I wanted to love this, but when I used it again recently, I still didn&#x27;t see a change after using it until it was depleted. I worked in high end skin care for about 6 years throughout college, so I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different brands and peels, and philosophy microderm peel is one of my all time faves. I will say that this did NOT cause any further breakouts or aggravate my skin at all though, so it would be great for most sensitive skin types. It looks like several people here loved the results, so if you really want to try it and you don&#x27;t like strong, acidic treatments, I say go for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best peel I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  I&#x27;m 71 and finish the process at 51.  And my skin feels so silky, like a newborn.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once, but I liked the results!! I love philosophy products</li>
            <li> This is one product that is worth every penny! Gives your face a beautiful glow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: I have super sensitive skin. This product doesn&#x27;t effect my skin at all even if I leave it on for 20 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: This makes my skin glow. If you&#x27;ve ever used the Estee&#x27; Lauder Idealist this makes your skin look like that but from within and for days on end. It does make my pores look smaller. Moisturizes skin. Does not effect fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy again: Yes! This is part of my beauty regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Age: 40</li>
            <li> Bought this product to try after reading good reviews but I after using the whole box, I can&#x27;t see any difference (did not get better or worse). Messy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions state that you need to fill the container to half but it is too much, I end up filling the container to 1/3. Will not repurchase again.</li>
            <li> Good product. I&#x27;m glad that Amazon carries this product.</li>
            <li> I do like it, I think.  No peels or red spots so far.  I did drop some on my limestone counter and had a lighter spot show - so, wash off any drips!</li>
            <li> It did not work for me. I think that the product could have had better instructions. Also the packaging was not as it looked..</li>
            <li> I just received this for Christmas and used it 2 days ago for the first time.I have mildly oily, tan skin with medium size pores and some adult acne. I was very impressed! My skin was so soft and it looked more even in tone. I will admit I was taken back by how few tablets there were in the kit. I cant imagine not having a ton of the cream left. Maybe you can just purchase the tablets? It was a tad messy also to mix it, but that didn&#x27;t bother me. No matter what product you buy or how good it works, there will always be negative reviews. I just didn&#x27;t see anything other than a product that worked really well and instantly. Even my Mom said my skin looked great right after I used the product. I also noticed my skin being much less oily too, even a few days later. Not saying it was do to this, but odds are it was. I&#x27;m impressed and will make this part of my skin regime for sure. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have used Philosophy products for years.  The Oxygen Peel does brighten and smooth the skin.  I also use the Microdelivery Peel, alternating uses.  I am not sure why some reviewers feel they did not get the same result.  I would say follow the directions and you will see results.  I also use their cleanser and moisturizers.  What I appreciate about Philosophy is that they provide products that are tested and do not irritate my sensitive skin.  I have used other company&#x27;s products in the past and found them to be too heavily scented or irritating.  I highly recommend any of Philosophy&#x27;s skin care line.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  It is gentle on the skin, and I have very sensitive skin, yet removes the tired, dead, and darkening follicles.  I can&#x27;t believe how much lighter and younger my skin looks after a peel.  It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t cause any itching or burning, on my skin at least.  This is a must to use before big days like weddings or fabulous dates, or when getting back from a grubby camping trip.  One thing, a day after the peel my skin looks a little red/blotchy in places but the day after that it&#x27;s stunning so if you are indeed purchasing this for a wedding, etc. use it 2 days before the big day or else you might look like a splotchy bride. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Most of Philosophy&#x27;s products are fabulous and if you&#x27;re going to go for this, it works well with the Real Purity facial cleanser to use right after the peel, and then the Hope in a Jar moisturizer after that.</li>
            <li> This peel really does a great job on removing dead skin and black heads.  I had the peel applied while at the beauty store and just did my first home application.  It was an easy 6 step process.&lt;br /&gt;1. Mix the gel&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply the gel&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply the oxygen cream&lt;br /&gt;4. Wait 1-3 minutes while the gel and oxygen cream form a foam&lt;br /&gt;5. Scrape of the foam (tool is included)&lt;br /&gt;6. Clean the residue off your face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the week between having the peel done at the store and redoing it at home I noticed that my pores stayed a lot cleaner on my blackhead prone areas and my skin remained blemish free. When I did it my self I also saw the dead skin and grime that the peel was removing after each scrape.  So I can see the work the peel does during the process and the effects long after.  I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase and will be incorporating it into my weekly regimen.</li>
            <li> this was purchased as a gift. even though the original box was not included, all the necessary items were. great bargain!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the great reviews for this product. It does absolutely nothing for your skin as far as I can tell. I&#x27;ve had better results using a three dollar to St. Ives apricot scrub.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Love Philosophy products!</li>
            <li> I love love this product. I use this 2-3 times a week. Now saying the I don&#x27;t use the full pill amount. I use half the pill and half water.  Now the gel needs to sit for awhile to gel. Here&#x27;s what I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a clay mask before to help dry out the oil in my skin, I use a paint brush to apply a clay mask because it makes it apply evenly. While its drying I mix the oxygen peel gel using warm water.  Once the clay mask is dry I check on the gel. I make sure it is purely a gel not watery. I use a buff puff to wash off the clay mask. Than pat face dry. Than use the oxygen peel. The gel will be almost if not perfect texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask will give a cooling effect that is quite refreshing. This has helped cut down on my break outs and will brighten your face.... Thanks to the peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall love this product.</li>
