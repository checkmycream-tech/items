            <li>but well worth it!</li>
            <li>will have a full review with photos up on my blog soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll be good for a less sophisticated design</li>
            <li>They are beautiful and I can&#x27;t wait to find something new and different to add to my wish list.  </li>
            <li>So for a change I got this one in very pretty colors.</li>
            <li>When applied right they look like you got them done at a special salon.</li>
            <li>I love this new addition to my nail art collection.  </li>
            <li>These are really pretty!</li>
            <li>But most of mine were just the clear plastic with paint on the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and we are having so much fun with all the added bling, not to mention all the compliments.</li>
            <li>Love,they are just the right size.</li>
            <li>I really like the container for my other good quality bows.</li>
            <li>These bows are every pretty in color.</li>
            <li>Came faster than expected and in nice container.</li>
            <li>First of all their not ceramic, they&#x27;re plastic.</li>
            <li>I would prefer if the bows were bended to fit the natural curve of my nail.</li>
            <li>When you try your best to rip one cubby open for one color, you end up ripping several open and bows flying everywhere.</li>
            <li>the shipping was fast, but i ordered flowers from this seller also acrylic, &amp; the flowers were great, but these bows, were smaller than i expected, and they did not look acylic, they looked like plastic...</li>
            <li>exactly what i expected and more</li>
            <li>They may work for someone with large finger tips</li>
            <li>The bow are very cute and fashion forward, just had a little problem getting them to stick to my nails!</li>
            <li>Nice little bows.</li>
            <li>I received these  in about 2-3 weeks, great colors...did not arrived in that neat organizing case like in the picture (arrived in a little plastic bag, all mixed together)</li>
            <li>and everyone wants it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to redo my nails and use them.</li>
            <li>I havent receive the bows and the nail cutter.i would really apreciate if u guys send this items please.</li>
            <li>The came very organized just like the picture.</li>
            <li>a very fashionable&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good secure packaging they come in, but very hard to open.</li>
            <li>Cute bows, very flat on the back</li>
            <li>I cant go wrong great for anything</li>
            <li>Yet, when it lightly falls from a few inches onto hard wood all the cubbies open all at once with ease and bows go flying lol.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave them a 4 star is because the picture makes them out to be larger than what they are, but as for them being nail bows they are super cute and came well before expected!</li>
            <li>They were just like the picture, vivid colors and just the right size not too big and in its container, not dissapointed!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty big</li>
            <li>They got here early.</li>
            <li>my 4 yr old daughter both used them they lasted a couple</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to getting what I actually bought</li>
            <li>they are a bit smaller than the normal bows, but I like that.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected based on the picture and description!</li>
            <li>All of them are clear and with a color painted in the back.</li>
            <li>It came much faster than other nail supply.  </li>
            <li>These bows are very pretty,easy to use,and the rhinestone on the bow adds that little extra bling!</li>

            <li> These bows are very pretty,easy to use,and the rhinestone on the bow adds that little extra bling!</li>
            <li> 3 were larger and were clear with black paint on the back.</li>
            <li> (these have a slight curve to them to make them adaptable to the rounded surface of a finger nail but no round enough for my tiny fingers).</li>
            <li> It is a little bigger than I had plan for, but at least still fit on a finger nail.</li>
            <li> I ordered the big bow last time with stone in center</li>
            <li> They are much smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Did take a long time to get here</li>
            <li> think next time I&#x27;ll spend a little extra money and get the nicer looking bows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only received 2 but not the other two.</li>
            <li> I got 2 different types of black bows.</li>
            <li> They arrived before the earliest expected arrival date.</li>
            <li> Just not what I expected and I will probably not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Got 2 weeks before expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> The other 2 were just black plastic.</li>
            <li> sometimes the case is a little hard to open.</li>
            <li> They have a dip in the back, point of contact is very small.</li>
            <li> A few were missing the center stones and a couple were deformed.</li>
            <li> I was a little upset that I did not receive the item before the guaranteed delivery date, but I contacted the seller and I received the item within a week.</li>
            <li> But missing a couple bows no more than 3 missing.</li>
            <li> but when I try to apply these at the base of my nail (near my cuticle) the edges hang over my skin and it doesn&#x27;t lay down because it&#x27;s too wide and it doesn&#x27;t round out as narrow as my nail does</li>
            <li> they are realy small</li>
            <li> They may break if bumped to hard.</li>
            <li> Little frustrating.</li>
            <li> way to thick to put on your nails.</li>
            <li> I am not happy at all...</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to get the bows to stay on.</li>
            <li> The bows look NOTHING like the picture at all, I can see through them and they are badly made.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sort of disappointed</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The bow are very cute and fashion forward, just had a little problem getting them to stick to my nails!</li>
            <li> I received these  in about 2-3 weeks, great colors...did not arrived in that neat organizing case like in the picture (arrived in a little plastic bag, all mixed together)</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this bow again.  This is alot cheaper than the supply store.  The quality is good too. Thank you.</li>
            <li> junk looks like cracker jack trash</li>
            <li> They were just like the picture, vivid colors and just the right size not too big and in its container, not dissapointed!</li>
            <li> I love how these sit on your nail, and make any style beautiful! The bows are easy t o manage and easy to apply!</li>
            <li> These bows are every pretty in color. They are much smaller than I expected. They may break if bumped to hard.</li>
            <li> They arrived before the earliest expected arrival date. There are 60 bows, 12 colors and 5 of each. I got 2 different types of black bows. 3 were larger and were clear with black paint on the back. The other 2 were just black plastic. From the photos they look to all be colored plastic bows. But most of mine were just the clear plastic with paint on the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sort of disappointed but they are useable and honestly, for the price they&#x27;re worth it. Just not what I expected and I will probably not purchase again. I doubt these will be able to be used again because the nail polish will probably melt the paint off the backs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think next time I&#x27;ll spend a little extra money and get the nicer looking bows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have a full review with photos up on my blog soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hannahsnail11.blogspot.com</li>

            <li> They are so adorable me and my 4 yr old daughter both used them they lasted a couple says but probably because I used 1$ nail glue and I adore the sturdy organizer pill box it came in</li>
            <li> The bows are good quality. I love nail art so I was very happy when I got them it was definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> None of my bows came with the rhinestones</li>
            <li> I love my bows! These bows are very pretty,easy to use,and the rhinestone on the bow adds that little extra bling! Beautiful colors! I can&#x27;t find these bows in the beauty supply stores,mall,or anywhere,so i&#x27;ll definitely be ordering these again</li>
            <li> Thank you for sending on time and I am so very glad that it was what I needed it made it easy for me</li>
            <li> Love,they are just the right size. I ordered the big bow last time with stone in center it&#x27;s pretty big but I love it and everyone wants it. So for a change I got this one in very pretty colors. I&#x27;m ready to redo my nails and use them. Came faster than expected and in nice container. I use with gel polish alway&#x27;s! I recommend them with a 5 star!!</li>
            <li> way to thick to put on your nails. good maybe for art projects not at all good for nail decoration.</li>
            <li> Great form your nails and is absolutely cute :) I will purchase again</li>
            <li> Love it I cant go wrong great for anything , will be buying again soon also telling friends about it</li>
            <li> Very cute but I wish it would have 10 bows in each color. The bows are the size shown too.</li>
            <li> I got this for when I go and get my nails done so I can do something different my daughter can&#x27;t wait until we go would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I did not received this product I actually got flowers instead...I am not happy at all...I was really looking forward to getting what I actually bought</li>
            <li> I was a little upset that I did not receive the item before the guaranteed delivery date, but I contacted the seller and I received the item within a week. The bows are just as described and the case they come in is great. I will definitely recommend this product to any crafter.</li>
            <li> My clients  loved them</li>
            <li> love it! exactly what i expected and more</li>
            <li> the shipping was fast, but i ordered flowers from this seller also acrylic, &amp; the flowers were great, but these bows, were smaller than i expected, and they did not look acylic, they looked like plastic... for the price its fair, but i would like better quality,</li>
            <li> I love they look so good on my nails i recommended to everyone</li>
            <li> First of all their not ceramic, they&#x27;re plastic. But they are okay. They&#x27;ll be good for a less sophisticated design</li>
            <li> The bows are cheaply made. All of them are clear and with a color painted in the back. I really like the container for my other good quality bows. Not buying these again.</li>
            <li> I love this new addition to my nail art collection.  I could not find anything like this in my area anywhere.  I would recommend these to anyone looking to &amp;#34;bling&amp;#34; up their nail art at an affordable price.  I received my items very quickly and am very happy with them. They are beautiful and I can&#x27;t wait to find something new and different to add to my wish list.  I am so happy....</li>
            <li> Just recieved them today finally! Did take a long time to get here but well worth it! They&#x27;re just as the picture shows. Perfect size for my nail beds cant wait to show off my nails!!</li>
            <li> This item arrived on time and in perfect condition. I find it difficult to get the bows to stay on. They have a dip in the back, point of contact is very small. I would prefer if the bows were bended to fit the natural curve of my nail. They are beautiful.</li>
            <li> The bows look NOTHING like the picture at all, I can see through them and they are badly made. Do NOT get these!</li>
            <li> Nice little bows. Exactly what I expected based on the picture and description! I will order again in the future</li>
            <li> Great product. Got 2 weeks before expected delivery date. But missing a couple bows no more than 3 missing. I would use them again.</li>
            <li> These are super cute!! When applied right they look like you got them done at a special salon. However, I have tiny nail beds/fingers and these are too big for my finger nails so I use them on my big toes. They may work for someone with large finger tips but when I try to apply these at the base of my nail (near my cuticle) the edges hang over my skin and it doesn&#x27;t lay down because it&#x27;s too wide and it doesn&#x27;t round out as narrow as my nail does (these have a slight curve to them to make them adaptable to the rounded surface of a finger nail but no round enough for my tiny fingers). Either way I love these and always stare at them. Good secure packaging they come in, but very hard to open. When you try your best to rip one cubby open for one color, you end up ripping several open and bows flying everywhere. Little frustrating. Yet, when it lightly falls from a few inches onto hard wood all the cubbies open all at once with ease and bows go flying lol. Miraculous! Either way I don&#x27;t regret my purchase. These are gorgeous and I love them for my feet.</li>
            <li> Havent receive 2 of the items. I only received 2 but not the other two. I havent receive the bows and the nail cutter.i would really apreciate if u guys send this items please. Thank u</li>
            <li> This seller can ship goods!  It came much faster than other nail supply.  It is a little bigger than I had plan for, but at least still fit on a finger nail.</li>
            <li> These are really pretty! The only reason I gave them a 4 star is because the picture makes them out to be larger than what they are, but as for them being nail bows they are super cute and came well before expected!</li>
            <li> I love doing my nails and getting this nail supply make it better both at home n in the nail salon. I love them and also they look cool to.</li>
            <li> These are to cute. I love them and will order others. Everyone seems to want them so i need more lol</li>
            <li> Loved it! The came very organized just like the picture. The box is really good. Son can reusenit. Colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li> I love my bows they look awesome on my nails gives nails a very fashionable&lt;br /&gt;they also look nice on cellphn covers!!</li>
            <li> The nail bows are very cute. I have just gotten into the nail art for me and my girls and we are having so much fun with all the added bling, not to mention all the compliments.</li>
            <li> these bows are so cute! they are a bit smaller than the normal bows, but I like that. sometimes the case is a little hard to open.</li>
            <li> my friend liked it alot</li>
            <li> Cute and worth every cent.</li>
            <li> A few were missing the center stones and a couple were deformed. But for for most part I am satisfied</li>
