    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li>great product, will be buying again!!</li>
            <li>These whitening strips are great!</li>
            <li>Best of all, I could visibly see results in just 2 days.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed an incredible difference!!  </li>
            <li>It was a wonderful thing to hear.</li>
            <li>Very easy to do!!!!     </li>
            <li>the whitestrips worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sooo glad I didn&#x27;t pay the rediculous price they want in the retailstores!!!</li>
            <li>Crest Whitestrips is an incredible product.  </li>
            <li>People have noticed and that&#x27;s a great feeling.  </li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>and this was always the best rated product of this kind.</li>
            <li>I experienced no pain or sensitivity with these or with the Listerine brand.    </li>
            <li>This product is great</li>
            <li>I was happy with the results, but I was expecting whiter teeth honestly!</li>
            <li>I love my tea and my coffee ... and in 2007 I saw photos of myself on a trip to Hawaii and was freaked out at the appearance of my so called perfect teeth.</li>
            <li>Good teeth whitening product.</li>
            <li>If you are seeking a whitening product, I think Crest Whitestrips Pro are a good, inexpensive way to go...</li>
            <li>If it looks good, people will buy it...</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m on day 7 and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the whitening results.</li>
            <li>I love the way they whiten, without giving me a Brite!White!</li>
            <li>I hope it will work better for you than it did for me!</li>
            <li>and enjoy your wonderful smile after the 10 days !!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m on day 9 its amazing</li>
            <li>In my case there also was some acute gum and nerve discomfort in the beginning.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving the results.  </li>
            <li>Then I rinsed my mouth with lots of warm water and used a tooth brush to get the peroxide off.      </li>
            <li>&quot; kind of a pain as they still slip.</li>
            <li>I own whitening trays, but wanted to try this product and avoid a trip to the dentist to buy their gel.  </li>
            <li>Just use the strips according to your own comfort level and enjoy the whitening!</li>
            <li>First off this Item is splendid.</li>
            <li>The whitening is pretty good, I am satisfied!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I can effectively get 2 full treatments from one box I think these are an amazing value.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s OK though.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with Crest Whitestrips</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>5 days\\&quot; but I have not noticed any whiteness even after the magic 14 days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am glad I bought the product.  </li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve preferred more in-depth instructions, also, but then again I tend to read instruction booklets word for word.</li>
            <li>To avoid any pain or discomfort of your gums make sure the strip starts at the top of your teeth, just where it meets the gum.</li>
            <li>Also for your teeth, make sure to use a sensitivity toothpaste like Sensodyne or Crest Sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was expecting more from these since they&#x27;re the \\&quot;Pro Effects\\&quot; eddition</li>
            <li>and I must say I think those are way better than these.</li>
            <li>By day 3, I figured out how to apply these better so that I no longer have the gum tingling</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used all the strips yet, but have used most of them and do see a noticeable difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I had the type of teeth that all the literature says should be helped the most by a product like this.  </li>
            <li>I would like to emphasize this because most people who claim that this doesn&#x27;t work didn&#x27;t use this system correctly.</li>
            <li>it works, make sure you stick to it</li>
            <li>I think that the trays work better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the whitening from this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m am satisfied with the results that I&#x27;ve gotten.  </li>
            <li>The Crest strips did a better job at whitening (see below)</li>
            <li>I almost returned them but decided to try one more day.    </li>
            <li>I recommend the Pro-Effects strips because they have the most peroxide you can get without a dentist</li>
            <li>and I must say if you&#x27;re a fan of the premium you&#x27;ll definitely love the ADVANCED SEAL!</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>:) You don&#x27;t HAVE to use them for 7-10 days.</li>
            <li>You can also whiten just your top teeth</li>
            <li>(if your bottom teeth don&#x27;t show when you talk or laugh-might look kinda goofy if they do:)</li>
            <li>My gums have gotten burned by the hydrogen peroxide more than once.</li>
            <li>1 hour a day is pretty good for how well it whitened &lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want to whiten your teeth, these get the job done for a pretty good price.</li>
            <li>I finished the 10 day regimen and my teeth are about 85% of what I had hoped, which is pretty good.</li>
            <li>being said, the strips are a great product and if you get them, make sure you buy some toothpaste for sensitive teeth because this product WILL make your teeth feel like they&#x27;re on fire.  </li>
            <li>They are much more user-friendly in that they are easy to apply, stick well on the teeth, and dissolve in your mouth.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with my teeth and no longer self conscious about their appearance!  </li>
            <li>I had my new veneers prepped today and the dentist commented that I had lightened my teeth, that they looked very nice and that the product worked well for me.</li>
            <li>I tried the advanced seal and it was so much better in terms of convenience.</li>
            <li>After years of staining a day or two doesn&#x27;t make much difference and the results are really good.</li>
            <li>They stay on better than the original Crest Whitestrips, but still have a tendency to wander.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll smile more now because you believe that they&#x27;re whiter and people will  perceive an improvement because they see your teeth more often.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Now I just do one a day and take it easy.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use, adhere well, and stay in place.</li>
            <li>I found the product fairly easy to use after a couple of applications.  </li>
            <li>Would strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have nothing against crest, I just think they put more effort into marketing their nice oversized blue plastic box rather than making a better whitening product!</li>
            <li>The reason I purchased this product was the beautiful white smiles of two ladies in my Arthritis Aerobics class.</li>
            <li>Not a bad price though, considering this product is upwards of $40 in most drug stores.</li>
            <li>Before I put even the first day&#x27;s strips on my teeth, I made sure to purchase some Sensodyne toothpaste, and I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>and you should be fine.</li>
            <li>but it was fine.</li>
            <li>Keeping the strips away from your gums makes a huge difference in the pain department.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge coffee/soda drinker</li>
            <li>Anyway, if you&#x27;re looking for a great basic whitening kit, I do suggest this.  </li>
            <li>As much as I&#x27;m impressed by the product, I cannot recommend it based on the packaging waste.</li>
            <li>and so far so good.</li>
            <li>but they seem to work just like the original version.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Plus\\&quot; in the product&#x27;s name seems to refer more to the much higher cost of this</li>
            <li>Within a week, I was getting compliments on what a pretty smile I had, which made me want to smile even more :).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used 5 packs so far and have seen great results, so I can&#x27;t wait!  </li>
            <li>Judging from the overwhelming positive response to this product I am giving it 4 stars.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so many positive things about Crest whitestrips, so I decided to give them a try.  </li>
            <li>but I probably had unrealistically high expectations (my dentist had told me that I simply have darker pigmented teeth than the ideal).  </li>
            <li>I think this is a great product and people shouldn&#x27;t complain whether they spent $20 or $40.</li>
            <li>I used them just as the directions stated and for the full amount of time.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheaper than getting your teeth whitened, and you will have whiter teeth after using them for the full 10 days.</li>
            <li>After a full week of bareing my teeth at myself I wasn&#x27;t at all sure any more just how yellow they were when I started.</li>
            <li>This quickly goes away after ending treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It quickly intensified.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re kind of tricky to put on because they&#x27;re flimsy, so just make sure your teeth are dry, place them right where the gum line meets your teeth, run your tongue over the strip and if you can suck air between your teeth</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, these new 10 day dental whitening strips are pretty amazing for their price.  </li>
            <li>My husband experienced less pain</li>
            <li>I saw results after the first day!  </li>
            <li>This really helped!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the 3rd day of using this product and love it!  </li>
            <li>There is really no need to get trays or Bright Smile unless you want it done faster, and want a freakishly unnatural whiteness about your teeth....</li>
            <li>Anyway, I guess it&#x27;s worth a shot, it may or may not work the way you wish it to.  </li>
            <li>I had such acute pain in my teeth a couple of times within those 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I hear medieval nobleman would gargle with their own urine to produce a whitening effect....</li>
            <li>I rarely felt tooth sensitivity with the walmart brand.     </li>
            <li>Most importantly, these actually work!</li>
            <li>These strips have done wonders for my smile.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth giving these a try.</li>
            <li>and it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already noticed I have a whiter smile</li>
            <li>and my teeth actually look uniform and nice.  </li>
            <li>so MAKE SURE it does NOT go anywhere near gums under silver crows.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a healthy-looking, natural whiteness that gives you more confidence in your smile.  </li>
            <li>, just realize that all it is is three more strips, so when you figure out how much you&#x27;re being charged per strip, you may find you&#x27;re paying considerably more for these per strip than the regular [[ASIN:B000FVU2DY</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth it though.</li>
            <li>i have sensitive teeth so to avoid the possibility of more sensitivity with the whitestrips i applied the strips once a day instead of twice</li>
            <li>it kind of vacuum&#x27;s them on.</li>
            <li>As many will remember, the original advertisement for these strips showed them being used while the female character window-shopped, which showcased the easy-to-use nature of this product.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise the price was right</li>
            <li>I am using it right now.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have a hundred rotting cavities right now.</li>
            <li>30 minutes flies right on by</li>
            <li>this is a pretty nice whiteness system for a short period of time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I will get this product again immediately as I&#x27;m happy with where I am at right now.</li>
            <li>I have to say the results were more apparent at the begining of this process than when I got to the end.</li>
            <li>These work great, much better than a generic brand I tried a few years ago.    </li>
            <li>Now when I smile, I notice my teeth are much brighter and whiter!  </li>
            <li>The walmart brand strips are a little bit thicker but easier to use in my opinion and they stay put, crest says your able to be normal, talk and enjoy life with theirs on... hogwash!!</li>
            <li>This whitening looks VERY natural which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>These made my teeth somewhat whiter, and were pretty inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions and put the strips on (without brushing first) and within the 30 minutes of applying them</li>
            <li>I may try a different brand and see if I get better results.</li>
            <li>I can chew ice and drink hot beverages without pain</li>
            <li>remember trying whitestrips when they first came out</li>
            <li>I think this is has the highest peroxide level of all the versions, so that is most likely my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being curious, price conscious and wanting the best bang for my buck, I bought these crest white strips...</li>
            <li>I only have time to use them once a day, but I am pleased with the results I am getting.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>the girl&#x27;s first response was \\&quot;how</li>
            <li>While trays work a bit faster since the gel can conform to each tooth (and I think the peroxide concentration is higher), Crest Whitestrips work</li>
            <li>I first tried the Listerine strips.</li>
            <li>I was quite skeptical, but I used them 2x a day for just one week before a family wedding and the results were excellent.</li>
            <li>first strip made my teeth hurt all night.</li>
            <li>Most people&#x27;s teeth are slightly yellow, but I drink coffee and brushing just doesn&#x27;t remove the staining.    </li>
            <li>Through perodic use, I have been able to keep my teeth fairly white.</li>
            <li>the first 15 minutes, your gums hurt.</li>
            <li>my teeth are so much whiter!</li>
            <li>At only 22.00 with free shipping if you spend 3.00 more, these are definately worth picking up if your teeth are yellow.</li>
            <li>Btw, I have fairly nice teeth, not bright bright white but not all yellowish either...</li>
            <li>But this product works very well, and I laugh every time I look in the mirror about how much improvement there is.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great product and offers you an inexpensive method for near professional quality whitening.</li>
            <li>They did whiten my teeth, but I also remembered they caused my teeth to be super sensitive.</li>
            <li>My biggest advice would be to make sure to brush well and wipe off your teeth with a dry paper towel before applying the strips.  </li>
            <li>There is a technique but it was easy enough to get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>and I would certainly go through the hassle of it all to conceal the damning evidence my coffee addiction.</li>
            <li>I have used reg. crest white strips, and they worked fine.</li>
            <li>but a little something would have been nice, just enhancement was all I needed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a little improvement in the first 3 days like everyone said, but now that I am nearing the end of the cycle, they look so much better than what I first started.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any burning or stinging, nothing intense anyway</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting fantastic results using the White Strips, but there was a visible improvement after completion of the 10-day program.</li>
            <li>it whiteness your teeth within reasonable price as well time.    </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>But I will finish the whole things anyway.</li>
            <li>It really does whiten.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient (stick &#x27;em on, go about your business)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get too much tooth sensitivity, like some people.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much whiter and brighter</li>
            <li>Just checked walmarts price and buying it on here saves me like 10 bucks, it ships fast.</li>
            <li>but I also didn&#x27;t really see my teeth get that much whiter either.  </li>
            <li>But the strips are very flimsly.  </li>
            <li>so I assumed my teeth were reasonably strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get as much whitening as I hoped</li>
            <li>I think the only way I would whiten my teeth is the cheap way because I can&#x27;t afford 500 bucks.</li>
            <li>Do you really want to know?</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see any changes using this product.</li>
            <li>It has been about a week since I got them and already my teeth look so much whiter.  </li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth much though.    </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I thoroughly enjoy the Crest Premium White Strips!</li>
            <li>I use it to brighten up if I&#x27;m headed out to a night event, I put the strips on while I&#x27;m getting ready.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>If you are going to buy this product than buy the white strips that have the advanced seal.</li>
            <li>I should have used the same old product that I had good experience with, big mistake!</li>
            <li>&#x27;s the thing, instead of rinsing your toothbrush in water before you apply your tooth paste to your brush head, dip it in 3% peroxide (everyday over the counter kind).</li>
            <li>The funny thing is, I used Crest Original white strips in high school</li>
            <li>I recently received a free sample of the new Crest ADVANCED SEAL White Strips...</li>
            <li>Most reviews educated me not to expect a bone, blue, pure, etc., type of white</li>
            <li>I am a non-smoker, but I do drink coffee and red wine frequently, and a bit of yellowness had settled onto my teeth, but now they are a nice shade of pearly white again.  </li>
            <li>My experience previously with  Advanced Seal (more than once) is they would easily adhere for at least  half-an-hour.  </li>
            <li>I used the Classic Strips for 2 weeks as directed.</li>
            <li>cause tooth and gum sensitivity: Never a serious issue for me, but</li>
            <li>These strips gave me mild sensitivity while I was using them, but nothing too severe, and it didn&#x27;t last after I removed the strips.    </li>
            <li>However, for the regular price ($60+), I would try and look for a better deal, as these strips will only whiten your teeth for about 3-4 years.</li>
            <li>Secondly, the strips don&#x27;t always stay in place, so they sometimes require more attention than one would want to devote to such a process.    </li>
            <li>Teeth a super white after using them.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t fall into this parameter, then there   are TONS of other products sold right here on Amazon that will fit your needs, but as far as these Crest Strips, they do what they say they are going to do.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Though these things certainly do what they advertise (the coffee stains on my teeth are nearly gone), they are not as convenient as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Ok, my teeth got a little bit whither.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard for me to tell if these strips did any good (that should say enough), but they also didn&#x27;t stay in place very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much whiter they make your teeth after only a few days.  </li>
            <li>I found that I can&#x27;t do normal activity when I whiten, so I apply the strips, then lay in bed and watch TV or read.  </li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this product for those looking to get a whiter smile.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a celebrity-white smile or anything, but it&#x27;s enough that my yellow stains from coffee and tea are pretty much gone</li>
            <li>White smile.   </li>
            <li>After 7 days, your teeth are pretty much as white as they&#x27;re going to get, and I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference from the additional 3 days.  </li>
            <li>If you have teeth that are ;yellow this product will improve your smile.  </li>
            <li>and yes, you definately experience sensitivity of your teeth as with any new cleaning or bleaching.</li>
            <li>I used the Pro-Effects strips a couple of years ago and am now buying a new box to whiten my teeth again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for a couple of years and decided to try the new \\&quot;Whitestrips Premium PLUS.\\</li>
            <li>I used to think Crest white strips were equal to GoSmile, until I tried the new ADVANCED GoSmile B1.  </li>
            <li>Again, no big deal if you aren&#x27;t in a huge hurry to get a final result.  </li>
            <li>I expected that, so I pretty much apply the strips and go somewhere and be still!</li>
            <li>I will have no idea if these significantly whiten my teeth because it hurts too much to keep them on long enough during each use.    </li>
            <li>but the gum became VERY sensitive, and I ended up getting gum soreness and bleeding.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t expect professionally whitened teeth!</li>
            <li>The only other thing I feel I need to add is that the instructions say it&#x27;s okay to do it twice in one day.</li>
            <li>The strips adhere to your teeth much better than ones used in the past.</li>
            <li>I actually tried the Crest Whitestrips years ago when they first came out and had no results.  </li>
            <li>They made a big difference with my teeth, which I&#x27;d not been able to achieve with other whitening products I&#x27;d tried.  </li>
            <li>The only \\&quot;con\\&quot; of these (hence, 4*) is the flimsiness.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m surprised by that since my teeth are very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>what bothers me most is that the part of my teeth closer to my gums look less white..</li>
            <li>I purchased Crest White Strips on my next vacation (they dont sell them here in Cancun) and I quickly became the girl that everyone asked \\&quot;how</li>
            <li>My teeth are a little dingy and yellowy, so I decided to try a cheap solution.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend the PREMIUM PLUS over the regular whitestrips and without a doubt over other brands like Rembrandt,  etc.</li>
            <li>The pain is incredible bad..</li>
            <li>My teeth are sooooo white now that everyone wants some.</li>
            <li>My teeth do not have a tendency of being sensitive-</li>
            <li>my teeth started getting painfully sensitive.</li>
            <li>Also I had incredibly sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I still use my toothpaste for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I am 21 years old.</li>
            <li>There has been a marked difference in my pearly whites since using these</li>
            <li>it make your teeth/gum sensitive.</li>
            <li>I decided to give these a shot since they were on sale and was pleasantly surprised with the results.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, although I only did it once every day.</li>
            <li>As for the reviews saying that this product makes your teeth sensitive, that hasn&#x27;t happened to me in my complete 10 days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>In addition, I always use a toothpaste for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>From about day three to six, I found my gums and teeth a bit sensitive</li>
            <li>and then my teeth continued to hurt and were extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li>If your teeth aren&#x27;t sensitive you can use them twice a day for faster results.     </li>
            <li>Sent for refund in early November and haven&#x27;t heard a word since</li>
            <li>I now have to go to a dentist to have a professional whitening done to REVERSE the damage done by this product.  </li>
            <li>I do have to warn you that if you have sensitive teeth you will suffer a lot.    </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth.    </li>
            <li>it lasts for two days , where your mouth is sensitive and hurts to eat.</li>
            <li>I only do one 30 minute treatment every other day, and it&#x27;s working fine.  </li>
            <li>The first Crest Strips that came out were tough on the gums and I could only use them every other day, but worked spectacularly!</li>
            <li>refers to the fact that it will last 6 months longer than the original, and you&#x27;re only paying for four extra days of strips.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much using the Listerine strips before the Crest strips contributed to the overall results, or how much whiter they would have been had the first day of Crest strips stayed on my teeth instead of wadding up and being wasted.    </li>
            <li>The strips were easy to use, stayed in place, and only caused as slight amount of tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly the same as the regular [[ASIN:B000FVU2DY</li>
            <li>if you only got the original, two boxes is what you&#x27;d need for it to last as long as \\&quot;plus\\&quot; does, and it would cost you 50 dollars as opposed to 34.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it whitened my teeth as much as I had hoped and as much as the Classic strips have in the past.</li>
            <li>I have used similar product from Crest, the 7 strip (total of 14 with half hour use every day), and had no problem specially it was much cheaper even though I bought it at Walgreens.</li>
            <li>I guess a few lucky people did have this work for them, but I&#x27;d suggest going to a professional instead.</li>
            <li>Have used Crest Advanced Seal in past with satsifactory results.   </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly as described with minimal results.  </li>
            <li>cheaper, less publicized products, which caused too much pain and irritation, which is why I wanted to try the white strips in the first place.  </li>
            <li>Crest can give up to 5 shades whiter, only gave me about three, but the new Gosmile that halle berry uses, gives you up to 10 shades whiter.</li>
            <li>Crest Whitestrips actually work very well, but this version has several issues which would prevent me from buying them again.  </li>
            <li>I actually see whiter upper teeth but lower teeth didn&#x27;t improve much,</li>
            <li>, it was a constant pain in my upper and lower teeth, I&#x27;m really hoping it&#x27;s just temporarily sensativity.</li>
            <li>Why do we need a thick plastic compartment that weights 15 times more than the actual product?</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t see the vivid white teeth others raved about.  </li>
            <li>A month later, I am still surprised at the results when looking in the mirror.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a heavy coffee or tea drinker and brush my teeth regularly, but I still whiten about every 6 mos.</li>
            <li>I did that, and was surprised the next day.</li>
            <li>It actually did lighten my old veneers a bit.  </li>
            <li>Also, this product is not for people with sensitive teeth and it inflammes the inner nerves of your teeth.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re white but not that fake snow white, which is good</li>
            <li>Several hours later my teeth still feel very sensitive, and it is without any exposure to heat/cold.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m not a smoker or a big coffee drinker, my teeth aren&#x27;t yellow, I just wanted a little boost, I really didn&#x27;t notice anything much though.  </li>
            <li>The strip for the upper portion of my mouth stayed on a few seconds longer, before slipping off and becoming useless.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However this new supposedly supper duper product caused severe pain after just one use (2 strips back to back total of 1 hour).</li>
            <li>Followed the 10 day process with ease and saw results within the first few days.  </li>
            <li>Some people complain about the sensitivity during the first few days.</li>
            <li>I see a small improvement but nothing worth being satisified over.</li>
            <li>The first day the strips were wasted because they just slipped around and wadded up in my mouth.</li>
            <li>My first attempt was a few days ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first day, I felt a little tingling in my gum area but saw instant results</li>
            <li>I usually use them right before I get in the shower, and by the time</li>
            <li>My teeth aren&#x27;t super white by any means, but they have gotten at least 2-3 shades whiter.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with this product.  </li>

            <li> These whitening strips are great!</li>
            <li> Best of all, I could visibly see results in just 2 days.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed an incredible difference!!  </li>
            <li> It was a wonderful thing to hear.</li>
            <li> Very easy to do!!!!     </li>
            <li> the whitestrips worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sooo glad I didn&#x27;t pay the rediculous price they want in the retailstores!!!</li>
            <li> Crest Whitestrips is an incredible product.  </li>
            <li> People have noticed and that&#x27;s a great feeling.  </li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> and this was always the best rated product of this kind.</li>
            <li> I experienced no pain or sensitivity with these or with the Listerine brand.    </li>
            <li> This product is great</li>
            <li> I was happy with the results, but I was expecting whiter teeth honestly!</li>
            <li> I love my tea and my coffee ... and in 2007 I saw photos of myself on a trip to Hawaii and was freaked out at the appearance of my so called perfect teeth.</li>
            <li> Good teeth whitening product.</li>
            <li> If you are seeking a whitening product, I think Crest Whitestrips Pro are a good, inexpensive way to go...</li>
            <li> If it looks good, people will buy it...</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m on day 7 and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the whitening results.</li>
            <li> I love the way they whiten, without giving me a Brite!White!</li>
            <li> I hope it will work better for you than it did for me!</li>
            <li> and enjoy your wonderful smile after the 10 days !!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m on day 9 its amazing</li>
            <li> In my case there also was some acute gum and nerve discomfort in the beginning.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving the results.  </li>
            <li> Then I rinsed my mouth with lots of warm water and used a tooth brush to get the peroxide off.      </li>
            <li> &quot; kind of a pain as they still slip.</li>
            <li> I own whitening trays, but wanted to try this product and avoid a trip to the dentist to buy their gel.  </li>
            <li> Just use the strips according to your own comfort level and enjoy the whitening!</li>
            <li> First off this Item is splendid.</li>
            <li> The whitening is pretty good, I am satisfied!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I can effectively get 2 full treatments from one box I think these are an amazing value.  </li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s OK though.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with Crest Whitestrips</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> 5 days\\&quot; but I have not noticed any whiteness even after the magic 14 days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am glad I bought the product.  </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve preferred more in-depth instructions, also, but then again I tend to read instruction booklets word for word.</li>
            <li> To avoid any pain or discomfort of your gums make sure the strip starts at the top of your teeth, just where it meets the gum.</li>
            <li> Also for your teeth, make sure to use a sensitivity toothpaste like Sensodyne or Crest Sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was expecting more from these since they&#x27;re the \\&quot;Pro Effects\\&quot; eddition</li>
            <li> and I must say I think those are way better than these.</li>
            <li> By day 3, I figured out how to apply these better so that I no longer have the gum tingling</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used all the strips yet, but have used most of them and do see a noticeable difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I had the type of teeth that all the literature says should be helped the most by a product like this.  </li>
            <li> I would like to emphasize this because most people who claim that this doesn&#x27;t work didn&#x27;t use this system correctly.</li>
            <li> it works, make sure you stick to it</li>
            <li> I think that the trays work better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the whitening from this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am satisfied with the results that I&#x27;ve gotten.  </li>
            <li> The Crest strips did a better job at whitening (see below)</li>
            <li> I almost returned them but decided to try one more day.    </li>
            <li> I recommend the Pro-Effects strips because they have the most peroxide you can get without a dentist</li>
            <li> and I must say if you&#x27;re a fan of the premium you&#x27;ll definitely love the ADVANCED SEAL!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> :) You don&#x27;t HAVE to use them for 7-10 days.</li>
            <li> You can also whiten just your top teeth</li>
            <li> (if your bottom teeth don&#x27;t show when you talk or laugh-might look kinda goofy if they do:)</li>
            <li> My gums have gotten burned by the hydrogen peroxide more than once.</li>
            <li> 1 hour a day is pretty good for how well it whitened &lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want to whiten your teeth, these get the job done for a pretty good price.</li>
            <li> I finished the 10 day regimen and my teeth are about 85% of what I had hoped, which is pretty good.</li>
            <li> being said, the strips are a great product and if you get them, make sure you buy some toothpaste for sensitive teeth because this product WILL make your teeth feel like they&#x27;re on fire.  </li>
            <li> They are much more user-friendly in that they are easy to apply, stick well on the teeth, and dissolve in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my teeth and no longer self conscious about their appearance!  </li>
            <li> I had my new veneers prepped today and the dentist commented that I had lightened my teeth, that they looked very nice and that the product worked well for me.</li>
            <li> I tried the advanced seal and it was so much better in terms of convenience.</li>
            <li> After years of staining a day or two doesn&#x27;t make much difference and the results are really good.</li>
            <li> They stay on better than the original Crest Whitestrips, but still have a tendency to wander.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll smile more now because you believe that they&#x27;re whiter and people will  perceive an improvement because they see your teeth more often.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Now I just do one a day and take it easy.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use, adhere well, and stay in place.</li>
            <li> I found the product fairly easy to use after a couple of applications.  </li>
            <li> Would strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have nothing against crest, I just think they put more effort into marketing their nice oversized blue plastic box rather than making a better whitening product!</li>
            <li> The reason I purchased this product was the beautiful white smiles of two ladies in my Arthritis Aerobics class.</li>
            <li> Not a bad price though, considering this product is upwards of $40 in most drug stores.</li>
            <li> Before I put even the first day&#x27;s strips on my teeth, I made sure to purchase some Sensodyne toothpaste, and I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> but it was fine.</li>
            <li> Keeping the strips away from your gums makes a huge difference in the pain department.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge coffee/soda drinker</li>
            <li> Anyway, if you&#x27;re looking for a great basic whitening kit, I do suggest this.  </li>
            <li> As much as I&#x27;m impressed by the product, I cannot recommend it based on the packaging waste.</li>
            <li> and so far so good.</li>
            <li> but they seem to work just like the original version.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Plus\\&quot; in the product&#x27;s name seems to refer more to the much higher cost of this</li>
            <li> Within a week, I was getting compliments on what a pretty smile I had, which made me want to smile even more :).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used 5 packs so far and have seen great results, so I can&#x27;t wait!  </li>
            <li> Judging from the overwhelming positive response to this product I am giving it 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many positive things about Crest whitestrips, so I decided to give them a try.  </li>
            <li> but I probably had unrealistically high expectations (my dentist had told me that I simply have darker pigmented teeth than the ideal).  </li>
            <li> I think this is a great product and people shouldn&#x27;t complain whether they spent $20 or $40.</li>
            <li> I used them just as the directions stated and for the full amount of time.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheaper than getting your teeth whitened, and you will have whiter teeth after using them for the full 10 days.</li>
            <li> After a full week of bareing my teeth at myself I wasn&#x27;t at all sure any more just how yellow they were when I started.</li>
            <li> This quickly goes away after ending treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It quickly intensified.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re kind of tricky to put on because they&#x27;re flimsy, so just make sure your teeth are dry, place them right where the gum line meets your teeth, run your tongue over the strip and if you can suck air between your teeth</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, these new 10 day dental whitening strips are pretty amazing for their price.  </li>
            <li> My husband experienced less pain</li>
            <li> I saw results after the first day!  </li>
            <li> This really helped!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the 3rd day of using this product and love it!  </li>
            <li> There is really no need to get trays or Bright Smile unless you want it done faster, and want a freakishly unnatural whiteness about your teeth....</li>
            <li> Anyway, I guess it&#x27;s worth a shot, it may or may not work the way you wish it to.  </li>
            <li> I had such acute pain in my teeth a couple of times within those 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I hear medieval nobleman would gargle with their own urine to produce a whitening effect....</li>
            <li> I rarely felt tooth sensitivity with the walmart brand.     </li>
            <li> Most importantly, these actually work!</li>
            <li> These strips have done wonders for my smile.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth giving these a try.</li>
            <li> and it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already noticed I have a whiter smile</li>
            <li> and my teeth actually look uniform and nice.  </li>
            <li> so MAKE SURE it does NOT go anywhere near gums under silver crows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a healthy-looking, natural whiteness that gives you more confidence in your smile.  </li>
            <li> , just realize that all it is is three more strips, so when you figure out how much you&#x27;re being charged per strip, you may find you&#x27;re paying considerably more for these per strip than the regular [[ASIN:B000FVU2DY</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth it though.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive teeth so to avoid the possibility of more sensitivity with the whitestrips i applied the strips once a day instead of twice</li>
            <li> it kind of vacuum&#x27;s them on.</li>
            <li> As many will remember, the original advertisement for these strips showed them being used while the female character window-shopped, which showcased the easy-to-use nature of this product.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise the price was right</li>
            <li> I am using it right now.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have a hundred rotting cavities right now.</li>
            <li> 30 minutes flies right on by</li>
            <li> this is a pretty nice whiteness system for a short period of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I will get this product again immediately as I&#x27;m happy with where I am at right now.</li>
            <li> I have to say the results were more apparent at the begining of this process than when I got to the end.</li>
            <li> These work great, much better than a generic brand I tried a few years ago.    </li>
            <li> Now when I smile, I notice my teeth are much brighter and whiter!  </li>
            <li> The walmart brand strips are a little bit thicker but easier to use in my opinion and they stay put, crest says your able to be normal, talk and enjoy life with theirs on... hogwash!!</li>
            <li> This whitening looks VERY natural which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> These made my teeth somewhat whiter, and were pretty inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions and put the strips on (without brushing first) and within the 30 minutes of applying them</li>
            <li> I may try a different brand and see if I get better results.</li>
            <li> I can chew ice and drink hot beverages without pain</li>
            <li> remember trying whitestrips when they first came out</li>
            <li> I think this is has the highest peroxide level of all the versions, so that is most likely my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being curious, price conscious and wanting the best bang for my buck, I bought these crest white strips...</li>
            <li> I only have time to use them once a day, but I am pleased with the results I am getting.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> the girl&#x27;s first response was \\&quot;how</li>
            <li> While trays work a bit faster since the gel can conform to each tooth (and I think the peroxide concentration is higher), Crest Whitestrips work</li>
            <li> I first tried the Listerine strips.</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical, but I used them 2x a day for just one week before a family wedding and the results were excellent.</li>
            <li> first strip made my teeth hurt all night.</li>
            <li> Most people&#x27;s teeth are slightly yellow, but I drink coffee and brushing just doesn&#x27;t remove the staining.    </li>
            <li> Through perodic use, I have been able to keep my teeth fairly white.</li>
            <li> the first 15 minutes, your gums hurt.</li>
            <li> my teeth are so much whiter!</li>
            <li> At only 22.00 with free shipping if you spend 3.00 more, these are definately worth picking up if your teeth are yellow.</li>
            <li> Btw, I have fairly nice teeth, not bright bright white but not all yellowish either...</li>
            <li> But this product works very well, and I laugh every time I look in the mirror about how much improvement there is.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great product and offers you an inexpensive method for near professional quality whitening.</li>
            <li> They did whiten my teeth, but I also remembered they caused my teeth to be super sensitive.</li>
            <li> My biggest advice would be to make sure to brush well and wipe off your teeth with a dry paper towel before applying the strips.  </li>
            <li> There is a technique but it was easy enough to get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> and I would certainly go through the hassle of it all to conceal the damning evidence my coffee addiction.</li>
            <li> I have used reg. crest white strips, and they worked fine.</li>
            <li> but a little something would have been nice, just enhancement was all I needed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a little improvement in the first 3 days like everyone said, but now that I am nearing the end of the cycle, they look so much better than what I first started.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any burning or stinging, nothing intense anyway</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting fantastic results using the White Strips, but there was a visible improvement after completion of the 10-day program.</li>
            <li> it whiteness your teeth within reasonable price as well time.    </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> But I will finish the whole things anyway.</li>
            <li> It really does whiten.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient (stick &#x27;em on, go about your business)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get too much tooth sensitivity, like some people.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much whiter and brighter</li>
            <li> Just checked walmarts price and buying it on here saves me like 10 bucks, it ships fast.</li>
            <li> but I also didn&#x27;t really see my teeth get that much whiter either.  </li>
            <li> But the strips are very flimsly.  </li>
            <li> so I assumed my teeth were reasonably strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get as much whitening as I hoped</li>
            <li> I think the only way I would whiten my teeth is the cheap way because I can&#x27;t afford 500 bucks.</li>
            <li> Do you really want to know?</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see any changes using this product.</li>
            <li> It has been about a week since I got them and already my teeth look so much whiter.  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth much though.    </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoy the Crest Premium White Strips!</li>
            <li> I use it to brighten up if I&#x27;m headed out to a night event, I put the strips on while I&#x27;m getting ready.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> If you are going to buy this product than buy the white strips that have the advanced seal.</li>
            <li> I should have used the same old product that I had good experience with, big mistake!</li>
            <li> &#x27;s the thing, instead of rinsing your toothbrush in water before you apply your tooth paste to your brush head, dip it in 3% peroxide (everyday over the counter kind).</li>
            <li> The funny thing is, I used Crest Original white strips in high school</li>
            <li> I recently received a free sample of the new Crest ADVANCED SEAL White Strips...</li>
            <li> Most reviews educated me not to expect a bone, blue, pure, etc., type of white</li>
            <li> I am a non-smoker, but I do drink coffee and red wine frequently, and a bit of yellowness had settled onto my teeth, but now they are a nice shade of pearly white again.  </li>
            <li> My experience previously with  Advanced Seal (more than once) is they would easily adhere for at least  half-an-hour.  </li>
            <li> I used the Classic Strips for 2 weeks as directed.</li>
            <li> cause tooth and gum sensitivity: Never a serious issue for me, but</li>
            <li> These strips gave me mild sensitivity while I was using them, but nothing too severe, and it didn&#x27;t last after I removed the strips.    </li>
            <li> However, for the regular price ($60+), I would try and look for a better deal, as these strips will only whiten your teeth for about 3-4 years.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the strips don&#x27;t always stay in place, so they sometimes require more attention than one would want to devote to such a process.    </li>
            <li> Teeth a super white after using them.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t fall into this parameter, then there   are TONS of other products sold right here on Amazon that will fit your needs, but as far as these Crest Strips, they do what they say they are going to do.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Though these things certainly do what they advertise (the coffee stains on my teeth are nearly gone), they are not as convenient as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Ok, my teeth got a little bit whither.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to tell if these strips did any good (that should say enough), but they also didn&#x27;t stay in place very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much whiter they make your teeth after only a few days.  </li>
            <li> I found that I can&#x27;t do normal activity when I whiten, so I apply the strips, then lay in bed and watch TV or read.  </li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this product for those looking to get a whiter smile.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a celebrity-white smile or anything, but it&#x27;s enough that my yellow stains from coffee and tea are pretty much gone</li>
            <li> White smile.   </li>
            <li> After 7 days, your teeth are pretty much as white as they&#x27;re going to get, and I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference from the additional 3 days.  </li>
            <li> If you have teeth that are ;yellow this product will improve your smile.  </li>
            <li> and yes, you definately experience sensitivity of your teeth as with any new cleaning or bleaching.</li>
            <li> I used the Pro-Effects strips a couple of years ago and am now buying a new box to whiten my teeth again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for a couple of years and decided to try the new \\&quot;Whitestrips Premium PLUS.\\</li>
            <li> I used to think Crest white strips were equal to GoSmile, until I tried the new ADVANCED GoSmile B1.  </li>
            <li> Again, no big deal if you aren&#x27;t in a huge hurry to get a final result.  </li>
            <li> I expected that, so I pretty much apply the strips and go somewhere and be still!</li>
            <li> I will have no idea if these significantly whiten my teeth because it hurts too much to keep them on long enough during each use.    </li>
            <li> but the gum became VERY sensitive, and I ended up getting gum soreness and bleeding.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t expect professionally whitened teeth!</li>
            <li> The only other thing I feel I need to add is that the instructions say it&#x27;s okay to do it twice in one day.</li>
            <li> The strips adhere to your teeth much better than ones used in the past.</li>
            <li> I actually tried the Crest Whitestrips years ago when they first came out and had no results.  </li>
            <li> They made a big difference with my teeth, which I&#x27;d not been able to achieve with other whitening products I&#x27;d tried.  </li>
            <li> The only \\&quot;con\\&quot; of these (hence, 4*) is the flimsiness.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m surprised by that since my teeth are very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> what bothers me most is that the part of my teeth closer to my gums look less white..</li>
            <li> I purchased Crest White Strips on my next vacation (they dont sell them here in Cancun) and I quickly became the girl that everyone asked \\&quot;how</li>
            <li> My teeth are a little dingy and yellowy, so I decided to try a cheap solution.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend the PREMIUM PLUS over the regular whitestrips and without a doubt over other brands like Rembrandt,  etc.</li>
            <li> The pain is incredible bad..</li>
            <li> My teeth are sooooo white now that everyone wants some.</li>
            <li> My teeth do not have a tendency of being sensitive-</li>
            <li> my teeth started getting painfully sensitive.</li>
            <li> Also I had incredibly sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I still use my toothpaste for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I am 21 years old.</li>
            <li> There has been a marked difference in my pearly whites since using these</li>
            <li> it make your teeth/gum sensitive.</li>
            <li> I decided to give these a shot since they were on sale and was pleasantly surprised with the results.  </li>
            <li> Works very well, although I only did it once every day.</li>
            <li> As for the reviews saying that this product makes your teeth sensitive, that hasn&#x27;t happened to me in my complete 10 days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In addition, I always use a toothpaste for sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> From about day three to six, I found my gums and teeth a bit sensitive</li>
            <li> and then my teeth continued to hurt and were extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> If your teeth aren&#x27;t sensitive you can use them twice a day for faster results.     </li>
            <li> Sent for refund in early November and haven&#x27;t heard a word since</li>
            <li> I now have to go to a dentist to have a professional whitening done to REVERSE the damage done by this product.  </li>
            <li> I do have to warn you that if you have sensitive teeth you will suffer a lot.    </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth.    </li>
            <li> it lasts for two days , where your mouth is sensitive and hurts to eat.</li>
            <li> I only do one 30 minute treatment every other day, and it&#x27;s working fine.  </li>
            <li> The first Crest Strips that came out were tough on the gums and I could only use them every other day, but worked spectacularly!</li>
            <li> refers to the fact that it will last 6 months longer than the original, and you&#x27;re only paying for four extra days of strips.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much using the Listerine strips before the Crest strips contributed to the overall results, or how much whiter they would have been had the first day of Crest strips stayed on my teeth instead of wadding up and being wasted.    </li>
            <li> The strips were easy to use, stayed in place, and only caused as slight amount of tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly the same as the regular [[ASIN:B000FVU2DY</li>
            <li> if you only got the original, two boxes is what you&#x27;d need for it to last as long as \\&quot;plus\\&quot; does, and it would cost you 50 dollars as opposed to 34.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it whitened my teeth as much as I had hoped and as much as the Classic strips have in the past.</li>
            <li> I have used similar product from Crest, the 7 strip (total of 14 with half hour use every day), and had no problem specially it was much cheaper even though I bought it at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> I guess a few lucky people did have this work for them, but I&#x27;d suggest going to a professional instead.</li>
            <li> Have used Crest Advanced Seal in past with satsifactory results.   </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly as described with minimal results.  </li>
            <li> cheaper, less publicized products, which caused too much pain and irritation, which is why I wanted to try the white strips in the first place.  </li>
            <li> Crest can give up to 5 shades whiter, only gave me about three, but the new Gosmile that halle berry uses, gives you up to 10 shades whiter.</li>
            <li> Crest Whitestrips actually work very well, but this version has several issues which would prevent me from buying them again.  </li>
            <li> I actually see whiter upper teeth but lower teeth didn&#x27;t improve much,</li>
            <li> , it was a constant pain in my upper and lower teeth, I&#x27;m really hoping it&#x27;s just temporarily sensativity.</li>
            <li> Why do we need a thick plastic compartment that weights 15 times more than the actual product?</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t see the vivid white teeth others raved about.  </li>
            <li> A month later, I am still surprised at the results when looking in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a heavy coffee or tea drinker and brush my teeth regularly, but I still whiten about every 6 mos.</li>
            <li> I did that, and was surprised the next day.</li>
            <li> It actually did lighten my old veneers a bit.  </li>
            <li> Also, this product is not for people with sensitive teeth and it inflammes the inner nerves of your teeth.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re white but not that fake snow white, which is good</li>
            <li> Several hours later my teeth still feel very sensitive, and it is without any exposure to heat/cold.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;m not a smoker or a big coffee drinker, my teeth aren&#x27;t yellow, I just wanted a little boost, I really didn&#x27;t notice anything much though.  </li>
            <li> The strip for the upper portion of my mouth stayed on a few seconds longer, before slipping off and becoming useless.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However this new supposedly supper duper product caused severe pain after just one use (2 strips back to back total of 1 hour).</li>
            <li> Followed the 10 day process with ease and saw results within the first few days.  </li>
            <li> Some people complain about the sensitivity during the first few days.</li>
            <li> I see a small improvement but nothing worth being satisified over.</li>
            <li> The first day the strips were wasted because they just slipped around and wadded up in my mouth.</li>
            <li> My first attempt was a few days ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first day, I felt a little tingling in my gum area but saw instant results</li>
            <li> I usually use them right before I get in the shower, and by the time</li>
            <li> My teeth aren&#x27;t super white by any means, but they have gotten at least 2-3 shades whiter.  </li>
            <li> this accounts for the different experiences and degrees of success or failure of the product.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t get you extremely pearly whites like that from the dentist, but don&#x27;t be too surprised for not spending $500.</li>
            <li> With both trays and this product, I have to whiten every other day because I have extremely sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> The back of the box states \\&quot;Additional Premium Whitestrips for long lasting whitening.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> When you bare your teeth they&#x27;re going to seem whiter than when your mouth is closed.</li>
            <li> how long the results last - the box says 18 months</li>
            <li> The white spots are small, normal and they go away within a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I have always used Crest Whitestrips Classic in the past and they have given me the desired results, but this product was different.</li>
            <li> The biggest pain with these crest strips is that they are very thin, flimsy, they tear very easily and they move all over your teeth even if you press your lips down on them from the outside of your mouth.     </li>
            <li> My only complaint was that after you took the slips off, there was this very goopy stuff (the gel, I know) on the backs of my teeth</li>
            <li> I should have spent the extra money for different ones.</li>
            <li> 15 minutes later, a SHARP pain shot into a nerve in my upper tooth.  </li>
            <li> I only use 1 and save the other one (in the package) for the next day.</li>
            <li> If I had known earlier I would&#x27;ve spent my money on the 3D strips instead.</li>
            <li> I was already using a toothpaste marketed for sensitive teeth as I have had sensitivity for a few years.</li>
            <li> AS LONG AS YOU USE THEM CORRECTLY</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> his product made my teeth so sensitive that i could not eat after a few applications.  </li>
            <li> I used these as directed, and not only did they burn my gums and hurt the nerves in my teeth, they did not really whiten.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth do not attempt to use the strips multiple times a day or worse, back to back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on using 10 of the packs and saving the other 10 packs to use in 9 months because I&#x27;ve already seen enough improvement.  </li>
            <li> i figured, \\&quot;hey, premium must be better right?\\&quot; WRONG! &lt;</li>
            <li> : If you try to dry you teeth before applying, they are easier to place and stay longer before sliding around in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;-May</li>
            <li> my lips became dry, sticky and my teeth hurt for a while after every use, even during the night.</li>
            <li> the reason it is gettin 4 stars is because it was painful on the 3 and 4th day of applying the strips and after the 10 days lower teeth looked yellow and top teeth looked lighter.</li>
            <li> Am happy to report that after four days I can claim it does work and isn&#x27;t too difficult or uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> you are willing to spend an hour a day using them, which can be tough sometimes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to the dentist tomorrow because the silver crown tooth is now slightly loose.</li>
            <li> I applied the strips, and laid down on my bed to watch a show (so that my head would be tilted back and saliva wouldn&#x27;t interfere with the strips).      </li>
            <li> The down side is the discomfort after several consecutive uses.</li>
            <li> my teeth are still sensitive to cold or hot food.</li>
            <li> I lay back slightly</li>
            <li> Not only is the box 3x bigger than it needs to be, but it&#x27;s double-walled plastic, doubling the waste!    </li>
            <li> My friends and family have noticed my much whiter teeth which were a bit yellow after heavy coffee drinking over the past few years.</li>
            <li> I hardly saw a difference after using these crest strips, every single time I used the walmart strips, I saw white and about 2-3 white spots on my teeth immediately after every use.</li>
            <li> It dries it out a little and actually makes it easier to adhere to your teeth.</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase them again in a few months and see if there is further improvement!    </li>
            <li> This evening I finally got the upper strip to stay on, but it has bunched up near my back teeth and is uncomfortable!  </li>
            <li> Several people complained that they thought getting 3 extra strips for the extra $$ was pointless, or led them to give this product fewer stars.</li>
            <li> Unlike Crest Whitestrips I&#x27;ve used in the past, these are very flimsy and hard to handle and to apply to the teeth.</li>
            <li> If you want great results in less than 2 weeks with little to no effort BUY NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Maybe these are  not good for people with sensitive teeth (which I thought I had)</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for the past 3 years and it keeps my teeth white.  </li>
            <li> They were difficult to place exactly on the theeth.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works, but be careful!</li>
            <li> Sometimes the strips will get out of place due to the saliva that is produced by having them on.</li>
            <li> If I use them again I&#x27;ll probably do every other day or every three days rather than follow the directions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first strip (lower portion) didn&#x27;t stay on and got all twisted up...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other whitening products...</li>
            <li> I recommend to anyone who wishes to use this whitener to use it every other day.</li>
            <li> It was very painful to apply them today, the peroxide burned my gums very much to the point where they turned white near my teeth.</li>
            <li> If your teeth are crooked, the strips might still work if you press hard to apply them to teeth out of alignment.     </li>
            <li> The pain last all day, so eat slowly and try not to eat hot or cold stuff..    </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and also a partial that contains a fake tooth</li>
            <li> These are less cumbersome than the trays and gel provided by the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I found that I did have sensitivity and started taking a Tylenol or two about half an hour before whitening, like you do when taking kids for shots.  </li>
            <li> You will feel pain and its not true that you can talk while you have the strips on.</li>
            <li> I toughed it out though, and the pain wore down after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Although it hurts my gun a little bit</li>
            <li> well if you don&#x27;t mind taking a little longer to get the result you want.  </li>
            <li> Instead, they created small white dots on my teeth that look absolutely ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s hope the pain dies down, because they seem to be working!</li>
            <li> I would say this product is made for people with an average to small sized mouth, straighter teeth and little sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I do not have \\&quot;chiclet\\&quot; teeth, that blue white luminous shade that, frankly, looks artificial but my teeth are cleaner and whiter than before.  </li>
            <li> I started using these a few months ago</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason why curiousity killed the cat...</li>
            <li> You MUST where these twice a day everyday for the allotted time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this product twice everyday, but instead I use this once everyday.</li>
            <li> However, despite these few annoyances, this product does work well</li>
            <li> I bought this because I assumed that means there are a few additional strips in addition to the 40 listed on the front of the box.  </li>
            <li> With today&#x27;s economy I can&#x27;t understand how anyone would want to waste their money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that my lips dried out while I used the strips</li>
            <li> Use it and after a few months use it again.</li>
            <li> The whitestrips are paper thin, yet the box the come in is enormous.  </li>
            <li> Pat them in firmly with your finger.</li>
            <li> Results did in fact show, but i had to discontinue after a few days</li>
            <li> May require two units (ie two packages) for heavily stained teeth</li>
            <li> Give it a few days and then reapply.</li>
            <li> It was not a huge issue for me</li>
            <li> What was wrong with the simple paper box the other version of Whitestrips used?</li>
            <li> The strips are two different sizes, one for your upper teeth; one for the lower, but the one for your lower teeth was fatter (it should have been longer) and merely covered behind my teeth too</li>
            <li> like I have been in the past.</li>
            <li> so not sure if that is a factor, but</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> This is a follow up review because I&#x27;ve reviewed them before based on using Whitestrips in the past.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small thing</li>
            <li> But this second set slid off my teeth and twisted up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just stick to Rembrandt products, as those have worked for me in the past.</li>
            <li> it was extremely painful, and my pink gum burned, melted and turned into white gum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen results very quickly with this product, but I&#x27;m disgusted at the packaging that Crest uses.</li>
            <li> It whitened, which is what it advertises, and I hardly felt any sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find a product that makes any difference at all.</li>
            <li> I also bought some Sensodyne ProNamel toothpaste and brush for one minute after removing the strips and my teeth have had very little sensitivity!  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these to anyone wanting to avoid the expensive process of going to the dentist to get your teeth whitened!</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I have read reviews of people with serious pain from the product, those seem to be the exception.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that the product would work, but I read lots of reviews and decided to go with it.  </li>
            <li> but it was still bad enough that he didn&#x27;t finish using them either.</li>
            <li> The heavy plastic container them came in is absurd.</li>
            <li> Unless you have mega tough bad-ass teeth, I recommend you try a milder tooth whitening</li>
            <li> BAD IDEA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and after the first use, after just five minutes, I felt a horrible sharp pain in one of my teeth.</li>
            <li> and yes there is a little sensitivity to cold drinks immediately after using them.</li>
            <li> and I still noticed dramatic results.</li>
            <li> I can tell you that I&#x27;m not impressed!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about how they say you will see results within 3 days.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I find the \\&quot;strips\\</li>
            <li> Well, I bought the expensive version of the Whitestrips,</li>
            <li> it became useless.  </li>
            <li> fake whitening.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical about trying any tooth whitener, but decided to try this one after reading reviews.  </li>
            <li> I anxiously checked after a couple of days to see any hints of whiteness  but finding none I reassured myself with things like, \\&quot;hey stupid</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have probably noted, the chemical used does sometimes burn gums; while it isn&#x27;t terribly painful, it is somewhat annoying.  </li>
            <li> At its worst the pain was excruciating for the half hour that these were on my teeth</li>
            <li> my teeth were sensitve to cold during use.  </li>
            <li> They slipped around and made it awkward to speak with family (who said I sounded like I had a lisp).</li>
            <li> but I found them inconvenient to apply, wear and remove.</li>
            <li> but it is not that bad.</li>
            <li> I guess my tooth enamel is in really bad shape or something.</li>
            <li> Could be a bad batch, but I&#x27;m not going to risk again  on Crest&#x27;s quality control.</li>
            <li> I just get frustrated because they do not stay in place.  </li>
            <li> And if they don&#x27;t adhere, they&#x27;re worthless.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know that terrible achy/sharp/electrified pain fell under that category.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with this product.  They are slippery, compared to the newer ones, these slip all over the place.  Anyway, I&#x27;m not a smoker or a big coffee drinker, my teeth aren&#x27;t yellow, I just wanted a little boost, I really didn&#x27;t notice anything much though.  I used them just as the directions stated and for the full amount of time.  I just didn&#x27;t see the vivid white teeth others raved about.  They&#x27;re white but not that fake snow white, which is good I guess, but a little something would have been nice, just enhancement was all I needed.  I didn&#x27;t notice any burning or stinging, nothing intense anyway, I&#x27;m surprised by that since my teeth are very sensitive.  Anyway, I guess it&#x27;s worth a shot, it may or may not work the way you wish it to.  For the price, it&#x27;s OK though.</li>
            <li> I am on day 6 of the 10 days. I am noticing a difference and yes there is a little sensitivity to cold drinks immediately after using them. Otherwise the price was right and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Followed the 10 day process with ease and saw results within the first few days.  A month later, I am still surprised at the results when looking in the mirror.  The strips were easy to use, stayed in place, and only caused as slight amount of tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting fantastic results using the White Strips, but there was a visible improvement after completion of the 10-day program. I plan to purchase them again in a few months and see if there is further improvement!    So, don&#x27;t expect a miracle, but follow the instructions closely and you&#x27;ll see gradual results.</li>
            <li> Bought this item because it&#x27;s on sale.  Have been using this product for the past 3 years and it keeps my teeth white.  Good teeth whitening product.</li>
            <li> this is a pretty nice whiteness system for a short period of time. it whiteness your teeth within reasonable price as well time.    Thanks.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with Crest Whitestrips like I have been in the past. I&#x27;m not a heavy coffee or tea drinker and brush my teeth regularly, but I still whiten about every 6 mos. or so because I like my teeth white for picture-taking and interviewing. I have always used Crest Whitestrips Classic in the past and they have given me the desired results, but this product was different. I don&#x27;t think it whitened my teeth as much as I had hoped and as much as the Classic strips have in the past. Not a bad price though, considering this product is upwards of $40 in most drug stores.</li>
            <li> I am using it right now. It is the fifth day and my teeth are all white. But I will finish the whole things anyway. I love it. Although it hurts my gun a little bit but it is not that bad.</li>
            <li> I used the Classic Strips for 2 weeks as directed. I anxiously checked after a couple of days to see any hints of whiteness  but finding none I reassured myself with things like, \\&quot;hey stupid you, it&#x27;s only been 2 days!\\&quot;. After a full week of bareing my teeth at myself I wasn&#x27;t at all sure any more just how yellow they were when I started. Most reviews educated me not to expect a bone, blue, pure, etc., type of white so I guess I was looking for something almost white or not quite so yellow. Only dreamers, it seems, would wait in vain for actual WHITE teeth. The company makes the statement \\&quot;noticeable whiteness after 5 days\\&quot; but I have not noticed any whiteness even after the magic 14 days. But I can&#x27;t remember how yellow they were when I started, a phenomenon that the marketing department is banking on. When you bare your teeth they&#x27;re going to seem whiter than when your mouth is closed. You&#x27;ll smile more now because you believe that they&#x27;re whiter and people will  perceive an improvement because they see your teeth more often. The trace amount of bleach in the strips would never work on a shirt stain. Maybe it&#x27;s an illusion or maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> I used to think Crest white strips were equal to GoSmile, until I tried the new ADVANCED GoSmile B1.  Crest can give up to 5 shades whiter, only gave me about three, but the new Gosmile that halle berry uses, gives you up to 10 shades whiter. My teeth are sooooo white now that everyone wants some. It&#x27;s cheapest at [...]</li>
            <li> I like a couple of things about this product: &lt;br /&gt;1. It really does whiten. &lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s very convenient (stick &#x27;em on, go about your business) &lt;br /&gt;3. 1 hour a day is pretty good for how well it whitened &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am glad I bought the product.  It whitened, which is what it advertises, and I hardly felt any sensitivity.  My only complaint was that after you took the slips off, there was this very goopy stuff (the gel, I know) on the backs of my teeth and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should spit it out, or leave it on.  I would&#x27;ve preferred more in-depth instructions, also, but then again I tend to read instruction booklets word for word.</li>
            <li> I started using these a few months ago and yes, you definately experience sensitivity of your teeth as with any new cleaning or bleaching. To avoid any pain or discomfort of your gums make sure the strip starts at the top of your teeth, just where it meets the gum. Keeping the strips away from your gums makes a huge difference in the pain department. Also for your teeth, make sure to use a sensitivity toothpaste like Sensodyne or Crest Sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also didn&#x27;t use the strips as often as recommended. I only used them once a day and I still noticed dramatic results. I have to say the results were more apparent at the begining of this process than when I got to the end. All in all I think this is a great product and people shouldn&#x27;t complain whether they spent $20 or $40. It still is a heck of a lot cheaper than Zoom whitening which costs $400 and you still get the same results. Try these!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get too much tooth sensitivity, like some people.  These made my teeth somewhat whiter, and were pretty inexpensive.  I will probably try another set soon, though.</li>
            <li> The reason I purchased this product was the beautiful white smiles of two ladies in my Arthritis Aerobics class. After years of coffee and tea drinking, I definitely had a brownish cast to my teeth and deep browning on the tips of my teeth. I can&#x27;t believe how much whiter and brighter my teeth are now. I am getting a kit for my husband. I did have some sensitivity so I would skip a day. After years of staining a day or two doesn&#x27;t make much difference and the results are really good.</li>
            <li> Just checked walmarts price and buying it on here saves me like 10 bucks, it ships fast. Ive only used them for a day and I already see a difference, I recommend everyone to alteast try it!! great product, will be buying again!!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use. I think my teeth change color when I use it 3 times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to try these again after using them several years ago. They did whiten my teeth, but I also remembered they caused my teeth to be super sensitive. My teeth do not have a tendency of being sensitive- unless I try to bite into ice cream; I cannot do that without feeling it. Before I put even the first day&#x27;s strips on my teeth, I made sure to purchase some Sensodyne toothpaste, and I am so glad that I did. I followed the directions and put the strips on (without brushing first) and within the 30 minutes of applying them my teeth started getting painfully sensitive. I had such acute pain in my teeth a couple of times within those 30 minutes. Several hours later my teeth still feel very sensitive, and it is without any exposure to heat/cold. These will whiten your teeth, but you will definitely feel it.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both can see a noticeable difference after using the product. It won&#x27;t get them politician/movie star white! For that you will need to pay $600 at a whitening or dentists office. It will take them however a shade or two whiter. Also I had incredibly sensitive teeth and I need to take 3 day breaks in between whitening in order to not have blinding an shooting pain in my teeth. If you have sensitive teeth do not attempt to use the strips multiple times a day or worse, back to back!</li>
            <li> Some people complain about the sensitivity during the first few days. In my case there also was some acute gum and nerve discomfort in the beginning. I hung in there and by day 4 it never came back. Now I&#x27;m on day 7 and am very pleased with the results. A noticable, whiter difference. Would strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> If you want to whiten your teeth, these get the job done for a pretty good price. I was happy with the results, but I was expecting whiter teeth honestly! But they did take a lot of yellow out and I suppose if I wanted to go back and do the kit again, I&#x27;d get closer what I was looking for.  Anyway, if you&#x27;re looking for a great basic whitening kit, I do suggest this.  But don&#x27;t expect professionally whitened teeth!</li>
            <li> I was expecting more from these since they&#x27;re the \\&quot;Pro Effects\\&quot; eddition but they seem to work just like the original version. I see a small improvement but nothing worth being satisified over. I got a sample of the 3D Whitestrips and I must say I think those are way better than these. If I had known earlier I would&#x27;ve spent my money on the 3D strips instead.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and also a partial that contains a fake tooth so I was hesitant to try these.  The first day, I felt a little tingling in my gum area but saw instant results so I decided to stick with it.  By day 3, I figured out how to apply these better so that I no longer have the gum tingling and I&#x27;m loving the results.  People have noticed and that&#x27;s a great feeling.  I still use my toothpaste for sensitive teeth so not sure if that is a factor, but the teeth sensitivity that people have talked about have never been a problem for me.  I&#x27;m a huge coffee/soda drinker so I&#x27;m not sure how long the results last - the box says 18 months so I will have to come back and review that later.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any pain but I also didn&#x27;t really see my teeth get that much whiter either.  I followed the instructions exactly as described with minimal results.  Oh well, I only paid around $15 so no big deal.  I may try a different brand and see if I get better results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just finished the 10 day treatment.  The solution works well.  But the strips are very flimsly.  (Thus the four star rating).    They were difficult to place exactly on the theeth.  And were proned to shift during the treatment time.   I believe that I may not have gotten the maximum benefit of the treatment because of the difficulty of placing the strips.        I plan to use a whitening treatment annually.  But the next time I will select a product that uses disposable whitening trays.</li>
            <li> Works great. I did some research online and this was always the best rated product of this kind. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I am 21 years old. My teeth are a little dingy and yellowy, so I decided to try a cheap solution. BAD IDEA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and after the first use, after just five minutes, I felt a horrible sharp pain in one of my teeth. The box warns against \\&quot;tooth sensitivity\\&quot;. I didn&#x27;t know that terrible achy/sharp/electrified pain fell under that category. My teeth still hurt. I feel like I have a hundred rotting cavities right now. I guess my tooth enamel is in really bad shape or something. I can chew ice and drink hot beverages without pain so I assumed my teeth were reasonably strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not for everyone. Unless you have mega tough bad-ass teeth, I recommend you try a milder tooth whitening option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember trying whitestrips when they first came out and they didn&#x27;t cause me pain. I think this is has the highest peroxide level of all the versions, so that is most likely my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely not risking the pain again with this genre of DIY Dentistry. I hear medieval nobleman would gargle with their own urine to produce a whitening effect....mmmm....urine.......I wonder if it qualifies for Amazon Prime?</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that the product would work, but I read lots of reviews and decided to go with it.  The strips DO work-provided you are willing to spend an hour a day using them, which can be tough sometimes.  I haven&#x27;t used all the strips yet, but have used most of them and do see a noticeable difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  I am a non-smoker, but I do drink coffee and red wine frequently, and a bit of yellowness had settled onto my teeth, but now they are a nice shade of pearly white again.  If you are seeking a whitening product, I think Crest Whitestrips Pro are a good, inexpensive way to go... and they work!</li>
            <li> I am currently nearing the end of my second use of Crest Whitetrips.  They work as advertised.  If you follow the directions and use the product twice daily for ten days, your teeth get whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawbacks:&lt;br /&gt;-Difficult to apply and keep in place for 30 minutes: If you try to dry you teeth before applying, they are easier to place and stay longer before sliding around in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;-May cause tooth and gum sensitivity: Never a serious issue for me, but my teeth were sensitve to cold during use.  This quickly goes away after ending treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I have read reviews of people with serious pain from the product, those seem to be the exception.  Overall, this is a great product and offers you an inexpensive method for near professional quality whitening.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, but be careful! it actually burned my gum. it was extremely painful, and my pink gum burned, melted and turned into white gum.</li>
            <li> I used this product as described (although once I did have to \\&quot;catch up\\&quot; on my days and had to do 3 \\&quot;sessions\\&quot; in one day instead of 2).  I do believe that my teeth got whiter.  I had the type of teeth that all the literature says should be helped the most by a product like this.  I didn&#x27;t get as much whitening as I hoped but I probably had unrealistically high expectations (my dentist had told me that I simply have darker pigmented teeth than the ideal).  I would recommend this product and will probably try it again in the future.</li>
            <li> I will have no idea if these significantly whiten my teeth because it hurts too much to keep them on long enough during each use.    I applied the strips, and laid down on my bed to watch a show (so that my head would be tilted back and saliva wouldn&#x27;t interfere with the strips).      15 minutes later, a SHARP pain shot into a nerve in my upper tooth.  I ran into the bathroom and immediately removed the strips.  Then I rinsed my mouth with lots of warm water and used a tooth brush to get the peroxide off.      I have been a coffee drinker for 5 years, so there is some yellowness to my teeth.    The funny thing is, I used Crest Original white strips in high school and they didn&#x27;t bother my teeth like this.  Maybe when I get up enough courage, I might look into some strips that have a lower concentration of peroxide and possibly get some Sensodyne.  I think the only way I would whiten my teeth is the cheap way because I can&#x27;t afford 500 bucks.</li>
            <li> Crest Whitestrips actually work very well, but this version has several issues which would prevent me from buying them again.  Unlike Crest Whitestrips I&#x27;ve used in the past, these are very flimsy and hard to handle and to apply to the teeth. One on, they are too slippery and flimsy to stay in place well.  The heavy plastic container them came in is absurd. Why do we need a thick plastic compartment that weights 15 times more than the actual product? Am I going to save it to keep my valuables in? What was wrong with the simple paper box the other version of Whitestrips used?</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason why curiousity killed the cat... I read all the reviews on all these crest whitening products prior to my purchase... Being curious, price conscious and wanting the best bang for my buck, I bought these crest white strips... I can tell you that I&#x27;m not impressed! Prior to purchasing these, I have used the equate Walmart brand in the blue and white box, 56 strips I think and they run about $18.00, so I have something to compare.    1. The biggest pain with these crest strips is that they are very thin, flimsy, they tear very easily and they move all over your teeth even if you press your lips down on them from the outside of your mouth.     2. I hardly saw a difference after using these crest strips, every single time I used the walmart strips, I saw white and about 2-3 white spots on my teeth immediately after every use. The white spots are small, normal and they go away within a short amount of time. Btw, I have fairly nice teeth, not bright bright white but not all yellowish either... Maybe a 6-7 out of 10 whiteness.    3. With these crest strips my lips became dry, sticky and my teeth hurt for a while after every use, even during the night. I rarely felt tooth sensitivity with the walmart brand.     All in all, they are both suppose to do the same thing... Whiten teeth! The walmart brand strips are a little bit thicker but easier to use in my opinion and they stay put, crest says your able to be normal, talk and enjoy life with theirs on... hogwash!! When I put on any whitening strips, I&#x27;m at home watching TV or on the computer and the last thing I want to do is have a conversation with someone! 30 minutes flies right on by and then I do another 30. I have nothing against crest, I just think they put more effort into marketing their nice oversized blue plastic box rather than making a better whitening product! If it looks good, people will buy it... That&#x27;s Corporate America! I&#x27;m sooo glad I didn&#x27;t pay the rediculous price they want in the retailstores!!! I will not be buying these again. Hope this info helps...</li>
            <li> These work great, much better than a generic brand I tried a few years ago.    I was already using a toothpaste marketed for sensitive teeth as I have had sensitivity for a few years. These strips gave me mild sensitivity while I was using them, but nothing too severe, and it didn&#x27;t last after I removed the strips.    I only have time to use them once a day, but I am pleased with the results I am getting.</li>
            <li> I keep hearing about these causing pain, I keep hearing about these causing burning, discomfort, stinging ect. Well, I have not had one ounce of pain or suffering using these! Maybe these are  not good for people with sensitive teeth (which I thought I had) but I have not had any pain. People have issues with these sliding all over the place, but since this is not a tray  I expected that, so I pretty much apply the strips and go somewhere and be still! Actually, I get on the internet for an hour or so and before I know it, it&#x27;s time to take the stips  out! The whitening is pretty good, I am satisfied! Everybody has different sized teeth, various size mouths and differing sensitivity to pain, thus the wide-range of reviews on this  product. I would say this product is made for people with an average to small sized mouth, straighter teeth and little sensitivity. If you don&#x27;t fall into this parameter, then there   are TONS of other products sold right here on Amazon that will fit your needs, but as far as these Crest Strips, they do what they say they are going to do.</li>
            <li> These Crest Whitestrips actually worked, and the featured review for this product hits the nail on the head. The only other thing I feel I need to add is that the instructions say it&#x27;s okay to do it twice in one day. I did that, and was surprised the next day. I wouldn&#x27;t say that my teeth were \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; as the box warned, but I felt like my teeth were actually sore. Not a big deal though. Now I just do one a day and take it easy.</li>
            <li> I purchased these during a sale of some sort for under $20. These strips work wonders on your teeth **AS LONG AS YOU USE THEM CORRECTLY** I would like to emphasize this because most people who claim that this doesn&#x27;t work didn&#x27;t use this system correctly. You MUST where these twice a day everyday for the allotted time. There has been a marked difference in my pearly whites since using these and I have received several compliments over my teeth. This works, but only if you take the time to use it correctly. However, for the regular price ($60+), I would try and look for a better deal, as these strips will only whiten your teeth for about 3-4 years.</li>
            <li> Do you really want to know? Ok, my teeth got a little bit whither. From 1 to 10, 5 I would Say. You will feel pain and its not true that you can talk while you have the strips on. Sometimes the strips will get out of place due to the saliva that is produced by having them on. I think the price should be about $15. what bothers me most is that the part of my teeth closer to my gums look less white..eventhough the strips touched my gums too and caused pain there.</li>
            <li> These whitening strips are great! They are easy to use, adhere well, and stay in place. Best of all, I could visibly see results in just 2 days.</li>
            <li> it works, make sure you stick to it becuse i forget sometimes. at night i try to wear it to bed. pls do not wear it to bed cos it make your teeth/gum sensitive.</li>
            <li> I actually see whiter upper teeth but lower teeth didn&#x27;t improve much, the reason it is gettin 4 stars is because it was painful on the 3 and 4th day of applying the strips and after the 10 days lower teeth looked yellow and top teeth looked lighter.</li>
            <li> I decided to give these a shot since they were on sale and was pleasantly surprised with the results.  These are less cumbersome than the trays and gel provided by the dentist.  Most importantly, these actually work!</li>
            <li> Several people complained that they thought getting 3 extra strips for the extra $$ was pointless, or led them to give this product fewer stars. In actuality, the PLUS is because this product whitens your teeth up to 18 months, while the standard Premium product is only efective for 12 months. This is also why you use this one for 10 days rather than 7. You actually are getting 50% longer effectiveness for about 20% extra money. To me, that makes a lot of sense!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about how they say you will see results within 3 days.  I saw results after the first day!  I am so happy with my teeth and no longer self conscious about their appearance!  I would definitely recommend these to anyone wanting to avoid the expensive process of going to the dentist to get your teeth whitened!</li>
            <li> I have used similar product from Crest, the 7 strip (total of 14 with half hour use every day), and had no problem specially it was much cheaper even though I bought it at Walgreens. However this new supposedly supper duper product caused severe pain after just one use (2 strips back to back total of 1 hour). It took about 3 days to recover from pain (both gum and teeth)and after 10 days my teeth are still sensitive to cold or hot food. I should have used the same old product that I had good experience with, big mistake!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see any changes using this product. I think that the trays work better.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the whitening results. Noticed whiter teeth in just 3 apps. Unfortunately, I find the \\&quot;strips\\&quot; kind of a pain as they still slip. They stay on better than the original Crest Whitestrips, but still have a tendency to wander. Tooth sensitivity may be a problem for some, but just wait a day or two in between applications and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to tell if these strips did any good (that should say enough), but they also didn&#x27;t stay in place very well. They slipped around and made it awkward to speak with family (who said I sounded like I had a lisp). The strips are two different sizes, one for your upper teeth; one for the lower, but the one for your lower teeth was fatter (it should have been longer) and merely covered behind my teeth too (uh, I don&#x27;t need white teeth where only my tongue can see them!). My suggestion to Crest: make both strips the same length and width.</li>
            <li> These strips have done wonders for my smile.  In only 4 days my teeth were amazingly white, so I quit.  I&#x27;m saving the rest to touch up in 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I can effectively get 2 full treatments from one box I think these are an amazing value.  There is really no need to get trays or Bright Smile unless you want it done faster, and want a freakishly unnatural whiteness about your teeth....almost blue looking. ;-)</li>
            <li> Worked well. The strips adhere to your teeth much better than ones used in the past.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t get you extremely pearly whites like that from the dentist, but don&#x27;t be too surprised for not spending $500. But this product works very well, and I laugh every time I look in the mirror about how much improvement there is. This whitening looks VERY natural which is a huge plus. It is also a shiny white too even though I noticed an insignificant amount of yellow.    My friends and family have noticed my much whiter teeth which were a bit yellow after heavy coffee drinking over the past few years. I&#x27;m not sure if I will get this product again immediately as I&#x27;m happy with where I am at right now. But I probably will use this product every 1 to 2 years.    As for sensitivity, I can&#x27;t say. I didn&#x27;t use this product twice everyday, but instead I use this once everyday. The sensitivity is noticeable, but the dentist who wrote a review on this says that it this products use can be stopped and resumed without having an diminishing effect on the whitening.</li>
            <li> Though these things certainly do what they advertise (the coffee stains on my teeth are nearly gone), they are not as convenient as advertised.  As many will remember, the original advertisement for these strips showed them being used while the female character window-shopped, which showcased the easy-to-use nature of this product.  Though I doubt no one attempted such a &#x27;feat,&#x27; I don&#x27;t think people realize the discomfort of using these.      As other reviewers have probably noted, the chemical used does sometimes burn gums; while it isn&#x27;t terribly painful, it is somewhat annoying.  Secondly, the strips don&#x27;t always stay in place, so they sometimes require more attention than one would want to devote to such a process.    However, despite these few annoyances, this product does work well and I would certainly go through the hassle of it all to conceal the damning evidence my coffee addiction.</li>
            <li> Judging from the overwhelming positive response to this product I am giving it 4 stars.  I have not even started to use it yet.  Why am I writing a review then?  Well, I bought the expensive version of the Whitestrips, Premium Plus.  The back of the box states \\&quot;Additional Premium Whitestrips for long lasting whitening.\\&quot;  I bought this because I assumed that means there are a few additional strips in addition to the 40 listed on the front of the box.  The pharmacist had no idea.  Another reviewer stated there were 3 additonal strips.  Well, let me tell you, there are no additional strips in my box.  I&#x27;ll be calling the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for five days now and I have noticed an incredible difference!!  I was getting to a point of embarrassment when smiling, my teeth had yellowed a lot over the years, and they were never really white to begin with.  Now when I smile, I notice my teeth are much brighter and whiter!  I also bought some Sensodyne ProNamel toothpaste and brush for one minute after removing the strips and my teeth have had very little sensitivity!  I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchased this...Works very well, although I only did it once every day. My friends were asking me how my teeth was so white! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i have tried every teeth whiting product and none of them deliver, niether does this one</li>
            <li> I love my tea and my coffee ... and in 2007 I saw photos of myself on a trip to Hawaii and was freaked out at the appearance of my so called perfect teeth. They were YELLOW!  I purchased Crest White Strips on my next vacation (they dont sell them here in Cancun) and I quickly became the girl that everyone asked \\&quot;how did your teeth get so white!!\\&quot;  People asked me when I was on vacation, when I was at work...it was the oddest thing to me. One time at the Atlantis hotel in the Bahamas I was asking a question and the girl&#x27;s first response was \\&quot;how did you get your teeth so white!\\&quot;.  It was a wonderful thing to hear.</li>
            <li> This is a follow up review because I&#x27;ve reviewed them before based on using Whitestrips in the past.  Let me tell you, these new 10 day dental whitening strips are pretty amazing for their price.  It has been about a week since I got them and already my teeth look so much whiter.  I&#x27;ve noticed a little improvement in the first 3 days like everyone said, but now that I am nearing the end of the cycle, they look so much better than what I first started.  At only 22.00 with free shipping if you spend 3.00 more, these are definately worth picking up if your teeth are yellow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the whitening from this product.  I own whitening trays, but wanted to try this product and avoid a trip to the dentist to buy their gel.  While trays work a bit faster since the gel can conform to each tooth (and I think the peroxide concentration is higher), Crest Whitestrips work well if you don&#x27;t mind taking a little longer to get the result you want.  With both trays and this product, I have to whiten every other day because I have extremely sensitive teeth.  Again, no big deal if you aren&#x27;t in a huge hurry to get a final result.  I found that I can&#x27;t do normal activity when I whiten, so I apply the strips, then lay in bed and watch TV or read.  I lay back slightly so I can swallow saliva and not dislodge the strips.  I only do one 30 minute treatment every other day, and it&#x27;s working fine.  Just use the strips according to your own comfort level and enjoy the whitening!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted whiter teeth like when I was a child.  I actually tried the Crest Whitestrips years ago when they first came out and had no results.  A couple weeks ago I was just browsing Amazon and came across these.  I decided to take a chance on them since they are the \\&quot;Premium Plus\\&quot; ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that these actually work.  I&#x27;m am satisfied with the results that I&#x27;ve gotten.  My teeth aren&#x27;t super white by any means, but they have gotten at least 2-3 shades whiter.  As for the reviews saying that this product makes your teeth sensitive, that hasn&#x27;t happened to me in my complete 10 days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product for those looking to get a whiter smile.</li>
            <li> I first tried the Listerine strips. They are much more user-friendly in that they are easy to apply, stick well on the teeth, and dissolve in your mouth. They didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth much though.    The Crest strips did a better job at whitening (see below) but I found them inconvenient to apply, wear and remove. The first day the strips were wasted because they just slipped around and wadded up in my mouth. I almost returned them but decided to try one more day.    In order to make them stick and stay in place, I had to rub back and forth with a lot of pressure on the strips against my teeth several times while applying them. Then I remained silent for the 30 minutes of wearing them, without moving my teeth at all and without swallowing.    If your teeth are crooked, the strips might still work if you press hard to apply them to teeth out of alignment.     I experienced no pain or sensitivity with these or with the Listerine brand.    I finished the 10 day regimen and my teeth are about 85% of what I had hoped, which is pretty good. I don&#x27;t know how much using the Listerine strips before the Crest strips contributed to the overall results, or how much whiter they would have been had the first day of Crest strips stayed on my teeth instead of wadding up and being wasted.    I think everyone&#x27;s mouth, gums and saliva are different and this accounts for the different experiences and degrees of success or failure of the product. It&#x27;s worth giving these a try.</li>
            <li> With today&#x27;s economy I can&#x27;t understand how anyone would want to waste their money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the thing, instead of rinsing your toothbrush in water before you apply your tooth paste to your brush head, dip it in 3% peroxide (everyday over the counter kind). Don&#x27;t shake off the excess; brush as usual.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: brush your tongue, walls and roof of your mouth, and you don&#x27;t need mouthwash either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your teeth will be whiter and pain free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously do not swallow and rinse well.</li>
            <li> Used it morning and night for 10 days and teeth are noticably whiter. Very easy to do!!!!     Thanks</li>
            <li> I used the Pro-Effects strips a couple of years ago and am now buying a new box to whiten my teeth again.  They made a big difference with my teeth, which I&#x27;d not been able to achieve with other whitening products I&#x27;d tried.  I found that I did have sensitivity and started taking a Tylenol or two about half an hour before whitening, like you do when taking kids for shots.  This really helped!!  In addition, I always use a toothpaste for sensitive teeth.  The combination helped A LOT!!  I recommend the Pro-Effects strips because they have the most peroxide you can get without a dentist and they get the job done.</li>
            <li> I will always keep using the Crest whitestrips. They&#x27;re cheaper than getting your teeth whitened, and you will have whiter teeth after using them for the full 10 days. I know its sometimes a hassle trying to find 30 min in the morning or at night to sit with the whitestrips, but its 10 days and it is definitely worth it. So put them on while your working, driving, etc. and enjoy your wonderful smile after the 10 days !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the 3rd day of using this product and love it!  I&#x27;ve already noticed I have a whiter smile and I haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity at all.  The product comes with 20 packs of upper and lower strips- enough for 2 x per day for 10 days.  I&#x27;m planning on using 10 of the packs and saving the other 10 packs to use in 9 months because I&#x27;ve already seen enough improvement.  I don&#x27;t have a celebrity-white smile or anything, but it&#x27;s enough that my yellow stains from coffee and tea are pretty much gone and my teeth actually look uniform and nice.  I&#x27;ve only used 5 packs so far and have seen great results, so I can&#x27;t wait!  My biggest advice would be to make sure to brush well and wipe off your teeth with a dry paper towel before applying the strips.  The strips tend to move from the moisture otherwise, especially since your mouth will salivate.</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical, but I used them 2x a day for just one week before a family wedding and the results were excellent. I strongly recommend the PREMIUM PLUS over the regular whitestrips and without a doubt over other brands like Rembrandt,  etc.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoy the Crest Premium White Strips! I recently received a free sample of the new Crest ADVANCED SEAL White Strips...and I must say if you&#x27;re a fan of the premium you&#x27;ll definitely love the ADVANCED SEAL! They stick on so well you don&#x27;t have to worry about them falling off!!! Until they come out I will continue using the Premium ones! Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I used this product at the suggestion of my dental hygienist prior to having some dental veneers replaced.  I read the reviews and I had some misgivings about using an over-the-counter product but it was fine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Results:  I am pleased with the results.  The strips lightened my teeth noticably.  I do not have \\&quot;chiclet\\&quot; teeth, that blue white luminous shade that, frankly, looks artificial but my teeth are cleaner and whiter than before.  I had my new veneers prepped today and the dentist commented that I had lightened my teeth, that they looked very nice and that the product worked well for me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Process:  I found the product fairly easy to use after a couple of applications.  There is a technique but it was easy enough to get the hang of it.  The gel adhered well to the surface of the tooth and I always had a lot of gel left on my teeth when I removed the strip.  From about day three to six, I found my gums and teeth a bit sensitive but I persisted and the sensation went away by the end of the ten days.  I found that my lips dried out while I used the strips and it helped to apply lip balm before and after using the strips. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Some Tips: Wash your hands when you finish applying the strips so that you don&#x27;t get white patches on your fingers.  Rinse your mouth when you finish to reduce gum sensitivity.  Find a couple of times during the day when you have enough time to concentrate on how you apply the strips.  It&#x27;s a small thing but I think it makes a difference to apply them well.  As I said, you may want to apply something to your lips to keep them from drying out.  You can anticipate some sensitivity.  It was not a huge issue for me but I can see it might be for some. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The directions say that Crest Strips will not lighten dental work.  It actually did lighten my old veneers a bit.  However, if you have veneers that you are not planning to replace, you might not like the two-toned effect you get.  So if you have cosmetic dental work, I&#x27;d suggest you ask your dentist before you try this product.</li>
            <li> refers to the fact that it will last 6 months longer than the original, and you&#x27;re only paying for four extra days of strips. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When if you only got the original, two boxes is what you&#x27;d need for it to last as long as \\&quot;plus\\&quot; does, and it would cost you 50 dollars as opposed to 34.</li>
            <li> My husband and I each bought a box of this before our wedding. I read the reviews on here so I knew it had the possibility of hurting but I figured that everyone&#x27;s different and it might not hurt me. I used it for probably 2 or 3 days before the pain started. It quickly intensified. At its worst the pain was excruciating for the half hour that these were on my teeth and then my teeth continued to hurt and were extremely sensitive. On a plus side though they worked. I could not finish using them. I think I did 6 days or so before I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. Still even though I did not use all the strips there was a noticeable difference in my teeth. If I use them again I&#x27;ll probably do every other day or every three days rather than follow the directions. Also, keep in mind that they may not hurt if you use them. My husband experienced less pain but it was still bad enough that he didn&#x27;t finish using them either. They definitely work though so as they say, \\&quot;no pain, no gain!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I got a sample in the mail and tried it out the same day.All i have to say is wow!It WILL stay in place until you remove it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time. It&#x27;s easier than the trays. Use it and after a few months use it again. I use it to brighten up if I&#x27;m headed out to a night event, I put the strips on while I&#x27;m getting ready. It&#x27;s so simply!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many positive things about Crest whitestrips, so I decided to give them a try.  My first attempt was a few days ago.&lt;br /&gt;The first strip (lower portion) didn&#x27;t stay on and got all twisted up...it became useless.  The strip for the upper portion of my mouth stayed on a few seconds longer, before slipping off and becoming useless.&lt;br /&gt;I tried them again, yesterday...guess I was thinking that those 2 just happened to be defective.  But this second set slid off my teeth and twisted up.  This evening I finally got the upper strip to stay on, but it has bunched up near my back teeth and is uncomfortable!  I got the white strips as a gift.  Had they not been a gift I would sent them back to Crest demanding a refund.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other whitening products...cheaper, less publicized products, which caused too much pain and irritation, which is why I wanted to try the white strips in the first place.  I&#x27;ll just stick to Rembrandt products, as those have worked for me in the past.</li>
            <li> this item does NOT work!!! it says that it&#x27;s guarantee money back when it doesn&#x27;t work but it&#x27;s a lie, they won&#x27;t give my money back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen results very quickly with this product, but I&#x27;m disgusted at the packaging that Crest uses. The whitestrips are paper thin, yet the box the come in is enormous.  Not only is the box 3x bigger than it needs to be, but it&#x27;s double-walled plastic, doubling the waste!    As much as I&#x27;m impressed by the product, I cannot recommend it based on the packaging waste.</li>
            <li> I have a silver crown at the bottom jaw, and this whitestrip went over the gum under the silver crown. Of course, it did not whiten the silver crown (not my intentional anyways) but the gum became VERY sensitive, and I ended up getting gum soreness and bleeding. I&#x27;m going to the dentist tomorrow because the silver crown tooth is now slightly loose. I think gums under silver crows are already in a compromised situation so MAKE SURE it does NOT go anywhere near gums under silver crows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first strip made my teeth hurt all night. It did go away though, you just have to put up with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did whiten my teeth though.</li>
            <li> I discovered Crest White strips after I quit smoking 6 yrs ago. I was going to shell out the $ at the dentist&#x27;s to reward myself but decided to give these a try. The first Crest Strips that came out were tough on the gums and I could only use them every other day, but worked spectacularly! Within a week, I was getting compliments on what a pretty smile I had, which made me want to smile even more :). I&#x27;ve used them off and on since, and find that I can go 3-4 mo, use them for a couple of days and, voila! White smile.   I&#x27;m something of a walking sales pitch for these things, because I don&#x27;t whiten my bottom teeth, (since they never show and it saves $-why whiten what you can&#x27;t see?). When people ask how well they work I show them the difference and they&#x27;re astounded. Most people&#x27;s teeth are slightly yellow, but I drink coffee and brushing just doesn&#x27;t remove the staining.    They&#x27;re kind of tricky to put on because they&#x27;re flimsy, so just make sure your teeth are dry, place them right where the gum line meets your teeth, run your tongue over the strip and if you can suck air between your teeth it kind of vacuum&#x27;s them on. Pat them in firmly with your finger. I only use 1 and save the other one (in the package) for the next day. It dries it out a little and actually makes it easier to adhere to your teeth. I usually use them right before I get in the shower, and by the time I&#x27;m finished blow drying my hair or getting dressed, it&#x27;s been 30 min. (No worries of eating/drinking during this time) If your teeth aren&#x27;t sensitive you can use them twice a day for faster results.     The only \\&quot;con\\&quot; of these (hence, 4*) is the flimsiness. It makes them tricky to get on and if you place them on your gums it could irritate them. Some people report tooth sensitivity but I haven&#x27;t had any problems. I love the way they whiten, without giving me a Brite!White! fake whitening. It&#x27;s a healthy-looking, natural whiteness that gives you more confidence in your smile.  A touch-up 30 min. every couple of months is all you need. :) You don&#x27;t HAVE to use them for 7-10 days. Just whiten them to the shade you want. You can also whiten just your top teeth so you can judge the difference (if your bottom teeth don&#x27;t show when you talk or laugh-might look kinda goofy if they do:)</li>
            <li> The strips do not stay on esp the bottom ones.  Every time I try to use them I just get frustrated because they do not stay in place.  I should have spent the extra money for different ones.</li>
            <li> Have used Crest Advanced Seal in past with satsifactory results.   HOWEVER, purchased the Crest Pro Effects and found that the strips   floated off my teeth within MINUTES.  My experience previously with  Advanced Seal (more than once) is they would easily adhere for at least  half-an-hour.  These didn&#x27;t.  And if they don&#x27;t adhere, they&#x27;re worthless.  Sent for refund in early November and haven&#x27;t heard a word since (it&#x27;s now  end of December).  Could be a bad batch, but I&#x27;m not going to risk again  on Crest&#x27;s quality control.</li>
            <li> Crest Whitestrips is an incredible product.  It is virtually the same hydrogen peroxide bleaching solution that dentists use.  It&#x27;s amazing how much whiter they make your teeth after only a few days.  I&#x27;ve been using them for a couple of years and decided to try the new \\&quot;Whitestrips Premium PLUS.\\&quot;  This product is exactly the same as the regular [[ASIN:B000FVU2DY Crest Whitestrips Premium- 7- Day Dental Whitening Formula System, 28 Strips]], except the box it comes in has a window and it comes with 3 extra days of strips.  The regular Whitestrips takes 7 days and this takes 10.  After 7 days, your teeth are pretty much as white as they&#x27;re going to get, and I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference from the additional 3 days.  The \\&quot;Plus\\&quot; in the product&#x27;s name seems to refer more to the much higher cost of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about getting this, just realize that all it is is three more strips, so when you figure out how much you&#x27;re being charged per strip, you may find you&#x27;re paying considerably more for these per strip than the regular [[ASIN:B000FVU2DY Crest Whitestrips Premium- 7- Day Dental Whitening Formula System, 28 Strips]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the strips are a great product and if you get them, make sure you buy some toothpaste for sensitive teeth because this product WILL make your teeth feel like they&#x27;re on fire.  It&#x27;s definitely worth it though.</li>
            <li> his product made my teeth so sensitive that i could not eat after a few applications.  Results did in fact show, but i had to discontinue after a few days</li>
            <li> If the only thing you want to know is whether or not this product whitens your teeth, it does. However, there are some caveats: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1) It works only on yellow stains &lt;br /&gt;2) May require two units (ie two packages) for heavily stained teeth &lt;br /&gt;3) The hydrogen peroxide (the stuff that whitens your teeth) can burn your gums (it did for me). If this happens to you, stop immediately and let your gums heal. Give it a few days and then reapply. If it still burns, discontinue the product. Also, this product is not for people with sensitive teeth and it inflammes the inner nerves of your teeth. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;ALternative, try the Crest Night Effects. You get to control what teeth gets whitened and it doesn&#x27;t burn your gums or teeth.</li>
            <li> I used these as directed, and not only did they burn my gums and hurt the nerves in my teeth, they did not really whiten.  Instead, they created small white dots on my teeth that look absolutely ridiculous.  I now have to go to a dentist to have a professional whitening done to REVERSE the damage done by this product.  I am asking crest for my money back.  This has been nothing but a PAIN...literally!  I guess a few lucky people did have this work for them, but I&#x27;d suggest going to a professional instead. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Good luck with this product.  I hope it will work better for you than it did for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only on day two, but my teeth seem noticably whiter, which is a shock, because my teeth are relatively white to start and it&#x27;s hard to find a product that makes any difference at all. It was very painful to apply them today, the peroxide burned my gums very much to the point where they turned white near my teeth. I toughed it out though, and the pain wore down after a few minutes. I did have problems all day though, it was a constant pain in my upper and lower teeth, I&#x27;m really hoping it&#x27;s just temporarily sensativity. I also recommend applying lipbalm before using, because your teeth will probably get chapped. Let&#x27;s hope the pain dies down, because they seem to be working!</li>
            <li> Was skeptical about trying any tooth whitener, but decided to try this one after reading reviews.  Am happy to report that after four days I can claim it does work and isn&#x27;t too difficult or uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> All I have to say about this is that it does the job.  My teeth started to turn white within the 3rd day of using the strips.    I do have to warn you that if you have sensitive teeth you will suffer a lot.    The pain is incredible bad.. I have sensitive teeth.    The pain last all day, so eat slowly and try not to eat hot or cold stuff..    Try eating at room temperature if possible.</li>
            <li> If you have teeth that are ;yellow this product will improve your smile.  I&#x27;m totally sold  on it and once you achieve the whiteness then it&#x27;s just occasional upkeep.  Thank-you Crest white strips</li>
            <li> I have been using these off and on for almost a year. Through perodic use, I have been able to keep my teeth fairly white. The down side is the discomfort after several consecutive uses. My gums have gotten burned by the hydrogen peroxide more than once. I recommend to anyone who wishes to use this whitener to use it every other day. Before I apply the whitening strips, I brush and floss thoroughly. The number one thing to do to maintain white teeth after you have used this product is to brush and floss daily(something everyone should do, but I know the majority of people do not).</li>
            <li> I am 19. I have used reg. crest white strips, and they worked fine. i figured, \\&quot;hey, premium must be better right?\\&quot; WRONG! &lt;br /&gt;within the first 15 minutes, your gums hurt. it lasts for two days , where your mouth is sensitive and hurts to eat. no way will i ever use all 40 strips.</li>
            <li> First off this Item is splendid. Results on day 2 and I&#x27;m on day 9 its amazing how well they work. I never had an issue with my gums. This product is great and I&#x27;d reccomend it to anyone. If you want great results in less than 2 weeks with little to no effort BUY NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> the whitestrips worked wonderfully. i have sensitive teeth so to avoid the possibility of more sensitivity with the whitestrips i applied the strips once a day instead of twice and i did not experience any sensitivity...and my teeth are so much whiter! i highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> I tried the advanced seal and it was so much better in terms of convenience. If you are going to buy this product than buy the white strips that have the advanced seal.</li>
            <li> Teeth a super white after using them.</li>
