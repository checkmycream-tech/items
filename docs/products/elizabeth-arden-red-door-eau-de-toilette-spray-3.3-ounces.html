            <li>My favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>Elizabeth  Arden is always  my favorite .</li>
            <li>The chemicals in the perfume react to your own PH giving each person their unique smell.</li>

            <li>Fast shipping, great product, thanks!</li>

            <li>Enjoying it very much.</li>
            <li>but for me it seems to have a special fragrance after I put it on.  </li>
            <li>The size and price were right on the money!</li>
            <li>I had found another site that had the right version, but this Christmas when I went there they had nothing!</li>
            <li>They immediately apologized and offered to send me a replacement with quick shipment since I needed it by that week.</li>
            <li>I have had many many complements when I wear it - actually which is every day.</li>
            <li>I love it and hope I will be able to get it from you in the future.</li>
            <li>THANKS FOR THE FINE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>hope you enjoy this lotion as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a fun tip I just discovered</li>
            <li>I love this product, is better than what I expected.</li>
            <li>it was not what I expected, however after using it I was very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I was pretty upset and called Customer Service to tell them about my situation.</li>
            <li>I have been using Red Door by Elizabeth Arden for many years.  </li>
            <li>This is my mom&#x27;s favorite and I always order it for her when she runs low because it&#x27;s so much cheaper than the stores</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was more than I expected because you find that sometimes, like this time, reviews from the manufacturer are not always what you find the scent on your own body would be due to your PH level.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really comment on the item itself, as my mom purchased it as a gift for someone.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>The picture is of the original Red Door</li>
            <li>It is light, but lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend this product to ladies who love to be a bit classy, I use it only especial occasions when I go for dinner, movies, other with my fiancee he loves it, since the first time I was using it on 2009.</li>
            <li>This is a medium weight almost a light pink grapefruit smell which is quite refreshing, This is definitely a transitional scent, moving from afternoon to early evening but not what I would consider a real later evening or dining</li>
            <li>so she new</li>
            <li>This is not my first time purchasing Red Door.</li>
            <li>The perfume is a clean, soft smell that the person wearing it won&#x27;t smell on herself after a few minutes but everyone around her, will.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I have to say, I&#x27;m not Personally a huge fan of the perfume; a bit sweet for me (go figure)</li>
            <li>and I received the new Red Door.  </li>

            <li> Christmas gift for my grandmother.  She has worn this for years so she new she liked it.</li>
            <li> I Love this lotion!  &#x3D;D  I Would have given it 5 stars if it were a bit more moisturizing~ you&#x27;re basically getting just all scent, here.  I have to say, I&#x27;m not Personally a huge fan of the perfume; a bit sweet for me (go figure) but for some reason,   this lotion mellows out to a lovely, sexy scent.  I save it for dates (b/c it tastes good, too~ a bonus!) ;)  ****Here&#x27;s a fun tip I just discovered: If you like this scent, go to Walgreen&#x27;s &amp; get their store brand women&#x27;s shave gel in the fuschia &amp; purple can. It&#x27;s a bargain &amp; has the same scent profile.  Fabulous!    ~I hope you enjoy this lotion as much as I do.  :)</li>
            <li> love this bottle [clear] but hard to find afraid to order I might get the dark red bottle,</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume for my wife. We both like it and the price was good.</li>
            <li> My mother loves this scent. I couldn&#x27;t resist.  She was on cloud 9</li>
            <li> When I purchased this item and received it, the perfume bottle was cracked somewhere (although I couldn&#x27;t see where) and had leaked all over the packaging. I was pretty upset and called Customer Service to tell them about my situation. They immediately apologized and offered to send me a replacement with quick shipment since I needed it by that week. I didn&#x27;t have to pay any extra fees for the quicker shipping or return the damaged item. I can&#x27;t really comment on the item itself, as my mom purchased it as a gift for someone. She does seem to like it herself though, so I&#x27;m going to go ahead and say it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> So many compliments on this fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best sprays I have purchased in many years as I have always worn Tabu. Everyone has commented how nice it smells and it stays with you all day.</li>

            <li> This was for my mother.  It is the only perfume she wears.  It is about 20 bucks cheaper than Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> good price, fast delivery My wife wears this everyday so I am always looking for a good price.  this fits the bill</li>
            <li> my girlfriend absoulutely loves this perfume. She always gets compliments from men and women. And the scent lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I love the scent!  It is light, but lasts for a long time.  It doesn&#x27;t overwhelm  the senses.  This would be good for almost any age.</li>
            <li> This is a medium weight almost a light pink grapefruit smell which is quite refreshing, This is definitely a transitional scent, moving from afternoon to early evening but not what I would consider a real later evening or dining scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was more than I expected because you find that sometimes, like this time, reviews from the manufacturer are not always what you find the scent on your own body would be due to your PH level.

            <li> This is not my first time purchasing Red Door. I&#x27;ve used it for years. It has a wonderful fragrance and will always make a good impression. You probably won&#x27;t smell it but others will. Only need a squirt or two and it lasts all day. Recommend to those who want to use a good fragrance that is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Red Door!  What could be better!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents...I love the smell of it!!! The size and price were right on the money!</li>
            <li> Red Door is my mother&#x27;s signature scent and for a few years we&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding the right one. It seemed like the formula had changed or something. Every time we bought it, the scent smelled off and yes. we bought the real Red Door - not a knock off. I had found another site that had the right version, but this Christmas when I went there they had nothing! In a panic I came to Amazon and as usual - found exactly what I needed. She was so happy and I was so thrilled Amazon came through again. I would have paid any price to make mom happy, but luckily the price was great.</li>
            <li> I love the perfume.  The price was an excellent price.  The perfume is a clean, soft smell that the person wearing it won&#x27;t smell on herself after a few minutes but everyone around her, will.  Many compliments on this when I wear it.</li>
            <li> love this product, i would my family&amp;friends to buy this, i rated this a 5of5 because smells good and the scent lasts.</li>
            <li> muy bueno 100% recomendado</li>
            <li> I have been using Red Door by Elizabeth Arden for many years.  It has always garnered many compliments from people I&lt;br /&gt;encounter.  Even my grandchildren associate the fragrance with Grammy.  They told me never to change the fragrance because&lt;br /&gt;Red Door typifies their grammy.</li>
            <li> still smells the same as it always did, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on as long.  Still love it though !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> OMG..... LOVE IT.... GETTING IT FOR MOM</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance.  Always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest spray going -that is if you like Red Door.  Many people don&#x27;t and I understand but for me it seems to have a special fragrance after I put it on.  I have had many many complements when I wear it - actually which is every day.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites, great price.</li>
            <li> Great product !! Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Enjoying it very much.</li>
            <li> what I bought at the store with  the same name is in a different looking bottle and is not the same so I ordered from you and it is the same as I have used forever.  I love it and hope I will be able to get it from you in the future.</li>
            <li> I buy this perfume all the time and this one that I received leaked really bad. Had it in my purse laying on its side and when I took it out over half at leaked out. Not good !!</li>
            <li> she loves that RED DOOR.  THANKS FOR THE FINE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> it was not what I expected, however after using it I was very pleased with the result. I do recommend buying the perfume.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume. I should have bought at TJMax....only $20 for the same ounce</li>
            <li> I always love a great deal like I got with Amazone. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Nice! Nice product for the ladies. My wifw loves this product as it compliments her body chemestry. Next I need to get some fragrances for myself. lol</li>
            <li> Elizabeth  Arden is always  my favorite .</li>
            <li> The picture is of the original Red Door and I received the new Red Door.  They are not the same.  I was extremely disappointed as I had ordered it as a gift and then was not able to give it.  Perfumes cannot be returned so I am stuck with 2 bottles that I did not want.  You need to change your picture so others are not fooled as I was.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and she loved it.</li>
            <li> #3 on my fav list. Awesome clean smell</li>
            <li> good price on the large bottle fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product, thanks!</li>
