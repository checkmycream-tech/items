            <li>good for sealing in moisture as well...</li>
            <li>How can this be good?</li>
            <li>good product</li>
            <li>This product is amazing</li>
            <li>AMAZING product.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s kind of like putting bubble gum in your hair.</li>
            <li>Really nice smell</li>
            <li>I LOVE it for my horses, but I couldn&#x27;t imagine using it on my own hair since it takes some time just washing it off my hands.</li>
            <li>I love mane and Tale Herbal Gro.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t help but love it.</li>
            <li>My mother used this many years ago and it helped with growing out her hair...</li>
            <li>, i use mostly on roots, maybe 3 or 4 times a week...</li>
            <li>Gets her hair very full and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Leave it on for as long as you can, overnight is the best option (use a hair cap or a plastic shopping bag to keep it from drying out and protect your pillows).</li>
            <li>This hair styling product is wonderful epcially if you have damaged and/or dry hair.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product and herbal gro</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re in my situation like mine where your hair is beyond fried, you need to lightly dampen your hair then GLOP this stuff on.</li>
            <li>I had such great expectations for this product.</li>
            <li>It is a great product, but obviously not for everyone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it does work, you just have to be light on the hair when using it...</li>
            <li>it will leave your hair soft and manageable and it has a lot of good ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>Makesy hair very greasy!!!</li>
            <li>yes, it may cause your hair to feel greasy, but if you use the right amount for the amount of hair you have, it should be fine..</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even need to scoop out a finger-dollop full.</li>
            <li>I love Straight Arrows shampoos, conditioner , and hoof cream.</li>
            <li>to the product not giving any clear instructions of how much to apply, I used a fair bit which caused a DISASTER.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t help but love it.be able to bring it back to a bearable texture</li>
            <li>would not recommend this for someone with the hair that is naturally very fine and soft, nor for someone with oily hair.</li>
            <li>This will help my hair out so much!!</li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars because it actually does smell very good, and I use other Mane&amp;Tail products</li>
            <li>This product makes my mares&#x27; tails and manes soft and easy to manage (both have pretty tangle-prone tails).</li>
            <li>Overall though, I love it.</li>
            <li>[...] followed the directions exactly-</li>
            <li>And if you have a tendency to over process your hair, this should be able to bring it back to a bearable texture (though nothing but time can 100% fix damaged</li>
            <li>I know most people like it, but it must be the matter of personal preference.  </li>
            <li>I cannot stand that smell for perfumes or other kind of beauty products.  </li>
            <li>But if you have very thirsty hair, this should more than help it keep from frizzing when used CORRECTLY and daily.</li>
            <li>If giving zero stars was an option, I would have certainly selected that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have been growing my hair out for 2 years now and have finally reached a very long length and good thickness.</li>
            <li>After 2 uses it&#x27;s now super soft and never tangles like it used to, not mention how much it grew in just a couple months.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to be able to tell if there is any significant growth</li>
            <li>what are you supposed to do haha...</li>
            <li>/&gt;However now the real problem comes...it hasn&#x27;t come out...</li>
            <li>It just oily and sticky stuff doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair really</li>
            <li>I never brought a product that had this much grease in it</li>
            <li>I could have use it to make a couple of pies cause that is what the main ingredient to making pies is lard.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sorry to see the low rating for this otherwise wonderful product.</li>
            <li>then I highly recommend this product and brand.</li>
            <li>but my hair has seemed less damaged and isn&#x27;t breaking as easily.</li>
            <li>I wish the seller would have listed the product ingredients because, I would not have ordered it if I had known that the first two ingredients are Petroleum and, the next ingredient is mineral oil.</li>
            <li>usually am looking for plenty of supplements and remedies to make my hair grow super strong and long</li>
            <li>If I rub some of it into my hair right after I wash them, then let it dry naturally, I end up with shiny, wavy hair that is not frizzy at all.  </li>
            <li>If it is still not out by the end of today, I will be heading to the hairdressers who will no doubt insist on cutting my vile looking hair after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;2 years of hair growth have just been reversed from using this one product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Mane and Tail, you&#x27;ve destroyed my pride and joy.</li>
            <li>Of course it doesn&#x27;t do very well for human hair.</li>
            <li>this stuff should not go on your hair, and it really doesn&#x27;t spread at all because of this, so obviously I used quite a bit, to evenly apply it...</li>
            <li>really should have read reviews before hand because people have had the same problem.</li>
            <li>only thing I really dislike about this product is the smell.  </li>
            <li>I have natural 4a hair...</li>
            <li>This product helps to keep my hair under control, soft and conditioned while its growing out.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Mane &#x27;n Tail Herbal Gro Maximum thinking it would be deep-conditioning and enriching, leaving my hair fortified, soft and luscious, but I was in for a surprise.&lt;br /&gt;Because the main ingredient is petroleum instead of conditioning oils, it left my hair greasy and unmanageable.</li>
            <li>, however, I thought I&#x27;d make this my first review to save other people&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But bewarned and buy Dawn (yes, as in the dish soap) and get ready for it to be your best friend because it was the only thing that will help you get this crap out of your hair!</li>
            <li>First thing, the directions aren&#x27;t very clear, it says &#x27;after shampooing and conditioning, apply and massage into hair and scalp, use as often as desired or needed, style as usual&#x27; ...</li>
            <li>this product contains two of the no no ingredients for black hair, mineral oil and petrolum and they are listed as the first two ingredients so although it says herbal gro.</li>
            <li>(Oddly, this happened to me today after nearly a year of leaving my hair [relatively] alone so it could repair itself, so I don&#x27;t really know why it happened -</li>
            <li>I personally did wash it out after like 2 minutes, I followed instructions of shampooing and conditioning like normal, then applied this to my scalp and hair, but the consistency of this stuff is gross, its so thick and gloopy and when you apply it to your hair, it just doesn&#x27;t feel right</li>
            <li>I have short hair, normal, straight hair (about 2 inches) and a little bit of this goes a long way for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s meant for both the idea that the product needs to stay in a horse&#x27;s mane and tail, and for the super thick hair shafts a horse has in its mane and tail.</li>
            <li>However, if you use to much, it may be a little too greasy for your hair and washing it out during your sower may need some extra scrubbing.  </li>

            <li> I usually use the normal shampoo and conditioner and a detangler which are all great, so when I saw this pop as something to try I didn&#x27;t hesitate, as I had high standards, it is awful!</li>
            <li> just wanted to give this a positive review to counteract some of the negative ones.</li>
            <li> just wanted to give this a positive review to counteract some of the negative ones.</li>
            <li> The only trik is : you must ti use a smoll amount of the product to styling your hair when is dry ( not completly) just try it!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really &amp;#34;STYLE AS USUAL&amp;#34; because your hair will be stuck, hard as a rock, and washing it out will take forever.</li>
            <li> I applied a small amount to my hair, which is very thick, and I have not been able to wash it out for over a week.</li>
            <li> #34;I look like a grease monkey who doesn&#x27;t believe in shampoo&amp;#34; if so go for it and buy this product.</li>
            <li> Alright, so a little back story about my hair: I dye it constantly</li>
            <li> Ive been using it a very long time.</li>
            <li> , only twice in my life have I experienced the terrifying</li>
            <li> I have dry and damage hair.</li>
            <li> three times...still hasn&#x27;t come out, I thought maybe if I dry it</li>
            <li> They became softer, silkier, not as dry.  </li>
            <li> have also used this on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> , nope, it still looks soaking wet even though its completely dry, its all sticky and horrid, I have no idea what to do now</li>
            <li> so only a little is needed if you are going to apply it during the day.&lt;br /&gt;My hair</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it is not very lasting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so be careful not to over use it....</li>
            <li> then wet your hair, put conditioner in, work it through and rinse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, my hair that is thick, coarser then the average female hair, very dry, wavy and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I try to use even less of it on those occasions, rub it into the driest and least manageable areas and wait for at least ten minutes before actually styling them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried rubbing a very small amount into my scalp and left my hair looking</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of not reading previous reviews and my hair paid for it.</li>
            <li> If you have dry, thick, damaged, and/or curly hair, this should help restore the life and shine to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (what is used to make Vaseline - a product which is near enough IMPOSSIBLE to get out of your hair).</li>
            <li> the last 2 hours, I have washed my hair FIVE times with washing-up liquid, sat with baby powder on my hair for 20 minuted and still cannot get this stupid product out of my hair, and this is due to the main ingredient being petroleum</li>
            <li> Due to this repetitive washing and despite using a lot of conditioner, I have had a lot of hair falling out, my hair had dried up ALOT, and the product is STILL not out.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I&#x27;m not super attached to my hair and have no problem cutting off several inches of dead ends on a regular basis, but all the haircuts in the world could not take all of the damage out of repeatedly bleached</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Also for those of you who use Qhemet Biologic heavy olive and olive cream or the burdock root</li>
            <li> If you have trouble getting it out for some reason</li>
            <li> My hair feels like a mess and it will take plenty of washing to get the small amount I put on</li>
            <li> other reviewers say: YES, this stuff is thick.</li>
            <li> It will feel gross, it will be almost impossible to wash out tomorrow morning, it will be difficult to work into your hair, but it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount is need to achieve this.</li>
            <li> after rinsing it out and towel drying it, my hair was all sticky and gross, stuck together and greasy looking, I knew something was wrong, so I shampooed my hair...</li>
            <li> This is like a thicker jar of petroleum jelly; seriously like green speckled cement hard goo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is hard to wash out of your hair and, off your hands.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s hard to work with.</li>
            <li> By &amp;#34;some of it&amp;#34; I mean</li>
            <li> but seriously, it has the consistency of petroleum jelly!&lt;br</li>
            <li> i seriously had to wash it out with dish soap.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally lovin it everyone is raving about it and I just had to buy it give y&#x27;all a update thx</li>
            <li> As another reviewer has said, if zero stars were an option, that is the rightful rating. This product is AWFUL.&lt;br /&gt;I have never composed a review on Amazon, however, I thought I&#x27;d make this my first review to save other people&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have been growing my hair out for 2 years now and have finally reached a very long length and good thickness. This product, despite its title claiming that it will help your hair &#x27;gro&#x27; does the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;Due to the product not giving any clear instructions of how much to apply, I used a fair bit which caused a DISASTER.&lt;br /&gt;In the last 2 hours, I have washed my hair FIVE times with washing-up liquid, sat with baby powder on my hair for 20 minuted and still cannot get this stupid product out of my hair, and this is due to the main ingredient being petroleum (what is used to make Vaseline - a product which is near enough IMPOSSIBLE to get out of your hair). Due to this repetitive washing and despite using a lot of conditioner, I have had a lot of hair falling out, my hair had dried up ALOT, and the product is STILL not out. If it is still not out by the end of today, I will be heading to the hairdressers who will no doubt insist on cutting my vile looking hair after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;2 years of hair growth have just been reversed from using this one product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Mane and Tail, you&#x27;ve destroyed my pride and joy.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend. I applied a small amount to my hair, which is very thick, and I have not been able to wash it out for over a week. I cannot brush or style my hair as it is like a glue that has bonded to my hair. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> There was only one review when I bought this and it said nothing about how it is HAIR GREASE. I tried rubbing a very small amount into my scalp and left my hair looking/feeling dirty and greasy. Literally looked like I hadn&#x27;t shampooed in 3-4 days. I gave it 2 stars because it actually does smell very good, and I use other Mane&amp;Tail products so I know that it&#x27;s quality. If you are looking for hair grease then I highly recommend this product and brand. But if that&#x27;s not the case, be warned that this is not what you want.</li>
            <li> I did not get this item !!!!  I spend around one month to wait my order for this creme and.....nothing.....</li>
            <li> Daughter loves this product. Gets her hair very full and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> This hair styling product is wonderful epcially if you have damaged and/or dry hair. It give your hair back it&#x27;s body and nautral shine. Just a small amount is need to achieve this. However, if you use to much, it may be a little too greasy for your hair and washing it out during your sower may need some extra scrubbing.  Overall though, I love it.</li>
            <li> I wish the seller would have listed the product ingredients because, I would not have ordered it if I had known that the first two ingredients are Petroleum and, the next ingredient is mineral oil. BIG NO NO because, these two products are the worst things that you can put on your hair because, they do not really absorb into the hair shaft therefore it never fixes the dryness in your hair but, gives you a false shine. It is hard to wash out of your hair and, off your hands. TOO GREASY. I will not ever buy it again.</li>
            <li> i was reallllly hopeful about this product- but seriously, it has the consistency of petroleum jelly!&lt;br /&gt;ewww[...] followed the directions exactly- but my hair was so greasy and sticky i seriously had to wash it out with dish soap. :(((((&lt;br /&gt;  i am not exaggerating- this has the texture of Crisco shortening.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Mane &#x27;n Tail Herbal Gro Maximum thinking it would be deep-conditioning and enriching, leaving my hair fortified, soft and luscious, but I was in for a surprise.&lt;br /&gt;Because the main ingredient is petroleum instead of conditioning oils, it left my hair greasy and unmanageable. Maybe it works for horses hair (if you need some grease to make things stick) but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people&#x27;s hair to make it grow. No siree.</li>
            <li> I love mane and Tale Herbal Gro. Ive been using it a very long time. I was very happy that Amazon had it for me to choose. Fantastic product and herbal gro</li>
            <li> I have short hair, normal, straight hair (about 2 inches) and a little bit of this goes a long way for me. It smells great and gives a nice texture and shine.</li>
            <li> Horses have way, way thicker hair than people do. This product makes my mares&#x27; tails and manes soft and easy to manage (both have pretty tangle-prone tails). When I put a product like this on my horses, I don&#x27;t want it to wash out. It shouldn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s meant for both the idea that the product needs to stay in a horse&#x27;s mane and tail, and for the super thick hair shafts a horse has in its mane and tail. Of course it doesn&#x27;t do very well for human hair.</li>
            <li> WORST, I repeat, WORST product ever!!!! I made the mistake of not reading previous reviews and my hair paid for it. If you wanna try this product, get a tub of Vaseline and dump it in your head instead, it will give you the same results.  Can you say &amp;#34;I look like a grease monkey who doesn&#x27;t believe in shampoo&amp;#34; if so go for it and buy this product. But bewarned and buy Dawn (yes, as in the dish soap) and get ready for it to be your best friend because it was the only thing that will help you get this crap out of your hair!</li>
            <li> This product sucks!!! Makesy hair very greasy!!! I shampooed eight times today to remove the product but nothing. Even washed my hair wish dishwashing paste!!! But nothing workes!!! Worst hair product I tried. I wish I can sue the manufacturer. This product is a total disaster!!</li>
            <li> Alright, so a little back story about my hair: I dye it constantly, I bleach it constantly, my hair color changes a lot. Luckily, I&#x27;m not super attached to my hair and have no problem cutting off several inches of dead ends on a regular basis, but all the haircuts in the world could not take all of the damage out of repeatedly bleached hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, only twice in my life have I experienced the terrifying \\&quot;I went to rinse out the bleach and my hair came with it!\\&quot; (Oddly, this happened to me today after nearly a year of leaving my hair [relatively] alone so it could repair itself, so I don&#x27;t really know why it happened - but that&#x27;s off topic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers say: YES, this stuff is thick. Yes, it&#x27;s hard to work with. Yes, it&#x27;s kind of like putting bubble gum in your hair. So, if you bought this to use daily, use the teeeeeeniest. You don&#x27;t even need to scoop out a finger-dollop full. Rub it between your hands, heat it up/melt it, then evenly apply through your hair. If you have dry, thick, damaged, and/or curly hair, this should help restore the life and shine to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re in my situation like mine where your hair is beyond fried, you need to lightly dampen your hair then GLOP this stuff on. Coat your hair. Leave it on for as long as you can, overnight is the best option (use a hair cap or a plastic shopping bag to keep it from drying out and protect your pillows). It will feel gross, it will be almost impossible to wash out tomorrow morning, it will be difficult to work into your hair, but it will be worth it. This has saved me from literally having to shave my head before and I currently have it in my hair under a head cap as we speak because I know it will pull through again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For daily use, yes it&#x27;s a bit tricky. I also dislike the scent. But if you have very thirsty hair, this should more than help it keep from frizzing when used CORRECTLY and daily. And if you have a tendency to over process your hair, this should be able to bring it back to a bearable texture (though nothing but time can 100% fix damaged hair!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to give this a positive review to counteract some of the negative ones. It&#x27;s saved me from being bald so I can&#x27;t help but love it.be able to bring it back to a bearable texture (though nothing but time can 100% fix damaged hair!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to give this a positive review to counteract some of the negative ones.

            <li> This product is great for curly hair. The only trik is : you must ti use a smoll amount of the product to styling your hair when is dry ( not completly) just try it! I have dry and damage hair. For me works great!</li>
            <li> I bought this in the Philippines last year and I hadn&#x27;t used it til now.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very thick grease, so only a little is needed if you are going to apply it during the day.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thin so it makes it look greasy if I wear it during the day so I apply generously before bed and wash it out in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels amazing once I wash it out and style it! It had made my hair a lot stronger and my split ends have vanished.&lt;br /&gt;However I haven&#x27;t noticed any hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;It stops my hair from breaking but it doesn&#x27;t promote the growth ultimately.</li>
            <li> So I have literally just used the &#x27;mane n tail maximum herbal-gro conditioning treatment&#x27;. First thing, the directions aren&#x27;t very clear, it says &#x27;after shampooing and conditioning, apply and massage into hair and scalp, use as often as desired or needed, style as usual&#x27; ...so it doesn&#x27;t say you wash it out? do you leave it in for a bit or what? what are you supposed to do haha...&lt;br /&gt;Well I personally did wash it out after like 2 minutes, I followed instructions of shampooing and conditioning like normal, then applied this to my scalp and hair, but the consistency of this stuff is gross, its so thick and gloopy and when you apply it to your hair, it just doesn&#x27;t feel right, it&#x27;s like this stuff should not go on your hair, and it really doesn&#x27;t spread at all because of this, so obviously I used quite a bit, to evenly apply it...&lt;br /&gt;However now the real problem comes...it hasn&#x27;t come out...after rinsing it out and towel drying it, my hair was all sticky and gross, stuck together and greasy looking, I knew something was wrong, so I shampooed my hair...didn&#x27;t come out, I used fairy liquid...three times...still hasn&#x27;t come out, I thought maybe if I dry it it might make a difference, nope, it still looks soaking wet even though its completely dry, its all sticky and horrid, I have no idea what to do now, it&#x27;s wrecked my hair!...&lt;br /&gt;I really should have read reviews before hand because people have had the same problem. I usually use the normal shampoo and conditioner and a detangler which are all great, so when I saw this pop as something to try I didn&#x27;t hesitate, as I had high standards, it is awful! this stuff should not be used on hair, if you read the ingredients it has stuff like petroleum?! bees wax etc no no no, ugh my hair feels gross, I have no idea how I am going to get it out! disaster!</li>
            <li> I guess it works? It just oily and sticky stuff doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair really</li>
            <li> I had such great expectations for this product. I have my dominican curls and I wanted to grow my hair longer so I bought the set with the shampoo, conditioner, the leave in spray and this s**t. The moment I applied this on my hair, I knew I was doomed. Its thick!  You can&#x27;t really &amp;#34;STYLE AS USUAL&amp;#34; because your hair will be stuck, hard as a rock, and washing it out will take forever. This product is terrible. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Done.</li>
            <li> It is a great product, but obviously not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;First, my hair that is thick, coarser then the average female hair, very dry, wavy and frizzy.  This helps with the dryness and the frizz part.  If I rub some of it into my hair right after I wash them, then let it dry naturally, I end up with shiny, wavy hair that is not frizzy at all.  By &amp;#34;some of it&amp;#34; I mean maybe quarter-size.  I would suggest starting by just getting the smallest amount on your fingertips, rubbing it in and spreading with a comb.&lt;br /&gt;After using it in this way for about a month (I wash my hair about 2-3 times a week, not every day), I noticed a change in my hair.  They became softer, silkier, not as dry.  My hairdresser even commented on it.  I literally swear by this thing now.&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this on dry hair.  I try to use even less of it on those occasions, rub it into the driest and least manageable areas and wait for at least ten minutes before actually styling them.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I really dislike about this product is the smell.  I know most people like it, but it must be the matter of personal preference.  The smell is that of coconuts.  I cannot stand that smell for perfumes or other kind of beauty products.  Fortunately, it is not very lasting.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this for someone with the hair that is naturally very fine and soft, nor for someone with oily hair.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and I would def buy this product again!! This will help my hair out so much!! Thank you again!</li>
            <li> Ladies on hair journeys be ware this product contains two of the no no ingredients for black hair, mineral oil and petrolum and they are listed as the first two ingredients so although it says herbal gro. It&#x27;s going to clog your pores and cause your ends to break. Dont be fooled.  I accidently picked the wrong product will return. On a side note though mane n tail has a creme version of this it does not have maximum listed on the outside.  That is the good stuff for naturals it will leave your hair soft and manageable and it has a lot of good ingredients in it. Also for those of you who use Qhemet Biologic heavy olive and olive cream or the burdock root this (the herbal gro creme therapy it&#x27;s called) is a cheaper substitute same results.  save your haie</li>
            <li> I never brought a product that had this much grease in it I could have use it to make a couple of pies cause that is what the main ingredient to making pies is lard.</li>
            <li> People, you have to remember this is a GREASE so be careful not to over use it....My mother used this many years ago and it helped with growing out her hair... but she also used it with the Conditioner and Shampoo... so it does work, you just have to be light on the hair when using it...</li>
            <li> I love Straight Arrows shampoos, conditioner , and hoof cream. That being said I decided to give this a try. DO NOT EVEN RISK IT. This is like a thicker jar of petroleum jelly; seriously like green speckled cement hard goo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will make you hair oily, unmanageable , greasy, and an overall disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave this one to the horses and not for the humans</li>
            <li> This product grew my hair like crazy! Really nice smell, i use mostly on roots, maybe 3 or 4 times a week... I have natural 4a hair... good for sealing in moisture as well...</li>
            <li> Omg,I can&#x27;t get this out of my hair,I washed it 10 times and with washing up liquid and still it won&#x27;t come out.I&#x27;m so annoyed! How can this be good? X</li>
            <li> If giving zero stars was an option, I would have certainly selected that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually am looking for plenty of supplements and remedies to make my hair grow super strong and long so I thought I would give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;BAD IDEA&lt;br /&gt;This product is basically putting petroleum in your hair. My hair feels like a mess and it will take plenty of washing to get the small amount I put on out.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and avoid this product</li>
            <li> I used this for my horse&#x27;s mane as a detangler. I&#x27;ve been fighting with impossible knots since I got him, but this stuff took care of it! After 2 uses it&#x27;s now super soft and never tangles like it used to, not mention how much it grew in just a couple months. I LOVE it for my horses, but I couldn&#x27;t imagine using it on my own hair since it takes some time just washing it off my hands.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to be able to tell if there is any significant growth but my hair has seemed less damaged and isn&#x27;t breaking as easily. It also has a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> I have just started to use this product and looking at all of these comments saying that it makes your hair greasy, for mine it does not. My hair has got to be the finest and dull hair you can find and I have not experienced any greasy feeling in my hair from it. If you over load it yes, it may cause your hair to feel greasy, but if you use the right amount for the amount of hair you have, it should be fine.. There is no need to bash a product when you don&#x27;t know how to use it properly.</li>
            <li> AMAZING product. I cut my hair short to grow out all of my colored hair and let my silver shine! This product helps to keep my hair under control, soft and conditioned while its growing out. The key is to use just a smidge and work it through thoroughly. If you have trouble getting it out for some reason (I havent) then wet your hair, put conditioner in, work it through and rinse. THEN shampoo your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry to see the low rating for this otherwise wonderful product. I think it will take me awhile to go through this jar but I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> works great, smells like coconut oil. good product</li>
