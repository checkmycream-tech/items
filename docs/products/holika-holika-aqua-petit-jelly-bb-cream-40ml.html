            <li>Perfect for NC 20 .</li>
            <li>I have oily face, have some pimples but this BB Cream hides those acnes perfectly.</li>
            <li>that people are saying this is &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;way too light&amp;#34; because it ended up being a perfect match for my skin.</li>
            <li>but it seems to go on best using your fingertips.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a brush, the sponge it came with, but I found my fingers are the best tools for this product.</li>

            <li>This product, I&#x27;ve using many BB creams and foundations, but this is the perfect I ever used.</li>
            <li>Authentic and perfect!</li>
            <li>ive tried many from Missha M Perfect Cover to Skin Food Aloe to To Skin 79</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li>my shade complexion blends beautifully into my skin though and the seller is amazing</li>
            <li>The light shade matches my very fair skin beautifully.</li>
            <li>It had very good qualties that I&#x27;m sure will work for others.</li>
            <li>Granted my skin will eventually overpower anything, but this lasts fairly well and doesn&#x27;t seem to make me break out.  </li>
            <li>This is good.</li>
            <li>A good product, covers well, keeps my skin from getting oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m good ALL day.</li>
            <li>Good for my face.</li>
            <li>Excellent coverage but still light like a BB cream should be.</li>
            <li>reasons.&lt;br /&gt;Provided also, is a good sized sponge to use for blending onto the skin.</li>
            <li>(Would be good for oily skin also)</li>
            <li>Not that good.</li>
            <li>The color fits me perfectly, the consistency is nice, the packaging is cute, it gives good medium coverage</li>
            <li>It smells good.</li>
            <li>benefits here were that it did a fairly good job at controlling oil, and there is a TON of product.</li>
            <li>When used with a good primer and set with a good powder&lt;</li>
            <li>Be cream itself is also good.</li>
            <li>But not so good in concealing.</li>
            <li>The cream smells really good</li>
            <li>so far.&lt;br /&gt;This is a lighter bb cream, it feels water based but still gives good coverage.</li>
            <li>seemed to indicate that this was a good one to try.</li>
            <li>After using Etude House and being delighted with it, I wanted to see what else was out</li>
            <li>It has the perfect amount of coverage while still feeling light &amp; it smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the jelly texture of this and it smells so good!  </li>
            <li>It is more liquid than any foundation I have ever used, but it still has great coverage and is buildable.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice texture and it smells good as well.&lt;br /&gt;good</li>
            <li>Color matched well with my cool tone, very fair skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in LOVE with this BB cream!</li>
            <li>What I am sure of, is that my skin LOVES this jelly jewel juice!</li>
            <li>What I am sure of, is that my skin LOVES this jelly jewel juice!</li>
            <li>AND the bottle is cute- icing on the cake!</li>
            <li>The packing is so cute!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>me and my roommate both LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Cute packaging too!</li>
            <li>The packaging is so adorable!</li>
            <li>I love the sponge that comes w. It too!</li>
            <li>I have very fair, dry skin, the color matches perfect</li>
            <li>This fit perfectly and the Jelly/water-like substance spreads and absorbs easily.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product to anyone who likes the bright look of Korean products without the sometimes overwhelming dewy-almost-oily face look.</li>
            <li>but that is what makes it really amazing</li>
            <li>I recommend this product if you want light to medium coverage, it feels great in the skin and does not give cake grease feeling.</li>
            <li>I also using Etude Precious Mineral BB cream too, but this product is just good as Etude House&#x27;s BB cream.</li>
            <li>it feels really nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>I heard so many good reviews on this from youtube beauty gurus.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a really good match :)</li>
            <li>and this BB cream smells really nice</li>
            <li>I had been looking for something that feels lighter and better than foundation, but stills gives a good level of coverage, and I found it with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This BB is light as air, smells fantastic and covers my skin perfectly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving Korean BB creams.  </li>
            <li>The #1 would be for the more fair skinned...</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest</li>
            <li>However, the bottle and applicator sponge are really nice.</li>
            <li>Holika holika has some of the best smelling BB cream out there, this one is pleasant, with nice texture and does not have white cast when I put it on.</li>
            <li>The cool feeling after I apply this cream onto my face is so great too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply and have quite a good coverage, but doesn&#x27;t look like a mask or something like that...</li>
            <li>Absorbs to a smooth dewy finish and good staying power, coverage medium.</li>
            <li>But the thinness of the formula is its most amazing property.</li>
            <li>If you want a natural, flawless look (who doesn&#x27;t?)</li>
            <li>and it comes with a cute blending spunge that works amazing</li>
            <li>After reading that many people liked this product, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with a cute box packaging, the BB cream has a light pleasant scent with a spatula to apply the product, it doesn&#x27;t come sealed.</li>
            <li>jelly like to totally easy to blend!</li>
            <li>Also smells good and fresh!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I haven&#x27;t been so excited about make-up since I was 13 and allowed by Mom to use it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this BB Cream!</li>
            <li>Very light shade with</li>
            <li>Very light in color.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t purchase unless you have very light skin.</li>
            <li>To get the most out of your makeup, you should make sure that you have a great skincare regimen in the first place.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clearly for very fair people, so if you&#x27;re skin is medium or darker, it probably won&#x27;t work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also love the smell.</li>
            <li>Seen many times on youtube makeup tutorials.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I love the semi-matte finish.</li>
            <li>The packaging is adorable, it looks like a jelly.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this foundation, and I plan on ordering it again.</li>
            <li>It works well on top of a moisturizing makeup base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>: I experimented with different ways to use this BB cream; I found that mixing this with Etude House Nymph Aura Volumer yields the best results.</li>
            <li>The mixture creates a more dewy finish.</li>
            <li>I feel like this helps it to blend better and look more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>packaging is downright adorable.</li>
            <li>After searching Amazon and reading so many reviews my eyes got crossed, I ordered the \\&quot;Holika</li>
            <li>To clarify, if I put a swatch on my wrist up, it blends perfectly without ANY visible lines using outside, daytime lighting.</li>
            <li>However, it is Summer in TX, and it is noticeably lighter if I put the swatch on the top of my hand.</li>
            <li>Better still...</li>
            <li>still use and love this product.</li>
            <li>I still use and love this product.</li>
            <li>#34;jelly-like,&amp;#34; but it much more resembled curdled milk (ick).</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I love the coverage and the color.</li>
            <li>Most people love this because of its moisturizing properties, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, this product (drying matte) does not give the &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; K-Pop look that many BB and CC creams give.</li>
            <li>i love the feel of this BB cream.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The box itself is adorable, and the bottle does not disappoint.</li>
            <li>With a cute polka dot pattern on the lid, it is something you will want to display on your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to most things.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smooth coverage, is a lot of product for the money, and doesn&#x27;t bother my rosacea.</li>
            <li>I wanted do desperately to love this product however, this was not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the product is much better than BB creams from the US, but this product did not suit me.</li>
            <li>they give you free samples!</li>
            <li>So there are MANY reasons this is my favorite bbcream&lt;br /&gt;ive</li>
            <li>WAY BETTER BLEND ABILITY than missha which was my number one complaint&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>but the product can be more easier to blend and apply</li>
            <li>I tried it and then went and bought three more bottles so that I don&#x27;t run out.  </li>
            <li>instead I use the spatula to apply it on the top of my nose and under my eyes in a triangle shape and blend</li>
            <li>I tried to use a brush, then a makeup sponge, but hands are definitely the best tools for this stuff (just be sure to wash your hands before</li>
            <li>the smell is also really enjoyable.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>The applicator was a problem, because it was attached to the top part.</li>
            <li>Take care of your skin and use quality products that are appropriate for your skin type and you&#x27;ll have much better results with your makeup.</li>
            <li>Love it and shipping come on time</li>
            <li>I love it and you should buy it</li>
            <li>The texture is nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>Cute bottle too.</li>
            <li>Cute glass bottle.</li>
            <li>BTW, the color of the bb cream has a more orange tone.</li>
            <li>fairly well by itself too, so overall it&#x27;s a very nice product</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and red hair, yet the 01 tone matches pretty much perfectly.  </li>
            <li>great coverage, good for your skin and keeps my skin matte all day long.  </li>
            <li>easy blending texture, medium coverage ideal for natural nude makeup, non greasy and matches skin.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with it and decided it would be fun to try out another one of their products.</li>
            <li>This product has lasted me a long time and it is wonderful!</li>
            <li>This BB cream has pretty good coverage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I haven&#x27;t been so excited about make-up since I was 13 and allowed by Mom to use it!</li>
            <li>It definitely light up my skin and make my skin looks very natural and bright!</li>
            <li>Very lightweight and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this product is the best for my whole face, but I use it as an under-eye brightener sometimes which works much</li>
            <li>While my nose is often highly offended by many products, this one is pleasant.    </li>
            <li>The great thing about it being fluid is that it fills in pores and fine lines effectively.</li>
            <li>More importantly, my skin still adores it.</li>
            <li>More importantly, my skin still adores it.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the Holika Holika Clearing BB alongside this one and I enjoy it much more.</li>
            <li>When I put it on, it seemed to melt into my skin, giving it the appearance of becoming a part of my skin.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, this BB Cream covered the redness around my nose so well that by the end of the day I had almost fooled myself into believing that my skin naturally looked that great.</li>
            <li>I find it kind of funny</li>
            <li>It looks like a little molded gelatin :) The BB cream texture is very pleasant, it is cooling when you put it on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a keeper!ing in any of the Valleys of fine lines and folds when the day is done.    </li>
            <li>This product also settled into my fine lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Caucasian and normally wear &#x27;porcelain&#x27; shades, and #1 works OK for me, if just a teeny bit too warm.</li>
            <li>The spatula is great as it is more clean than using a regular bottle.</li>
            <li>hence when I apply a layer of this BB cream over it, it gives me an extremely smooth doll-like finish, so flawless that looks somewhat &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34; to me (I actually like to retain a bit of the blemish because it just seems more natural</li>
            <li>Smooth face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light to medium coverage and it is buildable.</li>
            <li>Lightly scented.</li>
            <li>year-round because the coverage is light,</li>
            <li>and I recently discovered that it works great as a concealer too.</li>
            <li>This is such a great BB cream.</li>
            <li>However, I found it too light for my skin tone</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because I have not tried out the product yet as it is too light atm.</li>
            <li>Even after contouring and applying a bit of bronzer it was way too light.</li>
            <li>This bb cream its really light</li>
            <li>Also, I DID like the smell of it, which is light and citrusy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s waaaaay too light to be considered a BB Cream.</li>
            <li>I bought the darkest shade, #02, and its still WAY too light.</li>
            <li>Lightly scented.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a great product that gives you medium coverage.</li>
            <li>This BB has a surprising amount of coverage, smells pretty, and the packaging is exactly as pictured (the polka dot lidded bottle).</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not using the right cleanser, and moisturizer you&#x27;re not going to be as pleased with ANY makeup you pick.</li>
            <li>Smells very fresh.</li>
            <li>This product is great for those with pale skin tone, it has an extremely smooth and flawless finish if you don&#x27;t have dry skin or patchy-rough texture to it.</li>
            <li>I try and do as much research as I can for products, this one seemed like a pretty good bet.</li>
            <li>and my skin is actually pretty light compared to most people.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many kinds and the Holika Holika Aqua Jelly has become my new favorite.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t reflect light too well, but does an excellent job of brightening any dull spots.</li>
            <li>and it is easy to apply, which gives you a fresh look</li>
            <li>The soft fragrance from the mint water is really nice and clean.</li>
            <li>color is light with a golden undertone.</li>
            <li>Lighter, very oily skinned girls may fare better.</li>
            <li>I have cool toned skin</li>
            <li>at a very affordable price, this is the makeup for you. :]</li>
            <li>I like full coverage and have some acne scarring</li>
            <li>nice coverage and looks natural.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s a little large for travel, so this is probably best used at home.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but seriously is the best in evening out your skin(dark circles, hyperpigmentation, blemish marks ect...)</li>
            <li>Luckily, that&#x27;s what moisturizer and brushes (or your fingers) are for.</li>
            <li>This BB Cream is super drying.</li>
            <li>It does have a mild cooling feel.</li>
            <li>only redeeming part of this product was the packaging--it&#x27;s adorable.</li>
            <li>While my nose is often highly offended by many products, this one is pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normal bb creams make my oil combo skin just fill with even more oil however</li>
            <li>However, if I apply a thicker lotion to smoothen it out and then apply the BB cream on top of it, it should be fine, it will not look flaky as long as my skin is moist and smooth underneath it.</li>
            <li>I love the jelly texture and scent, a little of the product goes a long way, and it leaves a perfect dewy finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love trying different BB creams and so far, this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice everyday kind of coverage, but just a little off for me since I&#x27;m so fair.</li>
            <li>I really like the light weight feeling on my face.</li>
            <li>My T-Zone only needed 1 blot, on a really warm day.</li>
            <li>and I like that it is open and comes with a spatula so that you can get to all of the product, which for the price, is a nice amount.  </li>
            <li>in all, it is my favorite bb cream by far.</li>
            <li>This is the most natural looking makeup I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a quite good coverage, rather thick, my skin isn&#x27;t flawless but I only have a few, very very light acne blemish here and there, they&#x27;re almost unnoticeable,</li>
            <li>and it provides just the right amount of coverage for me though it is not buildable</li>
            <li>They enhanced all right ~ the aging factor!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it still wasn&#x27;t quite right.</li>
            <li>and I tend to wash my make up off right when I get home.</li>
            <li>to light for me, normally the lightest of shades is too dark/</li>
            <li>, this just keeps my skin nice and matte all day long.</li>
            <li>I work for a High end cosmetic counter in a multi retailer store &amp; I have tried so many foundations &amp; bb creams both drug store &amp; high end.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s get real!), but rather creates a slight luminous glow which makes my skin look almost perfect from a short distance away, or in somewhat dimmer lighting.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s get real!), but rather creates a slight luminous glow which makes my skin look almost perfect from a short distance away, or in somewhat dimmer lighting.</li>
            <li>But, it should cover most mild to moderate skin flaws on the first coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was afraid the color would be too light, but it&#x27;s really perfect for me and does blend well.</li>
            <li>it definitely matches my skin(hard to find anything that does) and goes on light and smooth.</li>
            <li>This BB cream is easy on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It does make my dry patches more visible since I have very dry skin, but i can fix that by exfoliating and using a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is nice a blend like loose pudding not quite liquid and not quite cream.  </li>
            <li>not gonna lie, this doesnt have very much coverage</li>
            <li>Curious, I hit Google for research and discovered the original, most touted and expounded upon bb creams, were out of Asia.</li>
            <li>The other thing is, while it does a good job of covering, it dries to a matte finish REALLY fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only thing with this BB cream is, it works great when my skin is nice and smooth, but during the winters my skin can get a little dry and this BB cream</li>
            <li>After all these years, there&#x27;s a total of 3 BB/CC creams/foundations I&#x27;ve used: holika holika aqua petit jelly BB cream, holika holika petit BB cream, and miss hana CC cream, and I love 2 of the 3,</li>
            <li>It is dewy when first applied and has a matte finish to it.</li>
            <li>which is why I only use this when I want to look more done-up.</li>
            <li>The bottle that it comes in is so pretty</li>
            <li>i really recommend this bb cream!</li>
            <li>had mostly given up on makeup for my aging skin (I&#x27;m in my mid 50s).</li>
            <li>first bb cream purchase was a drugstore brand.</li>
            <li>I have recently ordered the #2 shade  with the hope it will work better with my Summer, Sun-smooched skin color.</li>
            <li>When I wash my face at the end of the night, the snake cell, skin shedding issue I&#x27;ve been fighting with so many different products since the onset of menopause, is G-O-N-E!</li>
            <li>the \\&quot;cake\\&quot; factor, which I absolutely detest!</li>
            <li>When I wash my face at the end of the night, the snake cell, skin shedding issue I&#x27;ve been fighting with so many different products since the onset of menopause, is G-O-N-E!</li>
            <li>the \\&quot;cake\\&quot; factor, which I absolutely detest!</li>
            <li>I had higher expectations for this product.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells, it feels light on the skin, but it&#x27;s just a hint too dark for my skin.</li>
            <li>If you are Asian type skin, you will love this BB cream</li>
            <li>Really fun texture and it evens out my skin tone really well.</li>
            <li>so I got it in the first shade</li>
            <li>Its better for your skin and cheaper than these overpriced american brands.  </li>
            <li>Its very moisturize also!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to cover, especially if you use the sponge it comes with (or your favorite beauty sponge).</li>
            <li>have used many BB creams and foundations before this one and I will never go back.</li>
            <li>really just adore this stuff!</li>
            <li>so I might try the more yellow shade.</li>
            <li>blended in pretty well on my cheeks but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way easier to apply, the oil control is better, it doesn&#x27;t make me look like I&#x27;m dead, and it does not settle into my fine lines.</li>
            <li>Overall though I really dig it. :)</li>
            <li>, it makes my skin look very natural but at the same time it has a great coverage, the texture of this bb cream its different</li>
            <li>When first taking it out of the box, I noticed that it is a fairly large glass bottle and that you get a lot of product for your money.</li>
            <li>First off, this is a large bottle.</li>
            <li>It dries very fast and is very matte.</li>
            <li>the aqua petit (I use this for more formal occasions due to the thicker, more &amp;#34;flawless&amp;#34; coverage) and miss hana cc cream (this one is my go-to foundation, light coverage but looks extremely natural).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used many Korean BB and CC creams and this is the first one I&#x27;ve used that is just DRY.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s not a single River running in any of the Valleys of fine lines and folds when the day is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I can see myself using this one for a long time since I decided to give my skin a break : )</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream over the holika holika petit BB cream because the aqua jelly doesn&#x27;t give me as much breakout, I might get 1 tiny acne by the end of the day compared to the holika petit where it gives me a whole bunch of acnes and makes my skin itchy afterwards</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and delivery, product arrived with box crushed, but doesn&#x27;t matter since the bottle and sponge are ok.</li>
            <li>You have to blend it out very quickly when you put it on, or else it will start drying, so I suggest only applying it to one section of your face at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>Moisturize underneath if you have dry skin- also helps the cream blend better.</li>
            <li>I had my photo taken professionally last month and while some people might not risk the slightly glossy finish, I think that this looked great on camera.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>really like the Aqua/ jelly consistency.</li>
            <li>really like this BB cream.</li>
            <li>My current \\&quot;fix\\&quot; is using a light dusting of a closer matching mineral powder (Physicians Formula brand).</li>
            <li>I think this would work well for people with drier skin because it is very moisturizing and seems to melt into your skin, so it does not bring out flakes.</li>
            <li>very fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this BB cream.  </li>
            <li>and you have to blend it in fast before it dries</li>
            <li>or you may see a bit of a white or light residue.</li>
            <li>Deliveries fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I think the thing that really sells it is the &#x27;aqua&#x27; consistency.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also seems to work really well with my skin being so oily.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone looking for an alternative to foundation or who just wants to improve their skin.</li>
            <li>You should also be aware that while it goes on easily, it also dries quickly, so there is a small learning curve to apply it</li>
            <li>It covers most of your pores, and other troubles.</li>
            <li>I still like this BB cream even with these cons because it feels more like a skin care product than other BB creams out there.</li>
            <li>Since I am the only one using it with clean hands</li>
            <li>very watery , and super white.</li>
            <li>It holds just about as long as any BB cream would, and it&#x27;s so light that you fell like your not wearing anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>if you are someone who needs medium to full coverage, it gets sticky and does not blend well with a second coat.  </li>
            <li>Light, natural,and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>The coverage evened out my skin tone which tends to be slightly blotchy, however I did notice that it also settled into my pores, making them more noticeable instead of covering them&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>The Aqua Jelly has decent coverage for pores, acne scars and redness</li>
            <li>While I really want to love this product, there are a few drawbacks that I cannot ignore.</li>
            <li>It whitens skin and has decent coverage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really pale, I&#x27;m a fair skinned red head</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this makeup.</li>
            <li>This is partially why I wanted to try it, because the reviews claimed that it was so light</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and very prone to whiteheads as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have tried ten different Korean BB creams and this is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin and it works well for me, I like it.</li>
            <li>really do like the application too, the spatula is a unique touch compared to other bb cream applicators.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to last a long time even when my skin is at its most oily.</li>
            <li>only makes that dry part even more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I have pink undertones whereas this is more yellow.</li>
            <li>The only minus is that I wish it came in more shades.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what the magic is in this stuff (you can read the ingredients for yourself on the box).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what the magic is in this stuff (you can read the ingredients for yourself on the box).</li>
            <li>WOW!    </li>
            <li>I have very, very fair skin (I have trouble finding foundation pale enough to match my skin tone)</li>
            <li>I was really surprised!</li>
            <li>so I mix it with an American tinted moisturizer first.</li>
            <li>This bb cream, like many other korean bb creams turns your skin vampire white.</li>
            <li>Using a brush, or wet sponge/beauty blender is probably the easiest way to apply this BB cream unless you can move quickly with your fingers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried at least 20 American and Korean BB creams over the past year to figure out what works best as a cosmetic and a skin care product.</li>
            <li>It actually covers better than most of my regular foundations without having to add extra layers and a little goes a LONG way.  </li>
            <li>The cap is cute and girly and the bottle itself feels nice and heavy, like a lot of expensive makeup products.</li>
            <li>Great for this time of year when it&#x27;s cold and windy.</li>
            <li>but you will still need a concealer if you have pimples you want to hide completely.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft as my GrandBaby&#x27;s cheeks, and that&#x27;s BEFORE I put on my nighttime moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover them completely (Do any of them?</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft as my GrandBaby&#x27;s cheeks, and that&#x27;s BEFORE I put on my nighttime moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover them completely (Do any of them?</li>
            <li>I noticed that the makeup was very runny when I put some on the back of my hand.</li>
            <li>it dries on your face, it looks incredibly natural.</li>
            <li>Much nicer than any American brand I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks extremely natural.</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised by the level of coverage this has.</li>
            <li>Really the only downside is the stay factor; this foundation is one of those that rubs off and leaves tell-tale makeup smudges on my phone.</li>
            <li>it looked completely natural.</li>
            <li>Natural finish.  </li>
            <li>Not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin that breaks out with almost every foundation.</li>
            <li>however the \\&quot;cream\\&quot; has an applicator attached to the green top so once opened, you dont have to use your hands on the product itself which is terrific for hygiene</li>
            <li>much larger than your typical BB cream tube, more like the size of an american foundation.</li>
            <li>It evens out my skin tone to a degree previously not seen without \\&quot;layering\\&quot; products...</li>
            <li>It evens out my skin tone to a degree previously not seen without \\&quot;layering\\&quot; products...</li>
            <li>I actually use this along with my moisturizer because it has no negative effects.</li>
            <li>Perhaps this works for some people, but if you have fair skin, rosy undertones, or any need of coverage, there are far better products out there for you to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cute idea and gimmick, but terrible execution.</li>
            <li>It dries with a very matte finish that accentuates any dry spots.</li>
            <li>I  bought the first shade due to</li>
            <li>, I have combination skin (oily on the nose, sensitive on cheeks, could be dry atcertain times, and normal on forehead</li>
            <li>I used it the first day and tossed it because I have my own sponges, which don&#x27;t smell bad like this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that the first ingredient is titanium dioxide, a non-chemical sunscreen that, according to ewg.org, is not absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Then I go back a few minutes later and tap a tiny bit more where I need extra coverage.</li>
            <li>a 4 - had it been a little lighter without slightly making my pores more</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the way it made my skin a little bit lighter, but in certain lights it seriously looked like I was wearing clown makeup.</li>
            <li>It does not come with near as much product, but it is usually a little cheaper</li>
            <li>As I do have some enlarged pores &amp; pits from long ago and far away acne issues, I felt that was a plus, and it is!</li>
            <li>It was a little tricky to figure out how to put it on at first.</li>
            <li>I ordered This product in #2; It dries very very quickly and is very hard to spread out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pale</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on my skin very long it was also very hard to blend even with the sponge it brings which is still a lot better than trying to apply it with your fingers.</li>
            <li>I started buying this a few years ago because I have very pale Irish skin, and even the lightest shade of most drugstore foundations looked orange on me.</li>
            <li>For anyone like me who has sensitive skin, I was at first nervous about the fact that it has sunscreen and is scented ( my skin normally responds poorly to these things), but I have not had a single problem using this product.</li>

            <li> I have oily face, have some pimples but this BB Cream hides those acnes perfectly.</li>

            <li> Authentic and perfect!</li>
            <li> ive tried many from Missha M Perfect Cover to Skin Food Aloe to To Skin 79</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> my shade complexion blends beautifully into my skin though and the seller is amazing</li>
            <li> The light shade matches my very fair skin beautifully.</li>
            <li> It had very good qualties that I&#x27;m sure will work for others.</li>
            <li> Granted my skin will eventually overpower anything, but this lasts fairly well and doesn&#x27;t seem to make me break out.  </li>
            <li> This is good.</li>
            <li> A good product, covers well, keeps my skin from getting oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m good ALL day.</li>
            <li> Good for my face.</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage but still light like a BB cream should be.</li>
            <li> reasons.&lt;br /&gt;Provided also, is a good sized sponge to use for blending onto the skin.</li>
            <li> (Would be good for oily skin also)</li>
            <li> Not that good.</li>
            <li> The color fits me perfectly, the consistency is nice, the packaging is cute, it gives good medium coverage</li>
            <li> It smells good.</li>
            <li> benefits here were that it did a fairly good job at controlling oil, and there is a TON of product.</li>
            <li> When used with a good primer and set with a good powder&lt;</li>
            <li> Be cream itself is also good.</li>
            <li> But not so good in concealing.</li>
            <li> The cream smells really good</li>
            <li> so far.&lt;br /&gt;This is a lighter bb cream, it feels water based but still gives good coverage.</li>
            <li> seemed to indicate that this was a good one to try.</li>
            <li> After using Etude House and being delighted with it, I wanted to see what else was out</li>
            <li> It has the perfect amount of coverage while still feeling light &amp; it smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love the jelly texture of this and it smells so good!  </li>
            <li> It is more liquid than any foundation I have ever used, but it still has great coverage and is buildable.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice texture and it smells good as well.&lt;br /&gt;good</li>
            <li> Color matched well with my cool tone, very fair skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in LOVE with this BB cream!</li>
            <li> What I am sure of, is that my skin LOVES this jelly jewel juice!</li>
            <li> What I am sure of, is that my skin LOVES this jelly jewel juice!</li>

            <li> The packing is so cute!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> me and my roommate both LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Cute packaging too!</li>
            <li> The packaging is so adorable!</li>
            <li> I love the sponge that comes w. It too!</li>
            <li> I have very fair, dry skin, the color matches perfect</li>
            <li> This fit perfectly and the Jelly/water-like substance spreads and absorbs easily.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to anyone who likes the bright look of Korean products without the sometimes overwhelming dewy-almost-oily face look.</li>
            <li> but that is what makes it really amazing</li>
            <li> I recommend this product if you want light to medium coverage, it feels great in the skin and does not give cake grease feeling.</li>
            <li> I also using Etude Precious Mineral BB cream too, but this product is just good as Etude House&#x27;s BB cream.</li>
            <li> it feels really nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> I heard so many good reviews on this from youtube beauty gurus.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a really good match :)</li>
            <li> and this BB cream smells really nice</li>
            <li> I had been looking for something that feels lighter and better than foundation, but stills gives a good level of coverage, and I found it with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This BB is light as air, smells fantastic and covers my skin perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving Korean BB creams.  </li>
            <li> The #1 would be for the more fair skinned...</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest</li>
            <li> However, the bottle and applicator sponge are really nice.</li>
            <li> Holika holika has some of the best smelling BB cream out there, this one is pleasant, with nice texture and does not have white cast when I put it on.</li>
            <li> The cool feeling after I apply this cream onto my face is so great too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply and have quite a good coverage, but doesn&#x27;t look like a mask or something like that...</li>
            <li> Absorbs to a smooth dewy finish and good staying power, coverage medium.</li>
            <li> But the thinness of the formula is its most amazing property.</li>
            <li> If you want a natural, flawless look (who doesn&#x27;t?)</li>
            <li> and it comes with a cute blending spunge that works amazing</li>
            <li> After reading that many people liked this product, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a cute box packaging, the BB cream has a light pleasant scent with a spatula to apply the product, it doesn&#x27;t come sealed.</li>
            <li> jelly like to totally easy to blend!</li>
            <li> Also smells good and fresh!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I haven&#x27;t been so excited about make-up since I was 13 and allowed by Mom to use it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this BB Cream!</li>
            <li> Very light shade with</li>
            <li> Very light in color.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t purchase unless you have very light skin.</li>
            <li> To get the most out of your makeup, you should make sure that you have a great skincare regimen in the first place.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clearly for very fair people, so if you&#x27;re skin is medium or darker, it probably won&#x27;t work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also love the smell.</li>
            <li> Seen many times on youtube makeup tutorials.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I love the semi-matte finish.</li>
            <li> The packaging is adorable, it looks like a jelly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this foundation, and I plan on ordering it again.</li>
            <li> It works well on top of a moisturizing makeup base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> : I experimented with different ways to use this BB cream; I found that mixing this with Etude House Nymph Aura Volumer yields the best results.</li>
            <li> The mixture creates a more dewy finish.</li>
            <li> I feel like this helps it to blend better and look more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> packaging is downright adorable.</li>
            <li> After searching Amazon and reading so many reviews my eyes got crossed, I ordered the \\&quot;Holika</li>
            <li> To clarify, if I put a swatch on my wrist up, it blends perfectly without ANY visible lines using outside, daytime lighting.</li>
            <li> However, it is Summer in TX, and it is noticeably lighter if I put the swatch on the top of my hand.</li>
            <li> Better still...</li>
            <li> still use and love this product.</li>
            <li> I still use and love this product.</li>
            <li> #34;jelly-like,&amp;#34; but it much more resembled curdled milk (ick).</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I love the coverage and the color.</li>
            <li> Most people love this because of its moisturizing properties, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, this product (drying matte) does not give the &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; K-Pop look that many BB and CC creams give.</li>
            <li> i love the feel of this BB cream.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The box itself is adorable, and the bottle does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> With a cute polka dot pattern on the lid, it is something you will want to display on your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most things.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smooth coverage, is a lot of product for the money, and doesn&#x27;t bother my rosacea.</li>
            <li> I wanted do desperately to love this product however, this was not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the product is much better than BB creams from the US, but this product did not suit me.</li>
            <li> they give you free samples!</li>
            <li> So there are MANY reasons this is my favorite bbcream&lt;br /&gt;ive</li>
            <li> WAY BETTER BLEND ABILITY than missha which was my number one complaint&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> but the product can be more easier to blend and apply</li>
            <li> I tried it and then went and bought three more bottles so that I don&#x27;t run out.  </li>
            <li> instead I use the spatula to apply it on the top of my nose and under my eyes in a triangle shape and blend</li>
            <li> I tried to use a brush, then a makeup sponge, but hands are definitely the best tools for this stuff (just be sure to wash your hands before</li>
            <li> the smell is also really enjoyable.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> The applicator was a problem, because it was attached to the top part.</li>
            <li> Take care of your skin and use quality products that are appropriate for your skin type and you&#x27;ll have much better results with your makeup.</li>
            <li> Love it and shipping come on time</li>
            <li> I love it and you should buy it</li>
            <li> The texture is nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> LOVE.</li>
            <li> Cute bottle too.</li>
            <li> Cute glass bottle.</li>
            <li> BTW, the color of the bb cream has a more orange tone.</li>
            <li> fairly well by itself too, so overall it&#x27;s a very nice product</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and red hair, yet the 01 tone matches pretty much perfectly.  </li>
            <li> great coverage, good for your skin and keeps my skin matte all day long.  </li>
            <li> easy blending texture, medium coverage ideal for natural nude makeup, non greasy and matches skin.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with it and decided it would be fun to try out another one of their products.</li>
            <li> This product has lasted me a long time and it is wonderful!</li>
            <li> This BB cream has pretty good coverage.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I haven&#x27;t been so excited about make-up since I was 13 and allowed by Mom to use it!</li>
            <li> It definitely light up my skin and make my skin looks very natural and bright!</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is the best for my whole face, but I use it as an under-eye brightener sometimes which works much</li>
            <li> While my nose is often highly offended by many products, this one is pleasant.    </li>
            <li> The great thing about it being fluid is that it fills in pores and fine lines effectively.</li>
            <li> More importantly, my skin still adores it.</li>
            <li> More importantly, my skin still adores it.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the Holika Holika Clearing BB alongside this one and I enjoy it much more.</li>
            <li> When I put it on, it seemed to melt into my skin, giving it the appearance of becoming a part of my skin.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, this BB Cream covered the redness around my nose so well that by the end of the day I had almost fooled myself into believing that my skin naturally looked that great.</li>
            <li> I find it kind of funny</li>
            <li> It looks like a little molded gelatin :) The BB cream texture is very pleasant, it is cooling when you put it on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a keeper!ing in any of the Valleys of fine lines and folds when the day is done.    </li>
            <li> This product also settled into my fine lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Caucasian and normally wear &#x27;porcelain&#x27; shades, and #1 works OK for me, if just a teeny bit too warm.</li>
            <li> The spatula is great as it is more clean than using a regular bottle.</li>
            <li> hence when I apply a layer of this BB cream over it, it gives me an extremely smooth doll-like finish, so flawless that looks somewhat &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34; to me (I actually like to retain a bit of the blemish because it just seems more natural</li>
            <li> Smooth face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light to medium coverage and it is buildable.</li>
            <li> Lightly scented.</li>
            <li> year-round because the coverage is light,</li>
            <li> and I recently discovered that it works great as a concealer too.</li>
            <li> This is such a great BB cream.</li>
            <li> However, I found it too light for my skin tone</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because I have not tried out the product yet as it is too light atm.</li>
            <li> Even after contouring and applying a bit of bronzer it was way too light.</li>
            <li> This bb cream its really light</li>
            <li> Also, I DID like the smell of it, which is light and citrusy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waaaaay too light to be considered a BB Cream.</li>
            <li> I bought the darkest shade, #02, and its still WAY too light.</li>
            <li> Lightly scented.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a great product that gives you medium coverage.</li>
            <li> This BB has a surprising amount of coverage, smells pretty, and the packaging is exactly as pictured (the polka dot lidded bottle).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not using the right cleanser, and moisturizer you&#x27;re not going to be as pleased with ANY makeup you pick.</li>
            <li> Smells very fresh.</li>
            <li> This product is great for those with pale skin tone, it has an extremely smooth and flawless finish if you don&#x27;t have dry skin or patchy-rough texture to it.</li>
            <li> I try and do as much research as I can for products, this one seemed like a pretty good bet.</li>
            <li> and my skin is actually pretty light compared to most people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many kinds and the Holika Holika Aqua Jelly has become my new favorite.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t reflect light too well, but does an excellent job of brightening any dull spots.</li>
            <li> and it is easy to apply, which gives you a fresh look</li>
            <li> The soft fragrance from the mint water is really nice and clean.</li>
            <li> color is light with a golden undertone.</li>
            <li> Lighter, very oily skinned girls may fare better.</li>
            <li> I have cool toned skin</li>
            <li> at a very affordable price, this is the makeup for you. :]</li>
            <li> I like full coverage and have some acne scarring</li>
            <li> nice coverage and looks natural.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s a little large for travel, so this is probably best used at home.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but seriously is the best in evening out your skin(dark circles, hyperpigmentation, blemish marks ect...)</li>
            <li> Luckily, that&#x27;s what moisturizer and brushes (or your fingers) are for.</li>
            <li> This BB Cream is super drying.</li>
            <li> It does have a mild cooling feel.</li>
            <li> only redeeming part of this product was the packaging--it&#x27;s adorable.</li>
            <li> While my nose is often highly offended by many products, this one is pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normal bb creams make my oil combo skin just fill with even more oil however</li>
            <li> However, if I apply a thicker lotion to smoothen it out and then apply the BB cream on top of it, it should be fine, it will not look flaky as long as my skin is moist and smooth underneath it.</li>
            <li> I love the jelly texture and scent, a little of the product goes a long way, and it leaves a perfect dewy finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love trying different BB creams and so far, this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice everyday kind of coverage, but just a little off for me since I&#x27;m so fair.</li>
            <li> I really like the light weight feeling on my face.</li>
            <li> My T-Zone only needed 1 blot, on a really warm day.</li>
            <li> and I like that it is open and comes with a spatula so that you can get to all of the product, which for the price, is a nice amount.  </li>
            <li> in all, it is my favorite bb cream by far.</li>
            <li> This is the most natural looking makeup I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a quite good coverage, rather thick, my skin isn&#x27;t flawless but I only have a few, very very light acne blemish here and there, they&#x27;re almost unnoticeable,</li>
            <li> and it provides just the right amount of coverage for me though it is not buildable</li>
            <li> They enhanced all right ~ the aging factor!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it still wasn&#x27;t quite right.</li>
            <li> and I tend to wash my make up off right when I get home.</li>
            <li> to light for me, normally the lightest of shades is too dark/</li>
            <li> , this just keeps my skin nice and matte all day long.</li>
            <li> I work for a High end cosmetic counter in a multi retailer store &amp; I have tried so many foundations &amp; bb creams both drug store &amp; high end.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s get real!), but rather creates a slight luminous glow which makes my skin look almost perfect from a short distance away, or in somewhat dimmer lighting.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s get real!), but rather creates a slight luminous glow which makes my skin look almost perfect from a short distance away, or in somewhat dimmer lighting.</li>
            <li> But, it should cover most mild to moderate skin flaws on the first coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was afraid the color would be too light, but it&#x27;s really perfect for me and does blend well.</li>
            <li> it definitely matches my skin(hard to find anything that does) and goes on light and smooth.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is easy on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It does make my dry patches more visible since I have very dry skin, but i can fix that by exfoliating and using a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is nice a blend like loose pudding not quite liquid and not quite cream.  </li>
            <li> not gonna lie, this doesnt have very much coverage</li>
            <li> Curious, I hit Google for research and discovered the original, most touted and expounded upon bb creams, were out of Asia.</li>
            <li> The other thing is, while it does a good job of covering, it dries to a matte finish REALLY fast</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only thing with this BB cream is, it works great when my skin is nice and smooth, but during the winters my skin can get a little dry and this BB cream</li>
            <li> After all these years, there&#x27;s a total of 3 BB/CC creams/foundations I&#x27;ve used: holika holika aqua petit jelly BB cream, holika holika petit BB cream, and miss hana CC cream, and I love 2 of the 3,</li>
            <li> It is dewy when first applied and has a matte finish to it.</li>
            <li> which is why I only use this when I want to look more done-up.</li>
            <li> The bottle that it comes in is so pretty</li>
            <li> i really recommend this bb cream!</li>
            <li> had mostly given up on makeup for my aging skin (I&#x27;m in my mid 50s).</li>
            <li> first bb cream purchase was a drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> I have recently ordered the #2 shade  with the hope it will work better with my Summer, Sun-smooched skin color.</li>
            <li> When I wash my face at the end of the night, the snake cell, skin shedding issue I&#x27;ve been fighting with so many different products since the onset of menopause, is G-O-N-E!</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;cake\\&quot; factor, which I absolutely detest!</li>
            <li> When I wash my face at the end of the night, the snake cell, skin shedding issue I&#x27;ve been fighting with so many different products since the onset of menopause, is G-O-N-E!</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;cake\\&quot; factor, which I absolutely detest!</li>
            <li> I had higher expectations for this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells, it feels light on the skin, but it&#x27;s just a hint too dark for my skin.</li>
            <li> If you are Asian type skin, you will love this BB cream</li>
            <li> Really fun texture and it evens out my skin tone really well.</li>
            <li> so I got it in the first shade</li>
            <li> Its better for your skin and cheaper than these overpriced american brands.  </li>
            <li> Its very moisturize also!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to cover, especially if you use the sponge it comes with (or your favorite beauty sponge).</li>
            <li> have used many BB creams and foundations before this one and I will never go back.</li>
            <li> really just adore this stuff!</li>
            <li> so I might try the more yellow shade.</li>
            <li> blended in pretty well on my cheeks but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way easier to apply, the oil control is better, it doesn&#x27;t make me look like I&#x27;m dead, and it does not settle into my fine lines.</li>
            <li> Overall though I really dig it. :)</li>
            <li> , it makes my skin look very natural but at the same time it has a great coverage, the texture of this bb cream its different</li>
            <li> When first taking it out of the box, I noticed that it is a fairly large glass bottle and that you get a lot of product for your money.</li>
            <li> First off, this is a large bottle.</li>
            <li> It dries very fast and is very matte.</li>
            <li> the aqua petit (I use this for more formal occasions due to the thicker, more &amp;#34;flawless&amp;#34; coverage) and miss hana cc cream (this one is my go-to foundation, light coverage but looks extremely natural).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used many Korean BB and CC creams and this is the first one I&#x27;ve used that is just DRY.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s not a single River running in any of the Valleys of fine lines and folds when the day is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I can see myself using this one for a long time since I decided to give my skin a break : )</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream over the holika holika petit BB cream because the aqua jelly doesn&#x27;t give me as much breakout, I might get 1 tiny acne by the end of the day compared to the holika petit where it gives me a whole bunch of acnes and makes my skin itchy afterwards</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and delivery, product arrived with box crushed, but doesn&#x27;t matter since the bottle and sponge are ok.</li>
            <li> You have to blend it out very quickly when you put it on, or else it will start drying, so I suggest only applying it to one section of your face at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> Moisturize underneath if you have dry skin- also helps the cream blend better.</li>
            <li> I had my photo taken professionally last month and while some people might not risk the slightly glossy finish, I think that this looked great on camera.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> really like the Aqua/ jelly consistency.</li>
            <li> really like this BB cream.</li>
            <li> My current \\&quot;fix\\&quot; is using a light dusting of a closer matching mineral powder (Physicians Formula brand).</li>
            <li> I think this would work well for people with drier skin because it is very moisturizing and seems to melt into your skin, so it does not bring out flakes.</li>
            <li> very fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this BB cream.  </li>
            <li> and you have to blend it in fast before it dries</li>
            <li> or you may see a bit of a white or light residue.</li>
            <li> Deliveries fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I think the thing that really sells it is the &#x27;aqua&#x27; consistency.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also seems to work really well with my skin being so oily.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone looking for an alternative to foundation or who just wants to improve their skin.</li>
            <li> You should also be aware that while it goes on easily, it also dries quickly, so there is a small learning curve to apply it</li>
            <li> It covers most of your pores, and other troubles.</li>
            <li> I still like this BB cream even with these cons because it feels more like a skin care product than other BB creams out there.</li>
            <li> Since I am the only one using it with clean hands</li>
            <li> very watery , and super white.</li>
            <li> It holds just about as long as any BB cream would, and it&#x27;s so light that you fell like your not wearing anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> if you are someone who needs medium to full coverage, it gets sticky and does not blend well with a second coat.  </li>
            <li> Light, natural,and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> The coverage evened out my skin tone which tends to be slightly blotchy, however I did notice that it also settled into my pores, making them more noticeable instead of covering them&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> The Aqua Jelly has decent coverage for pores, acne scars and redness</li>
            <li> While I really want to love this product, there are a few drawbacks that I cannot ignore.</li>
            <li> It whitens skin and has decent coverage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pale, I&#x27;m a fair skinned red head</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this makeup.</li>
            <li> This is partially why I wanted to try it, because the reviews claimed that it was so light</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and very prone to whiteheads as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried ten different Korean BB creams and this is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin and it works well for me, I like it.</li>
            <li> really do like the application too, the spatula is a unique touch compared to other bb cream applicators.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to last a long time even when my skin is at its most oily.</li>
            <li> only makes that dry part even more noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have pink undertones whereas this is more yellow.</li>
            <li> The only minus is that I wish it came in more shades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what the magic is in this stuff (you can read the ingredients for yourself on the box).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the magic is in this stuff (you can read the ingredients for yourself on the box).</li>
            <li> WOW!    </li>
            <li> I have very, very fair skin (I have trouble finding foundation pale enough to match my skin tone)</li>
            <li> I was really surprised!</li>
            <li> so I mix it with an American tinted moisturizer first.</li>
            <li> This bb cream, like many other korean bb creams turns your skin vampire white.</li>
            <li> Using a brush, or wet sponge/beauty blender is probably the easiest way to apply this BB cream unless you can move quickly with your fingers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least 20 American and Korean BB creams over the past year to figure out what works best as a cosmetic and a skin care product.</li>
            <li> It actually covers better than most of my regular foundations without having to add extra layers and a little goes a LONG way.  </li>
            <li> The cap is cute and girly and the bottle itself feels nice and heavy, like a lot of expensive makeup products.</li>
            <li> Great for this time of year when it&#x27;s cold and windy.</li>
            <li> but you will still need a concealer if you have pimples you want to hide completely.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft as my GrandBaby&#x27;s cheeks, and that&#x27;s BEFORE I put on my nighttime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover them completely (Do any of them?</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft as my GrandBaby&#x27;s cheeks, and that&#x27;s BEFORE I put on my nighttime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover them completely (Do any of them?</li>
            <li> I noticed that the makeup was very runny when I put some on the back of my hand.</li>
            <li> it dries on your face, it looks incredibly natural.</li>
            <li> Much nicer than any American brand I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks extremely natural.</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised by the level of coverage this has.</li>
            <li> Really the only downside is the stay factor; this foundation is one of those that rubs off and leaves tell-tale makeup smudges on my phone.</li>
            <li> it looked completely natural.</li>
            <li> Natural finish.  </li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin that breaks out with almost every foundation.</li>
            <li> however the \\&quot;cream\\&quot; has an applicator attached to the green top so once opened, you dont have to use your hands on the product itself which is terrific for hygiene</li>
            <li> much larger than your typical BB cream tube, more like the size of an american foundation.</li>
            <li> It evens out my skin tone to a degree previously not seen without \\&quot;layering\\&quot; products...</li>
            <li> It evens out my skin tone to a degree previously not seen without \\&quot;layering\\&quot; products...</li>
            <li> I actually use this along with my moisturizer because it has no negative effects.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this works for some people, but if you have fair skin, rosy undertones, or any need of coverage, there are far better products out there for you to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cute idea and gimmick, but terrible execution.</li>
            <li> It dries with a very matte finish that accentuates any dry spots.</li>
            <li> I  bought the first shade due to</li>
            <li> , I have combination skin (oily on the nose, sensitive on cheeks, could be dry atcertain times, and normal on forehead</li>
            <li> I used it the first day and tossed it because I have my own sponges, which don&#x27;t smell bad like this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that the first ingredient is titanium dioxide, a non-chemical sunscreen that, according to ewg.org, is not absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Then I go back a few minutes later and tap a tiny bit more where I need extra coverage.</li>
            <li> a 4 - had it been a little lighter without slightly making my pores more</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the way it made my skin a little bit lighter, but in certain lights it seriously looked like I was wearing clown makeup.</li>
            <li> It does not come with near as much product, but it is usually a little cheaper</li>
            <li> As I do have some enlarged pores &amp; pits from long ago and far away acne issues, I felt that was a plus, and it is!</li>
            <li> It was a little tricky to figure out how to put it on at first.</li>
            <li> I ordered This product in #2; It dries very very quickly and is very hard to spread out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pale</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on my skin very long it was also very hard to blend even with the sponge it brings which is still a lot better than trying to apply it with your fingers.</li>
            <li> I started buying this a few years ago because I have very pale Irish skin, and even the lightest shade of most drugstore foundations looked orange on me.</li>
            <li> For anyone like me who has sensitive skin, I was at first nervous about the fact that it has sunscreen and is scented ( my skin normally responds poorly to these things), but I have not had a single problem using this product.</li>
            <li> Dry my skin first then after few hours it causes oil skin</li>
            <li> The only cons I found is that the texture is not easy to spread and dries extremely fast.</li>
            <li> I deposited some of the BB cream on the back of my hand and put some on the sponge, I will advise against using the sponge because it absorbs too much of the product and deposits very little on your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is the real one or not because on youtube videos it had a different consistency and coverage</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m 40 &amp; starting to get fine lines~tried a ton of different expensive foundations + BB&#x27;s @Sephora and</li>
            <li> My previous BB creams didn&#x27;t necessarily look natural, but they smoothed my face.</li>
            <li> However, Lioele has almost no coverage; it can only help cover pores and minimize minor blemishes.</li>
            <li> , a tiny amount (pea size) goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;m buying the Holika Holika Aqua Petit Jelly BB Cream #1, my first purchase was in 2013 when I was new to makeup and had no idea how to choose the foundation shade that matched my skin tone, so somehow I randomly ended up buying this product.</li>
            <li> For those that does have dry skin or has somewhat of a texture to it, this BB cream will only amplify that.</li>
            <li> Also, you must moisturize well especially if you have dry skin</li>
            <li> I definitely would not recommend this product unless you have extremely oily skin and are actually Casper the Ghost.</li>
            <li> (extremely) minor quibble:</li>
            <li> I used it for a few weeks and it looked completely untouched.</li>
            <li> LONG TIME&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot bigger than I expected, so it has lasted me a while.</li>
            <li> It even came earlier than expected in the mail.</li>
            <li> My sensitivities have been an issue in the past in using new face products.</li>
            <li> This came in earlier than expected~!</li>
            <li> I have had no issue in using this, and it actually feels lighter than some of my other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, that leans towards dry, during winter.</li>
            <li> or you risk looking chalky or having dry patches highlighted.</li>
            <li> It applies dry and patchy</li>
            <li> to dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;odd</li>
            <li> The cream can be a bit dry</li>
            <li> I was so tired of wasting my hard earned dollars on beauty enhancement products that did nothing but aggravate my continuously flaking, mysterious menopausal shedding skin cells, as well as them taking up a running residency after a couple of hours in the crevices of my growing with time, fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The makeup is so thin that it sinks right into the sponge.</li>
            <li> I can usually use that amount (or less) to cover my whole</li>
            <li> that is sensitive and usually oily in the T-zone, and after reading the reviews I thought this would be the product I had been searching for.</li>
            <li> it is cool looking but useless in my opinion as it soaks up all the product.  </li>
            <li> I am a bb cream fan but this one is very strange because is VERY dry, even when I have medium to oily skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a completely different texture than I&#x27;m used to and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The texture of the bb cream is jelly like but for me, it is a little bit too dry, I have to put on a lot of moisturizer prior putting on this bb cream.</li>
            <li> My skin is quite pale with slight yellow tone, will try color #2 next time....</li>
            <li> I still need to use a little bit of concealer in places where I am very red or have a breakout here or there, but not very much.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> For covering blemishes or any especially red areas, you may want to use a thin amount of product all over your face and come back with a little extra makeup on any highly red or discolored areas.</li>
            <li> A few dots about the face and buffing outward swirls of a short stippling brush, Ta-Da!</li>
            <li> I actually prefer my usual drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> A little dry.</li>
            <li> This made me look cakey and uneven, and I only applied a little bit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Opening up the bottle, I saw that it has a very wide opening and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit dark for my skin, but nothing a little bit of white foundation doesn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen anything with such a weird texture - maybe it was old or something...</li>
            <li> Based on the previous reviews, I really expected to like this product.</li>
            <li> Can be layered if you have blemishes or if you have dark circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll still need concealer for stubborn under eye circles, dark spots, etc.</li>
            <li> I applied the BB Cream with my fingers, as is typically advised.</li>
            <li> The majority of BB creams I&#x27;ve tried have an odd odor that bothers me.  </li>
            <li> The coverage is very poor and only last maximum 4 hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a little spatula on the cap to scoop the product out with.  </li>
            <li> Is dewy but matte plus it comes with a little sample and a sponge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Sometimes its a little drying in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> heavy on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> chemical smell.&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to blend as it dried</li>
            <li> and you shouldn&#x27;t have any trouble.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday even if I&#x27;m not wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a smidge too pale for me--and I&#x27;ve got a heavy hand applying it--</li>
            <li> As an extremely pale person, this is a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> and this gives me a pale cast.</li>
            <li> I have pale skin</li>
            <li> I have pale skin and</li>
            <li> To be frank, I 100% expect all BB creams to adhere to my skin because they&#x27;re supposed to make you look pale and glowing, and as a redhead, my skin is already pale.</li>
            <li> Not unless your skin is really pale.</li>
            <li> And when I say really pale</li>
            <li> I got the lighter one and it was extremely pale</li>
            <li> This came in a plain cardboard box.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how something described as &amp;#34;jelly&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;bouncy&amp;#34; can be difficult to blend and dries with such a dull, dry finish.</li>
            <li> Only after removing the makeupdid I remind myself that my skin is not flawless.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t make me too slick.  </li>
            <li> This made me look sallow and yellow, rendering this product utterly useless.</li>
            <li> I mean PALE.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to blend.</li>
            <li> I even have oily skin and it was hard to spread it on my face.</li>
            <li> Well at least I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Very messy, it looks like someone had it for months!</li>
            <li> I have really pale skin tone and finding a BB cream that isn&#x27;t too dark was almost impossible.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s at least 8 hours Ladies, with my combo skin type!</li>
            <li> It was very thick and didn&#x27;t glide on to my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> sponge was a tad useless to me, it soaked up all the product and none of it</li>
            <li> This one went on horribly, because not only did it not provide any sort of coverage, it also didn&#x27;t blend with my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> On to the next one.gimmick, but terrible execution.</li>
            <li> It holds even after I&#x27;ve exercised and sweat like crazy.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this BB Cream.</li>
            <li> Disappointed and grossed out</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate the feeling of make up</li>
            <li> Hated the texture and made my imperfections noticeable!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is great.  It actually covers better than most of my regular foundations without having to add extra layers and a little goes a LONG way.  I have rather oily skin, yet this stays put and I don&#x27;t have to blot excess oil as often.  Granted my skin will eventually overpower anything, but this lasts fairly well and doesn&#x27;t seem to make me break out.  I have fair skin and red hair, yet the 01 tone matches pretty much perfectly.  I also love the smell.</li>
            <li> Holika holika has some of the best smelling BB cream out there, this one is pleasant, with nice texture and does not have white cast when I put it on. Absorbs to a smooth dewy finish and good staying power, coverage medium.</li>
            <li> As an extremely pale person, this is a lifesaver. I love the jelly texture and scent, a little of the product goes a long way, and it leaves a perfect dewy finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My (extremely) minor quibble: it&#x27;s a bit drying and the enclosed sponge isn&#x27;t very good. Luckily, that&#x27;s what moisturizer and brushes (or your fingers) are for.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing! Doesnt irritate skin. Perfect for NC 20 . Matte finish , feels like youre skin.</li>
            <li> This is good. Seen many times on youtube makeup tutorials.</li>
            <li> A good product, covers well, keeps my skin from getting oily. It&#x27;s really pale, I&#x27;m a fair skinned red head and it make me washed out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in LOVE with this BB cream! I have combination skin, that leans towards dry, during winter. Also, I&#x27;m 40 &amp; starting to get fine lines~tried a ton of different expensive foundations + BB&#x27;s @Sephora and no matter what, they tend to accentuate them. Not Holika!&lt;br /&gt;  A few dots about the face and buffing outward swirls of a short stippling brush, Ta-Da! I look airbrushed + I&#x27;m good ALL day. *no oxidation, no creasing nor settling in to pores! My T-Zone only needed 1 blot, on a really warm day. I&#x27;m impressed and completely in LOVE!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;m buying the Holika Holika Aqua Petit Jelly BB Cream #1, my first purchase was in 2013 when I was new to makeup and had no idea how to choose the foundation shade that matched my skin tone, so somehow I randomly ended up buying this product. After all these years, there&#x27;s a total of 3 BB/CC creams/foundations I&#x27;ve used: holika holika aqua petit jelly BB cream, holika holika petit BB cream, and miss hana CC cream, and I love 2 of the 3, the aqua petit (I use this for more formal occasions due to the thicker, more &amp;#34;flawless&amp;#34; coverage) and miss hana cc cream (this one is my go-to foundation, light coverage but looks extremely natural).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a cute box packaging, the BB cream has a light pleasant scent with a spatula to apply the product, it doesn&#x27;t come sealed. It is dewy when first applied and has a matte finish to it. This product is great for those with pale skin tone, it has an extremely smooth and flawless finish if you don&#x27;t have dry skin or patchy-rough texture to it. For those that does have dry skin or has somewhat of a texture to it, this BB cream will only amplify that. It has a quite good coverage, rather thick, my skin isn&#x27;t flawless but I only have a few, very very light acne blemish here and there, they&#x27;re almost unnoticeable, hence when I apply a layer of this BB cream over it, it gives me an extremely smooth doll-like finish, so flawless that looks somewhat &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34; to me (I actually like to retain a bit of the blemish because it just seems more natural, that&#x27;s my personal preference), which is why I only use this when I want to look more done-up. I love this BB cream over the holika holika petit BB cream because the aqua jelly doesn&#x27;t give me as much breakout, I might get 1 tiny acne by the end of the day compared to the holika petit where it gives me a whole bunch of acnes and makes my skin itchy afterwards, I have combination skin (oily on the nose, sensitive on cheeks, could be dry atcertain times, and normal on forehead area).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing with this BB cream is, it works great when my skin is nice and smooth, but during the winters my skin can get a little dry and this BB cream only makes that dry part even more noticeable. However, if I apply a thicker lotion to smoothen it out and then apply the BB cream on top of it, it should be fine, it will not look flaky as long as my skin is moist and smooth underneath it.</li>
            <li> Love it. Light, natural,and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like the light weight feeling on my face. However, it&#x27;s a bit sticky and I have to set it with power. My skin is quite pale with slight yellow tone, will try color #2 next time....</li>
            <li> Fast shipping (; got it because of the popularity it had on YouTube&lt;br /&gt;smells amazing&lt;br /&gt;matte finish&lt;br /&gt;perfect for the summer&lt;br /&gt;comes with sponge</li>
            <li> Good for my face. Smooth face.</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage but still light like a BB cream should be. Color matched well with my cool tone, very fair skin. No breakouts.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and delivery, product arrived with box crushed, but doesn&#x27;t matter since the bottle and sponge are ok. Well at least I don&#x27;t mind. Very light shade with easy blending texture, medium coverage ideal for natural nude makeup, non greasy and matches skin. I have tried Dior BB cream, smash box CC cream... but I can see myself using this one for a long time since I decided to give my skin a break : )</li>
            <li> The cream is jelly like in consistency which isnt one well known in the European markets however the \\&quot;cream\\&quot; has an applicator attached to the green top so once opened, you dont have to use your hands on the product itself which is terrific for hygiene reasons.&lt;br /&gt;Provided also, is a good sized sponge to use for blending onto the skin. The coverage evened out my skin tone which tends to be slightly blotchy, however I did notice that it also settled into my pores, making them more noticeable instead of covering them&lt;br /&gt;For this reason alone, I gave this product a 4 - had it been a little lighter without slightly making my pores more notice​able, I would have given a 5</li>
            <li> A little dry. But I like it</li>
            <li> I have tried ten different Korean BB creams and this is my favorite so far. I have very fair, dry skin, the color matches perfect and I love the semi-matte finish. It&#x27;s a light to medium coverage and it is buildable. The wear time is 6-8 hours, fades evenly, never patchy, not drying. The packaging is adorable, it looks like a jelly. Will purchase again from this seller. (Would be good for oily skin also)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this foundation, and I plan on ordering it again. It provides great coverage, and often times I found that I did not need any concealer at all when using this. Can be layered if you have blemishes or if you have dark circles under the eyes. Felt lightweight. Lightly scented. For anyone like me who has sensitive skin, I was at first nervous about the fact that it has sunscreen and is scented ( my skin normally responds poorly to these things), but I have not had a single problem using this product. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not that good. Dry my skin first then after few hours it causes oil skin</li>
            <li> This product, I&#x27;ve using many BB creams and foundations, but this is the perfect I ever used. I also using Etude Precious Mineral BB cream too, but this product is just good as Etude House&#x27;s BB cream. The cool feeling after I apply this cream onto my face is so great too. It covers most of your pores, and other troubles. It stays on your face about 4-5 hours. I have oily face, have some pimples but this BB Cream hides those acnes perfectly.</li>
            <li> This BB Cream is super drying. Wearing moisturizer underneath makes it chunky and sticky.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this BB Cream! My friend got me some when she visited Korea a while back, and I used all mine up! She paid 15usd in Korea for it, and when I found it for basically the same price, I HAD to get it! Authentic and perfect!</li>
            <li> This is a great BB cream. I&#x27;ve tried many kinds and the Holika Holika Aqua Jelly has become my new favorite. Using a brush, or wet sponge/beauty blender is probably the easiest way to apply this BB cream unless you can move quickly with your fingers. I would compare the cream to Lioele Water Drop Blemish Balm Cream because both creams feel so lightweight that you can&#x27;t feel it on your skin. However, Lioele has almost no coverage; it can only help cover pores and minimize minor blemishes. The Aqua Jelly has decent coverage for pores, acne scars and redness but you will still need a concealer if you have pimples you want to hide completely. The only cons I found is that the texture is not easy to spread and dries extremely fast. Also, you must moisturize well especially if you have dry skin or you risk looking chalky or having dry patches highlighted. I still like this BB cream even with these cons because it feels more like a skin care product than other BB creams out there. It works well on top of a moisturizing makeup base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I experimented with different ways to use this BB cream; I found that mixing this with Etude House Nymph Aura Volumer yields the best results. The Nymph Aura Volumer is oily and it worked great with the Aqua Jelly. The mixture creates a more dewy finish. I used a ratio of 1:4 (Aura Volumer to Aqua Jelly).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a BB cream that fits my skin so perfectly And smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I find it kind of funny that people are saying this is &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;way too light&amp;#34; because it ended up being a perfect match for my skin. It&#x27;s clearly for very fair people, so if you&#x27;re skin is medium or darker, it probably won&#x27;t work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the Aqua/ jelly consistency. I feel like this helps it to blend better and look more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that some people claimed this was drying. I have oily/ combination skin and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with that luckily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is downright adorable. The cap is cute and girly and the bottle itself feels nice and heavy, like a lot of expensive makeup products. I don&#x27;t have to worry about dropping it and finding a crack in it later. However, it&#x27;s a little large for travel, so this is probably best used at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this BB cream. The color fits me perfectly, the consistency is nice, the packaging is cute, it gives good medium coverage and it came packaged nicely/ with samples in a timely manner. I would definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love the jelly texture of this and it smells so good!  Blends well with fingers and feels like you have nothing on.  When you initially apply it there is a cooling feeling from the mint water in it which leaves skin looking hydrated and refreshed.  I have been using this as foundation and it provides just the right amount of coverage for me though it is not buildable if you are someone who needs medium to full coverage, it gets sticky and does not blend well with a second coat.  The sponge that comes with it is cool looking but useless in my opinion as it soaks up all the product.  I tried applying it with a brush as well but it seems to go on best using your fingertips.  It doesn&#x27;t wear as well as my urban decay naked foundation but it keeps my skin moisturized throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;  The bottle that it comes in is so pretty and I like that it is open and comes with a spatula so that you can get to all of the product, which for the price, is a nice amount.  I always wash my hands before I use it and then apply the desired amount to the back of my hand.  Since I am the only one using it with clean hands I don&#x27;t feel it would get contaminated this way.  I think I will keep the bottle to store cream or something in when it is gone.  It is a well made heavy frosted glass jar, which I find really aesthetically pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it is my favorite bb cream by far.</li>
            <li> it feels really nice on the skin. it&#x27;s a nice texture and it smells good as well.&lt;br /&gt;good coverage as well. i really recommend this bb cream!</li>
            <li> Wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get it! I get why there&#x27;s all this growing \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; regarding BB Creams!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had mostly given up on makeup for my aging skin (I&#x27;m in my mid 50s). I was so tired of wasting my hard earned dollars on beauty enhancement products that did nothing but aggravate my continuously flaking, mysterious menopausal shedding skin cells, as well as them taking up a running residency after a couple of hours in the crevices of my growing with time, fine lines and wrinkles. They enhanced all right ~ the aging factor!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first bb cream purchase was a drugstore brand. While I did like it, (it did make me go,\\&quot;hmmm?!?!?\\&quot;) it still wasn&#x27;t quite right. Curious, I hit Google for research and discovered the original, most touted and expounded upon bb creams, were out of Asia. After searching Amazon and reading so many reviews my eyes got crossed, I ordered the \\&quot;Holika Holika Petit Jelly BB Cream #1.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like its name, it has a jelly-like consistency. As I do have some enlarged pores &amp; pits from long ago and far away acne issues, I felt that was a plus, and it is! You should also be aware that while it goes on easily, it also dries quickly, so there is a small learning curve to apply it evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is light with a golden undertone. As that matches my own caucasian skin, it was almost perfect for me. To clarify, if I put a swatch on my wrist up, it blends perfectly without ANY visible lines using outside, daytime lighting. However, it is Summer in TX, and it is noticeably lighter if I put the swatch on the top of my hand. I have recently ordered the #2 shade  with the hope it will work better with my Summer, Sun-smooched skin color. My current \\&quot;fix\\&quot; is using a light dusting of a closer matching mineral powder (Physicians Formula brand). It works beautifully, even with outdoor lighting! It should also be noted (hip-hip-hooray!!!) that this method lasts me ALL day...that&#x27;s at least 8 hours Ladies, with my combo skin type! Better still...there&#x27;s not a single River running in any of the Valleys of fine lines and folds when the day is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what the magic is in this stuff (you can read the ingredients for yourself on the box). What I am sure of, is that my skin LOVES this jelly jewel juice! When I wash my face at the end of the night, the snake cell, skin shedding issue I&#x27;ve been fighting with so many different products since the onset of menopause, is G-O-N-E! My skin feels soft as my GrandBaby&#x27;s cheeks, and that&#x27;s BEFORE I put on my nighttime moisturizer. As my skin adores this product, I no longer use moisturizer before applying it. There&#x27;s also no stink factor! While my nose is often highly offended by many products, this one is pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I haven&#x27;t been so excited about make-up since I was 13 and allowed by Mom to use it! It evens out my skin tone to a degree previously not seen without \\&quot;layering\\&quot; products...the \\&quot;cake\\&quot; factor, which I absolutely detest! It doesn&#x27;t cover them completely (Do any of them? Let&#x27;s get real!), but rather creates a slight luminous glow which makes my skin look almost perfect from a short distance away, or in somewhat dimmer lighting. Up close and personal, it doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Update: August 17,2014&lt;br /&gt;I still use and love this product. More importantly, my skin still adores it. I just received my 2nd order (#2 shade), so it lasted me almost a year! It&#x27;s a keeper!ing in any of the Valleys of fine lines and folds when the day is done.    I&#x27;m not sure what the magic is in this stuff (you can read the ingredients for yourself on the box).

            <li> I had higher expectations for this product. I have very, very fair skin (I have trouble finding foundation pale enough to match my skin tone) that is sensitive and usually oily in the T-zone, and after reading the reviews I thought this would be the product I had been searching for. After applying, my skin began to flake and looked like I had painted my face with white paint. Also, I know the texture is supposed to be &amp;#34;jelly-like,&amp;#34; but it much more resembled curdled milk (ick). I definitely would not recommend this product unless you have extremely oily skin and are actually Casper the Ghost.</li>
            <li> I started buying this a few years ago because I have very pale Irish skin, and even the lightest shade of most drugstore foundations looked orange on me. Shade #1 works great for me year-round because the coverage is light, and I recently discovered that it works great as a concealer too. A lot comes in the bottle, so it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> This is such a great BB cream. It has medium coverage. The light shade matches my very fair skin beautifully. It is rather powdery after drying, so that is why I gave it 4 stars.  Otherwise, I love the coverage and the color.</li>
            <li> I heard so many good reviews on this from youtube beauty gurus. However, I found it too light for my skin tone and it caked up on my face.</li>
            <li> While I really want to love this product, there are a few drawbacks that I cannot ignore. Most people love this because of its moisturizing properties, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me. It dries with a very matte finish that accentuates any dry spots. I don&#x27;t like the overdone, powdery, and cakey &amp;#34;make-up look&amp;#34; that this product creates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, this product (drying matte) does not give the &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; K-Pop look that many BB and CC creams give. It doesn&#x27;t reflect light too well, but does an excellent job of brightening any dull spots. I don&#x27;t think this product is the best for my whole face, but I use it as an under-eye brightener sometimes which works much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a tiny amount (pea size) goes a LONG way. I can usually use that amount (or less) to cover my whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who likes the bright look of Korean products without the sometimes overwhelming dewy-almost-oily face look.</li>
            <li> I try and do as much research as I can for products, this one seemed like a pretty good bet. I love the way it smells, it feels light on the skin, but it&#x27;s just a hint too dark for my skin. I have pink undertones whereas this is more yellow. The other thing is, while it does a good job of covering, it dries to a matte finish REALLY fast so it&#x27;s hard to blend. I&#x27;ve tried a brush, the sponge it came with, but I found my fingers are the best tools for this product. It&#x27;s a nice everyday kind of coverage, but just a little off for me since I&#x27;m so fair.</li>
            <li> I have oily, NC 25 ish skin and this gives me a pale cast. It applies dry and patchy so I can&#x27;t even use it as a highlight/contour color. It is jelly like in texture but feels cornstarch-like  on my skin. It does have a mild cooling feel. I just wish that it worked on me. Lighter, very oily skinned girls may fare better. For now I will stick to my Missha Perfect Cover</li>
            <li> i love the feel of this BB cream. It smells good. It gives you the perfect coverage. If you are Asian type skin, you will love this BB cream</li>
            <li> I have oil prone very fair porcelain skin. I ordered This product in #2; It dries very very quickly and is very hard to spread out. I enjoyed the way it made my skin a little bit lighter, but in certain lights it seriously looked like I was wearing clown makeup. This product also settled into my fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefits here were that it did a fairly good job at controlling oil, and there is a TON of product. I used it for a few weeks and it looked completely untouched. While I did not like it, I gave it to my also fair/oily skinned bf and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the Holika Holika Clearing BB alongside this one and I enjoy it much more. It&#x27;s way easier to apply, the oil control is better, it doesn&#x27;t make me look like I&#x27;m dead, and it does not settle into my fine lines. It does not come with near as much product, but it is usually a little cheaper so that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I have really pale skin tone and finding a BB cream that isn&#x27;t too dark was almost impossible. This fit perfectly and the Jelly/water-like substance spreads and absorbs easily. It holds just about as long as any BB cream would, and it&#x27;s so light that you fell like your not wearing anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;I loved it!</li>
            <li> Great coverage. Very light in color. When used with a good primer and set with a good powder&lt;br /&gt; can last all day.</li>
            <li> I have pale skin and this is a very cute color! It&#x27;s a little bit dark for my skin, but nothing a little bit of white foundation doesn&#x27;t fix. It dries very fast and is very matte. It holds even after I&#x27;ve exercised and sweat like crazy. I was really surprised!</li>
            <li> Really fun texture and it evens out my skin tone really well. It does make my dry patches more visible since I have very dry skin, but i can fix that by exfoliating and using a good moisturizer. I&#x27;m pretty pale so I got it in the first shade and it&#x27;s a really good match :)</li>
            <li> I really love this product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply and have quite a good coverage, but doesn&#x27;t look like a mask or something like that...&lt;br /&gt;I recommand this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this BB Cream after using another one of Holika Holika&#x27;s products, the Petit BB, which I recommend. I was very satisfied with it and decided it would be fun to try out another one of their products. After trying the Aqua Petit BB Cream, I have to say it exceeded my expectations and that I actually prefer it over the Petit BB. When first taking it out of the box, I noticed that it is a fairly large glass bottle and that you get a lot of product for your money. The box itself is adorable, and the bottle does not disappoint. With a cute polka dot pattern on the lid, it is something you will want to display on your bathroom counter. It also comes with a white sponge to apply the makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opening up the bottle, I saw that it has a very wide opening and the lid has a tiny applicator spatula. I deposited some of the BB cream on the back of my hand and put some on the sponge, I will advise against using the sponge because it absorbs too much of the product and deposits very little on your face. The makeup is so thin that it sinks right into the sponge. I applied the BB Cream with my fingers, as is typically advised. I noticed that the makeup was very runny when I put some on the back of my hand. It drips off of the spatula. But the thinness of the formula is its most amazing property. When I put it on, it seemed to melt into my skin, giving it the appearance of becoming a part of my skin. You have to blend it out very quickly when you put it on, or else it will start drying, so I suggest only applying it to one section of your face at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once it dries on your face, it looks incredibly natural. Shade #1 matches my very fair skin perfectly. I have cool toned skin so I battle with redness around my nose and the occasional blemish. Let me tell you, this BB Cream covered the redness around my nose so well that by the end of the day I had almost fooled myself into believing that my skin naturally looked that great. Only after removing the makeupdid I remind myself that my skin is not flawless. This is the most natural looking makeup I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people with oily or combination skin like me, I recommend setting this makeup with powder. I think this would work well for people with drier skin because it is very moisturizing and seems to melt into your skin, so it does not bring out flakes. For covering blemishes or any especially red areas, you may want to use a thin amount of product all over your face and come back with a little extra makeup on any highly red or discolored areas. But, it should cover most mild to moderate skin flaws on the first coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this makeup. If you want a natural, flawless look (who doesn&#x27;t?) at a very affordable price, this is the makeup for you. :]</li>
            <li> This came in earlier than expected~! I gave it four stars because I have not tried out the product yet as it is too light atm. I think I&#x27;m going to save it for winter</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most things. The majority of BB creams I&#x27;ve tried have an odd odor that bothers me.  This one has almost no odor and doesn&#x27;t set off my allergies at all. It has a nice smooth coverage, is a lot of product for the money, and doesn&#x27;t bother my rosacea. I also like the fact that the first ingredient is titanium dioxide, a non-chemical sunscreen that, according to ewg.org, is not absorbed into the skin.  AND the bottle is cute- icing on the cake!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t purchase unless you have very light skin. Would not repurchase or recommend. Maybe if you have porcelin or Asian like skin</li>
            <li> Hmm... the thing i don&#x27;t like about this is the bottle and the texture of the BB cream since it&#x27;s kinda jelly just like how the name says it. But overall, I won&#x27;t complain since it works well for me. I often use it sometimes. I have normal skin and it works well for me, I like it.</li>
            <li> I wanted do desperately to love this product however, this was not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;This product was buildable.&lt;br /&gt;Not heavy on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to wash off with facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;cute packaging.&lt;br /&gt;pores were invisible.&lt;br /&gt;long lasting in humidity and sweat proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Much to light for me, normally the lightest of shades is too dark/orange.&lt;br /&gt;clung to dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;odd chemical smell.&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to blend as it dried very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Terrible applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product is much better than BB creams from the US, but this product did not suit me. It had very good qualties that I&#x27;m sure will work for others.</li>
            <li> very watery , and super white. Even after contouring and applying a bit of bronzer it was way too light. i&#x27;m not even that tan! the coverage isn&#x27;t all that great. I&#x27;m not sure if this is the real one or not because on youtube videos it had a different consistency and coverage</li>
            <li> I really like this BB cream.  I have oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t make me too slick.  Great for this time of year when it&#x27;s cold and windy.</li>
            <li> I love trying different BB creams and so far, this one is my favorite! I was afraid the color would be too light, but it&#x27;s really perfect for me and does blend well. The cream can be a bit dry and you have to blend it in fast before it dries or you may see a bit of a white or light residue. Bend it well with a sponge and you shouldn&#x27;t have any trouble. Moisturize underneath if you have dry skin- also helps the cream blend better. Covers well enough to be worn as foundation. You&#x27;ll still need concealer for stubborn under eye circles, dark spots, etc.</li>
            <li> This came in a plain cardboard box.  I opened the box from Amazon, and it was just laying there without an expiration date or safety seal.  I opened it up, and it was the texture of lumpy pudding.  It has a little spatula on the cap to scoop the product out with.  It has fragrance too (which I don&#x27;t care for).  I didn&#x27;t care for the BB creme or how it arrived.  I&#x27;ve never seen anything with such a weird texture - maybe it was old or something...</li>
            <li> Normal bb creams make my oil combo skin just fill with even more oil however, this just keeps my skin nice and matte all day long.</li>
            <li> Deliveries fast. Be cream itself is also good. But not so good in concealing.</li>
            <li> The packing is so cute! and this BB cream smells really nice I  bought the first shade due to my shade complexion blends beautifully into my skin though and the seller is amazing they give you free samples!</li>
            <li> So there are MANY reasons this is my favorite bbcream&lt;br /&gt;ive been wearing bbcream since 3 years ago.. LONG TIME&lt;br /&gt;so ive tried many from Missha M Perfect Cover to Skin Food Aloe to To Skin 79 Triple Function!&lt;br /&gt;Im not gonna lie, this doesnt have very much coverage but seriously is the best in evening out your skin(dark circles, hyperpigmentation, blemish marks ect...) jelly like to totally easy to blend! WAY BETTER BLEND ABILITY than missha which was my number one complaint&lt;br /&gt;Also cant forget... SMELLS AMAZING!!!! i honestly put some on my hand just to smell ^_^&lt;br /&gt;Overall  best bb cream ive tried EVER so i totally recomend it</li>
            <li> It whitens skin and has decent coverage. Also smells good and fresh! but the product can be more easier to blend and apply</li>
            <li> This product has lasted me a long time and it is wonderful! I have pale skin and the color was perfect for me. Very lightweight and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> great coverage, good for your skin and keeps my skin matte all day long.  It makes my skin look flawless!  I love this stuff!  I tried it and then went and bought three more bottles so that I don&#x27;t run out.  Its better for your skin and cheaper than these overpriced american brands.  You really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> The cream smells really good and it is easy to apply, which gives you a fresh look and it is jelly form.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd holika holika bb cream I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m very impressed with the brand so far.&lt;br /&gt;This is a lighter bb cream, it feels water based but still gives good coverage. Much nicer than any American brand I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I really do like the application too, the spatula is a unique touch compared to other bb cream applicators.&lt;br /&gt;The sponge was a tad useless to me, it soaked up all the product and none of it applied to my skin, so instead I use the spatula to apply it on the top of my nose and under my eyes in a triangle shape and blend outward.&lt;br /&gt;Last fairly well by itself too, so overall it&#x27;s a very nice product and I can see myself purchasing again.</li>
            <li> It definitely light up my skin and make my skin looks very natural and bright! Its very moisturize also! me and my roommate both LOVE it!</li>
            <li> This bb cream its really light, it makes my skin look very natural but at the same time it has a great coverage, the texture of this bb cream its different but that is what makes it really amazing</li>
            <li> I actually prefer my usual drugstore brand. This made me look cakey and uneven, and I only applied a little bit.</li>
            <li> I prefer the clearing bb cream but I like this too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a completely different texture than I&#x27;m used to and a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s a smidge too pale for me--and I&#x27;ve got a heavy hand applying it--so I mix it with an American tinted moisturizer first. Then I go back a few minutes later and tap a tiny bit more where I need extra coverage. It looks extremely natural.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for something that feels lighter and better than foundation, but stills gives a good level of coverage, and I found it with this.&lt;br /&gt;It feels neat when you put it on your skin; it&#x27;s like it turns into water as you rub it on! It was a little tricky to figure out how to put it on at first. I tried to use a brush, then a makeup sponge, but hands are definitely the best tools for this stuff (just be sure to wash your hands before AND after if you decide to do this as well). I was actually surprised by the level of coverage this has. I still need to use a little bit of concealer in places where I am very red or have a breakout here or there, but not very much.&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have is that it does smell a bit perfumey, so if that is something that irritates your skin then I suggest you try something else. Overall though I really dig it. :)</li>
            <li> i loooove this! it definitely matches my skin(hard to find anything that does) and goes on light and smooth. stays on allll day. and it comes with a cute blending spunge that works amazing</li>
            <li> Moisturizes and layers great!</li>
            <li> The cover I would say is light-medium. It&#x27;s a lot whiter on my skin but I just blend in a darker shade of foundation to up the shade. the smell is also really enjoyable. It&#x27;s a lot bigger than I expected, so it has lasted me a while. Cute packaging too!</li>
            <li> First off, this is a large bottle. much larger than your typical BB cream tube, more like the size of an american foundation.This BB cream has pretty good coverage. I like full coverage and have some acne scarring so I use a concealer for those spots and the BB as my overall foundation, then set with a mineral setting powder. The soft fragrance from the mint water is really nice and clean. Really the only downside is the stay factor; this foundation is one of those that rubs off and leaves tell-tale makeup smudges on my phone. Still a keeper though. :)</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this BB Cream. I did my research and the reviews seemed to indicate that this was a good one to try. After using Etude House and being delighted with it, I wanted to see what else was out there.&lt;br /&gt;The only redeeming part of this product was the packaging--it&#x27;s adorable. Also, I DID like the smell of it, which is light and citrusy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there were too many things that were wrong with this:&lt;br /&gt;1) The consistency did not remind me of jelly. It actually reminded me of pudding, and I&#x27;m not really a big fan of pudding.&lt;br /&gt;2) The applicator was a problem, because it was attached to the top part. And yet you can&#x27;t actually apply the cream to your face with it. Instead, they provide you with a sponge that reeks of packaging. I used it the first day and tossed it because I have my own sponges, which don&#x27;t smell bad like this one.&lt;br /&gt;3) Applying it is made even trickier because you can&#x27;t use your fingers. If you do, it will look like there is nothing on your face. However,&lt;br /&gt;4) Even with the sponge, it still doesn&#x27;t apply well. It&#x27;s waaaaay too light to be considered a BB Cream. This is partially why I wanted to try it, because the reviews claimed that it was so light it looked completely natural. My previous BB creams didn&#x27;t necessarily look natural, but they smoothed my face. This one went on horribly, because not only did it not provide any sort of coverage, it also didn&#x27;t blend with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole point of BB cream coming in so few shades is that it&#x27;s supposed to adhere with any skin type. To be frank, I 100% expect all BB creams to adhere to my skin because they&#x27;re supposed to make you look pale and glowing, and as a redhead, my skin is already pale. This made me look sallow and yellow, rendering this product utterly useless. Perhaps this works for some people, but if you have fair skin, rosy undertones, or any need of coverage, there are far better products out there for you to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cute idea and gimmick, but terrible execution. On to the next one.gimmick, but terrible execution. On to the next one.</li>
            <li> This BB is light as air, smells fantastic and covers my skin perfectly. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to cover, especially if you use the sponge it comes with (or your favorite beauty sponge). To get the most out of your makeup, you should make sure that you have a great skincare regimen in the first place. If you&#x27;re not using the right cleanser, and moisturizer you&#x27;re not going to be as pleased with ANY makeup you pick. Take care of your skin and use quality products that are appropriate for your skin type and you&#x27;ll have much better results with your makeup. I will definitely buy this BB cream again.</li>
            <li> YUCK!!!! If I could give this a no star rating I would! Hated the texture and made my imperfections noticeable! How could anyone like this product???</li>
            <li> I didnt buy this product from this site.. but im gonna write a review anyway. This bb cream, like many other korean bb creams turns your skin vampire white. After reading that many people liked this product, I decided to give it a try. I bought the darkest shade, #02, and its still WAY too light. Im korean.. and my skin is actually pretty light compared to most people. I regret buying this.. and I will be exchanging it for a different product. For people who are hesitating to buy this, dont. Not unless your skin is really pale. And when I say really pale I mean PALE.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I am rarely impressed with beauty products, but this stuff makes my skin look flawless, and has even made my skin look better when I&#x27;m not wearing it. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least 20 American and Korean BB creams over the past year to figure out what works best as a cosmetic and a skin care product. Nothing comes close to this product. I think the thing that really sells it is the &#x27;aqua&#x27; consistency. It is more liquid than any foundation I have ever used, but it still has great coverage and is buildable. The great thing about it being fluid is that it fills in pores and fine lines effectively. I had my photo taken professionally last month and while some people might not risk the slightly glossy finish, I think that this looked great on camera. The only minus is that I wish it came in more shades. Hopefully, since Holika Holika just opened a North America storefront, they will consider it. I&#x27;m Caucasian and normally wear &#x27;porcelain&#x27; shades, and #1 works OK for me, if just a teeny bit too warm.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is easy on my sensitive skin. My sensitivities have been an issue in the past in using new face products. I have had no issue in using this, and it actually feels lighter than some of my other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also seems to work really well with my skin being so oily. It seems to last a long time even when my skin is at its most oily.</li>
            <li> It even came earlier than expected in the mail. It was supposed to have the delivery window start on the nineteenth. This BB has a surprising amount of coverage, smells pretty, and the packaging is exactly as pictured (the polka dot lidded bottle). The packaging is so adorable! It looks like a little molded gelatin :) The BB cream texture is very pleasant, it is cooling when you put it on. I am very pleased with the order!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product if you want light to medium coverage, it feels great in the skin and does not give cake grease feeling. Is dewy but matte plus it comes with a little sample and a sponge. The spatula is great as it is more clean than using a regular bottle. Love it and shipping come on time</li>
            <li> Before I start I have Combination/oily skin with some dryness around the chin and nose. My skin is sensitive and very prone to whiteheads as well.&lt;br /&gt;I have used many BB creams and foundations before this one and I will never go back. I actually use this along with my moisturizer because it has no negative effects. I absolutely hate the feeling of make up and I tend to wash my make up off right when I get home. This doesn&#x27;t feel like makeup at all. I put it on in the morning and when I go to bed. After I wash my face I mix some of the BB cream in with my moisturizer and put it on as a night cream. I have never found anything quite like this.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Lightens skin and scars.&lt;br /&gt;*Doesn&#x27;t cause my to break out.&lt;br /&gt;*Feels like a skin care product rather than makeup.&lt;br /&gt;*It Smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;*Covers very well.&lt;br /&gt;*Blends easily.&lt;br /&gt;*doesn&#x27;t flake or wear during the day.&lt;br /&gt;*I use it both as a substitute for foundation and as a concealer.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*Sometimes its a little drying in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has been great. I use it everyday even if I&#x27;m not wearing makeup. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an alternative to foundation or who just wants to improve their skin.</li>
            <li> GREAT BB cream. I love it and you should buy it&lt;br /&gt;This is the best BB cream I ever had&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is this BB not very white</li>
            <li> I work for a High end cosmetic counter in a multi retailer store &amp; I have tried so many foundations &amp; bb creams both drug store &amp; high end. This, in my opinion, takes the cake. It has the perfect amount of coverage while still feeling light &amp; it smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I really just adore this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving Korean BB creams.  I have purchased about 30 different kinds.  This is nice a blend like loose pudding not quite liquid and not quite cream.  The texture is nice and smooth.  The #1 would be for the more fair skinned...nice coverage and looks natural.</li>
            <li> LOVE. Lightly scented. Smells very fresh. Cute bottle too. I&#x27;m the lightest shade in the drugstore and i got shade 1. I love the sponge that comes w. It too!</li>
            <li> Jelly texture.  Flower smell.  Cute glass bottle. Natural finish.  Medium coverage.  But made me break out.  Not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I got the lighter one and it was extremely pale so I might try the more yellow shade. It doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on my skin very long it was also very hard to blend even with the sponge it brings which is still a lot better than trying to apply it with your fingers. It was very thick and didn&#x27;t glide on to my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It blended in pretty well on my cheeks but on my nose it made my pores appear larger and it wore off in maybe an hour or 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did realize that it didn&#x27;t seem to break me out and I have sensitive skin that breaks out with almost every foundation.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant. The texture of the bb cream is jelly like but for me, it is a little bit too dry, I have to put on a lot of moisturizer prior putting on this bb cream. Overall, it is a great product that gives you medium coverage. BTW, the color of the bb cream has a more orange tone.</li>
            <li> I am a bb cream fan but this one is very strange because is VERY dry, even when I have medium to oily skin it dries my skin a lot. The coverage is very poor and only last maximum 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;To be honest I don&#x27;t recomend this.</li>
            <li> I want to return. I believe this was used. It had no safety seal on the BB cream and there were air bubbles already in the bottle. Very messy, it looks like someone had it for months! Disappointed and grossed out</li>
            <li> Based on the previous reviews, I really expected to like this product. I have used many Korean BB and CC creams and this is the first one I&#x27;ve used that is just DRY. I don&#x27;t understand how something described as &amp;#34;jelly&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;bouncy&amp;#34; can be difficult to blend and dries with such a dull, dry finish. I even have oily skin and it was hard to spread it on my face. Sigh. However, the bottle and applicator sponge are really nice.</li>
