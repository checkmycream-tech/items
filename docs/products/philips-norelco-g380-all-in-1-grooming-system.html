            <li>and I am very happy with this Norelco product.</li>
            <li>MY POINT OF VIEW NORELCO MAKES THE BEST GROOMERS I HAVE USE UP TO THIS DATE.</li>

            <li>It was the best thing I could have got him.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with what was all included, except that no stand was provided.  </li>

            <li>I bought this product because for many years now I have had a Norelco shaving machine that has worked perfectly well for me</li>

            <li>My shaving experience with this thing is pleasant...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>I figured it was overkill for just a nose hair trimmer, but it was a good price</li>
            <li>and he just loved it.  </li>
            <li>This may not be the best grooming system available</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco G380 All-in-1 Grooming System]] isn&#x27;t nearly as good as the cheaper (newer) version, the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>it good though.  </li>
            <li>Turns out, it works great for trimming ear hair (both inside and on the outer rim), and even has a good attachment for trimming those more \\&quot;delicate\\&quot; areas.  </li>
            <li>it does not pull hairs which is very refreshing for a trimmer.</li>
            <li>it does not pull hairs which is very refreshing for a trimmer.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with it and haven&#x27;t had many</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, although I think it came with more attachments than I am ever going to need.</li>
            <li>Ok, maybe it doesn&#x27;t shave great.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m very satisfied, also regarding the price</li>
            <li>Save your money for a better brand/model!</li>
            <li>As a nose-hair trimmer, it works, but not as effectively as one I had which was dedicated to that purpose - this one takes longer to do it.  </li>
            <li>Features are nice.  </li>
            <li>The trimmers work nice.  </li>
            <li>A nice trimmer, not cumbersome at all like the Remington trimmers.</li>
            <li>This did the job nicely and I was all trimmed up in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li>Nice that it can be rinsed under water.</li>
            <li>The system is very well built and very attractive.</li>
            <li>So have some kind of backup clipper to use  in case</li>
            <li>I am glad a chose a good product for him to trim his beard.</li>
            <li>In fact it doesn&#x27;t shave good at all :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal Norelco razor user for over 50 years, a Sonicare user for about a year...and have always been happy with the performance of the products.   </li>
            <li>The motor is still strong, too, especially at full charge.</li>
            <li>If you want something cheap that cuts your hair this is good.</li>
            <li>I have used the product and find it handy in many ways.</li>
            <li>This product is great for anyone that wants to keep a tidy beard, it has all the attachments that would ever be required.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I found the All-in-1 Grooming System to be a pretty good shaver, but the nice thing is all of the attachment and options.</li>
            <li>but they need to put a better battery in this or enable it to run when plugged in.</li>
            <li>Too many attachments that I probably won&#x27;t ever use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>AFTER BUYING SO MANY BRANDS I COME TO LEARN THAT</li>
            <li>Just try and return something to Amazon after the magic 30-day threshhold is passed.</li>
            <li>it seems safe.  </li>
            <li>He was extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>but it requires a bit more attention from me.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been to a barber since I discovered I can use a clipper to cut my beard and hair many years ago.       </li>
            <li>I thought, in spite of the $27 price, that, if it was a Norelco product, it would be OK.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>, I was told that Philips Norelco doesn&#x27;t provide the stand anymore, but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure I can find a organizer at bed, bath, and beyond. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;You won&#x27;t find a better unit for the price.</li>
            <li>more addition is that I started to search for a &#x27;stubble&#x27; trimmer for my face and the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Just awesome, actually.</li>
            <li>it will leave a very fine layer of stubble which is fine by me.</li>
            <li>it will leave a very fine layer of stubble which is fine by me.</li>
            <li>It worked nicely while it did, but about 8 months into owning it, the battery would deplete within a day of full recharge.</li>
            <li>Far from great.  </li>
            <li>I came to find out that he actually used it and loved it!</li>
            <li>so you can easily get un evan hair cuts.    </li>
            <li>and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>Had one of these and was fine, but eventually died.  </li>
            <li>SO SMOOTH AND EVEN .FROM</li>
            <li>The end result will be great, but this requires multiple passes to cut all of your hair.  </li>
            <li>The head detaches so you can clean the fine hair \\&quot;dust\\&quot; out.</li>
            <li>My husband does all of his own hair and beard trimming, and is always looking for high quality grooming tools.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied so far.</li>
            <li>and it was time to clean up</li>
            <li>really like this trimmer - seems to be more precise than others.</li>
            <li>Right where you would want to put your thumb for strong control.</li>
            <li>I have a full beard that I like to keep neatly trimmed and outlined.</li>
            <li>Works good if you pay extra attention to the amount of pressure you use.</li>
            <li>that is much cheaper and better</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t get more than a year out of this.</li>
            <li>but I think for the price it has tremendous functionality.</li>
            <li>He had an older version of it before and it lasted many years before we replaced it with this one.</li>
            <li>The hair trimmer and guide fill with hair quickly and prevent the blades from doing their job.  </li>
            <li>I have been loyal customer</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for sure.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and easy to handle and travel with.     </li>
            <li>The older one simply dropped into a cradle after use and used magnetic induction for recharging, very handy.</li>
            <li>actual shave was pretty good, for what that is worth.</li>
            <li>The all-in-one notion is useful, though it does not work as well as dedicated products.  </li>
            <li>He said it was much better than the kit he had and tossed his old one.</li>
            <li>The all-in one grooming system proves that you get what you pay for...</li>
            <li>The nose/ear trimmer, just doesn&#x27;t cut worth a darn.  </li>
            <li>This one you&#x27;re looking at can never be worth $80</li>
            <li>At $15-$20 each, it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Trims fine, holds a charge a decent length of time.</li>
            <li>this gets right to it, huh?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>and it also has the charger built right into the holder , witch I didnot recieve.</li>
            <li>Though the attachments that control length have a lot of \\&quot;wiggle room.\\&quot; For a consistent length you either need to avoid putting any pressure at all, or make sure you are constantly putting full pressure on.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s had several different ones over the years, and says that this one is the best so far.  </li>
            <li>Still OK for basic trimming</li>
            <li>(but I don&#x27;t see why I would misuse them in the first place).</li>
            <li>The motor unit itself is comfortable in the hand and not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>Not expensive for the quality.</li>
            <li>Another benefit is that you can rinse all the attachments under hot water in addition to brushing the hair out prior to that to ensure a very clean trimmer.</li>

            <li>It has never failed, but for one thing, and that was the large beard trimming attachment, which the \\&quot;catch\\&quot; for adjusting length of trim broke, but only after I dropped it (more than once).</li>
            <li>motor seems strong - i use it mainly on my hair (or lack there of) to keep it super short / shaved.</li>
            <li>That means it could easily stop in mid use.  </li>
            <li>The parts are very smooth, light and hard to hold onto.</li>
            <li>A man can still look neat if he shapes up the facial hair before reducing it to fine stubble.</li>
            <li>A man can still look neat if he shapes up the facial hair before reducing it to fine stubble.</li>
            <li>I have used it only about 5 times now, but it works fine for me.</li>
            <li>Its a nice little trimmer and not cumbersome at all like the remington trimmers.</li>
            <li>Hard to find good rechargeable.</li>
            <li>stand is compact and doesn&#x27;t really take up much counter real estate at all.</li>
            <li>The attachment for trimming hair in ears and nose works very well.</li>
            <li>So much so that when he opened it Christmas morning, he immediately trimmed his nose hairs.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t here any comments so didn&#x27;t really know if he was using mine or got something else.</li>
            <li>It does everything and more then he expected.</li>
            <li>Very Dissatisfied.  </li>
            <li>he liked the fact that it had all these different guards for different lengths and it has a nose hair trimmer as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s somewhat lightweight and delicate, and one needs to be careful when using it, like making sure you push the release button when pulling off a head, but all of its attachments do pretty nice job, and are quite flexible.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;Addendum to my initial review: I&#x27;ve just downgraded my original 4 star to a 3 star review.</li>
            <li>Not bad for this last one having lasted 15yrs!</li>
            <li>it only takes a second to remove the hair for each pass -- but is different from what you might expect if you are used to high powered non battery operated clippers, which can cut your hair in one swoop the way you might mow your lawn, (but don&#x27;t do as good a job as this unit)       </li>
            <li>I mainly want this because I need a nose, eyebrow and beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>Thought it was decent.</li>
            <li>My older Norelco trimmer did a yeoman&#x27;s job but did not have all the attachments this Model has.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve researched this G380 on Philips website and is shows that the G380 is actually older (2006) than the G370 (2010)</li>
            <li>This unit is now back to original power, and I haven&#x27;t had to recharge in over 3 weeks of normal use and it functions like new).</li>
            <li>Now it will not hold a charge for more than a few minutes and it will not run if plugged into the charger.</li>
            <li>If you want something more heavy duty, try something else.</li>
            <li>how is it possible for the machine to have hair inside if it is a fresh one..</li>
            <li>(you can try this a few times to make sure it is fully drained).</li>
            <li>And when I say I&#x27;ve used it, I mean I&#x27;ve used about 3-4 a year because I cut my own hair with it.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new trimmer and selected this one trusting the brand name.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t travel outside of the USA, it&#x27;s a reasonable jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none product that does what it says reasonably well, though a bit flimsy in use.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty coarse beard, but it cuts just fine, even at half</li>
            <li>I just bought this at a local Rite Aid Pharmacy and used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an old nose hair trimmer that had died.  </li>
            <li>AND I AM 53 YEARS OLD.</li>
            <li>Replacing the battery requires a so called professional.</li>
            <li>It is recommended that you completely discharge the unit before charging it.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worked well for me so far.</li>
            <li>I am sad to say that this model is not as good.</li>
            <li>Also, the release button that lets the guard drop all the way to the lowest setting is right in the center of the head.</li>
            <li>I could not simply open and replace with a new battery.</li>
            <li>I have a beard and so don&#x27;t care about this, but this probably won&#x27;t substitute for a bladed razor, if you need to be shaved right down to the skin.      </li>
            <li>Asked me to sent the old one back, prepaid shipping, and next thing i knew i had this new model delivered.</li>
            <li>With a few caveats this product does a better job than any other clipper.    </li>
            <li>It has a cheap little organizer but as long as your not rough with it, it shouldnt break.</li>
            <li>or so I usually hit it by mistake and wind up having to shave my whole beard much closer than I wanted to match the swath I just cut out of it.</li>
            <li>Just remember folks this is a trimmer not a wet blade or electric razor..</li>
            <li>Just remember folks, this is a trimmer not a wet blade or electric razor...</li>
            <li>It does a good job of cutting beard, hair or mustache.      </li>
            <li>i bought this especially for my 3 year old son and now i have to look for a new one in shop and not in online as i am not ready to take a chance again..</li>
            <li>It was a let down because the trimmer was comparatively weaker than the 20xl, couldn&#x27;t really cut a chunk of hair (would strain and pull it) and didnt get close enough to the skin for the shaver function.</li>
            <li>The thing is all plastic which I could live with if it only had some ease of use and features that were little more than poorly executed gimmicks.</li>

            <li> I found the All-in-1 Grooming System to be a pretty good shaver, but the nice thing is all of the attachment and options.</li>
            <li> but they need to put a better battery in this or enable it to run when plugged in.</li>
            <li> Too many attachments that I probably won&#x27;t ever use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> AFTER BUYING SO MANY BRANDS I COME TO LEARN THAT</li>
            <li> Just try and return something to Amazon after the magic 30-day threshhold is passed.</li>
            <li> it seems safe.  </li>
            <li> He was extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> but it requires a bit more attention from me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been to a barber since I discovered I can use a clipper to cut my beard and hair many years ago.       </li>
            <li> I thought, in spite of the $27 price, that, if it was a Norelco product, it would be OK.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> , I was told that Philips Norelco doesn&#x27;t provide the stand anymore, but that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure I can find a organizer at bed, bath, and beyond. :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;You won&#x27;t find a better unit for the price.</li>
            <li> more addition is that I started to search for a &#x27;stubble&#x27; trimmer for my face and the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Just awesome, actually.</li>
            <li> it will leave a very fine layer of stubble which is fine by me.</li>
            <li> it will leave a very fine layer of stubble which is fine by me.</li>
            <li> It worked nicely while it did, but about 8 months into owning it, the battery would deplete within a day of full recharge.</li>
            <li> Far from great.  </li>
            <li> I came to find out that he actually used it and loved it!</li>
            <li> so you can easily get un evan hair cuts.    </li>
            <li> and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Had one of these and was fine, but eventually died.  </li>
            <li> SO SMOOTH AND EVEN .FROM</li>
            <li> The end result will be great, but this requires multiple passes to cut all of your hair.  </li>
            <li> The head detaches so you can clean the fine hair \\&quot;dust\\&quot; out.</li>
            <li> My husband does all of his own hair and beard trimming, and is always looking for high quality grooming tools.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> and it was time to clean up</li>
            <li> really like this trimmer - seems to be more precise than others.</li>
            <li> Right where you would want to put your thumb for strong control.</li>
            <li> I have a full beard that I like to keep neatly trimmed and outlined.</li>
            <li> Works good if you pay extra attention to the amount of pressure you use.</li>
            <li> that is much cheaper and better</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t get more than a year out of this.</li>
            <li> but I think for the price it has tremendous functionality.</li>
            <li> He had an older version of it before and it lasted many years before we replaced it with this one.</li>
            <li> The hair trimmer and guide fill with hair quickly and prevent the blades from doing their job.  </li>
            <li> I have been loyal customer</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for sure.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and easy to handle and travel with.     </li>
            <li> The older one simply dropped into a cradle after use and used magnetic induction for recharging, very handy.</li>
            <li> actual shave was pretty good, for what that is worth.</li>
            <li> The all-in-one notion is useful, though it does not work as well as dedicated products.  </li>
            <li> He said it was much better than the kit he had and tossed his old one.</li>
            <li> The all-in one grooming system proves that you get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> The nose/ear trimmer, just doesn&#x27;t cut worth a darn.  </li>
            <li> This one you&#x27;re looking at can never be worth $80</li>
            <li> At $15-$20 each, it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Trims fine, holds a charge a decent length of time.</li>
            <li> this gets right to it, huh?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> and it also has the charger built right into the holder , witch I didnot recieve.</li>
            <li> Though the attachments that control length have a lot of \\&quot;wiggle room.\\&quot; For a consistent length you either need to avoid putting any pressure at all, or make sure you are constantly putting full pressure on.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s had several different ones over the years, and says that this one is the best so far.  </li>
            <li> Still OK for basic trimming</li>
            <li> (but I don&#x27;t see why I would misuse them in the first place).</li>
            <li> The motor unit itself is comfortable in the hand and not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> Not expensive for the quality.</li>
            <li> Another benefit is that you can rinse all the attachments under hot water in addition to brushing the hair out prior to that to ensure a very clean trimmer.</li>

            <li> It has never failed, but for one thing, and that was the large beard trimming attachment, which the \\&quot;catch\\&quot; for adjusting length of trim broke, but only after I dropped it (more than once).</li>
            <li> motor seems strong - i use it mainly on my hair (or lack there of) to keep it super short / shaved.</li>
            <li> That means it could easily stop in mid use.  </li>
            <li> The parts are very smooth, light and hard to hold onto.</li>
            <li> A man can still look neat if he shapes up the facial hair before reducing it to fine stubble.</li>
            <li> A man can still look neat if he shapes up the facial hair before reducing it to fine stubble.</li>
            <li> I have used it only about 5 times now, but it works fine for me.</li>
            <li> Its a nice little trimmer and not cumbersome at all like the remington trimmers.</li>
            <li> Hard to find good rechargeable.</li>
            <li> stand is compact and doesn&#x27;t really take up much counter real estate at all.</li>
            <li> The attachment for trimming hair in ears and nose works very well.</li>
            <li> So much so that when he opened it Christmas morning, he immediately trimmed his nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t here any comments so didn&#x27;t really know if he was using mine or got something else.</li>
            <li> It does everything and more then he expected.</li>
            <li> Very Dissatisfied.  </li>
            <li> he liked the fact that it had all these different guards for different lengths and it has a nose hair trimmer as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat lightweight and delicate, and one needs to be careful when using it, like making sure you push the release button when pulling off a head, but all of its attachments do pretty nice job, and are quite flexible.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;Addendum to my initial review: I&#x27;ve just downgraded my original 4 star to a 3 star review.</li>
            <li> Not bad for this last one having lasted 15yrs!</li>
            <li> it only takes a second to remove the hair for each pass -- but is different from what you might expect if you are used to high powered non battery operated clippers, which can cut your hair in one swoop the way you might mow your lawn, (but don&#x27;t do as good a job as this unit)       </li>
            <li> I mainly want this because I need a nose, eyebrow and beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Thought it was decent.</li>
            <li> My older Norelco trimmer did a yeoman&#x27;s job but did not have all the attachments this Model has.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve researched this G380 on Philips website and is shows that the G380 is actually older (2006) than the G370 (2010)</li>
            <li> This unit is now back to original power, and I haven&#x27;t had to recharge in over 3 weeks of normal use and it functions like new).</li>
            <li> Now it will not hold a charge for more than a few minutes and it will not run if plugged into the charger.</li>
            <li> If you want something more heavy duty, try something else.</li>
            <li> how is it possible for the machine to have hair inside if it is a fresh one..</li>
            <li> (you can try this a few times to make sure it is fully drained).</li>
            <li> And when I say I&#x27;ve used it, I mean I&#x27;ve used about 3-4 a year because I cut my own hair with it.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new trimmer and selected this one trusting the brand name.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t travel outside of the USA, it&#x27;s a reasonable jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none product that does what it says reasonably well, though a bit flimsy in use.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty coarse beard, but it cuts just fine, even at half</li>
            <li> I just bought this at a local Rite Aid Pharmacy and used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old nose hair trimmer that had died.  </li>
            <li> AND I AM 53 YEARS OLD.</li>
            <li> Replacing the battery requires a so called professional.</li>
            <li> It is recommended that you completely discharge the unit before charging it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worked well for me so far.</li>
            <li> I am sad to say that this model is not as good.</li>
            <li> Also, the release button that lets the guard drop all the way to the lowest setting is right in the center of the head.</li>
            <li> I could not simply open and replace with a new battery.</li>
            <li> I have a beard and so don&#x27;t care about this, but this probably won&#x27;t substitute for a bladed razor, if you need to be shaved right down to the skin.      </li>
            <li> Asked me to sent the old one back, prepaid shipping, and next thing i knew i had this new model delivered.</li>
            <li> With a few caveats this product does a better job than any other clipper.    </li>
            <li> It has a cheap little organizer but as long as your not rough with it, it shouldnt break.</li>
            <li> or so I usually hit it by mistake and wind up having to shave my whole beard much closer than I wanted to match the swath I just cut out of it.</li>
            <li> Just remember folks this is a trimmer not a wet blade or electric razor..</li>
            <li> Just remember folks, this is a trimmer not a wet blade or electric razor...</li>
            <li> It does a good job of cutting beard, hair or mustache.      </li>
            <li> i bought this especially for my 3 year old son and now i have to look for a new one in shop and not in online as i am not ready to take a chance again..</li>
            <li> It was a let down because the trimmer was comparatively weaker than the 20xl, couldn&#x27;t really cut a chunk of hair (would strain and pull it) and didnt get close enough to the skin for the shaver function.</li>
            <li> The thing is all plastic which I could live with if it only had some ease of use and features that were little more than poorly executed gimmicks.</li>
            <li> The razor is too small and underpowered to be used for anything other than light beard trimming, but even worse, the motor gave out a little more than four weeks after receiving it.</li>
            <li> As a facial-hair trimmer, it works, though it seems a little flimsy compared to an older Norelco beard-trimmer I used before the battery died.  </li>
            <li> The only negative so far is the fact that it has to be plugged-in to charge, must be nearly discharged, and requires one to charge the trimmer for a specific period of time.</li>
            <li> Its not hard or complicated --you just have to do it right.    </li>
            <li> The only faults I&#x27;ve had with the G370 is that the &#x27;spring&#x27; mechanism that allows you to vary the cutting height no longer provides the proper resistance after many uses - resulting in some varied height.</li>
            <li> The only other device I never had/have that problem with is my braun 360 complete (parts of the year I shave, other parts of the year I trim).</li>
            <li> The trimmer works well, holds a charge a long time...</li>
            <li> and I agree with some of the other reviewers that the attachments are a bit fragile</li>
            <li> This was with just using it every other day or so for basic trimming.</li>
            <li> Not good for much.</li>
            <li> but it just was not powerful enough.</li>
            <li> It also has a small organizer, but as long as you&#x27;re not rough with it, it should&#x27;nt break.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d actually give it maybe a two and a half</li>
            <li> This will cut only a little bit of hair at a time,  so you need  to repeatedly  use it, brush the hair away from the blades with your finger, and use it again to cut all of your hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The nose/ear hair trimmer jammed up on me, but I freed the cutting strip inside, which got hung up on the metal retainer, and it&#x27;s worked fine ever since.</li>
            <li> so be careful not to drop any part of this set.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful that the length setting doesn&#x27;t change while you&#x27;re using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had to be careful as attachments moved</li>
            <li> If you do things correctly you will have no problem, but if you attempt to put an attachment on backwards, or otherwise aren&#x27;t careful you could break the plastic parts of the attachments.  </li>
            <li> My wife gave me a haircut the other day</li>
            <li> The price was lower than any of the other places I shopped around at</li>
            <li> Just a hint if you have one and are looking to replace the G380 due to battery loss give this a try once a year:&lt;br /&gt;Run</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it 4 is because the hair and beard attachments are of delicate quality and I feel like they can break if I am not too careful</li>
            <li> I received all the parts and the charger, even a little bag to hold everything, but I expected to also be sent the stand that&#x27;s pictured with all the attachments and that was not the case.</li>
            <li> foil attachment works well, though if your beard is a bit long, you&#x27;ll need to trim it down with the raw exposed blade of the shaver, which I do anyway for my neck.</li>
            <li> It works ONLY on 110-120 VAC (USA voltage) and NOT on 220v systems, which is the rule in Europe and common in Asia.  </li>
            <li> A lot of bells and whistles for this system but not worth it.</li>
            <li> This was bought to replace my husband&#x27;s old system, whose charger had broken.  </li>
            <li> Got the 20xl previously.</li>
            <li> I had a previous model where the charger quit, which was still on warranty.</li>
            <li> I asked for this for christmas to replace a previous model.  </li>
            <li> He was not sure at first but after trying each piece a few times; he loves it and any thing he had previously murmured about it being the wrong brand forget it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d use this for my hair as it seems a little under powered for that</li>
            <li> for the money they could of done a little endurance testing ..</li>
            <li> The wall wart is a little bulky, but I don&#x27;t care about that.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it did work very well in cutting and trimming hair.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Once the rechargeable battery is dead, the unit does not work when plugged in.</li>
            <li> I picked this up a few years ago in Bed Bath and Beyond</li>
            <li> The adjustable heads have a lot of play in them resulting in an uneven trim if any pressure is used at all.  </li>
            <li> The piece would invariably bounce off the counter and onto the floor or worse, into the toilet.</li>
            <li> Why doesn&#x27;t it just come with at least a half charge?  </li>
            <li> I got a refund, but was more disappointed in norelco&#x27;s poor workmanship, materials cutting (shaver was smaller than it predecessor).</li>
            <li> However, its size makes it difficult to use especially for trimming hair.</li>
            <li> No more remembering to plug it in.  </li>
            <li> i was totally not satisfied and iam throwing it off...</li>
            <li> The ear/nose attachment is not very good either.</li>
            <li> but the blades have become a bit dull.</li>
            <li> and it still holds a charge for at least a week, even two (with lighter use).</li>
            <li> But at the rate it&#x27;s going, that could be another couple years, at least.</li>
            <li> By this I mean when the battery is getting weak</li>
            <li> My brother is a professional athlete and during their playoffs his team grew out nasty mops of hair and crazy facial hair.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that you didn&#x27;t send me the same thing.</li>
            <li> this was poor marketing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i bought it specifically for my neck, because i get bad razor burn there.  </li>
            <li> when the package reached my hands i was shocked to see it was refurbished/opened one which still had hair in the machine..</li>
            <li> Retarded.  </li>
            <li> you are stuck looking like an idiot until it charges.</li>

            <li> Its a nice little trimmer and not cumbersome at all like the remington trimmers. It has a cheap little organizer but as long as your not rough with it, it shouldnt break. Another benefit is that you can rinse all the attachments under hot water in addition to brushing the hair out prior to that to ensure a very clean trimmer. &lt;br /&gt;   Just remember folks this is a trimmer not a wet blade or electric razor..it will leave a very fine layer of stubble which is fine by me. A man can still look neat if he shapes up the facial hair before reducing it to fine stubble. My shaving experience with this thing is pleasant...it does not pull hairs which is very refreshing for a trimmer. The only other device I never had/have that problem with is my braun 360 complete (parts of the year I shave, other parts of the year I trim). Its a very nice package and efficient. The only drawback is that it seems fragile...so be careful not to drop any part of this set.</li>
            <li> The all-in-one notion is useful, though it does not work as well as dedicated products.  As a nose-hair trimmer, it works, but not as effectively as one I had which was dedicated to that purpose - this one takes longer to do it.  As a facial-hair trimmer, it works, though it seems a little flimsy compared to an older Norelco beard-trimmer I used before the battery died.  You have to be careful that the length setting doesn&#x27;t change while you&#x27;re using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The transformer is not multi-voltage.  It works ONLY on 110-120 VAC (USA voltage) and NOT on 220v systems, which is the rule in Europe and common in Asia.  The USA voltage requirement is not mentioned in the specifications here, or on the box, and I bought it assuming multi-voltage since the earlier Norelco trimmer had it.  I may well return the product because of this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t travel outside of the USA, it&#x27;s a reasonable jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none product that does what it says reasonably well, though a bit flimsy in use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good.  Far from great.  Features are nice.  Takes FOREVER to charge initially.  Why doesn&#x27;t it just come with at least a half charge?  Retarded.  The trimmers work nice.  Everyone else is correct, not a close shave, but if you wanna be Don Johnson circa 1987 - it works great!  It&#x27;s the damned lack of a charged battery at purchase that drives me nuts, rest is acceptable, especially the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old nose hair trimmer that had died.  I figured it was overkill for just a nose hair trimmer, but it was a good price so I got it anyway.  Turns out, it works great for trimming ear hair (both inside and on the outer rim), and even has a good attachment for trimming those more \\&quot;delicate\\&quot; areas.  All in all, a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a birthday present for my dad and he just loved it.  he liked the fact that it had all these different guards for different lengths and it has a nose hair trimmer as well.</li>

            <li> I just bought this at a local Rite Aid Pharmacy and used it for the first time. I mainly want this because I need a nose, eyebrow and beard trimmer. I have a full beard that I like to keep neatly trimmed and outlined. This did the job nicely and I was all trimmed up in a matter of minutes. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d use this for my hair as it seems a little under powered for that and I agree with some of the other reviewers that the attachments are a bit fragile which is why this gets a four and not a five. However, for the $20 I paid for it, it seems perfect for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum to my initial review: I&#x27;ve just downgraded my original 4 star to a 3 star review. I&#x27;d actually give it maybe a two and a half if I could. Once this was initially charged I didn&#x27;t have to charge it again for about 3 weeks. This was with just using it every other day or so for basic trimming. Now it will not hold a charge for more than a few minutes and it will not run if plugged into the charger. Still OK for basic trimming but they need to put a better battery in this or enable it to run when plugged in.</li>
            <li> Had one of these and was fine, but eventually died.  Had to be careful as attachments moved so you can easily get un evan hair cuts.    My replacement was a Wahl (midprice point, rechargeable) and it just died.    Hard to find good rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Got the 20xl previously. Thought it was decent. Then got this. It was a let down because the trimmer was comparatively weaker than the 20xl, couldn&#x27;t really cut a chunk of hair (would strain and pull it) and didnt get close enough to the skin for the shaver function. A lot of bells and whistles for this system but not worth it. I got a refund, but was more disappointed in norelco&#x27;s poor workmanship, materials cutting (shaver was smaller than it predecessor).</li>
            <li> Trims fine, holds a charge a decent length of time. Nice that it can be rinsed under water. Too many attachments that I probably won&#x27;t ever use but that&#x27;s not their fault. I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> In a world where neatness doesn&#x27;t always count, it is a pleasure to know that this product encourages a presentable appearance, and makes neatness simple and attainable.</li>
            <li> The system is very well built and very attractive. However, its size makes it difficult to use especially for trimming hair. The attachment for trimming hair in ears and nose works very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because for many years now I have had a Norelco shaving machine that has worked perfectly well for me and I am very happy with this Norelco product.</li>
            <li> I like the G380. I have used it only about 5 times now, but it works fine for me. The only reason I give it 4 is because the hair and beard attachments are of delicate quality and I feel like they can break if I am not too careful (but I don&#x27;t see why I would misuse them in the first place). The ear/nose attachment is not very good either. Doesn&#x27;t cut hair as well as I would like it too. If you want something cheap that cuts your hair this is good. If you want something more heavy duty, try something else.</li>
            <li> AFTER BUYING SO MANY BRANDS I COME TO LEARN THAT THIS GROOMER CUT&#x27;S MY BEARD SO SMOOTH AND EVEN .FROM MY POINT OF VIEW NORELCO MAKES THE BEST GROOMERS I HAVE USE UP TO THIS DATE. AND I AM 53 YEARS OLD.</li>
            <li> I found the All-in-1 Grooming System to be a pretty good shaver, but the nice thing is all of the attachment and options.</li>
            <li> I needed a new trimmer and selected this one trusting the brand name. I made a mistake. The thing is all plastic which I could live with if it only had some ease of use and features that were little more than poorly executed gimmicks. The parts are very smooth, light and hard to hold onto. They were constantly falling off. The button to turn it on is too close to the button that allows the removal of the head piece so I was constantly popping off the head piece when I turned it on. The piece would invariably bounce off the counter and onto the floor or worse, into the toilet. Also there is no travel case to carry all of those parts so what do you do with them if you want to bring it with you on a trip. Finally threw it all into the trash and am looking for a quality replacement. NOT recommended.</li>
            <li> This may not be the best grooming system available but I think for the price it has tremendous functionality.</li>
            <li> My brother is a professional athlete and during their playoffs his team grew out nasty mops of hair and crazy facial hair. I bought this for him as a gag gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the Playoffs and it was time to clean up I came to find out that he actually used it and loved it! He said it was much better than the kit he had and tossed his old one. He still uses this one today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess this is a second hand review but if you could see the before and after pictures you would be impressed too.</li>
            <li> The razor is too small and underpowered to be used for anything other than light beard trimming, but even worse, the motor gave out a little more than four weeks after receiving it. Just try and return something to Amazon after the magic 30-day threshhold is passed. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my fiancee and he likes it.  He uses it to trip his goatee and he said he likes all of the attachments.</li>
            <li> This product is great for anyone that wants to keep a tidy beard, it has all the attachments that would ever be required. Without this, I wouldn&#x27;t have the mood to keep a chinstrap.</li>
            <li> This was bought to replace my husband&#x27;s old system, whose charger had broken.  He uses it to groom his beard, not his hair.  He loves it; especially that it is a constant charge.  No more remembering to plug it in.  It performs well.  The storage rack is very handy.</li>
            <li> My husband grows hair every where.  I don&#x27;t mind using it on him it seems safe.  He wouldn&#x27;t like it if I cut him</li>
            <li> Once the rechargeable battery is dead, the unit does not work when plugged in. Replacing the battery requires a so called professional. I could not simply open and replace with a new battery. Unit cannot be rinsed under water. Otherwise, it did work very well in cutting and trimming hair.</li>
            <li> I gave this grooming system to my Husband for Christmas. He loves it. So much so that when he opened it Christmas morning, he immediately trimmed his nose hairs. Later that same day he trimmed up his beard and mustache. He was extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think anything can beat this Norelco set in this price range. It&#x27;s somewhat lightweight and delicate, and one needs to be careful when using it, like making sure you push the release button when pulling off a head, but all of its attachments do pretty nice job, and are quite flexible.     Something else I can say about Philips that I don&#x27;t think one can say about every company, and it&#x27;s their customer service. I had a previous model where the charger quit, which was still on warranty. When I emailed them about it, I got immediate response asking when it was bought, and that was all. Asked me to sent the old one back, prepaid shipping, and next thing i knew i had this new model delivered. No hassle, no BS.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he absolutely loved it! Great item and speed on delivery!</li>
            <li> Got this for my son for Christmas and waited. Didn&#x27;t here any comments so didn&#x27;t really know if he was using mine or got something else. Well, he opened up and let me have it. It was the best thing I could have got him. He was not sure at first but after trying each piece a few times; he loves it and any thing he had previously murmured about it being the wrong brand forget it. It does everything and more then he expected.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works well, holds a charge a long time...but the heads no longer stay on the base...plastic plastic.. for the money they could of done a little endurance testing .. maybe they did...</li>
            <li> when the package reached my hands i was shocked to see it was refurbished/opened one which still had hair in the machine..how is it possible for the machine to have hair inside if it is a fresh one..philips norelco is pushing all its refurbished products through amazon..(it was mentioned by one of the reviewer also)..i was totally not satisfied and iam throwing it off...i bought this especially for my 3 year old son and now i have to look for a new one in shop and not in online as i am not ready to take a chance again..totally dissatisfied...</li>
            <li> This product is amazing ,it has everything you need for a shave would recommend to anybody!</li>
            <li> I have used the product and find it handy in many ways. My older Norelco trimmer did a yeoman&#x27;s job but did not have all the attachments this Model has.  The only negative so far is the fact that it has to be plugged-in to charge, must be nearly discharged, and requires one to charge the trimmer for a specific period of time. The older one simply dropped into a cradle after use and used magnetic induction for recharging, very handy. I guess I&#x27;ll get used to this one but it requires a bit more attention from me.</li>
            <li> With a few caveats this product does a better job than any other clipper.    I use this product to trim my mustache and beard and cut my hair.  I haven&#x27;t been to a barber since I discovered I can use a clipper to cut my beard and hair many years ago.       It does a good job of cutting beard, hair or mustache.      It is very lightweight and easy to handle and travel with.     Cons:  The attachments are fragile.  Read the manual before using and don&#x27;t force   any attachment in place.   If you do things correctly you will have no problem, but if you attempt to put an attachment on backwards, or otherwise aren&#x27;t careful you could break the plastic parts of the attachments.  SO READ THE MANUAL AND PRACTICE PUTTING ON AND TAKING OFF THE ATTACHMENTS BEFORE YOU USE THIS.   Its not hard or complicated --you just have to do it right.    It is recommended that you completely discharge the unit before charging it.  That means it could easily stop in mid use.  So have some kind of backup clipper to use  in case this happens.       It won&#x27;t shave you as closely as a regular razor.  I have a beard and so don&#x27;t care about this, but this probably won&#x27;t substitute for a bladed razor, if you need to be shaved right down to the skin.      This will cut only a little bit of hair at a time,  so you need  to repeatedly  use it, brush the hair away from the blades with your finger, and use it again to cut all of your hair.  The end result will be great, but this requires multiple passes to cut all of your hair.  This is not a problem at all, --since it only takes a second to remove the hair for each pass -- but is different from what you might expect if you are used to high powered non battery operated clippers, which can cut your hair in one swoop the way you might mow your lawn, (but don&#x27;t do as good a job as this unit)       All in all I have four electric clippers and this is the one I use all the time.</li>
            <li> Great for the price. Very satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> After owning a Remington trimmer for about 3 years, it died. I bought this Norelco because of all its uses. I hope its battery lasts longer (then Remington) or I will just grow a beard and a pay a barber to trim me.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this system.  He had an older version of it before and it lasted many years before we replaced it with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Norelco razor user for over 50 years, a Sonicare user for about a year...and have always been happy with the performance of the products.   I thought, in spite of the $27 price, that, if it was a Norelco product, it would be OK.  The all-in one grooming system proves that you get what you pay for...the hair trimmer, the ear/nose trimmer work like you might expect...not well.  The hair trimmer and guide fill with hair quickly and prevent the blades from doing their job.  The nose/ear trimmer, just doesn&#x27;t cut worth a darn.  Save your money for a better brand/model!</li>
            <li> it works great.  My wife gave me a haircut the other day and she said, \\&quot;Man this gets right to it, huh?\\&quot;  And it did.</li>
            <li> I picked this up a few years ago in Bed Bath and Beyond for I think about $45. I am really happy with it and haven&#x27;t had many issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to trim my beard and it wortks great. It goes like a dream and makes trimmed my beard effortless. Its really a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife tried using it for hair cuts but it just was not powerful enough.</li>
            <li> Didnot have the holder for everything and it also has the charger built right into the holder , witch I didnot recieve.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the same thing I saw in the picture I was disappointed that you didn&#x27;t send me the same thing.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this brand of shaver for my hubby for some time now. And in our 32 yrs together he has only gone through 2 of these kits in that time. I bought him this one for Christmas as the last one is still working but the blades have become a bit dull. Not bad for this last one having lasted 15yrs!</li>
            <li> wish they still make this system</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, although I think it came with more attachments than I am ever going to need. The price was lower than any of the other places I shopped around at and it&#x27;s worked well for me so far. Deffiantly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for probably 6+ years and it is still going strong. Just a hint if you have one and are looking to replace the G380 due to battery loss give this a try once a year:&lt;br /&gt;Run until the battery discharges fully. By this I mean when the battery is getting weak I take the attachments off and turn on the power switch. Leave the switch on until the gizmos stop rotating then turn off. Wait about 20 minutes or so and then power on to deplete the rest of the battery (you can try this a few times to make sure it is fully drained). After discharging, plug it into the charger and let fully charge (I think I let mine charge overnight). This unit is now back to original power, and I haven&#x27;t had to recharge in over 3 weeks of normal use and it functions like new). Just a tip to save you some money before deciding to buy another unit which I almost did. I could not find a replacement battery when I thought the battery was the issue.</li>
            <li> really like this trimmer - seems to be more precise than others. motor seems strong - i use it mainly on my hair (or lack there of) to keep it super short / shaved.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem is the battery. The unit cannot be run from outlet power. You must charge the battery and use that for power. This has two problems:&lt;br /&gt;1) if the battery dies mid shave you are stuck looking like an idiot until it charges. This becomes a bigger problem as the battery life declines. It is also a concern if you try to use the device to shave your head.&lt;br /&gt;2) After about 2 years the battery dies and you have a paper weight. An overnight charge currently gives me about 60 seconds of reduced power shaving time. Not good for much. The battery is not designed to be consumer replaceable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual shave was pretty good, for what that is worth. Though the attachments that control length have a lot of \\&quot;wiggle room.\\&quot; For a consistent length you either need to avoid putting any pressure at all, or make sure you are constantly putting full pressure on. Also, the release button that lets the guard drop all the way to the lowest setting is right in the center of the head. Right where you would want to put your thumb for strong control. It isn&#x27;t unusable or anything, but once a year or so I usually hit it by mistake and wind up having to shave my whole beard much closer than I wanted to match the swath I just cut out of it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband as a Christmas gift and he LOVES it! I am glad a chose a good product for him to trim his beard. I highly recommend it for sure. It doesn&#x27;t come with the stand but that&#x27;s ok, I was told that Philips Norelco doesn&#x27;t provide the stand anymore, but that&#x27;s ok, I&#x27;m sure I can find a organizer at bed, bath, and beyond. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this model for over five years now. It has never failed, but for one thing, and that was the large beard trimming attachment, which the \\&quot;catch\\&quot; for adjusting length of trim broke, but only after I dropped it (more than once). However, the smaller of the two is still functioning just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nose/ear hair trimmer jammed up on me, but I freed the cutting strip inside, which got hung up on the metal retainer, and it&#x27;s worked fine ever since. That was two years ago that this happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil attachment works well, though if your beard is a bit long, you&#x27;ll need to trim it down with the raw exposed blade of the shaver, which I do anyway for my neck. The head detaches so you can clean the fine hair \\&quot;dust\\&quot; out. I just blow it off, though the included brush can be used. There&#x27;s a comb included, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall cleaning is a snap. And if you have concerns about the battery lasting? Five years and it still holds a charge for at least a week, even two (with lighter use). The motor is still strong, too, especially at full charge. I have a pretty coarse beard, but it cuts just fine, even at half charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is compact and doesn&#x27;t really take up much counter real estate at all. The wall wart is a little bulky, but I don&#x27;t care about that. The motor unit itself is comfortable in the hand and not heavy at all. And the noise level is relatively quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t find a better unit for the price. I&#x27;m buying another one and storing it away for when my current one finally dies. But at the rate it&#x27;s going, that could be another couple years, at least. No, I&#x27;m not kidding. Only the battery dying will be the reason I replace it.</li>
            <li> I asked for this for christmas to replace a previous model.  I am sad to say that this model is not as good. The adjustable heads have a lot of play in them resulting in an uneven trim if any pressure is used at all.  Works good if you pay extra attention to the amount of pressure you use.</li>
            <li> The product works great and I&#x27;m very happy with what was all included, except that no stand was provided.  I received all the parts and the charger, even a little bag to hold everything, but I expected to also be sent the stand that&#x27;s pictured with all the attachments and that was not the case.</li>
            <li> This [[ASIN:B000FED5DK Philips Norelco G380 All-in-1 Grooming System]] isn&#x27;t nearly as good as the cheaper (newer) version, the [[ASIN:B000FED5DU Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System]]. This one you&#x27;re looking at can never be worth $80+  I&#x27;ve researched this G380 on Philips website and is shows that the G380 is actually older (2006) than the G370 (2010) that is much cheaper and better - I&#x27;ve used both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the [[ASIN:B000FED5DU Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System]] for almost 4 years now. And when I say I&#x27;ve used it, I mean I&#x27;ve used about 3-4 a year because I cut my own hair with it.  At $15-$20 each, it is worth the price. Yes, the G370 has some faults but it just works. With that said, this review is for the [[ASIN:B000FED5DK Philips Norelco G380 All-in-1 Grooming System]] &amp; it is almost identical to the [[ASIN:B000FED5DU Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System]] except for the color and the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy the [[ASIN:B000FED5DU Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System]] instead of this overpriced one - the G380.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, as a product designer, I&#x27;ve tried to comprehend what Philips Norelco could do to upgrade the $15-ish G370 to the $80+ G380? Nothing... The only faults I&#x27;ve had with the G370 is that the &#x27;spring&#x27; mechanism that allows you to vary the cutting height no longer provides the proper resistance after many uses - resulting in some varied height. Again, I used the G370 once a week to cut my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more addition is that I started to search for a &#x27;stubble&#x27; trimmer for my face and the [[ASIN:B000FED5DU Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System]] works wonderfully for that! Just awesome, actually.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t get more than a year out of this. It worked nicely while it did, but about 8 months into owning it, the battery would deplete within a day of full recharge. At the end of the year, unusable.</li>
            <li> My husband does all of his own hair and beard trimming, and is always looking for high quality grooming tools.  He&#x27;s had several different ones over the years, and says that this one is the best so far.  Not expensive for the quality.</li>
            <li> i recently purchased the norelco g380 mutil purpose grooming kit and i am not too impressed.  it just doesnt get a close enough shave.  i bought it specifically for my neck, because i get bad razor burn there.  but it just doesnt get close enough.  everything else it good though.  lots of options.</li>
            <li> Very Dissatisfied.  Photo was deceptive Stand was not included as shown.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I choose this was to replace existing.  Norelco I have been loyal customer this was poor marketing.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe you should have Santa deliver that stand like the Company I remember as a child.</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe it doesn&#x27;t shave great. In fact it doesn&#x27;t shave good at all :) But I&#x27;m very satisfied, also regarding the price</li>
