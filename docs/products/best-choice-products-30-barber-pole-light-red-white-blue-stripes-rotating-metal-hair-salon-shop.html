            <li>Goes great next to the used barber chair</li>
            <li>This barber pole light plugs in meaning</li>
            <li>So far so good, not to be knit picking</li>
            <li>We  have this hanging on a wall, by our barber/salon tapertry, wood stove and barber chair, this section of the house is my husband&#x27;s special place,</li>

            <li> Love It, Fast Ship, Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m real happy with my barber pole.I&#x27;ve always wanted one for my barber shop but they were just too expensive. I came across this one and it&#x27;s perfect, price wise and all. I hung it in my shop window and I leave it on 24/7. I believe it has brought me more business. All the customers comment on it and like it.</li>
            <li> Light weight great price is what i expected for the price. I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This pole was easy to install, light weight, looks great and affordable. It lights up and rotates. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Nice and large and looks great in the man cave.  Arrived very quickly and was simple to put up.  Works great and makes the room look better.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Great product for the price ...Truly glad I made the purchase üëçüèΩ !!!</li>
            <li> Great quality. Quick shipping.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> It was a gift and was well received, as a professional enchancement</li>
            <li> Best deal! Looks great I bought it for my barbershop in perris pacos fresh kutts and the customers noticed it right away.</li>
            <li> So far so good, not to be knit picking but sometimes when I turn it on it squeaks like it needs to be oiled. It eventually stops squeaking or the shop becomes busy and drowns out the noise. Great product if you need to let the public know there&#x27;s a barber on duty.</li>
            <li> My husband who is a barber loved it and all his customers comment on it.  It makes for good conversations.</li>
            <li> Great pole. Only had it for a few weeks but so far it is great.</li>
            <li> Own a salon and wanted to advertise that we do mens barbering hair cuts and it&#x27;s an awesome window sign and light. Working well and a conversation piece</li>
            <li> Does&#x27;nt run as smooth as it should.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a Christmas gift I was very pleased with this and the look on the one I gave it to was priceless.</li>
            <li> Looks great on the wall, best but when it comes to this particular item... Makes for a ideal gift! Totally recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> We hung this in my husband&#x27;s Barber Shop and the customers think it&#x27;s so fun.  Services as a night light during closed hours.&lt;br /&gt;Much bigger than we expected.  Great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for almost 9 months and it&#x27;s good for the price but the chrome on the plastic is beginning to get really ugly i guess because of the sun, I wold like it to last longer.</li>
            <li> VERY NICE  PRODUCT  LOOKS AND WORKS LIKE THE $600 MODELS.</li>
            <li> Great for the price....&lt;br /&gt;It is Big and Lights Up and Swirls around ....&lt;br /&gt;Light weight and easy to install ....</li>
            <li> much needed for my shop</li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected and a little noisy when spinning but otherwise great for the man cave!</li>
            <li> It is beautiful and perfect.. Once installed I&#x27;ll add a photo... :)</li>
            <li> nice looks great in shop ,  thought it would weigh more but its super light</li>
            <li> The bulb is a size that you can&#x27;t find in the USA unless you pay $29 plus shipping. The bulb is soldered in, and taped in and almost impossible to get out. I had to take the insides out and disconnect all the wiring to pull the bulb out, only to find that the wires are soldered directly to the bulb.   I am leaving the pole down and ordering a Marvy which takes a screw-in bulb.</li>
            <li> Great product for the money. Would recommend to friend. Works very well and easy to install and use. Looks good in game room.</li>
            <li> I love love my barber pole. I out it inside as I don&#x27;t think this one is weather proof. It was easy to hang and looks great..</li>
            <li> Great just what we wanted  wish you could ship to PR great price and looks great love it will recomed.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the barber pole. It was affordable, arrived quickly, looks great.  I would recommend it as a great value.</li>
            <li> this was a gift and it arrived on time and was as depicted</li>
            <li> Awesome deal. I ordered on a monday, I had my pole on that thursday. I use mine as an exterior attraction. I had to clip the cord and hard wire it to my outside lamp socket and it works wonderfully. great economic solution. This pole rocks.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Got it for my wife as a Christmas gift.  her dad was a barber, she loved it. Goes great next to the used barber chair I got her as well.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing that would make it better would be some variable control on it, to slow the spinning down, as it spins fast.</li>
            <li> Very Good Looking and the Price Met My Expectations.  Was Placed Indoors in my Man Cave.  This is an Indoor Product that is 80 percent Plastic.  The Hanger is Metal. Lights Up and Rotates.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a barber and this is a great product</li>
            <li> We  have this hanging on a wall, by our barber/salon tapertry, wood stove and barber chair, this section of the house is my husband&#x27;s special place, oh yes our juke box is there too.</li>
            <li> Looks great at the shop</li>
            <li> We did a barbers chair, vintage razor and accessories.  This barber pole light plugs in meaning it did not have to be hard wired.  It&#x27;s light to move around and looks GREAT.</li>
