            <li>You can go to the stores and try to find your colors, but good luck!!</li>
            <li>Gorgeous color and color stays on well too!</li>
            <li>Very pleased!</li>
            <li>It is a great color and lasts all day, I have never found a lipstick that lasts like these Outlast colors do.</li>
            <li>But, for the value, it is a great bargain.</li>
            <li>good combination of lip stain and moisturer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using outlast lipstain for years now, it is an amazing product that stays on all day.</li>
            <li>Nice color.</li>
            <li>the color was more peach</li>
            <li>I love this lipcolor.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite color</li>
            <li>I love Outlast lipcolor as I can&#x27;t be bothered with reapplying lipstick continually throughout the day.</li>
            <li>The lip gloss that&#x27;s included is ok, nothing special, but nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lipstick for years now - i&#x27;ve tried other brands but this one is just the best.  </li>
            <li>Not bad!</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and the price was outstanding.</li>
            <li>Great lasting lipstick.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure it&#x27;s nail polish.</li>
            <li>This really does last and looks great.</li>
            <li>Love it and highly recommend any covergirl outlast lipstain.</li>
            <li>This is a great value, considering it has been discontinued in the stores, as far as I can tell, and I have searched all the regular stores (Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, etc.)</li>
            <li>Use the color tube first, then apply the gloss-like stick.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Been using this My Papaya for years and is hard to find locally, so this was an excellent deal for me</li>
            <li>- you really need that</li>
            <li>normally put on chap stick at least 5 times per day, but surprisingly didn&#x27;t need it during work at all using this lip color.</li>
            <li>I do like Covergirl, as the color stays true for hours and doesn&#x27;t dry out the lips very much.  </li>
            <li>It really does stay on for hours, though not usually all day.  </li>
            <li>This I wore for my wedding and the color was great, mild enough that it didn&#x27;t look too flashy but added just enough color.</li>
            <li>and I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>The fact that I only had to put it on one-two times during and entire day makes it worth it.  </li>
            <li>This is more of a dark coral color than what I expected, but it does look like the picture</li>
            <li>So, not sure what is up with this particular brand, although it is the exact number and color</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like these type of lipcolors when I first used them--seemed like putting nail polish on my lips, they were so drying and stiff.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found that the gloss doesn&#x27;t last as long as the lipstick itself, so I often just put any old gloss or chapstick that I have</li>

            <li> Pretty stupid of me since I&#x27;ve been doing most of my shopping online since 1995.</li>
            <li> As long as they make this product, i will keep buying same.</li>
            <li> The lipcolor is a shade on the pink side for me but it does last all day long.</li>
            <li> Note that the stain makes your lips feel sooooo dry</li>
            <li> As expected... nothing to rave about</li>
            <li> You put the stain on, wait a little while for it to dry (box says 60 seconds,</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the texture of it on my lips, which reminded me of a faint glue-like substance which took a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li> It usually stays on for about 4-5 hours for me, even through eating breakfast / coffee ...</li>
            <li> by lunchtime, it&#x27;s usually faded and i need to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s usually around 10-15 seconds for me), and then put on the gloss.  </li>
            <li> No more stores for me.&lt;br /&gt;Great service.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fake - not really cover girl product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line - i highly recommend this for people who hate reapplying lipstick throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have been using covergirl outlast for years, either alone or as a base coat for other colors.  </li>
            <li> DUH!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so frustrating to shop for makeup at the stores which is always a hit and miss and horribly inconsistent on the color choices.</li>

            <li> Not bad! Just Read d instructions before applying</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color and color stays on well too! Definitely a must buy!!</li>
            <li> Use the color tube first, then apply the gloss-like stick.  I was surprised at the texture of it on my lips, which reminded me of a faint glue-like substance which took a little getting used to.  The fact that I only had to put it on one-two times during and entire day makes it worth it.  I ordered one additional color after trying this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chap stick users:&lt;br /&gt;I normally put on chap stick at least 5 times per day, but surprisingly didn&#x27;t need it during work at all using this lip color.</li>
            <li> This is more of a dark coral color than what I expected, but it does look like the picture and I am pleasantly surprised. It is a great color and lasts all day, I have never found a lipstick that lasts like these Outlast colors do. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fake - not really cover girl product. Pretty sure it&#x27;s nail polish. Don&#x27;t buy it&#x27;s a scam</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lipstick for years now - i&#x27;ve tried other brands but this one is just the best.  It really does stay on for hours, though not usually all day.  It usually stays on for about 4-5 hours for me, even through eating breakfast / coffee ... by lunchtime, it&#x27;s usually faded and i need to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This includes two things - the lip stain and a lip gloss.  You put the stain on, wait a little while for it to dry (box says 60 seconds, but it&#x27;s usually around 10-15 seconds for me), and then put on the gloss.  Note that the stain makes your lips feel sooooo dry - you really need that gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that the gloss doesn&#x27;t last as long as the lipstick itself, so I often just put any old gloss or chapstick that I have afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - i highly recommend this for people who hate reapplying lipstick throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Been using this My Papaya for years and is hard to find locally, so this was an excellent deal for me</li>
            <li> I have been using covergirl outlast for years, either alone or as a base coat for other colors.  I never have my lipstick bleed above my lipline and at  the end of the day, without reapplying, i always have color on my lips. As long as they make this product, i will keep buying same.</li>
            <li> the color was more peach then I expected and product was old - guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s $6</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using outlast lipstain for years now, it is an amazing product that stays on all day. This I wore for my wedding and the color was great, mild enough that it didn&#x27;t look too flashy but added just enough color. Stays on FOREVER. Love it and highly recommend any covergirl outlast lipstain. I have 6 or so colors.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised with no problems</li>
            <li> This is a great value, considering it has been discontinued in the stores, as far as I can tell, and I have searched all the regular stores (Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, etc.) that used to carry it.  The problem with this item is that it goes on lighter and I need to put on three coats, as opposed to just the one coat on the product I used to purchase prior to be discontinuing.  So, not sure what is up with this particular brand, although it is the exact number and color I purchased regularly for years.  But, for the value, it is a great bargain.</li>
            <li> Great lasting lipstick. Thank you.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and the price was outstanding. Almost 1/3 of what I would have paid at Target or Walgreen&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this lipcolor. It may not last all day if you eat something greasy, otherwise it will last, I have been wearing it since it came out and I will continue to wear it. This is my favorite color and I hope they never discontinue it.</li>
            <li> You can go to the stores and try to find your colors, but good luck!! So this is what I&#x27;ve been doing off and on until one day I had an epiphany..GEE... DUH!!! Why hadn&#x27;t I gone online sooner. Pretty stupid of me since I&#x27;ve been doing most of my shopping online since 1995. It&#x27;s so frustrating to shop for makeup at the stores which is always a hit and miss and horribly inconsistent on the color choices. No more stores for me.&lt;br /&gt;Great service. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love Outlast lipcolor as I can&#x27;t be bothered with reapplying lipstick continually throughout the day. This really does last and looks great. Nice color.</li>
            <li> The lipcolor is a shade on the pink side for me but it does last all day long.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like these type of lipcolors when I first used them--seemed like putting nail polish on my lips, they were so drying and stiff.  I do like Covergirl, as the color stays true for hours and doesn&#x27;t dry out the lips very much.  The lip gloss that&#x27;s included is ok, nothing special, but nice.</li>
            <li> I received this product in an unsealed box and with no seal on the container.  How do I know this lipcolor has not been used?  Eeeewwwwww!</li>
            <li> good combination of lip stain and moisturer.</li>
            <li> As expected... nothing to rave about</li>
