            <li>BEST MASCARA EVER!!!!</li>
            <li>One of the best mascara&#x27;s i have used.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t really impressed, but the good news is that it doesn&#x27;t flake or smear.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is really a great lengthener for lashes.</li>
            <li>Looks amazing.</li>
            <li>There are better ones out there IMHO.</li>
            <li>Great mascara that makes my eyelashes look much fuller and longer than they ever have been.</li>
            <li>a gift for myself love this product</li>
            <li>, I still was able to apply it without smudging.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product more than once now.  </li>
            <li>one thing I don&#x27;t like is how huge the brush is.  </li>
            <li>And I haven&#x27;t had any problems with application, while I&#x27;m not an accurate person</li>
            <li>you can apply the product without it leaving a sticky, smudged mess on the eye lid, the impact on the eyes is pretty impressive.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary:  All in all, I think the lengthening effect is good but the actual product doesn&#x27;t stay where it is supposed to and smudges.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way more brown than black, and with fair skin and hair, that looks better than black.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that I have to use it all the time because I love the way it looks.....</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, it creates really long</li>
            <li>It picks up too much product.  </li>
            <li>I really like the color.  </li>
            <li>I would not pay even one dollar for it.&lt;br /&gt;I received it as a free sample and used only 2 times.</li>
            <li>Couldnt really tell there were any &amp;#34;lashes&amp;#34; in this.  </li>
            <li>The color is nice and if you only need the mascara to last for an hour,</li>
            <li>The brown/black color is nice because it&#x27;s not too dark and looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal has other products that are much better.</li>
            <li>The black brown color was a good shade for my blue eyes and helped them pop.  </li>
            <li>I use black mascara on the top lashes.  </li>
            <li>I love Maybelline&#x27;s Royal Blue and wish this came in the same color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Next best thing to false lashes indeed!</li>
            <li>For a professional work environment, the impact may be a bit much.  </li>
            <li>and I would say not thick but</li>
            <li>I can be very sensitive to mascara</li>
            <li>And there is some flaking during the day, but the long eyelashes makes it worth it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this mascara, but as many brands do, it dried out fairly fast - like in less than 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t do much for those of us old folks with short sparce lashes.</li>
            <li>I think mine was old?</li>
            <li>A couple of drops of water fixed it, so far.  </li>
            <li>I love how long and fluffy it makes my eyelashes.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Makes mess on eyelashes, not smooth, not eve close to be at least not perfect but Good.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately, whether wearing for work or play, the product just doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> I tried it with a lash primer, they didn&#x27;t work well together, the lashes became to thick and firm, so I use the mascara alone now.</li>
            <li> The applicator brush is poorly designed.  </li>
            <li> Applies very faint - doesn&#x27;t build up lashes like you&#x27;d expect it to.  </li>

            <li> BEST MASCARA EVER!!!!</li>
            <li> I think mine was old? I received it, and the mascara was very dry and clumpy. Don&#x27;t care for how HUMONGOUS the brush is. There are better ones out there IMHO.</li>
            <li> I found this product to aid in the creation of longer, thicker lashes that are curled at the ends.  The black brown color was a good shade for my blue eyes and helped them pop.  When going out, this would be the mascara I would turn to if it actually had some staying power and wasn&#x27;t so messy in its application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can apply the product without it leaving a sticky, smudged mess on the eye lid, the impact on the eyes is pretty impressive.  For a professional work environment, the impact may be a bit much.  Unfortunately, whether wearing for work or play, the product just doesn&#x27;t last.  The formula may lead to longer looking lashes, but it flakes away after only a couple of hours leaving flecks under the eyes that smudge upon an attempted removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the formula of the product, I found the applicator brush to be lacking. It picks up a lot of product and this contributes to the messy application problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the product several times and have not had any eye irritation.  I can be very sensitive to mascara but I haven&#x27;t noticed any irritation with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:  All in all, I think the lengthening effect is good but the actual product doesn&#x27;t stay where it is supposed to and smudges.  The applicator brush is poorly designed.  It picks up too much product.  The color is nice and if you only need the mascara to last for an hour, this may work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars</li>
            <li> One of the best mascara&#x27;s i have used.  I have short stubby limp eyelashes and this really perked them up.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara, but as many brands do, it dried out fairly fast - like in less than 2 weeks.  A couple of drops of water fixed it, so far.  I really like the color.  It&#x27;s way more brown than black, and with fair skin and hair, that looks better than black.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really impressed, but the good news is that it doesn&#x27;t flake or smear.  It just doesn&#x27;t do much for those of us old folks with short sparce lashes.</li>
            <li> Definitely thickens lashes</li>
            <li> I love how long and fluffy it makes my eyelashes.  The brown/black color is nice because it&#x27;s not too dark and looks very natural.  I love Maybelline&#x27;s Royal Blue and wish this came in the same color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I don&#x27;t like is how huge the brush is.  And there is some flaking during the day, but the long eyelashes makes it worth it.  I&#x27;d try the black one as well.</li>
            <li> I would not pay even one dollar for it.&lt;br /&gt;I received it as a free sample and used only 2 times. Like a mud! Makes mess on eyelashes, not smooth, not eve close to be at least not perfect but Good.</li>
            <li> Great mascara that makes my eyelashes look much fuller and longer than they ever have been. The only downside is that I have to use it all the time because I love the way it looks.....</li>
            <li> I tried several before getting this one.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> I use this on my lower lashes.  I use black mascara on the top lashes.  I like the brown black on the bottom.</li>
            <li> a gift for myself love this product</li>
            <li> Couldnt really tell there were any &amp;#34;lashes&amp;#34; in this.  Clumpy mess that dried up in a month.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, it creates really long and I would say not thick but \\&quot;furry\\&quot; lashes. Looks amazing. And I haven&#x27;t had any problems with application, while I&#x27;m not an accurate person, I still was able to apply it without smudging. I haven&#x27;t also noticed any flakes. I tried it with a lash primer, they didn&#x27;t work well together, the lashes became to thick and firm, so I use the mascara alone now.</li>
            <li> Applies very faint - doesn&#x27;t build up lashes like you&#x27;d expect it to.  L&#x27;Oreal has other products that are much better.</li>
            <li> This mascara is really a great lengthener for lashes.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product more than once now.  It does indeed give volume, length to the lashes.  Next best thing to false lashes indeed!</li>
            <li> It is just like any mascara</li>
