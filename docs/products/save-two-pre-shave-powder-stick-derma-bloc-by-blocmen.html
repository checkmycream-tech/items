    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It works great for shaving!</li>
            <li>these Derma Bloc Pre Shave Powder sticks were perfect.  </li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s the best product he has ever used with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Best pre-electric shave powder I have come across.</li>
            <li>My dad needed a pre-shave product that didn&#x27;t have a scent and this one is perfect.  </li>
            <li>It greatly reduces irritation and redness.  </li>
            <li>It makes a good shave a great shave.</li>
            <li>No matter how good the shaver, there would still be some irritation afterward</li>
            <li>AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT FOR PROVIDING A SMOOTH AND CLOSE SHAVE.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Honestly I have no idea how or why the product works so well, but it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, best pre-shave I have found</li>
            <li>Good results, always comfortable.</li>
            <li>This shave stick really makes it easy to get an excellent shave from an electric razor</li>
            <li>This product is a huge improvement over that!  </li>
            <li>For me, an application of an alcohol-based lotion helps the beard stand up better and does make for a closer shave vs Derma Bloc.  </li>
            <li>more thing you should know...</li>
            <li>Feels better than electric shaving without powder.  </li>
            <li>This pre-shave powder works much better, and I don&#x27;t have any redness now.  </li>
            <li>Love this stick with my Panasonic electric razor.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S TOP PERFORMANCE.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned that this product is very fine and causes the razors no problem; easy glide.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>This caused powder to spread TOO easily and fall off my face more.</li>
            <li>I think this pre-shave powder stick works better, plus it doesn&#x27;t leave a strong scent or oily feeling on your skin.  </li>
            <li>closer shave, more comfortable shave and quicker too.  </li>
            <li>but it is definitely more comfortable.</li>
            <li>There is a strong perfume scent; but, the item says \\&quot;unscented\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>, if you like a strong odor in your shave stick that says unscented, then this is the one for you.</li>
            <li>Both myself and my wife have a problem with a competitor&#x27;s strongly scented product.</li>
            <li>I feel the extra step is worthwhile and produces a great, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>You can use Shower to Shower, but not being as fine</li>
            <li>These in the black plastic are the best on the market</li>
            <li>while the manufacturer claims this to be an unscented product, it is in fact lightly scented.  </li>
            <li>The shave is smooth and effortless (depending on your electric razor, of course, and taking into account that my beard is medium).  </li>
            <li>the powder will let the shaver glide smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Result is a smooth, lubricated glide of the shaver</li>
            <li>The powder also tends to clog up the blades, requiring more effort to clean -- but that&#x27;s not too unusual for most oil or powder-based pre-shave products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>super fine powder,</li>
            <li>The scent is light and mild, I like it.</li>
            <li>Really makes a better, smoother shave</li>
            <li>after using it for 7 more months, it seemed to be harder to get a close shave, and my face seemed to be drying out more and more.</li>
            <li>This product works really well for many reasons.</li>
            <li>This product needs a few application use instructions like how much and where to apply for best use on face, etceteras</li>
            <li>Product arrived FAST!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a bit soft, however I just apply it very lightly.  </li>
            <li>As to the question of which works better, it is a toss-up so far.</li>
            <li>A light application of the powder seems to go a long way, and it does help the razor glide better.  </li>
            <li>I am thankful that I was able to find it on Amazon and am always surprised about the vast amount of products we are able to acquire via this site.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m not so sure it actually helps provide a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>He really loves it!</li>
            <li>Works really well!  </li>
            <li>the product is sented, but the real problem is the quality of the cake, it is way too soft, crumbles easily.</li>
            <li>so it breaks off the stick easily and goes all over the place if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin and shaving is irritating, this is the best that I have found.</li>
            <li>No strong scent and made my shave comfortable and burn free!</li>
            <li>but the fragrance didnt seem to help with the irritation much for a pre shave.    </li>
            <li>and I absolutely would be lost without it.  </li>
            <li>Really does make shaving easier.</li>
            <li>I BOUGHT IN AMAZONS THANKS FOR SALE IT</li>
            <li>This is much easier than using a powder on my face.</li>
            <li>It had a very distinctive scent.</li>
            <li>The powder adheres to your face very well (despite fears to the contrary that I would have powder all over me).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unscented and non-irritating, really helped his razor burn.</li>
            <li>This gives me a much closer shave without drying my skin; made of talc and paraffin.</li>
            <li>This is real junk and don&#x27;t make the mistake I did.</li>
            <li>Better than the other sticks.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the drill-into-my-sinuses irritant quality I find in most other perfumes.</li>
            <li>Better than any lotion or other product available on the market and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>First of all it&#x27;s not nearly as messy.  </li>
            <li>unscented (other brands smell strong) and very soothing to the skin.    </li>
            <li>This product was not manufactuered properly, when I opened one of the units a piece about equal to 1/3 of the top broke off.</li>
            <li>cheaper to buy the two pack than singly and free 2 day prime shipping</li>
            <li>The talc is very smooth without being messy.</li>
            <li>(The Remington brand Face Saver is much nicer and not messy to use.)</li>
            <li>While I like pre-shave powders much better than alcohol based solutions and gels/ foams, this is too powdery and messy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m dropping one star because of this new over-softness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>definitely suggest this product to anyone switching to electric shavers (first time or those who its been awhile)</li>
            <li>importantly, Derma Bloc does noticeably cut down on razor burn; and for that reason alone, I give the product 4 stars and will probably purchase again.</li>
            <li>The nice thing about this product it does not have the normal heavy talcum smell that comes from other manufacturers products</li>
            <li>and/or people with sensitive skin using electric shavers.    </li>
            <li>With my modest beard (I&#x27;m a blond guy)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing that the sticks are just too soft.  </li>
            <li>I really appreciate this very low scented product.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t find them in stores anymore or at least I haven&#x27;t been able to.</li>
            <li>I lightly tap my face a few times before shaving, then start shaving at that spot.  </li>
            <li>This particular item is extra powdery</li>
            <li>Long story short, if you have sensitive skin and use an electric razor, you will find these powder sticks very helpful.  </li>
            <li>Generally I apply the pre-shave powder liberally before shaving with an electric razor/shaver.  </li>
            <li>They both work about equally well on my fairly sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li>sensitive to scents and use only unscented products</li>
            <li>(it comes out a little heavier than youll need at first), then rub it around to spread/let excess off, shave and done.    </li>
            <li>of course my skin was not ready for this move as much as i was (minor reddening/irritation/few bumps).  </li>
            <li>last two Derma Blocs I ordered were much softer than previous ones.</li>

            <li> of course my skin was not ready for this move as much as i was (minor reddening/irritation/few bumps).  </li>
            <li> last two Derma Blocs I ordered were much softer than previous ones.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that as the stick nears the end, it crumbles and falls apart easily, which makes clean up a hassle, and makes it near impossible to use the remaining chunks to cover your face.  </li>
            <li> should last me a long time even with daily use</li>
            <li> you use a dry electric shaver, I can&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough!</li>
            <li> i wanted to get my skin adjusted sooner rather than later and had tried other powders like clubman talc (regular kinf not the shave talc)</li>
            <li> I had previously tried two alcohol-based creams (Kyoku for Men and Necessary Luxuries) and both dried out my skin without giving me a much closer shave compared to no pre-shave.</li>
            <li> This product is not completely without scent</li>
            <li> On balance, I can rinse most of the Williams scent away, but the mess these sticks makes them of questionable value.  </li>
            <li> Both work very well but the Remington product stinks to high heaven.  </li>
            <li> A must have for dry electric shavers!</li>
            <li> Kind of annoying, but this is a minor quibble about a product that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my skin is much less dry.</li>
            <li> I used an electric shaver without any other shaving aids.</li>
            <li> In my experience, I do have to go over some areas afterward, but this can be due to either the powder or the razor.  </li>
            <li> Y ALWAYS IS EXCELENT DUE</li>
            <li> just pass over your whiskers until you have slight coat of it over the areas to be shaved.</li>
            <li> UNFORTUNALLY IS NO EASY TO FOUND DUE TO THIS</li>
            <li> It works but makes a heck of a mess.  </li>
            <li> A little too flakey.</li>
            <li> If your face is a little damp</li>
            <li> so I do understand that these types of products are a little messy</li>
            <li> It is messy and it is a finer grain that doesn&#x27;t work well with shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thus, I decided to try a lotion-based product, \\&quot;Shavetronic Ultra Gel,\\&quot; and after using it for a few days, I prefer it to the stick--it gives close shave and</li>
            <li> I only used a thin coat but that made no difference.  </li>
            <li> so I was concerned about the perfume, however I have had no problems with the very slight perfume in this.  </li>
            <li> It somehow cushions the face and reduces the irritation for the cutting blades while at the same time making my stubble easier for the them to cut.</li>
            <li> But after using this for a few months, I&#x27;M CONVINCED!!!  </li>
            <li> Eigher way it is a poor quality item.</li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical and didn&#x27;t understand how this product could make shaving easier.  </li>
            <li> I will still get them and hope that it was just a bad batch, and will let you know.</li>
            <li> Iwas really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had to take the base apart and replace the shaver cutter head.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve always used \\&quot;Face Saver\\&quot;, but my local K-Mart and Meijers have not had stock for some time, so I looked online and found this product.  Works just as well as the \\&quot;Face Saver\\&quot; so I&#x27;ll just keep buying it from now on.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin and shaving is irritating, this is the best that I have found. I have been using this since the 80&#x27;s and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Really makes a better, smoother shave</li>
            <li> UPDATE: May 16, 2012:&lt;br /&gt;The last two Derma Blocs I ordered were much softer than previous ones. This caused powder to spread TOO easily and fall off my face more. I guess they changed the formulation. I will still get them and hope that it was just a bad batch, and will let you know. I&#x27;m dropping one star because of this new over-softness.&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;For years I used an electric shaver without any other shaving aids. No matter how good the shaver, there would still be some irritation afterward and I&#x27;d need the cooling \\&quot;ahhh\\&quot; of an aftershave lotion. I tried pre-shave lotions but they didn&#x27;t seem to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a family member gave me a pre-shave powder stick. I used it once and have been doing so ever since. I really can&#x27;t go back to not using it. It makes a good shave a great shave. It somehow cushions the face and reduces the irritation for the cutting blades while at the same time making my stubble easier for the them to cut. It is applied like a big fat lipstick or roll on...just pass over your whiskers until you have slight coat of it over the areas to be shaved. The scent is light and mild, I like it. Don&#x27;t be fooled that you can use regular talc (baby powder) in place of this. It is messy and it is a finer grain that doesn&#x27;t work well with shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use a dry electric shaver, I can&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough!</li>
            <li> This product is a regular household item used by my dad. I ordered it online as the local Macy&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore. It feels like a talcon powder. It works great for shaving!</li>
            <li> finally made the switch to electric razors about a week ago (wahl 5 star shaver).  of course my skin was not ready for this move as much as i was (minor reddening/irritation/few bumps).  i wanted to get my skin adjusted sooner rather than later and had tried other powders like clubman talc (regular kinf not the shave talc) but the fragrance didnt seem to help with the irritation much for a pre shave.    these Derma Bloc Pre Shave Powder sticks were perfect.  super fine powder, unscented (other brands smell strong) and very soothing to the skin.    i didnt think they would help get a CLOSER shave but in all honesty they did.  closer shave, more comfortable shave and quicker too.  definitely suggest this product to anyone switching to electric shavers (first time or those who its been awhile) and/or people with sensitive skin using electric shavers.    dab or glide it along your face (it comes out a little heavier than youll need at first), then rub it around to spread/let excess off, shave and done.    cheaper to buy the two pack than singly and free 2 day prime shipping didnt hurt either.  should last me a long time even with daily use</li>
            <li> There is a strong perfume scent; but, the item says \\&quot;unscented\\&quot;.  The restocking fee is 9.95; so, they literally \\&quot;stick\\&quot; you with it.&lt;br /&gt;But, if you like a strong odor in your shave stick that says unscented, then this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because my local stores no longer carry it.  I have been using this product for over 20 years and I absolutely would be lost without it.  I am thankful that I was able to find it on Amazon and am always surprised about the vast amount of products we are able to acquire via this site.  Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> Long story short, if you have sensitive skin and use an electric razor, you will find these powder sticks very helpful.  A light application of the powder seems to go a long way, and it does help the razor glide better.  However, I&#x27;m not so sure it actually helps provide a closer shave.  In my experience, I do have to go over some areas afterward, but this can be due to either the powder or the razor.  For me, an application of an alcohol-based lotion helps the beard stand up better and does make for a closer shave vs Derma Bloc.  The powder also tends to clog up the blades, requiring more effort to clean -- but that&#x27;s not too unusual for most oil or powder-based pre-shave products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing you should know... while the manufacturer claims this to be an unscented product, it is in fact lightly scented.  Not offensive or overpowering, but the product does contain added fragrance.  I&#x27;d prefer that it didn&#x27;t, but haven&#x27;t found the scent to be off-putting in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, Derma Bloc does noticeably cut down on razor burn; and for that reason alone, I give the product 4 stars and will probably purchase again.</li>
            <li> Feels better than electric shaving without powder.  There is a fragrance but after you wash your face it does not linger.  I do not think it gives a closer shave but it is definitely more comfortable. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this and Williams Lectric Shave (lotion). As to the question of which works better, it is a toss-up so far. In both cases, you should shave before taking a shower in order to wash off the powder/lotion residue. I feel the extra step is worthwhile and produces a great, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> the product is sented, but the real problem is the quality of the cake, it is way too soft, crumbles easily. I have used the face shaver brand so I do understand that these types of products are a little messy but they do work well. This product was not manufactuered properly, when I opened one of the units a piece about equal to 1/3 of the top broke off. They eigher did not use enough bonding agent or they do not compress the product enough. Eigher way it is a poor quality item. I did not save anything by buying this over facesaver. I will go back to using it.</li>
            <li> Really does make shaving easier. If applied sparingly, two sticks should last a year.</li>
            <li> I KNEW THE PRODCT 18 YEARS AGO Y ALWAYS IS EXCELENT DUE TO THIS I USE AND RECOMEND UNFORTUNALLY IS NO EASY TO FOUND DUE TO THIS I BOUGHT IN AMAZONS THANKS FOR SALE IT</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to Williams Electric Shave which has a somewhat tacky scent.  It works but makes a heck of a mess.  With my modest beard (I&#x27;m a blond guy) the powder accumulates on your collar and on the vanity counter as you apply the stick to your face.      They both work about equally well on my fairly sensitive skin.    On balance, I can rinse most of the Williams scent away, but the mess these sticks makes them of questionable value.  I&#x27;m guessing that the sticks are just too soft.  I don&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
            <li> This is much easier than using a powder on my face. Good results, always comfortable. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> The product was not as represented.  It had a very distinctive scent. The reason I purchased it was because it was nor supposed to have a scent. Iwas really disappointed.</li>
            <li> This shave stick really makes it easy to get an excellent shave from an electric razor no matter what the brand.  The nice thing about this product it does not have the normal heavy talcum smell that comes from other manufacturers products</li>
            <li> I really appreciate this very low scented product. Both myself and my wife have a problem with a competitor&#x27;s strongly scented product.</li>
            <li> This works well when applied before shaving with an electric shaver.  It greatly reduces irritation and redness.  I used to use Nivea post-shave balm.  I think this pre-shave powder stick works better, plus it doesn&#x27;t leave a strong scent or oily feeling on your skin.  Generally I apply the pre-shave powder liberally before shaving with an electric razor/shaver.  Then afterward, I rinse off with just water and take a shower.  After that, I have no irritation or redness at all, even if I exercise soon after, which was always a problem before finding this product.  Exercising and sweat would always cause redness, especially on my neck.  This pre-shave powder works much better, and I don&#x27;t have any redness now.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> While I like pre-shave powders much better than alcohol based solutions and gels/ foams, this is too powdery and messy. It does work well however. (The Remington brand Face Saver is much nicer and not messy to use.)</li>
            <li> This product is not completely without scent but it is not offensive, in my opinion.  I tried this after buying the Remington Face Saver product and the difference is like night and day.  Both work very well but the Remington product stinks to high heaven.  This product is a huge improvement over that!  I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I have to say that when I was a lot younger, my grandfather suggested using sticks like this to shave.  I was VERY skeptical and didn&#x27;t understand how this product could make shaving easier.  But after using this for a few months, I&#x27;M CONVINCED!!!  Wash your face, then wait maybe 30-90 minutes before applying the stick to your face, and you will have a shaving experience WITHOUT severe irritation or the need for aftershave to sooth your skin.  Honestly I have no idea how or why the product works so well, but it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that as the stick nears the end, it crumbles and falls apart easily, which makes clean up a hassle, and makes it near impossible to use the remaining chunks to cover your face.  Kind of annoying, but this is a minor quibble about a product that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it and you won&#x27;t dread shaving like I used to do.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, best pre-shave I have found</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used powder instead of lather you will be in for a surprise.  First of all it&#x27;s not nearly as messy.  The powder adheres to your face very well (despite fears to the contrary that I would have powder all over me).  The shave is smooth and effortless (depending on your electric razor, of course, and taking into account that my beard is medium).  A simple rinse finishes the process.  These sticks last forever and this is the same brand that Remington uses, the only difference being that it doesn&#x27;t say Remington.  I had no problems buying or receiving these sticks and the price is unbeatable.  You can&#x27;t find them in stores anymore or at least I haven&#x27;t been able to.</li>
            <li> This product needs a few application use instructions like how much and where to apply for best use on face, etceteras</li>
            <li> Pretty good. A little too flakey.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this product locally so I tried amazon! The talc is very smooth without being messy. No strong scent and made my shave comfortable and burn free! A must have for dry electric shavers!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff. If they were to ever stop making it shaving would once again be a disaster for me.</li>
            <li> This was not for me but the recipient loves it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned that this product is very fine and causes the razors no problem; easy glide.  You can use Shower to Shower, but not being as fine it&#x27;ll clog up the heads faster.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband 3 times already - a stick lasts him about 6 months, with daily shaving. He says it&#x27;s the best product he has ever used with an electric shaver. It&#x27;s unscented and non-irritating, really helped his razor burn. Will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> These in the black plastic are the best on the market and I would recommend these for any electric razor user...will reorder.</li>
            <li> These powder sticks allow for smoother shaves, especially if your skin is moist from perspiration.  This particular item is extra powdery so it breaks off the stick easily and goes all over the place if you&#x27;re not careful.  You will also have to wash out the shaver head as the powder will collect inside by the blades.  Overall, it makes electric shaving easier on your face.</li>
            <li> Best pre-electric shave powder I have come across. Better than any lotion or other product available on the market and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this stick with my Panasonic electric razor.  Better than the other sticks.  Product arrived FAST!!</li>
            <li> This gives me a much closer shave without drying my skin; made of talc and paraffin. It leaves a lot of talc inside the razor so I would only use it with a razor that can be rinsed out. I had previously tried two alcohol-based creams (Kyoku for Men and Necessary Luxuries) and both dried out my skin without giving me a much closer shave compared to no pre-shave. I plan to keep using Derma-Bloc.&lt;br /&gt;September 2013 update: after using it for 7 more months, it seemed to be harder to get a close shave, and my face seemed to be drying out more and more. Thus, I decided to try a lotion-based product, \\&quot;Shavetronic Ultra Gel,\\&quot; and after using it for a few days, I prefer it to the stick--it gives close shave and my skin is much less dry.</li>
            <li> I have a self cleaning electric shaver and this junk had it so clogged the self cleaning cycle could not remove it. I only used a thin coat but that made no difference.  I had to take the base apart and replace the shaver cutter head.  This is real junk and don&#x27;t make the mistake I did.</li>
            <li> My dad needed a pre-shave product that didn&#x27;t have a scent and this one is perfect.  He really loves it!</li>
            <li> This product works really well for many reasons. It will sharpen the blades and lubricate them also.  If your face is a little damp the powder will let the shaver glide smoothly.  I have been using this now for about 6 month and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT FOR PROVIDING A SMOOTH AND CLOSE SHAVE. THIS PRODUCT WILL ALSO ALLOW YOUR ELECTRIC SHAVER TO OPERATE AT IT&#x27;S TOP PERFORMANCE.</li>
            <li> Works really well!  I lightly tap my face a few times before shaving, then start shaving at that spot.  Result is a smooth, lubricated glide of the shaver head.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit soft, however I just apply it very lightly.  The stick doesn&#x27;t come apart or anything.  It will drop a bit of powder.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sensitive to scents and use only unscented products so I was concerned about the perfume, however I have had no problems with the very slight perfume in this.  It doesn&#x27;t have the drill-into-my-sinuses irritant quality I find in most other perfumes.</li>
