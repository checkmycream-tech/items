            <li>In a new world where everyone at work seems to be sensitive or allergic to perfumes, I wear Love Spell, and no one complains.</li>
            <li>This is OK, but the scent is short lasting and almost too sweet.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve continued to wear it for years because it&#x27;s much lighter than perfume.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The price was GREAT and the product is everything I expect from a Victoria Secret scent.</li>
            <li>I will never pay high price from the store again.</li>
            <li>Just a little tip, there&#x27;s a knock off called Love Struck, smells literally just like this</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my 17 year old daughter who loves this fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little trashy but in a fun flirty girly way.</li>
