            <li> smells horrible and doesn&#x27;t moisturize. I have fine hair and it didn&#x27;t work on me or my daughters thick curly hair. don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a hair stylist to treat my badly dry &amp; damaged hair. And it has helped a lot.</li>
            <li> if you have dry fly away hair it really helps</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel soft abc hydrated with the first use!! I love it!! I have very long hair and need all the extra moisture I can get!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mild and moisturizing shampoo for a while.&lt;br /&gt;This one worked very well on my hair. Now my wife has started using this too!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for 6 months and love it! It makes my hair feel incredibly soft and shiny. My beautician recommended it to me when I told her that my hair is so dry and frizzy from coloring it for so many years. I use the Paul Mitchell Instant Moisture shampoo too. I&#x27;ll never go back to Pantene again!</li>
            <li> With my thyroid issues along with the fact that I flat iron my hair, this stuff does a great job keeping my hair from not being dry...even my bangs, which they tend to dry out the most! I love the smell of this product as well. I will have to try their shampoos and conditioners for my daily wash, but this stuff is not supposed to be something that you use every day, but wow, I sure could! I love it!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this conditioner.  My 6 year old daughter has very thick, long hair and I could never find a conditioner that helped detangle her hair the way this one does.  It leaves her hair soft and smelling great.  And the best thing...you only need a very small amount so although you&#x27;ll pay more than some of the others, you will use alot less!!  Will but it over and over!</li>
            <li> I tried this style of shampoo and conditioner during a hotel stay in December. They were the guest sized products in our room. I now have bought them and love them and how soft and shiny they leave my hair. Now that I spend most of my time in Arizona, dryness is an issue, and these products do wonders with that.</li>
            <li> Thank you! It was delivered rightbon time! I love the product. My curls keep nourished a lovely.</li>
            <li> Great for thick coarse hair. Provides instant moisture and makes one&#x27;s hair feel silky and clean. Using it with the Instant moist shampoo is quite beneficial.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Too expensive. Great for detangling. I don&#x27;t see a difference with the &amp;#34;nature&amp;#34; of my hair. I&#x27;ll stick to WEN products.</li>
            <li> I have tried many hair conditioner and I have to say .I&#x27;m very pleased with this one.My hair is very long and with using this I have soft shining hair. I would and have recommended this product</li>
