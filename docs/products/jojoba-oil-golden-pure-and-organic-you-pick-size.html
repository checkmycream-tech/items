            <li> This is the best price of Jojoba Oil I have found.  It is a great product.  It is completely natural and great for your skin and hair.  We use it as a massage oil and add scent (not necessary, just a preference) and heat it up in the microwave.</li>
            <li> I use these high quality oils for soap making and it&#x27;s hard to find organic products.  The jojoba adds moisturizer and nutrients to the soap that enhance the quality.  Jojoba is also a good &amp;#34;carrier&amp;#34; oil:  My daughter mixes a few drops of her &amp;#34;germ fighter&amp;#34; blend of essential oils to jojoba before rubbing it on her skin.  Essential oils,( in most cases) should not be applied directly to the skin without a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> Jojoba Oil Rocks and I&#x27;ve ordered a couple times from the Adorable Dr.  Had one leak, and they replaced it pronto!!  Great customer service!</li>
            <li> Great product but shipping needs improvement. My shipment leaked.</li>
            <li> While it massages just fine it smells funky. First time using jojobala oil but still this smell is not natural. And yes it did come leaking. It wasn&#x27;t that bad tho. The smell is what makes me never want to buy from this guy again.</li>
            <li> Very thick, not easy to apply as other brands that I&#x27;ve tried before, I should have bought a small bottle to try it, now I&#x27;m stuck with the big one. The package came soaked in the oil it was not sealed correctly at all. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Wonderful product. No harsh smell. Goes on smooth and isn&#x27;t goopy or too thick. I haven&#x27;t&#x27; had any issues with it staining anything.</li>
            <li> This product is great</li>
            <li> Great product, great buy. Wonderful consistancy</li>
            <li> I am disappointed because it is suppose to be golden which it isn&#x27;t --  It has the color of canola oil.  I used it for a couple days and was not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I, like others suspect that this is not jojoba oil at all. I am a massage therapist and have exclusively used jojoba oil for 5 years. My supplier ran out. This has made my sheets rancid after 4 weeks use. I have NEVER had rancid sheets with true jojoba oil. So, if you want the real stuff, keep looking. I was a day late to return the product and can&#x27;t afford to throw out the 3 remaining containers. So I have to wash all my sheets twice and they still smell like rancid oil.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Love the size and price! I add a little essential oils to it and WE love it!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product came early:)</li>
            <li> this is my second order. I have been using their product for about a year now. Seems to work well, and is the best value for organic jojoba oil on amazon (I did the research).</li>
            <li> One of the uses is for my beard, keeps it moisturized, of course there are many other uses.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this oil. It smells like used cooking oil! The consistency isn&#x27;t right either. I&#x27;m doubting it is real jojoba oil. I can&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> This oil is very moisturizing.  I mix it with my body lotion and apply at night.  It makes your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> The cap was not sealed on tight more than half of it fell in the bag it came in.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  I like their products.</li>
            <li> This was very low grade jojoba oil and the it was soapy jojoba is supposed to be very dark golden thick consistancy. I didn&#x27;t get thia from the company I&#x27;m very disappointed because I was making soap with the oil and totally ruin the batch.</li>
