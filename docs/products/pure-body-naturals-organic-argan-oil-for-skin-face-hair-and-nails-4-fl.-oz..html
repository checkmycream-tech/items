            <li>I liked the added feature of the companion dropper.  </li>

            <li>This is always a plus for me, knowing exactly what I&#x27;m using, and that it&#x27;s good for my body and hair.</li>
            <li>This oil is just as good or better than the higher priced Argan oil, very light and clean smelling.</li>

            <li>I had a excellent experience using the argan oil with my hair, as it helps with my dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>Whether I use it on my hair, skin or nails the oil absorbs quickly and feels so nice, not sticky or greasy.  </li>
            <li>Great product for my very sensitive skin.  </li>

            <li>It leaves my legs feeling smooth and looking sexy.</li>
            <li>I love how it leaves my hair shiny and frizz free even on rainy days.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell good but it works really well.</li>
            <li>I think this is good came fast and all.  </li>
            <li>A nice side benefit was that as I was applying the Argan oil to my hair and skin, it was also being absorbed by my nails and hands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice light oil that absorbs quickly into your skin, without making it feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>so this product is super gently even though it is very effective.</li>
            <li>But I have to admit everything I hear is true!</li>
            <li>I have dry skin so this is so so nice!!</li>

            <li>Odor isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>Smells strongly like rotting fruit.</li>

            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would like this version since it is natural and doesn&#x27;t have the scent of many of the argan oil versions popular on the market.</li>
            <li>My favorite way to use Argan Oil is to apply it at night as an all over body moisturizer right after I get out of the shower or bath.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and the price was right.</li>
            <li>I dye my hair a bright red, so I always mix a bit with my conditioner to keep my hair smooth, shiny, and damage free.</li>
            <li>It has customer friendly packaging, and all the features you should look for in an argan oil.</li>
            <li>While your results may not be exactly like mine, I enjoyed using this product to repair my hair, skin and nails and do recommend</li>
            <li>i like the way this oil goes on, makes my skin very smooth, it does however have a funny smell to it, but it does wear off quickly</li>
            <li>My nails look great and the skin around my nail bed is no longer dry or cracking.</li>
            <li>really great if you have problems with severely dry skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so clean feeling and never develops a spoiled smell, if on all day.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product with the hopes that it would offer some relief to my shoulder-length dry, brittle and fly away hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many eczema products and have never come across such amazing results.</li>
            <li>I use it every night after I clean my face and again in the morning before I apply makeup.</li>
            <li>This works great for winter dry skin.</li>
            <li>But the scent vanishes quickly and the oil really does leave your skin and hair softer AND it is 100% pure no fillers or junk added in so you can feel good about what you are using.</li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to review this argan oil from Pure Body Naturals and I love it.</li>
            <li>really enjoyed trying Argan Oil by Pure Body Naturals for a month.</li>
            <li>Pure Body Naturals has made sure that their packaging doesn&#x27;t limit your usage options.</li>
            <li>the product right on time!</li>
            <li>The oil isnt overly greasy and is absorbed into the skin easily and quickly</li>
            <li>It seems to be effective so far.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I put this on last night  and loved the lightness of the oil and  today</li>
            <li>Anyways I give it a four stars because I got a full refund, no hassle.</li>
            <li>I also love that it makes my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
            <li>It also shows right on the bottle that it is certified organic (by EcoCert), cruelty free, not tested on animals, and that the oil is imported from Morocco.</li>
            <li>Pure Body Naturals is so confident that you will love their pure Argan oil that they are offering an amazing lifetime 100% money back</li>
            <li>Super</li>
            <li>product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it</li>
            <li>Product received quickly.</li>
            <li>Absorbs into the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>Because there is no celebrity name and expensive advertising attached , you get the best quality without paying top dollar.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>It does have a mild yeast-y scent, but that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product as it can be used for many reasons.</li>
            <li>I am not kidding, since the first application my hair has become manageable, it is no longer fly away and it is no longer dry and yucky looking.</li>
            <li>Awesome service as usual amazon, and thanks to Pure Body Naturals for the product!!</li>
            <li>I liked it real well, but the cost is high.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This seems to do what it says for both hair and skin and so far it has worked for me  on my dry skin but doesn&#x27;t smell very good</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a first time user and worried about being &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;, don&#x27;t be!</li>
            <li>I am 100% confident that it will make my hair soft and shiney!</li>
            <li>essential oil just to make it smell lovely!</li>
            <li>Will order again very soon!!</li>
            <li>I have used other argan oil before, and it has always had a light, nutty smell that was very lovely.</li>
            <li>received this product in exchange for my honest opinion based on my personal experiences.</li>
            <li>Love how soft it leaves my skin ..</li>
            <li>I have had better results with hand creams that feel luxuious and make ur hands feel soft</li>
            <li>This is especially useful if you&#x27;ve bought this argan oil for a specific purpose like me.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin baby soft and keeps my hair healthy</li>
            <li>I use more than 3 drops applied directly to my face as my skin absorbs it</li>
            <li>It nice to have an extra boost of help for my skin this time of year.  </li>
            <li>I personally love that Argan Oil is a natural product that I can use in the place of treating my son&#x27;s eczema.  </li>
            <li>This keeps the product fresh and reduces contamination and oxidizing.</li>
            <li>Immediately there is a soothing moisturizing, with dryness disappearing as the product is absorbed.</li>
            <li>Once opened, the product remains fresh for 12 months.</li>
            <li>/&gt; with a more concise review</li>
            <li>but so far so fabulous!</li>
            <li>It was a bit pricey but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I am also thrilled with the larger bottle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non greasy and it soaks right in to your skin.</li>
            <li>I use my right hand to dip my pointer finger in and apply dots on my face &amp; neck.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;What sets this argan oil apart from the rest is how very pure it is.</li>
            <li>I really like it in my hair but go easy on how much you put in.</li>
            <li>this  is the first time I am using argan oil I found out what it is used for and ordered it right away</li>
            <li>I received one bottle of Pure Body Naturals Organic Argan Oil to review!  </li>
            <li>My hair is ridiculously soft and it was easy to brush.</li>
            <li>I also tried it on my hair and it makes my hair soft, shiny and easy to comb.</li>
            <li>The label was easy to read and the company information is clearly labeled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sometimes so I love being able to use a little argan oil to keep my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It soaked right in and left my skin feeling so much better.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, experienced no redness or any other side effects.</li>
            <li>My face has cleared up considerably and the fine lines around my eyes are diminishing after a month of continuous use.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my nails to keep them looking great and hard and not breaking.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy again and am glad to be saving money.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that some may not develop the same</li>
            <li>I use argan oil for several things, but mostly I use it for my hair.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It does feel oily when I first put it on my face, but within minutes my skin drinks it up and</li>
            <li>I ordered this Organic Argan Oil, not expecting much but thought it worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I have used several brands and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and leaves your skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product as I have received numerous comments on how healthy my hair has started to look since using this product.</li>
            <li>The patches stay away with consistent use.  </li>
            <li>After using the argan oil, my nails have started to lose that dullness and the healthy glow is starting to shine through.  </li>
            <li>When I use it on my hands they instantly look much more rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li>well two, because I used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair first and saw the result which lead me to use it on my hair.</li>
            <li>It works people, it really and truly works!</li>
            <li>Why pay more for the same benefits ?</li>
            <li>The oil itself is clear with light scent.</li>
            <li>Most facial products are 1-2 oz</li>
            <li>However I wouldn&#x27;t say this should be used for hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li>You could use it if you want to  mix oils for a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li>I love Argan Oil, especially when I can get</li>
            <li>Amazingly rejenurating my dry skin!!</li>
            <li>It definitely has a very unique &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>Pure body natutrals is one of the few that are ontop of my list of the good brands to use.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and soft and I don&#x27;t seem to</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a big thing to me because I&#x27;m not even sure if it is the oil itself or if it is the bottle because it doesn&#x27;t really have that scent when you use</li>
            <li>It is too early to review the results for my skin, but my hair is more manageable and is so soft after just one use...</li>
            <li>but as this is first time i am using pure argan oil</li>
            <li>Be consistent and you don&#x27;t need to grease the affected area down to make it effective.</li>
            <li>Its very fast absorbing and has no smell to it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First I love the smell, its light and gentle and not overpowering like a few argan oils I have used.&lt;br /&gt;*For</li>
            <li>Argan Oil is definitely one of my favorite products and I would highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems like a small, insignificant thing, but I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve seen products claim they&#x27;re organic or cruelty free</li>
            <li>If you have issues with dry skin, or like in my case eczema (or psoriasis ) this can help you for sure.</li>
            <li>My face has been extremely dry all winter and after one use it&#x27;s feeling better already..</li>
            <li>Pure Body Naturals Argan Oil is pure USDA and ECO Certified Organic Moroccan Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>I use Pure Body Naturals Argan Oil on my hair to help heal damaged, split ends and reduce frizz.  </li>
            <li>This is just pure, organic argan oil.</li>
            <li>Pure Body Naturals delivers on both quality and convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is pure without carrier or filler oils.</li>
            <li>Being that it is 100% Pure Certified Organic</li>
            <li>I received the Pure Body Naturals Argan Oil for review.  </li>
            <li>This 100% certified organic argan oil comes in a large 4 oz.</li>
            <li>This is pure Argan oil.</li>
            <li>Plus is 100% pure oil.</li>
            <li>this seems to last much longer than traditional lotion, it absorbs quickly but is more effective.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I am not sure that Argan oil is more superior to other body oils..</li>
            <li>Once face and skin is clean right out of shower, the mix is easier to apply and the product lasts twice as long.</li>
            <li>It will help with those crazy fly aways and leave your hair shinny and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  definitely made a huge impact.</li>
            <li>I am very amazed.</li>
            <li>So, imagine just getting straight argan oil, that you can use for all purposes.</li>
            <li>I really wanted it for my hair, but end up using it for my skin.</li>
            <li>I was honestly very hesitant to use oils-</li>
            <li>Since I use it on my face, neck, nails and hair, I really like the fact that no fillers or additives are used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works very well on hair and hands...</li>
            <li>also it goes very well with make up on..</li>
            <li>it started to smell rancid too fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>It has really helped my hair in heal against breakage and haven&#x27;t noticed as much breakage.</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>Really calms my hair</li>
            <li>Argan Oil is really a &amp;#34;Must Have&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Holy Grail&amp;#34; beauty and skincare product that I think everyone should have as part of their beauty, skincare and hair care routines.  </li>
            <li>It sems to absorb into the skin very well.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.  </li>
            <li>saturate my whole head and wait for an hour and then wash it out.  </li>
            <li>as much as I did before.</li>
            <li>really like this product</li>
            <li>Delivery was extremely fast.</li>
            <li>I really do recommend you buy this product.</li>
            <li>and I really like the results.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free to test and review.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and it has helped my face, neck, hands, &amp; hair so much.</li>
            <li>I  love that it had minimal packaging.</li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t very noticeable.</li>
            <li>even use this with the dermal roller and it really helps your skin heel faster,normally I look sunburned for 2-3 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I like it and it works very well</li>
            <li>This was reasonably priced and had favorable reviews</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and everything.</li>
            <li>The oil consistency is also very runny, compared to my Josie Maran and my Physician&#x27;s Formula Oil.</li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone, whether they&#x27;re a seasoned user or a new one.</li>
            <li>is a great argan product and for my dry crackly body this has endless possibilities!</li>
            <li>particularly like this Pure Body Naturals argan oil</li>
            <li>because of how pure it is and the realistic packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this for my hair to keep frizz down and create a smooth, healthy appearance, especially at the ends.</li>
            <li>I have fairly good skin, but my elbows get dry and rough</li>
            <li>I also use it in my hair and it keeps it feeling smooth all day long.  </li>
            <li>The only difference is, this oil has the true Argan earthy smell.  </li>
            <li>Argan Oil gave my hair a nice shine and softness without being too oily or slick.  </li>
            <li>I might be able to put up with it if i am not pregnant.</li>
            <li>Ever since I started using this particular brand about a month ago, I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very very pleased with how this feels on my my nails and my hands because they&#x27;re so dry and my hair is very very brittle and this made it shiny and feeling an extremely soft unbelievable difference in the feel and the look noticed it right away.  </li>
            <li>If you want healthier hair and skin, I highly recommend this Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>I am also using it on my scalp - yep, for psoriasis - instead of prescription which contains steroids - saturate scalp and cover with cap overnight several times a week (obviously washing hair next morning), and I&#x27;m starting to have great results.  </li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really sinks into your skin and smoothes out fine lines.</li>
            <li>still do like this as its pure natural &amp; they give a guarantee of some 60 days</li>
            <li>It is pure argan oil, triple filtered and with all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I really like the natural feel of this oil, for my hands nails and even my face</li>
            <li>I guess the strength was a bit much for my sensitive</li>
            <li>I just got it, but so far I like it really well.</li>
            <li>My skin is dry and this product helps keep it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a heavy glass and you dispense the oil with a dripper so you can easily control how much you are squeezing out.  </li>
            <li>Argan Oil is like the new coconut oil - it is like a cure all for everything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so much about them but never tired them especially Argan.</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It kept my dry ends from becoming frizzy and improved the overall texture.</li>
            <li>not as I expected, smelliness, unlike the other review said, kind of disappoint.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in a dark colored bottle (to protect the oil from light).</li>
            <li>The bottle is pretty simple and includes helpful usage tips.</li>
            <li>This is truly unique to me because every other argan oil I&#x27;ve ever purchased either has a dropper as the lid or has no dropper.</li>
            <li>WOW the improvement in my skin is jaw dropping!</li>
            <li>my&lt;br /&gt;skin is still soft, and moisturized!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try adding some essential oils because it works so much better than other Argan oil that I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li>A little bit of this goes a long way and it has a nice smell to it.  </li>
            <li>The argan oil somehow prevented my rashes to get worse, I am pretty sure it will go away if I no longer use those chemicals.</li>
            <li>It also works great on hair, just apply a little to the ends of damp hair to help heal any damage and tame flyaways!</li>
            <li>I would say that is true due to its flexible use.  </li>
            <li>If your hair has those crazy fly away use a drop of this oil and rub in your palms and lightly brush down your hair with your palms.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using a small amount as a facial moisturizer at night and around my eyes during the day, but felt that it gave me too much of a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; as a whole face moisturizer during the day.</li>
            <li>the boy starts getting a dry spot, I use Argan Oil right away.  </li>
            <li>Lastly I run my hands through my hair focusing on the middle &amp; ends since that&#x27;s the most dry.  </li>
            <li>Argan Oil is definitely a staple in my hair routine, and this product by Pure Body Naturals is just what I needed.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face as well for acne breakouts and to help clear up my face</li>
            <li>and my face is clear no redness whatsoever.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t heavy but leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The product is all natural and organic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve noticed, as have I that products with argan oil are all over the place lately.</li>
            <li>i dint feel my hands soft.</li>
            <li>The oil has no additives or fillers and is all natural, organic, and unrefined.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>No greasy feel, no breakouts, just soft skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much rather make a batch of treatment options myself than to pay retail price for a commercial product.</li>
            <li>it helps my hair to grow and makes it so soft with no buildup.</li>
            <li>my skin feels soft.  </li>
            <li>It has made them soft and hydrated, it also has made the itchiness go away.</li>
            <li>It gives your hair a healthy look but doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy in the least.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 60 years old now).</li>
            <li>My face is SO SOFT and silky.</li>
            <li>I used on my hands and they stayed soft all day.</li>
            <li>My cuticles stay soft and no hangnails.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to smells find an unscented Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>I added a few drops of argan oil to my moisturizer everyday and it is doing wonders keeping my face looking healthy and fresh.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t use a product that smells like spoiled milk, no matter how good it is for my skin &amp; hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m becoming very partial to this brand of argan oil specifically because of how much faster it absorbs than other brands and because of how convenient the packaging</li>
            <li>The only other issue was probably more user error than anything, but be careful to not use too much in your hair if leaving the Argan Oil in as you will get a greasy look.</li>
            <li>Nice to not have the heavy scent that other companies as to their Argan oil.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product and will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li>This time of year, my face becomes very dry with the cold weather, but I have noticed that it is much better this year than most winters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Moderate amounts on my thick hair makes it feel alive and healthy not greesy.</li>
            <li>Argan Oil is one of my new favorites for all of the above.</li>
            <li>This is the exact same organic , first pressed, raw argan oil that is sold for $100 and some.</li>
            <li>This oil left my face feeling so,so soft and hydrated after using it!</li>
            <li>I let my significant other try it out, and he said he likes the way it makes his beard feel, and also helps with his dry skin, eczema and scalp.</li>
            <li>have v coarse super dry hair, normal facial skin but v dry hands.</li>
            <li>I tend to have very dry skin in the winter and it really helped with the itchiness and dryness.  </li>
            <li>I have to say the company is very generous as it provides the consumer wit a huge 4 oz bottle which will definitely last a long time, as a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical but this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>My scalp feels more hydrated and not as dry, I also noticed less flakes because of my scalp not being dry.</li>
            <li>I use Argan Oil on my hair and in various hair cream concoctions on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>guarantee that if you are not satisfied, send them an email and they will refund your purchase in full.  </li>
            <li>My skin stays super soft &amp; moisturized for at least 24 hours if not longer.  </li>
            <li>I used this product for the dry ends on my hair and it worked very well and actually continued working even after I washed and conditioned my hair.</li>
            <li>I have used other argan oils, this is exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li>I have used it jus for a week and was not bowled over as i did not experience out of ordinary feelings,&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick and came in god condition - no breakage etc</li>
            <li>This oil absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn&#x27;t make your hands slick or oily like lotions do.</li>
            <li>Even though I wash my hands several times during a day, I reapplied twice and my hands were still soft the next morning..  </li>
            <li>Pure Body Naturals also recommends using other ways such as on your body as a moisturizer, massage oil, acne treatment, etc., but I have not applied it in such a way and cannot speak in regards of those options.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But as some other reviewers have said, when using argan oil for the first time, I was surprised to find it smelled like a zoo (a sour manure-like odor).</li>
            <li>When I call the packaging realistic, I mean that they understand how people use this oil and have made the packaging convenient and real.</li>
            <li>Treats Dry and Sensitive Skin</li>
            <li>and I have noticed that it is less frizzy and much shinier.  </li>
            <li>My hands are surviving the cold weather better than they ever have!</li>
            <li>But I do have dry skin on my hands, especially around the fingernails and this so far has appeared to help that condition.</li>
            <li>It has an unusual oder that I can tolerate but not best--all you have to do is put a little Lavender essential oil it</li>
            <li>I have to give it time to give it a good or bad review.  </li>

            <li> This seems to be something that is popular in the beauty world now, but has been being used forever elsewhere.</li>
            <li> and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.</li>
            <li> but I won&#x27;t buy agian because of the lack of nice scent.</li>
            <li> I liked the added feature of the companion dropper.  </li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity and the product to see how it worked for me for my honest testimonial of how it worked in my life, here it is.  </li>

            <li> A nice side benefit was that as I was applying the Argan oil to my hair and skin, it was also being absorbed by my nails and hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice light oil that absorbs quickly into your skin, without making it feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> so this product is super gently even though it is very effective.</li>
            <li> But I have to admit everything I hear is true!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin so this is so so nice!!</li>
            <li> This oil does not feel greasy and it came with a dropper for easy use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Argan Oil is extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li> but it smells strongly like rotten fruit.</li>
            <li> Odor isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> Smells strongly like rotting fruit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had strong nails.</li>
            <li> This is some pretty amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> The oil is silky smooth and applies easily.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil helps to minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, plus it does NOT clog pores.  </li>
            <li> Reduces Fine Lines and Wrinkles</li>
            <li> See my fine lines soften in a week.  </li>
            <li> Too excited right now!!</li>

            <li> I enjoy this product that dollar</li>
            <li> reviews.com let me enjoy and try I used this in my hair and nails..</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would like this version since it is natural and doesn&#x27;t have the scent of many of the argan oil versions popular on the market.</li>
            <li> My favorite way to use Argan Oil is to apply it at night as an all over body moisturizer right after I get out of the shower or bath.  </li>
            <li> Love this product and the price was right.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair a bright red, so I always mix a bit with my conditioner to keep my hair smooth, shiny, and damage free.</li>
            <li> It has customer friendly packaging, and all the features you should look for in an argan oil.</li>
            <li> While your results may not be exactly like mine, I enjoyed using this product to repair my hair, skin and nails and do recommend</li>
            <li> i like the way this oil goes on, makes my skin very smooth, it does however have a funny smell to it, but it does wear off quickly</li>
            <li> My nails look great and the skin around my nail bed is no longer dry or cracking.</li>
            <li> really great if you have problems with severely dry skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so clean feeling and never develops a spoiled smell, if on all day.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product with the hopes that it would offer some relief to my shoulder-length dry, brittle and fly away hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many eczema products and have never come across such amazing results.</li>
            <li> I use it every night after I clean my face and again in the morning before I apply makeup.</li>
            <li> This works great for winter dry skin.</li>
            <li> But the scent vanishes quickly and the oil really does leave your skin and hair softer AND it is 100% pure no fillers or junk added in so you can feel good about what you are using.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to review this argan oil from Pure Body Naturals and I love it.</li>
            <li> really enjoyed trying Argan Oil by Pure Body Naturals for a month.</li>
            <li> Pure Body Naturals has made sure that their packaging doesn&#x27;t limit your usage options.</li>
            <li> the product right on time!</li>
            <li> The oil isnt overly greasy and is absorbed into the skin easily and quickly</li>
            <li> It seems to be effective so far.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I put this on last night  and loved the lightness of the oil and  today</li>
            <li> Anyways I give it a four stars because I got a full refund, no hassle.</li>
            <li> I also love that it makes my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent.</li>
            <li> It also shows right on the bottle that it is certified organic (by EcoCert), cruelty free, not tested on animals, and that the oil is imported from Morocco.</li>
            <li> Pure Body Naturals is so confident that you will love their pure Argan oil that they are offering an amazing lifetime 100% money back</li>
            <li> Super</li>
            <li> product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it</li>
            <li> Product received quickly.</li>
            <li> Absorbs into the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> Because there is no celebrity name and expensive advertising attached , you get the best quality without paying top dollar.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> It does have a mild yeast-y scent, but that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product as it can be used for many reasons.</li>
            <li> I am not kidding, since the first application my hair has become manageable, it is no longer fly away and it is no longer dry and yucky looking.</li>
            <li> Awesome service as usual amazon, and thanks to Pure Body Naturals for the product!!</li>
            <li> I liked it real well, but the cost is high.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This seems to do what it says for both hair and skin and so far it has worked for me  on my dry skin but doesn&#x27;t smell very good</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a first time user and worried about being &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;, don&#x27;t be!</li>
            <li> I am 100% confident that it will make my hair soft and shiney!</li>
            <li> essential oil just to make it smell lovely!</li>
            <li> Will order again very soon!!</li>
            <li> I have used other argan oil before, and it has always had a light, nutty smell that was very lovely.</li>
            <li> received this product in exchange for my honest opinion based on my personal experiences.</li>
            <li> Love how soft it leaves my skin ..</li>
            <li> I have had better results with hand creams that feel luxuious and make ur hands feel soft</li>
            <li> This is especially useful if you&#x27;ve bought this argan oil for a specific purpose like me.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin baby soft and keeps my hair healthy</li>
            <li> I use more than 3 drops applied directly to my face as my skin absorbs it</li>
            <li> It nice to have an extra boost of help for my skin this time of year.  </li>
            <li> I personally love that Argan Oil is a natural product that I can use in the place of treating my son&#x27;s eczema.  </li>
            <li> This keeps the product fresh and reduces contamination and oxidizing.</li>
            <li> Immediately there is a soothing moisturizing, with dryness disappearing as the product is absorbed.</li>
            <li> Once opened, the product remains fresh for 12 months.</li>
            <li> /&gt; with a more concise review</li>
            <li> but so far so fabulous!</li>
            <li> It was a bit pricey but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I am also thrilled with the larger bottle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non greasy and it soaks right in to your skin.</li>
            <li> I use my right hand to dip my pointer finger in and apply dots on my face &amp; neck.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;What sets this argan oil apart from the rest is how very pure it is.</li>
            <li> I really like it in my hair but go easy on how much you put in.</li>
            <li> this  is the first time I am using argan oil I found out what it is used for and ordered it right away</li>
            <li> I received one bottle of Pure Body Naturals Organic Argan Oil to review!  </li>
            <li> My hair is ridiculously soft and it was easy to brush.</li>
            <li> I also tried it on my hair and it makes my hair soft, shiny and easy to comb.</li>
            <li> The label was easy to read and the company information is clearly labeled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sometimes so I love being able to use a little argan oil to keep my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It soaked right in and left my skin feeling so much better.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, experienced no redness or any other side effects.</li>
            <li> My face has cleared up considerably and the fine lines around my eyes are diminishing after a month of continuous use.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my nails to keep them looking great and hard and not breaking.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy again and am glad to be saving money.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that some may not develop the same</li>
            <li> I use argan oil for several things, but mostly I use it for my hair.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It does feel oily when I first put it on my face, but within minutes my skin drinks it up and</li>
            <li> I ordered this Organic Argan Oil, not expecting much but thought it worth a try.  </li>
            <li> I have used several brands and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and leaves your skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product as I have received numerous comments on how healthy my hair has started to look since using this product.</li>
            <li> The patches stay away with consistent use.  </li>
            <li> After using the argan oil, my nails have started to lose that dullness and the healthy glow is starting to shine through.  </li>
            <li> When I use it on my hands they instantly look much more rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li> well two, because I used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair first and saw the result which lead me to use it on my hair.</li>
            <li> It works people, it really and truly works!</li>
            <li> Why pay more for the same benefits ?</li>
            <li> The oil itself is clear with light scent.</li>
            <li> Most facial products are 1-2 oz</li>
            <li> However I wouldn&#x27;t say this should be used for hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li> You could use it if you want to  mix oils for a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> I love Argan Oil, especially when I can get</li>
            <li> Amazingly rejenurating my dry skin!!</li>
            <li> It definitely has a very unique &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> Pure body natutrals is one of the few that are ontop of my list of the good brands to use.</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean and soft and I don&#x27;t seem to</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a big thing to me because I&#x27;m not even sure if it is the oil itself or if it is the bottle because it doesn&#x27;t really have that scent when you use</li>
            <li> It is too early to review the results for my skin, but my hair is more manageable and is so soft after just one use...</li>
            <li> but as this is first time i am using pure argan oil</li>
            <li> Be consistent and you don&#x27;t need to grease the affected area down to make it effective.</li>
            <li> Its very fast absorbing and has no smell to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First I love the smell, its light and gentle and not overpowering like a few argan oils I have used.&lt;br /&gt;*For</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is definitely one of my favorite products and I would highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems like a small, insignificant thing, but I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve seen products claim they&#x27;re organic or cruelty free</li>
            <li> If you have issues with dry skin, or like in my case eczema (or psoriasis ) this can help you for sure.</li>
            <li> My face has been extremely dry all winter and after one use it&#x27;s feeling better already..</li>
            <li> Pure Body Naturals Argan Oil is pure USDA and ECO Certified Organic Moroccan Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I use Pure Body Naturals Argan Oil on my hair to help heal damaged, split ends and reduce frizz.  </li>
            <li> This is just pure, organic argan oil.</li>
            <li> Pure Body Naturals delivers on both quality and convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is pure without carrier or filler oils.</li>
            <li> Being that it is 100% Pure Certified Organic</li>
            <li> I received the Pure Body Naturals Argan Oil for review.  </li>
            <li> This 100% certified organic argan oil comes in a large 4 oz.</li>
            <li> This is pure Argan oil.</li>
            <li> Plus is 100% pure oil.</li>
            <li> this seems to last much longer than traditional lotion, it absorbs quickly but is more effective.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I am not sure that Argan oil is more superior to other body oils..</li>
            <li> Once face and skin is clean right out of shower, the mix is easier to apply and the product lasts twice as long.</li>
            <li> It will help with those crazy fly aways and leave your hair shinny and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  definitely made a huge impact.</li>
            <li> I am very amazed.</li>
            <li> So, imagine just getting straight argan oil, that you can use for all purposes.</li>
            <li> I really wanted it for my hair, but end up using it for my skin.</li>
            <li> I was honestly very hesitant to use oils-</li>
            <li> Since I use it on my face, neck, nails and hair, I really like the fact that no fillers or additives are used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works very well on hair and hands...</li>
            <li> also it goes very well with make up on..</li>
            <li> it started to smell rancid too fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> It has really helped my hair in heal against breakage and haven&#x27;t noticed as much breakage.</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> Really calms my hair</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is really a &amp;#34;Must Have&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Holy Grail&amp;#34; beauty and skincare product that I think everyone should have as part of their beauty, skincare and hair care routines.  </li>
            <li> It sems to absorb into the skin very well.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.  </li>
            <li> saturate my whole head and wait for an hour and then wash it out.  </li>
            <li> as much as I did before.</li>
            <li> really like this product</li>
            <li> Delivery was extremely fast.</li>
            <li> I really do recommend you buy this product.</li>
            <li> and I really like the results.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free to test and review.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> and it has helped my face, neck, hands, &amp; hair so much.</li>
            <li> I  love that it had minimal packaging.</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t very noticeable.</li>
            <li> even use this with the dermal roller and it really helps your skin heel faster,normally I look sunburned for 2-3 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I like it and it works very well</li>
            <li> This was reasonably priced and had favorable reviews</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and everything.</li>
            <li> The oil consistency is also very runny, compared to my Josie Maran and my Physician&#x27;s Formula Oil.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone, whether they&#x27;re a seasoned user or a new one.</li>
            <li> is a great argan product and for my dry crackly body this has endless possibilities!</li>
            <li> particularly like this Pure Body Naturals argan oil</li>
            <li> because of how pure it is and the realistic packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this for my hair to keep frizz down and create a smooth, healthy appearance, especially at the ends.</li>
            <li> I have fairly good skin, but my elbows get dry and rough</li>
            <li> I also use it in my hair and it keeps it feeling smooth all day long.  </li>
            <li> The only difference is, this oil has the true Argan earthy smell.  </li>
            <li> Argan Oil gave my hair a nice shine and softness without being too oily or slick.  </li>
            <li> I might be able to put up with it if i am not pregnant.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using this particular brand about a month ago, I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very very pleased with how this feels on my my nails and my hands because they&#x27;re so dry and my hair is very very brittle and this made it shiny and feeling an extremely soft unbelievable difference in the feel and the look noticed it right away.  </li>
            <li> If you want healthier hair and skin, I highly recommend this Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I am also using it on my scalp - yep, for psoriasis - instead of prescription which contains steroids - saturate scalp and cover with cap overnight several times a week (obviously washing hair next morning), and I&#x27;m starting to have great results.  </li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really sinks into your skin and smoothes out fine lines.</li>
            <li> still do like this as its pure natural &amp; they give a guarantee of some 60 days</li>
            <li> It is pure argan oil, triple filtered and with all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I really like the natural feel of this oil, for my hands nails and even my face</li>
            <li> I guess the strength was a bit much for my sensitive</li>
            <li> I just got it, but so far I like it really well.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and this product helps keep it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a heavy glass and you dispense the oil with a dripper so you can easily control how much you are squeezing out.  </li>
            <li> Argan Oil is like the new coconut oil - it is like a cure all for everything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about them but never tired them especially Argan.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It kept my dry ends from becoming frizzy and improved the overall texture.</li>
            <li> not as I expected, smelliness, unlike the other review said, kind of disappoint.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in a dark colored bottle (to protect the oil from light).</li>
            <li> The bottle is pretty simple and includes helpful usage tips.</li>
            <li> This is truly unique to me because every other argan oil I&#x27;ve ever purchased either has a dropper as the lid or has no dropper.</li>
            <li> WOW the improvement in my skin is jaw dropping!</li>
            <li> my&lt;br /&gt;skin is still soft, and moisturized!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try adding some essential oils because it works so much better than other Argan oil that I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li> A little bit of this goes a long way and it has a nice smell to it.  </li>
            <li> The argan oil somehow prevented my rashes to get worse, I am pretty sure it will go away if I no longer use those chemicals.</li>
            <li> It also works great on hair, just apply a little to the ends of damp hair to help heal any damage and tame flyaways!</li>
            <li> I would say that is true due to its flexible use.  </li>
            <li> If your hair has those crazy fly away use a drop of this oil and rub in your palms and lightly brush down your hair with your palms.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy using a small amount as a facial moisturizer at night and around my eyes during the day, but felt that it gave me too much of a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; as a whole face moisturizer during the day.</li>
            <li> the boy starts getting a dry spot, I use Argan Oil right away.  </li>
            <li> Lastly I run my hands through my hair focusing on the middle &amp; ends since that&#x27;s the most dry.  </li>
            <li> Argan Oil is definitely a staple in my hair routine, and this product by Pure Body Naturals is just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face as well for acne breakouts and to help clear up my face</li>
            <li> and my face is clear no redness whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy but leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The product is all natural and organic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve noticed, as have I that products with argan oil are all over the place lately.</li>
            <li> i dint feel my hands soft.</li>
            <li> The oil has no additives or fillers and is all natural, organic, and unrefined.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> No greasy feel, no breakouts, just soft skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much rather make a batch of treatment options myself than to pay retail price for a commercial product.</li>
            <li> it helps my hair to grow and makes it so soft with no buildup.</li>
            <li> my skin feels soft.  </li>
            <li> It has made them soft and hydrated, it also has made the itchiness go away.</li>
            <li> It gives your hair a healthy look but doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy in the least.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 60 years old now).</li>
            <li> My face is SO SOFT and silky.</li>
            <li> I used on my hands and they stayed soft all day.</li>
            <li> My cuticles stay soft and no hangnails.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to smells find an unscented Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I added a few drops of argan oil to my moisturizer everyday and it is doing wonders keeping my face looking healthy and fresh.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t use a product that smells like spoiled milk, no matter how good it is for my skin &amp; hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m becoming very partial to this brand of argan oil specifically because of how much faster it absorbs than other brands and because of how convenient the packaging</li>
            <li> The only other issue was probably more user error than anything, but be careful to not use too much in your hair if leaving the Argan Oil in as you will get a greasy look.</li>
            <li> Nice to not have the heavy scent that other companies as to their Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product and will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This time of year, my face becomes very dry with the cold weather, but I have noticed that it is much better this year than most winters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Moderate amounts on my thick hair makes it feel alive and healthy not greesy.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is one of my new favorites for all of the above.</li>
            <li> This is the exact same organic , first pressed, raw argan oil that is sold for $100 and some.</li>
            <li> This oil left my face feeling so,so soft and hydrated after using it!</li>
            <li> I let my significant other try it out, and he said he likes the way it makes his beard feel, and also helps with his dry skin, eczema and scalp.</li>
            <li> have v coarse super dry hair, normal facial skin but v dry hands.</li>
            <li> I tend to have very dry skin in the winter and it really helped with the itchiness and dryness.  </li>
            <li> I have to say the company is very generous as it provides the consumer wit a huge 4 oz bottle which will definitely last a long time, as a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical but this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> My scalp feels more hydrated and not as dry, I also noticed less flakes because of my scalp not being dry.</li>
            <li> I use Argan Oil on my hair and in various hair cream concoctions on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> guarantee that if you are not satisfied, send them an email and they will refund your purchase in full.  </li>
            <li> My skin stays super soft &amp; moisturized for at least 24 hours if not longer.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for the dry ends on my hair and it worked very well and actually continued working even after I washed and conditioned my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used other argan oils, this is exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li> I have used it jus for a week and was not bowled over as i did not experience out of ordinary feelings,&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick and came in god condition - no breakage etc</li>
            <li> This oil absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn&#x27;t make your hands slick or oily like lotions do.</li>
            <li> Even though I wash my hands several times during a day, I reapplied twice and my hands were still soft the next morning..  </li>
            <li> Pure Body Naturals also recommends using other ways such as on your body as a moisturizer, massage oil, acne treatment, etc., but I have not applied it in such a way and cannot speak in regards of those options.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But as some other reviewers have said, when using argan oil for the first time, I was surprised to find it smelled like a zoo (a sour manure-like odor).</li>
            <li> When I call the packaging realistic, I mean that they understand how people use this oil and have made the packaging convenient and real.</li>
            <li> Treats Dry and Sensitive Skin</li>
            <li> and I have noticed that it is less frizzy and much shinier.  </li>
            <li> My hands are surviving the cold weather better than they ever have!</li>
            <li> But I do have dry skin on my hands, especially around the fingernails and this so far has appeared to help that condition.</li>
            <li> It has an unusual oder that I can tolerate but not best--all you have to do is put a little Lavender essential oil it</li>
            <li> I have to give it time to give it a good or bad review.  </li>
            <li> I also use it very sparingly on the ends of my hair and it calms down the over processed, dry ends.  </li>
            <li> Oh by the way, you only need a small amount and it covers large areas.</li>
            <li> When I compare the scent to other pure argan oils I&#x27;ve tried, it almost smells sour in the bottle where it should smell similar to olive oil.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed and then it should be gently massaged into the hair, skin or nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is a pure product.  </li>
            <li> Pure Body Naturals sent me their 100% Organic Argan Oil to test out for them and it is has been my go to Argan Oil for the past</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure about how pure this is</li>
            <li> just not sure how much I will use it.</li>
            <li> so this bottle will last you for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Smells a little bad, but great for your hair and complexion.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy and has a very off putting smell.</li>
            <li> All this with just 2-3 drops total which means the bottle lasts for a long time!</li>
            <li> It will last a very long time even if you use it every day.  </li>
            <li> Wife has always been a believer in Argan oil and uses this on her hair and for me I had never heard of it but researched it and decided to try it on my dry skin, especially on my hands.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Having read the positive reviews i had v high hopes-&lt;br /&gt;Smell is bit weird..</li>
            <li> [live in dry climate year round] without an oily mask, and use it nightly after washing my face and before going to bed.  </li>
            <li> Smells strange and still trying to figure out what it is.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that you will wish you started using a long time ago.</li>
            <li> It also lasts really long.</li>
            <li> Shampoo, conditioner, bodywash, hair creams, lotions, and a few drops directly onto my face and neck area.</li>
            <li> My daughter who is 11 also got a rash on her scalp despite how soft her coarse curly hair was, it wasn&#x27;t worth the annoying rash that developed on her face and neck.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the garish brown-yellow of lower quality argan oils that I have tried, and it also isn&#x27;t mixed with any other oils or fragrances.</li>
            <li> needs to be mixed with other ingredients.</li>
            <li> It is simply not as moisturizing as some other oils i have tried like jajabo oil, bio oil etc.</li>
            <li> The only hard part about using this oil is that I am putting it on a squiggling  year old boy who thinks he&#x27;s getting a beauty</li>
            <li> I find it helpful when my face becomes dry.  </li>
            <li> It also helps reduce symptoms of aging and treats dry skin and eczema.  </li>
            <li> Dry hair?</li>
            <li> Dry skin?</li>
            <li> I never heard of a dry oil</li>
            <li> My skin gets so dry this time of year.</li>
            <li> Wife uses it to keep her hair from being dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I feel safer using it on his dry spots than using the prescription lotion that states it could burn the skin on the warning label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put this on my dry skin immediately after cleansing before bed and in the a.m. under  my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it, but my hair remained untamable and dry.  </li>
            <li> I also used the Argan Oil on dry patches of my skin and face.</li>
            <li> my dry parts</li>
            <li> Her skin is no longer dry or itchy and she has stopped scratching all together.</li>
            <li> I use this oil when my hair is dry and frizzy (it helps taming it) or after I use any heat products.</li>
            <li> Dry hair, dry skin, scars, acne.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops every morning mixed with an equal amount of Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> And remember, a little goes a long way, so this bottle will last a LONG time!</li>
            <li> my hair - wet or dry - after shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have paid the same price for half the amount.</li>
            <li> these last few days!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have used this as a lotion on my body, did a hair treatment , used it on my nails and also on my dry craking heels, elbows and knees.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also add it to my leave in and rinse out conditioners for a little extra oomph.</li>
            <li> Smells a little funky, but does not last.</li>
            <li> Have rough, cracked feet?</li>
            <li> I have absolutely NO smell at all.</li>
            <li> You can add a few drops of this to your lotion in your palm and give it that extra boost.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You only need a few drops at a time.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I only started using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> The oil sinks in and keeps your nails from breaking and splitting.</li>
            <li> I have used various kinds of Argan oil before which had a heavy smell however this one does not.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the company offers a 100% money back guarantee, so they stand behind this product.</li>
            <li> My hands feel softer and are less dry.</li>
            <li> My cuticles softened and even my nails seemed less dry.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It was greasy on my hair, but I think I may have overdone it as a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I just ordered another bottle just to have on hand, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I also like adding a couple of drops to my bath to keep my body moisturized and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You only have to use a small amount or it will make your hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Either use a small amount to leave in or plan on washing out a larger amount after some time has passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> will other oils</li>
            <li> but I also apply to other parts of my body as well.</li>
            <li> With other oils &amp; serums I find that I have to reapply them</li>
            <li> Usually, you just get that on the tiny bottles of product.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be thicker like other Argan Oils</li>
            <li> It softened the calluses and kept my heels from cracking due to the dryness of the winter weather.</li>
            <li> I have been using argan oil for years, but from other brands.</li>
            <li> Unusable for retail blends with other oils unless cut with deodorized Argan.</li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> I like this MUCH better than all the chemical crap</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a slight unpleasant scent, but I only really notice it if I smell the Argan Oil in concentrate.</li>
            <li> My hair still has movement does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> My nails were looking a little yellowish due to over use of the ole nail polish.  </li>
            <li> no more dry skin.</li>
            <li> I believe this brand just lacks a bit of the quality I&#x27;ve used from a few other brands.</li>
            <li> You have to squeeze out and half a syringe is all you need.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I started using Argan Oil, my hair has been a lot smoother and softer, easier to brush, tangles less and looks healthier.</li>
            <li> oil does have a slight scent.</li>
            <li> I mix this in another bottle with distilled water- half and half.</li>
            <li> It is unscented and the smell is just slightly off to me.</li>
            <li> It seemed to remove the dryness and even the slight wrinkles and tightness of my skin.</li>
            <li> and they are slightly sunburned.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face at nighttime as my skin has been very dry for the past couple of weeks (darn Winter).</li>
            <li> Using the argan oil has helped with that issue as well, while my hair is still damp I will put a few drops on my hand and rub it on the crown of my head and then using a small tooth comb,I comb it through, then blow dry.</li>
            <li> For ladies it might be different because you use make up, so I can only tell you from guys perspective.&lt;br /&gt;People with eczema and psoriasis understand how painful it can be, especially psychologically, so please give it a try.</li>
            <li> My face broke in teenage pimples - not the redness usually associated with my dermatologist diagnoses of Rosacea and was prescribed an oral antibiotics RX which was not effective if I didn&#x27;t take the medicine every day for consecutive days.  </li>
            <li> I also like to apply to my face at night as a sleep mask and when I wake up my skin is well hydrated and even has a little glow to it.  </li>
            <li> Just put a little on your skin...</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this one is a little oily.  </li>
            <li> When I get out of the shower, I use a little in my hair.</li>
            <li> The oil is too heavy for my hair, it doesn&#x27;t absorb well.</li>
            <li> I also use a few drops</li>
            <li> Just a few drops in the palm of my hand was all that was needed to apply.  </li>
            <li> She uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few days.</li>
            <li> My daughter has seborrhea dermatitis and she has been using this also for a few days.</li>
            <li> I apply this a few times a day</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> I use just a little on my ends to tame them after styling.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair slightly stiff.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and very thick.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my hair,it was falling out pretty bad.</li>
            <li> You need very little of this oil</li>
            <li> Out of the bottle, it has very little odor.  </li>
            <li> No more lotions for me.</li>
            <li> I put the oil all over my head once a week and leave it in for at least two days</li>
            <li> ,I think it is slowly working.only</li>
            <li> I use it after taking showers and my hair has seriously been growing and lookin healthier since.</li>
            <li> but I can also use it for a moisturizer for my dry feet as well as treating my cuticles which the cold winter air always butchers them.</li>
            <li> i think i am not a good judge here..</li>
            <li> If you like to go to a gym for example, then you know that sweating is not good for your eczema, so</li>
            <li> The downside it is very thin and drips out when you remove the dropper - can be messy, the aroma is not pleasant (smells like infant poop), and for this reason I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed a difference in my hair, which is very thick and tends to get frizzy..</li>
            <li> It seems thin</li>
            <li> disappointed with this oil, it gave my hair a dry feeling</li>
            <li> Unlike other brands I&#x27;ve tried this one doesn&#x27;t have a bad scent.</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy it because of some negative reviews that it had a bad smell.</li>
            <li> Just received this as a gift, but it smells terrible... oddly enough like spoiled milk.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this stuff!</li>
            <li> Sorry for the confusion.</li>
            <li> In worst  case scenario you  will &amp;#34;waste&amp;#34; $17, which is actually less if you spread it over 2-3 months depending of how often you use the oil.</li>
            <li> Where I am located in the midwest the weather has been crazy on my nails.</li>
            <li> I have been going Argan oil crazy</li>
            <li> I will still use it, just a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> It smelled badly..</li>
            <li> It stinks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was very skeptical!</li>
            <li> it smells bad!</li>
            <li> Size is disappointing!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product! I use this for my hair to keep frizz down and create a smooth, healthy appearance, especially at the ends. I also use it on my hands, feet and elbows to keep my skin looking and feeling great.</li>
            <li> Nice to not have the heavy scent that other companies as to their Argan oil.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell good but it works really well.</li>
            <li> It smelled badly.. It was spoiled, to the point of rotten..</li>
            <li> Smells strange and still trying to figure out what it is. Have another brand that is great but cost more. Get what pay for. .</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair this evening after washing it. My hair is ridiculously soft and it was easy to brush.</li>
            <li> IT WILL MAKE YOUR HAIR FALL FASTER</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this Argan Oil.  I apply it on my face and body and I shimmer all day.  Great moisturizing and a much lower cost for great quality!</li>
            <li> this  is the first time I am using argan oil I found out what it is used for and ordered it right away I&#x27;m very very pleased with how this feels on my my nails and my hands because they&#x27;re so dry and my hair is very very brittle and this made it shiny and feeling an extremely soft unbelievable difference in the feel and the look noticed it right away.  I love Body naturals and I will continue to shop at this company because they have everything I need for my face and then some I feel very confident with this company and they have all great great reviews this is how I started to try their products from there client reviews</li>
            <li> Love, love Argan Oil, and this has exceeded my expectations of quality!</li>
            <li> Just received this as a gift, but it smells terrible... oddly enough like spoiled milk. I have used other argan oil before, and it has always had a light, nutty smell that was very lovely. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t use a product that smells like spoiled milk, no matter how good it is for my skin &amp; hair. Super bummed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: the seller was great about issuing a refund. I&#x27;m adjusting my one star rating to two because although I won&#x27;t use the product, they responded to my email immediately.</li>
            <li> I tried Organic Argan oil on my arms. The picture at the bottom will show you how this product works. This is my left arm, on day one I only got rashes but after a week I burn my skin, see the circle red spot?  Organic Argan oil seems to hydrate my skin. It eliminated my rashes and heals my burn. As you can see my skin looks better. The only problem is that I am expose to the same chemicals that caused the rashes on a daily basis. The argan oil somehow prevented my rashes to get worse, I am pretty sure it will go away if I no longer use those chemicals. My burn healed pretty good. I am very amazed. I don&#x27;t feel itchy and stingy anymore. This oil does not feel greasy and it came with a dropper for easy use. I like this product and I would buy it again when I am out. I also tried it on my hair and it makes my hair soft, shiny and easy to comb. But I am saving this bottle mostly for my arms. I want to get better and feel great about my skin..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a bottle of this product free for review and product evaluation.</li>
            <li> You have to squeeze out and half a syringe is all you need. What is it you might ask? Well it is called Argan Oil. I have recently found out that argan oil is awesome for the fingers. Where I am located in the midwest the weather has been crazy on my nails.I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! I have had some snapping off. With using this it is helping with healing my cuticles. I am using this all over my hands and feet. While using this I am noticing my skin and hair looking healthier. I am using the oil on the ends of my hair. I will keeping using this on my hands and hair. I am loving the results from this.</li>
            <li> Love Argon Oil my face and hair felt softer after two days of use. Liquid Gold is a good name for it.</li>
            <li> First of all the best news is this product is 100% pure Argan oil. There are no additives, or fillers, just 1 ingredient. This is always a plus for me, knowing exactly what I&#x27;m using, and that it&#x27;s good for my body and hair.The product is all natural and organic.This product works great as a moisturizer for your hair and skin. It makes your hair shine. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve noticed, as have I that products with argan oil are all over the place lately. People are loving argan oil shampoos, and conditioners and everything else. So, imagine just getting straight argan oil, that you can use for all purposes. This is a great product. I was very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my hair, skin and nails. Argan Oil is one of my new favorites for all of the above. Not to mention the company offers a 100% money back guarantee, so they stand behind this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using the oil on my hair after washing and it feels healthy and smooth</li>
            <li> It works okay, but I don&#x27;t like the smell. I really wanted it for my hair, but end up using it for my skin. Makes my hair slightly stiff. Works okay on my skin. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Inez Ellis</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hair,it was falling out pretty bad.I put the oil all over my head once a week and leave it in for at least two days,I think it is slowly working.only have had it for about 3weeks,so time will tell.</li>
            <li> great price. I searched all over the internet and this was the best price I found for this size bottle.</li>
            <li> i like the way this oil goes on, makes my skin very smooth, it does however have a funny smell to it, but it does wear off quickly</li>
            <li> I was honestly very hesitant to use oils-I&#x27;ve heard so much about them but never tired them especially Argan.But I have to admit everything I hear is true! This oil left my face feeling so,so soft and hydrated after using it! I have dry skin so this is so so nice!! And let&#x27;s not talk about my hair..I use it after taking showers and my hair has seriously been growing and lookin healthier since.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is a pure product.  It seems thin and it doesn&#x27;t condition my hair the way the Moroccan oil did.</li>
            <li> Good product for the skin for wrinkles has helped me greatly. Wayne</li>
            <li> I really love argan oil. I have used argan oil on my hair for about 2 years now. I had the opportunity to review this argan oil from Pure Body Naturals and I love it. It makes your hair feel wonderful and gets rid of the frizz. Makes your hair smooth and manageable. You only have to use a small amount or it will make your hair greasy. You should only use about a dime to a pea size depending on your hair length. I would recommend this to anyone who has frizzy hair. I have yet to try it on my face or nails but I would almost bet that it would work for them too.</li>
            <li> This is some pretty amazing stuff. I love using it on my hair. I use just a little on my ends to tame them after styling. I sometimes use it as a leave in conditioner. I have also used it as a moisturizer on my face. There are so many great uses for this! It smells pretty good too!</li>
            <li> Argan Oil by Pure Body Naturals is a great product that contains 100% pure certified organic virgin cold-pressed Argan Oil. Since I use it on my face, neck, nails and hair, I really like the fact that no fillers or additives are used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan Oil is extremely easy to use. Each day, I put only 2-3 drops on my palm, rub my hands together, then I rub a bit on my face and neck, afterwards I rub some on each fingernail bed/cuticle and finally, I run my hands threw my hair for the last of it. All this with just 2-3 drops total which means the bottle lasts for a long time! Pure Body Naturals also recommends using other ways such as on your body as a moisturizer, massage oil, acne treatment, etc., but I have not applied it in such a way and cannot speak in regards of those options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using Argan Oil, my hair has been a lot smoother and softer, easier to brush, tangles less and looks healthier. My nails look great and the skin around my nail bed is no longer dry or cracking. This time of year, my face becomes very dry with the cold weather, but I have noticed that it is much better this year than most winters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight unpleasant scent, but I only really notice it if I smell the Argan Oil in concentrate. While I use it on my face, nails or hair, I do not notice the aroma or if I do, it is very brief. The only other issue was probably more user error than anything, but be careful to not use too much in your hair if leaving the Argan Oil in as you will get a greasy look. Either use a small amount to leave in or plan on washing out a larger amount after some time has passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed trying Argan Oil by Pure Body Naturals for a month. It has worked well and I look forward towards continued use in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest opinion based on my personal experiences.</li>
            <li> I recived this product for review. I love using Argan oil on my hair to help with breakage and to help moisturize also. I have been using this product for a month and I and enjoyed the healthy results that I am seeing. Thor is also an all over product so it have multi uses. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Smells like olives and my skin did not react well to it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at an excellent price. I had been buying overpriced Josie Maran Argan Oil for many years. I wish I had found this sooner. I almost didn&#x27;t buy it because of some negative reviews that it had a bad smell. This one smells no different than Josie Maran.  I will definitely buy again and am glad to be saving money.</li>
            <li> works very well on hair and hands...no scent at all , I wish it had that Moroccan oil scent I have come to know from buying otheres</li>
            <li> Great price and shipping. AAA</li>
            <li> Love it for skin, hair AND nails!</li>
            <li> I really like the natural feel of this oil, for my hands nails and even my face</li>
            <li> Love this oil for my hair!</li>
            <li> The wife says it&#x27;s good ...... so it&#x27;s good ... end of discussion.</li>
            <li> Love how soft it leaves my skin ..also it goes very well with make up on..</li>
            <li> Product was OK. it started to smell rancid too fast.</li>
            <li> I love Argan Oil.  My skin loves it.  If I don&#x27;t use it, it feels like it is going to flake off.  I will not be without it.</li>
            <li> I have used it jus for a week and was not bowled over as i did not experience out of ordinary feelings,&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick and came in god condition - no breakage etc so thats good&lt;br /&gt;it comes with a glass filler that is convieneint and be cosncious of how many drops u use. also hygenic than digging your fingers in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I have v coarse super dry hair, normal facial skin but v dry hands. I also purchased the derma roller so figured this argan oil will be my moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Having read the positive reviews i had v high hopes-&lt;br /&gt;Smell is bit weird..but as this is first time i am using pure argan oil i think i am not a good judge here..smells reminds me of some overripe /rotten fruit&lt;br /&gt;used couple of drops in my hair ,rubbed in my palms and ran thru my hair post shwoeing. It did get a bit shiny,greasy ..results are just ok&lt;br /&gt;Yday night used them on my palsm before bed, and though it felt oily i dint feel my hands soft. I have had better results with hand creams that feel luxuious and make ur hands feel soft&lt;br /&gt;I still do like this as its pure natural &amp; they give a guarantee of some 60 days i suppose.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to continue using this on my face, hair either alone or mix it will other oils ..I am sure it will definately yield good results</li>
            <li> I think this is good came fast and all.  It has an unusual oder that I can tolerate but not best--all you have to do is put a little Lavender essential oil it it and then smell good.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. So versatile! Smells great and great viscosity and is very nourishing. Used on hair and for homemade beard balm and oil for my SO.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this light oil</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service.  Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Great product for my very sensitive skin.  I find it helpful when my face becomes dry.  A little goes a long way.  Good sale price.</li>
            <li> I like to start by stating that I got this product for review.  However, all opinions and experiences are mine alone.

It leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable.  I also use it on my face and body for moisturizing and hydration.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. It also helps reduce symptoms of aging and treats dry skin and eczema.  I also use Argan oil on my nails to help keep them strong and healthy.

            <li> not as I expected, smelliness, unlike the other review said, kind of disappoint.....</li>
            <li> awesome oil, for my skin and love how silky shiny it makes my hair!! My hair still has movement does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> will not know how well the product worked until I use it for a while longer. It seems to be effective so far.</li>
            <li> The service was great and delivered on time.  The oil is too heavy for my hair, it doesn&#x27;t absorb well.</li>
            <li> Even though it may soften the skin and hair, I got a rash on my arms and legs.  My daughter who is 11 also got a rash on her scalp despite how soft her coarse curly hair was, it wasn&#x27;t worth the annoying rash that developed on her face and neck.  I&#x27;m sure that some may not develop the same, I am just writing what happened to my family.</li>
            <li> This may be a good product, but check with your physician to see if you have any allergies to this type of oil. My left eye is swollen from me applying this to my face.</li>
            <li> Organic argan oil is a great oil that I have been using on my hair for awhile now. It helps ad a great shine to my hair without making it feel greasy or oily. It has really helped my hair in heal against breakage and haven&#x27;t noticed as much breakage. I also use it on my nails to keep them looking great and hard and not breaking. This stuff you can use everywhere I use it on my face as well for acne breakouts and to help clear up my face it works great. A little bit of this goes a long way and it has a nice smell to it.  received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is like the new coconut oil - it is like a cure all for everything. Dry hair? Argan oil. Problematic skin? Argan oil. Dry skin? Argan oil. Need cuticle care? Argan Oil. Have rough, cracked feet? Argan Oil. The stuff is great. I have been using this on my face at nighttime as my skin has been very dry for the past couple of weeks (darn Winter). I love how it restores moisture without making my face oily or sticky. It is free of added fragrances or junk so you know what you are putting on your skin is not toxic to your body. Plus, how many products do you own that you can use from your hair to your toes, literally? This is one of those products that you will wish you started using a long time ago. This seems to be something that is popular in the beauty world now, but has been being used forever elsewhere. If you want healthier hair and skin, I highly recommend this Argan Oil. And remember, a little goes a long way, so this bottle will last a LONG time!</li>
            <li> I use argan oil for several things, but mostly I use it for my hair. I dye my hair a bright red, so I always mix a bit with my conditioner to keep my hair smooth, shiny, and damage free. But there are so many uses for argan oil that it is one of the best things you could ever keep on hand. It is absolutely amazing for your skin, hair, and nails. If you&#x27;re a first time user and worried about being &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;, don&#x27;t be! Argan oil is a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; oil, which means that it will not leave any oily residue on your skin! I could go on and on about the uses and benefits, but a simple internet search can tell you everything you&#x27;d ever want to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly like this Pure Body Naturals argan oil because of how pure it is and the realistic packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What sets this argan oil apart from the rest is how very pure it is. It doesn&#x27;t have the garish brown-yellow of lower quality argan oils that I have tried, and it also isn&#x27;t mixed with any other oils or fragrances. This is just pure, organic argan oil. I&#x27;m becoming very partial to this brand of argan oil specifically because of how much faster it absorbs than other brands and because of how convenient the packaging is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a dark colored bottle (to protect the oil from light). The bottle is pretty simple and includes helpful usage tips. It also shows right on the bottle that it is certified organic (by EcoCert), cruelty free, not tested on animals, and that the oil is imported from Morocco. It seems like a small, insignificant thing, but I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve seen products claim they&#x27;re organic or cruelty free and there isn&#x27;t any sign on the product itself. Seeing it on the bottle gives me more faith in the product and shows me they&#x27;re proud of those features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway. When I call the packaging realistic, I mean that they understand how people use this oil and have made the packaging convenient and real. The bottle ships with a seperate glass dropper. This is truly unique to me because every other argan oil I&#x27;ve ever purchased either has a dropper as the lid or has no dropper. Pure Body Naturals has made sure that their packaging doesn&#x27;t limit your usage options. You can use it with the rubber-sealed lid that comes on it, or you can replace that with the dropper lid they&#x27;ve included with it. This is especially useful if you&#x27;ve bought this argan oil for a specific purpose like me. I would use a dropper for argan oil that I am going to use on my skin/nails, but I would prefer to pour it out of the bottle for my hair or use a pump. It seems like Pure Body Naturals knows and understands how people use their products and wants happy customers. The only thing I can think of that would improve this packaging is if they included the dropper and a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil does have a slight scent. When I compare the scent to other pure argan oils I&#x27;ve tried, it almost smells sour in the bottle where it should smell similar to olive oil. This isn&#x27;t a big thing to me because I&#x27;m not even sure if it is the oil itself or if it is the bottle because it doesn&#x27;t really have that scent when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great argan oil. It has customer friendly packaging, and all the features you should look for in an argan oil. I would recommend it to anyone, whether they&#x27;re a seasoned user or a new one. Pure Body Naturals delivers on both quality and convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.</li>
            <li> WOW the improvement in my skin is jaw dropping! I am addicted to this stuff!</li>
            <li> I mix this in another bottle with distilled water- half and half. Once face and skin is clean right out of shower, the mix is easier to apply and the product lasts twice as long.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT I LOOK BEAUTIFUL NOW</li>
            <li> Silky smooth formula with no fragrance.  Sinks into skin and makes it soft.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have used it all over my skin, on my kids, on my hair. No greasy feel, no breakouts, just soft skin and hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the bottle is HUGE. This will last you quite a while.</li>
            <li> This oil is okay. I am not sure that Argan oil is more superior to other body oils.. It is a good buy for the money though. It is pure without carrier or filler oils. It is unscented and the smell is just slightly off to me. I wish it was scented. I will add it to my lotions and shampoo to use but I won&#x27;t buy agian because of the lack of nice scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a week on my face, hair and hands and I can already feel a difference. I really like it in my hair but go easy on how much you put in. I would recommend this product for sure but forewarn about the scent. I read that it has an &#x27;earthy&#x27; smell on the reviews so I was expecting something heady. I would describe the smell as a blend of mushrooms and manure. Really. It stinks! But the scent vanishes quickly and the oil really does leave your skin and hair softer AND it is 100% pure no fillers or junk added in so you can feel good about what you are using. Bottom line: I will purchase this item again despite its malodorous scent.</li>
            <li> Really good product. Amazingly rejenurating my dry skin!! Happy buyer!!!</li>
            <li> this is so good for my skin, hair and nails. I&#x27;d much rather make a batch of treatment options myself than to pay retail price for a commercial product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face at night--4 or 5 drops is all it takes. And I haven&#x27;t even been needing eye cream. My skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This item was tried last night on my skin. I LOVED it!!!  I can&#x27;t wait to try it on my hair as I sometimes get &amp;#34;frizzes&amp;#34;.  I am 100% confident that it will make my hair soft and shiney!</li>
            <li> Love it. Really calms my hair</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is really a &amp;#34;Must Have&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Holy Grail&amp;#34; beauty and skincare product that I think everyone should have as part of their beauty, skincare and hair care routines.  Pure Body Naturals sent me their 100% Organic Argan Oil to test out for them and it is has been my go to Argan Oil for the past several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The really great thing about Argan Oil is that you can literally use it for everything, like your entire body kind of everything!  My favorite way to use Argan Oil is to apply it at night as an all over body moisturizer right after I get out of the shower or bath.  My skin stays super soft &amp; moisturized for at least 24 hours if not longer.  I also like to apply to my face at night as a sleep mask and when I wake up my skin is well hydrated and even has a little glow to it.  It also works great on hair, just apply a little to the ends of damp hair to help heal any damage and tame flyaways!</li>
            <li> I have used different brands of argan oil and I found some to be more effective than others. Pure body natutrals is one of the few that are ontop of my list of the good brands to use. I have sensitive skin, experienced no redness or any other side effects. I had a excellent experience using the argan oil with my hair, as it helps with my dry itchy scalp. Ever since I started using this particular brand about a month ago, I noticed a difference. My scalp feels more hydrated and not as dry, I also noticed less flakes because of my scalp not being dry.I have frizz issues as well (but what person doesn’t ) especially during the cold weather because of the wind and during the warm weather because of the humidity. Using the argan oil has helped with that issue as well, while my hair is still damp I will put a few drops on my hand and rub it on the crown of my head and then using a small tooth comb,I comb it through, then blow dry. It also helps with split ends. In the end it leaves my hair looking refreshed, soft, shiny and flawless. I color my hair and it doesn’t affect the coloring by making it fade, it gives it shine and protects the color. In my opinion I think it makes the color last longer. With using argan oil on my skin it helps with my dryness that I get during the winter months but I also apply to other parts of my body as well. When applied to my skin it leaves it feeling hydrated and glowing,even giving me a youthful feel. I apply it to my legs after I shave and it prevents me getting any razor burn, redness or bumps. It leaves my legs feeling smooth and looking sexy. Argan oil is also good for men so let the man in your life give it a try. He wont regret using it especially if he has a beard. I let my significant other try it out, and he said he likes the way it makes his beard feel, and also helps with his dry skin, eczema and scalp. He uses it before he puts on lotion. The best part about argan oil for us females is that we can go about our daily makeup routine. It enhances the look of your face.tine. It enhances the look of your face.</li>
            <li> really great if you have problems with severely dry skin worked better than the 50.00 Rx and 50.00 copay to the dermatologist</li>
            <li> I use on my lock it helps my hair to grow and makes it so soft with no buildup. I use as a body oil. I love the dropper. I mix with my favorite lotion. I did receive for review</li>
            <li> My magical oil. Dont worry it wont break you out. Just put a little on your skin...coconut oil breaks me out but this doesnt. It makes my skin baby soft and keeps my hair healthy</li>
            <li> Smelled rancid. Returned. Don&#x27;t bother wasting your time.</li>
            <li> Found out this is from a tree nut and I am alergic to pecans and walnuts. Alot of people like this oil but don&#x27;t use if you have an allergy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe all the comments on the smell of this product.  I have absolutely NO smell at all. It sems to absorb into the skin very well.  I have to give it time to give it a good or bad review.  But so far...I like it.</li>
            <li> needs to be mixed with other ingredients. used by itself on my skin it started itching - I guess the strength was a bit much for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in my shampoos for the great benefits. :)</li>
            <li> This is some very good stuff, gives you a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is fabulous.  I never heard of a dry oil but it truly is.  Whether I use it on my hair, skin or nails the oil absorbs quickly and feels so nice, not sticky or greasy.  And it doesn&#x27;t take much for great results.</li>
            <li> I put this in my leave in conditioners and use it to keep my scalp moist. Works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Product received quickly. The positives I like the way the product feels, definitely is helping my skin become smoother, and does not feel greasy. The downside it is very thin and drips out when you remove the dropper - can be messy, the aroma is not pleasant (smells like infant poop), and for this reason I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product was amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Received the product right on time!</li>
            <li> Miracle stuff.  I use it on my face as a moisturizer and it&#x27;s perfect.  It makes my skin feel oily HOWEVER it makes it look matte which is PERFECT for keeping your skin youthful.  I also use it in my hair and it keeps it feeling smooth all day long.  I like this MUCH better than all the chemical crap these big drug companies push on us.</li>
            <li> Absorbs into the skin quickly.  I like to use this for a &amp;#34;carrier&amp;#34; oil for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> If this is the one I bought, then it&#x27;s good,  (See my review of InstaNatural)  Otherwise, this one is a little oily.  Sorry for the confusion.</li>
            <li> Good price for the size you get. I use this on damp hair after a shampoo for extra shine, after I wash my face just before bed and on my hands. I also add it to my leave in and rinse out conditioners for a little extra oomph. Works very well.</li>
            <li> Light and smooth - you can use it during the daytime. Smells a little funky, but does not last. I use a few drops every morning mixed with an equal amount of Rosehip oil. Leaves my skin glowy. I also use a few drops n my hair - wet or dry - after shampoo. Makes my nails stronger and healthier looking.</li>
            <li> very nice oil. It melts in the skin and it is not greasy. However, i am not a fan of the smell. It definitely has a very unique &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell. I might be able to put up with it if i am not pregnant. But nowadays the smell makes me gag every time i open the bottle. It is great on the hair. But i don&#x27;t recommend this oil for use as stretch mark preventive. It is simply not as moisturizing as some other oils i have tried like jajabo oil, bio oil etc. Otherwise it is a great moisturizer for face.</li>
            <li> I really love this oil.  I use it on my face, hair, hands, and all over my body.  My skin is dry and this product helps keep it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> no more dry skin. silky smooth</li>
            <li> great quality of oil does very well for hair and skin</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.  Some of the reviews said this product was great and some said it was too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;My hair and skin love it.  It does feel oily when I first put it on my face, but within minutes my skin drinks it up and&lt;br /&gt;then my skin feels soft.  It was greasy on my hair, but I think I may have overdone it as a little goes a long way.  I now prefer&lt;br /&gt;to saturate my whole head and wait for an hour and then wash it out.  My hair feels clean and soft and I don&#x27;t seem to&lt;br /&gt;shed as much as I did before.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I use it as a moisturizer on my face and oil my scalp with it as well. It makes my skin so smooth and it seems to help my hair grow aswell..very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> My face broke in teenage pimples - not the redness usually associated with my dermatologist diagnoses of Rosacea and was prescribed an oral antibiotics RX which was not effective if I didn&#x27;t take the medicine every day for consecutive days.  I ordered this Organic Argan Oil, not expecting much but thought it worth a try.  I am happily agast and totally amazed at the immediate results (I&#x27;ve been using it for a month)  I use more than 3 drops applied directly to my face as my skin absorbs it [live in dry climate year round] without an oily mask, and use it nightly after washing my face and before going to bed.  I am also using it on my scalp - yep, for psoriasis - instead of prescription which contains steroids - saturate scalp and cover with cap overnight several times a week (obviously washing hair next morning), and I&#x27;m starting to have great results.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product and will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Unlike other brands I&#x27;ve tried this one doesn&#x27;t have a bad scent. I love how it leaves my hair shiny and frizz free even on rainy days. It also lasts really long. With other oils &amp; serums I find that I have to reapply them If I plan on going out. However if I applied this oil in the morning I can come back in the evening and straighten my hair and not need to reapply. It&#x27;s also done great on the eczema on my hands. It has made them soft and hydrated, it also has made the itchiness go away. It&#x27;s a great product and one that I will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> I got the chance to try out this Argan oil and I loved it.  This oil did not leave me oily at all after.  It soaked right in and left my skin feeling so much better.  My skin gets so dry this time of year. It nice to have an extra boost of help for my skin this time of year.  If you have a lotion you love the smell of, but just does not work as great as you hoped it would. You can add a few drops of this to your lotion in your palm and give it that extra boost.&lt;br /&gt;  You can use this Argan oil on your skin, face, hair and nails.  There are so many uses this bottle is an all in one.  You need very little of this oil so this bottle will last you for quite a long time. This oil is also 100% certified organic.  You can beat that.  This was a great oil and I am so happy I found it.  If your hair has those crazy fly away use a drop of this oil and rub in your palms and lightly brush down your hair with your palms.  It will help with those crazy fly aways and leave your hair shinny and smooth.</li>
            <li> disappointed with this oil, it gave my hair a dry feeling so I&#x27;m not sure about how pure this is</li>
            <li> I Love this Argan Oil.  I have used several brands and this is my favorite.  It goes on smoothly and leaves your skin soft and supple.  Definatelately would buy again .  I did get this at a reduced price to try and review.</li>
            <li> smells like Olive Oil</li>
            <li> Smells a little bad, but great for your hair and complexion.  Non greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I think argan oil is the best skin oil.  It&#x27;s so clean feeling and never develops a spoiled smell, if on all day.  I liked the added feature of the companion dropper.  Usually, you just get that on the tiny bottles of product.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> excellent product and will purchase again</li>
            <li> Excellent quality oil.  WAY cheaper than Josie Maran.  The only difference is, this oil has the true Argan earthy smell.  Josie&#x27;s oil must be de-scented.</li>
            <li> Wife has always been a believer in Argan oil and uses this on her hair and for me I had never heard of it but researched it and decided to try it on my dry skin, especially on my hands. Wife uses it to keep her hair from being dry and brittle. She says it helps keep her hair healthier and softer overall. I recently started using this and will reserve final judgment after some time with the product and update my review. But I do have dry skin on my hands, especially around the fingernails and this so far has appeared to help that condition. My hands feel softer and are less dry. This oil absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn&#x27;t make your hands slick or oily like lotions do. This doesn&#x27;t smell particularly great though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems to do what it says for both hair and skin and so far it has worked for me  on my dry skin but doesn&#x27;t smell very good and I think is a bit expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars</li>
            <li> Wow!!! Just received oil today and I already feel a difference in my skin. Two drops for my face and it feels smoother and hydrated A++++</li>
            <li> This also is what I was looking for. I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but this stuff is amazing.  It gives your hair a healthy look but doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy in the least.  I even put it on my dogs and they are sleek as can be now.  You only need a few drops at a time.</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE FACE/BODY/HAIR OIL</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be thicker like other Argan Oils I hace bought!</li>
            <li> Argan Oil gave my hair a nice shine and softness without being too oily or slick.  Just a few drops in the palm of my hand was all that was needed to apply.  I would recommend this product as I have received numerous comments on how healthy my hair has started to look since using this product.</li>
            <li> I was really happy to try out Pure Body Naturals Argan Oil.  I was given the opportunity and the product to see how it worked for me for my honest testimonial of how it worked in my life, here it is.  I personally love that Argan Oil is a natural product that I can use in the place of treating my son&#x27;s eczema.  Being that it is 100% Pure Certified Organic I feel safer using it on his dry spots than using the prescription lotion that states it could burn the skin on the warning label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the boy starts getting a dry spot, I use Argan Oil right away.  I has been working great.  The patches stay away with consistent use.  The only hard part about using this oil is that I am putting it on a squiggling  year old boy who thinks he&#x27;s getting a beauty treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this Argan oil on my nails and hands. My nails were looking a little yellowish due to over use of the ole nail polish.  After using the argan oil, my nails have started to lose that dullness and the healthy glow is starting to shine through.  When I use it on my hands they instantly look much more rejuvenated.  It is an oil so I make sure I use it sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product as it has so many uses.  I especially&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would recommend this to anyone with eczema. relief</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this but my hairdresser said it was a must have for me.  Know it is the best.</li>
            <li> I use Argan Oil on my hair and in various hair cream concoctions on my natural hair. My hair is smoother, and my ends are in better condition. Argan Oil is definitely a staple in my hair routine, and this product by Pure Body Naturals is just what I needed. I had a pump from a bottle of Argan Oil I was finished with, so I used it with this bottle in order to perform the free product review. The quality of this Argan Oil is great.</li>
            <li> I know some of you use this alone but I added it to my favorite lotion and it was the perfect addition to my vit e cream and saves me a step instead of applying two different products</li>
            <li> There is nothing like this oil. I just bought it and I am using it for both hair and skin. It is too early to review the results for my skin, but my hair is more manageable and is so soft after just one use...well two, because I used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair first and saw the result which lead me to use it on my hair. I am a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I feel sure it is good oil, just not sure how much I will use it.</li>
            <li> Whoa. Seems like good Argan oil but it smells strongly like rotten fruit. Yuck. I had to cut it with my Zakia&#x27;s brand Argan because that one has no scent at all. I won&#x27;t be buying this again, despite the price. Can&#x27;t have my clients smelling like rotten fruit.</li>
            <li> I had never used this before.  I am completely impressed.  I put this on my dry skin immediately after cleansing before bed and in the a.m. under  my makeup.  I also use it very sparingly on the ends of my hair and it calms down the over processed, dry ends.  It is an oil that is not greasy.  I will always have this in my daily routine from now on.  I have recommended this brand of Argan oil to all my friends</li>
            <li> I use it for hair and it&#x27;s perfect for my frizz and ends. Moderate amounts on my thick hair makes it feel alive and healthy not greesy.</li>
            <li> Great price and great service from the shipper.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift, because I have some, and my daughter loves it.  She uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is not what I expected. It makes my hair greasy instead of smoothing, like Morrocan Oil.</li>
            <li> Delivery was extremely fast. Product as described for a good price too.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the price was right.</li>
            <li> I have used other argan oils, this is exactly the same thing. Only cheaper.</li>
            <li> This oil is just as good or better than the higher priced Argan oil, very light and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> I only started using it for a few days. So far so good. It came on time, and i apply it mostly in my hair and face.</li>
            <li> I added a few drops of argan oil to my moisturizer everyday and it is doing wonders keeping my face looking healthy and fresh.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with the hopes that it would offer some relief to my shoulder-length dry, brittle and fly away hair. No matter what product I used, be it shampoo, conditioner, leave-in conditioner, deep hair conditioners, coconut oil, you name it I&#x27;ve tried it, but my hair remained untamable and dry.  That is until I started using this product. I am not kidding, since the first application my hair has become manageable, it is no longer fly away and it is no longer dry and yucky looking. My hair is like it was when I was a teenager again! (I&#x27;m 60 years old now). I really do recommend you buy this product. It works people, it really and truly works!</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful.  Use it for my hair  and skin.</li>
            <li> High quality. Works well. Odor isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> Love the results of using this product  on my face!</li>
            <li> Use just 3 drops in my vinegar hair rinse, love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few days. I LOVE it. I&#x27;ve used MaryKay for many years. I liked it real well, but the cost is high. I thought I would give this a try. My face is SO SOFT and silky. It&#x27;s non greasy and it soaks right in to your skin. My daughter has seborrhea dermatitis and she has been using this also for a few days. Her red icheey patches are all cleared up. Her face looks like it glows now. Thank you for offering this product. I will order again when we get low. Oh by the way, you only need a small amount and it covers large areas. Plus it helps make my hair shinny. It doesn&#x27;t have the nutty smell.</li>
            <li> This oil as made a very big difference when I apply sparely to my hair. I have not begun to use it on my skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell that great but who cares...it is a great product. I&#x27;ve used it on both my skin and hair and I really like the results. I would definitely purchase again...a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I received the Pure Body Naturals Argan Oil for review.  It claims on the label to be a &amp;#34;miracle oil.&amp;#34;  I would say that is true due to its flexible use.  It can be used on skin, hair and nails.  I have to say the company is very generous as it provides the consumer wit a huge 4 oz bottle which will definitely last a long time, as a little goes a long way.  Both men and women can use it which is a nice feature.  It is pure argan oil, triple filtered and with all natural ingredients.  Using it makes you feel eco friendly and good for yourself.  I used it on my skin and was delighted with the smoothing effects.  I tend to have very dry skin in the winter and it really helped with the itchiness and dryness.  It also make my cuticles softer and smoother.  I would highly recommend this product as it can be used for many reasons.</li>
            <li> This 100% certified organic argan oil comes in a large 4 oz. amber glass bottle with an eye dropper. This keeps the product fresh and reduces contamination and oxidizing. The oil is silky smooth and applies easily. Only a small amount is needed and then it should be gently massaged into the hair, skin or nails. Immediately there is a soothing moisturizing, with dryness disappearing as the product is absorbed. I used this product for the dry ends on my hair and it worked very well and actually continued working even after I washed and conditioned my hair. It kept my dry ends from becoming frizzy and improved the overall texture. I also began using this Argan Oil on my winter-dry feet. It softened the calluses and kept my heels from cracking due to the dryness of the winter weather. With continued use my calluses seemed to shrink and become more like the surrounding skin. I plan to continue using it to prepare my feet for wearing summer sandals. A nice side benefit was that as I was applying the Argan oil to my hair and skin, it was also being absorbed by my nails and hands. Softness returned to my chapped hands and they seemed to heal. My cuticles softened and even my nails seemed less dry. I also used the Argan Oil on dry patches of my skin and face. It seemed to remove the dryness and even the slight wrinkles and tightness of my skin. This product is imported from Morocco and packaged in the USA. One warning is that the product, argan oil, is derived from tree nuts, so if you have nut allergies you may need to use caution. It is not tested on animals and is cruelty free. Once opened, the product remains fresh for 12 months. While your results may not be exactly like mine, I enjoyed using this product to repair my hair, skin and nails and do recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free to test and review. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Great product. This is the exact same organic , first pressed, raw argan oil that is sold for $100 and some. Because there is no celebrity name and expensive advertising attached , you get the best quality without paying top dollar. It works great. I use it head to toe and it is fantastic. My face and body are very happy in this skin parching weather. Why pay more for the same benefits ?</li>
            <li> My hands are surviving the cold weather better than they ever have! My nails are also stronger and not so brittle. I enjoy using a small amount as a facial moisturizer at night and around my eyes during the day, but felt that it gave me too much of a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; as a whole face moisturizer during the day. My face has cleared up considerably and the fine lines around my eyes are diminishing after a month of continuous use. I have very sensitive skin so this product is super gently even though it is very effective. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  Absorbs quickly - great product!</li>
            <li> I love this Argan oil! I have super dry skin and it has helped my face, neck, hands, &amp; hair so much. I apply this at night and here is what I do: I put about a dime size in my left palm.  I use my right hand to dip my pointer finger in and apply dots on my face &amp; neck.  Before spreading the oil on my face &amp; neck I massage what is left in my palm into my hands and cuticles.  Next I spread the dots I put on my face &amp; neck so the area is coated.  Lastly I run my hands through my hair focusing on the middle &amp; ends since that&#x27;s the most dry.  I find the oil distributes in the hair better if hair is damp.  A little of this product goes a very long way.  The oil itself is clear with light scent. The size of the bottle is great for the value.  Most facial products are 1-2 oz and this bottle is 4.  It will last a very long time even if you use it every day.  The bottle is a heavy glass and you dispense the oil with a dripper so you can easily control how much you are squeezing out.  I have been very satisfied with this product. #sponsored  For more product reviews visit www.SurveysByStephanie.Tumblr.com</li>
            <li> I use this for everything!!! When I get out of the shower, I use a little in my hair. I put it on my face, body &amp; massage into my nails. My skin just soaks it up!!! Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy &amp; doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> I have been going Argan oil crazy these last few days!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have used this as a lotion on my body, did a hair treatment , used it on my nails and also on my dry craking heels, elbows and knees.&lt;br /&gt;First I love the smell, its light and gentle and not overpowering like a few argan oils I have used.&lt;br /&gt;*For my hands this product was nice , i get hang nails a lot and this moisturized my entire hands. The oil isnt overly greasy and is absorbed into the skin easily and quickly&lt;br /&gt;*For my hair I did have to wash my hair twice to competely remove the oil but my hair was shinier and doing this tamed muy frizzy hair for the day.&lt;br /&gt;*For my dry parts this seems to last much longer than traditional lotion, it absorbs quickly but is more effective.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great argan product and for my dry crackly body this has endless possibilities! My bedtime routine has included this Argan oil with no complaints from my husband who hates fragrant strong smelling lotions and perfumes!</li>
            <li> It arrived in simple packaging along with a dropper. I  love that it had minimal packaging. It shows that the company is concerned about the overuse of packaging and the environment.  The label was easy to read and the company information is clearly labeled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s great for my hair. I can add justa  drop in my hair after washing it to add shine and ease the frizz. I also love that it makes my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent. It goes great with any shampoo/conditioner and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love using it on my skin. I have fairly good skin, but my elbows get dry and rough sometimes so I love being able to use a little argan oil to keep my skin soft and smooth. I use it on my elbows once a week and haven&#x27;t had any issues. It&#x27;s great for cracked feet as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using just a  dab on my daughter&#x27;s eczema and it does wonders. Her skin is no longer dry or itchy and she has stopped scratching all together. I&#x27;ve tried many eczema products and have never come across such amazing results. I know that I will continue to use Argan oil in our daily routine. It&#x27;s  definitely made a huge impact.</li>
            <li> I received one bottle of Pure Body Naturals Organic Argan Oil to review!  This is one of those perfect beauty oils that has numerous benefits.  Argan Oil helps to minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, plus it does NOT clog pores.  It&#x27;s a nice light oil that absorbs quickly into your skin, without making it feel greasy.  The best part of all is that it&#x27;s organic, with no additives or fillers, it&#x27;s all natural!  Argan Oil is definitely one of my favorite products and I would highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantageous of Using Argan Oil:&lt;br /&gt;•  Nourish and Revitalize Your Hair&lt;br /&gt;•  Moisturize and Hydrate Your Skin&lt;br /&gt;•  Strengthen Your Nails&lt;br /&gt;•  Treats Dry and Sensitive Skin&lt;br /&gt;•  Treats Eczema&lt;br /&gt;•  Reduces Fine Lines and Wrinkles</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels great</li>
            <li> If you have issues with dry skin, or like in my case eczema (or psoriasis ) this can help you for sure. Even without these issues this will give you nice shinny look of your skin. I apply this a few times a day and it isn&#x27;t very noticeable. If you like to go to a gym for example, then you know that sweating is not good for your eczema, so whenever I go to the gym I apply this to my face and IT HELPs, A LOT. I also use it Before going to bed, and in the mornings. By the time you get to school or your job it won&#x27;t be visible on your face. For ladies it might be different because you use make up, so I can only tell you from guys perspective.&lt;br /&gt;People with eczema and psoriasis understand how painful it can be, especially psychologically, so please give it a try. In worst  case scenario you  will &amp;#34;waste&amp;#34; $17, which is actually less if you spread it over 2-3 months depending of how often you use the oil.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is great,I use this with the lift wand .&lt;br /&gt;And it s even better than the argan oil that comes with the Lift wand.&lt;br /&gt;I even use this with the dermal roller and it really helps your skin heel faster,normally I look sunburned for 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the derma roller in the morning and then did the Lift wand and then covered my face with more argan oil .&lt;br /&gt;I woke up this morning and my face is clear no redness whatsoever. I will only buy this from now on.&lt;br /&gt;I also derma roller my hands  and they are slightly sunburned. But my hands look good ,I Can&#x27;t wait till this bottle is gone.&lt;br /&gt;I can only imagine. What&#x27;s my face and hands will look like. Buy this you will be glad you did&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s great oil but I Like this one better.&lt;br /&gt;It really sinks into your skin and smoothes out fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have been using argan oil for years, but from other brands. I didn&#x27;t think I would like this version since it is natural and doesn&#x27;t have the scent of many of the argan oil versions popular on the market. I immediately noticed a difference in my hair, which is very thick and tends to get frizzy..after blow drying it is smooth after using the oil and no greasy-ness or build up. I&#x27;ve also enjoyed using it as a moisturizer on my hands and feet. So nice! I don&#x27;t need to buy anything else. It is a multi-use product!</li>
            <li> Size is disappointing!!!! The size looks huge on the picture but it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  See my fine lines soften in a week.  Definitely will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this oil. Living in Wyoming where it seems you just cannot put on enough lotion because it doesn&#x27;t stay&lt;br /&gt;moisturized I&#x27;ll admit I was very skeptical! I put this on last night  and loved the lightness of the oil and  today my&lt;br /&gt;skin is still soft, and moisturized! I did NOT smell a odor, or any smell for that matter. But I do plan on adding the&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;jasmine sambac&amp;#34; essential oil just to make it smell lovely! No more lotions for me. I will write more in 30 days&lt;br /&gt; with a more concise review....but so far so fabulous!</li>
            <li> I like it and it works very well</li>
            <li> I heard about the benefits of argon oil on the radio and decided to see if I liked it. This was reasonably priced and had favorable reviews so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I love it. I use it every night after I clean my face and again in the morning before I apply makeup. I love it. It isn&#x27;t heavy but leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Smells strongly like rotting fruit. Unusable for retail blends with other oils unless cut with deodorized Argan. I guess that explains the price.</li>
            <li> Works GREAT. Smells just like a baby blueberry poop diaper.  It almost makes me gag.  I&#x27;m going to try adding some essential oils because it works so much better than other Argan oil that I&#x27;ve purchased but OH the smell.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product that dollar reviews.com let me enjoy and try I used this in my hair and nails..when I opened the bottle I was hoping a scent was there but yes nodda scent so don&#x27;t expect one..second I tried on hair for two days didn&#x27;t see a change it may take longer yet that&#x27;s OK..But man I used it on my nails on one hand man they look so shine y pretty definitely great for nails thanks</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this oil since I heard so many people raving about it. It was a bit pricey but well worth it. The smell is very sweet and it adds gorgeous shine to my hair. However I wouldn&#x27;t say this should be used for hot oil treatments. You could use it if you want to  mix oils for a hot oil treatment. I use this oil when my hair is dry and frizzy (it helps taming it) or after I use any heat products. I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I love this oil. Smells great and it comes with a top and a glass dropper. You get a lot for your money.</li>
            <li> Love smells really good too</li>
            <li> I believe this brand just lacks a bit of the quality I&#x27;ve used from a few other brands. I will still use it, just a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is my everything product. Dry hair, dry skin, scars, acne. I use it for everything with a derma roller and i have seen great results. Be consistent and you don&#x27;t need to grease the affected area down to make it effective.</li>
            <li> I did not like this oil. It&#x27;s very heavy and has a very off putting smell.</li>
            <li> I saw one ounce for sale for $12 at my local Target, this is four ounces for $15, plus it&#x27;s certified organic. You do the math. I put this into EVERYTHING. Shampoo, conditioner, bodywash, hair creams, lotions, and a few drops directly onto my face and neck area. I used to use evoo, I find that the argan oil works better at keeping my face moisturized and my skin seems more luminous. It does have a mild yeast-y scent, but that dissipates quickly. I just ordered another bottle just to have on hand, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and this oil in my opinion is better for wrinkles and hydration than the expensive products you buy at the Department stores.</li>
            <li> This is pure Argan oil. Out of the bottle, it has very little odor.  I used on my hands and they stayed soft all day. Even though I wash my hands several times during a day, I reapplied twice and my hands were still soft the next morning..  My cuticles stay soft and no hangnails.It is good for my hair too. My hair is long and very thick.  I put this on my hair while damp and no tangles.</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to use this oil!! The bottle is indeed huge!! Too excited right now!! Awesome service as usual amazon, and thanks to Pure Body Naturals for the product!! Will order again very soon!!</li>
            <li> great product for hair &amp; body</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had strong nails. Someone suggested this and I thought I would give it a try even though I doubted it would help. But it did! It&#x27;s especially good when you apply it right after filing your nails. The oil sinks in and keeps your nails from breaking and splitting. I haven&#x27;t used it on my hair or face but I might try that too. I&#x27;m just happy right now to have strong nails. I&#x27;ll be buying more soon.</li>
            <li> **I received this product in turn for an honest review. All opinions are my own.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I was super impressed with this product and the bottle is HUGE. I am really impressed only with the amount of product that I received but also with the quality. I have used various kinds of Argan oil before which had a heavy smell however this one does not. I am also thrilled with the larger bottle so I can not only have plenty to use for conditioning and treating my hair but I can also use it for a moisturizer for my dry feet as well as treating my cuticles which the cold winter air always butchers them. I also like adding a couple of drops to my bath to keep my body moisturized and a little goes a long way. My daughter has wavy hair and I also used to condition her hair and I have noticed that it is less frizzy and much shinier.  After using this I will never be without a bottle of Argan oil in the house.</li>
            <li> I love Argan Oil, especially when I can get&lt;br /&gt;It in a larger size. This works great for winter dry skin. It absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;and does not leave a greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it for a carrier oil for some essential oils such as Thieves, peppermint or french Lavender.</li>
            <li> Great oil at a great price! Packaged well and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> Happy to find this good value product. But as some other reviewers have said, when using argan oil for the first time, I was surprised to find it smelled like a zoo (a sour manure-like odor). Although the scent went away after using on my face, it wasn&#x27;t a particularly pleasant experience. I think I may get used to it, but I will have second thoughts about using as part of a beard oil formulation, as I have a feeling my brother would not care for the smell in that application. The dropper include with the shipment was a helpful addition. This might have to grow on me.</li>
            <li> I just got it, but so far I like it really well. Its very fast absorbing and has no smell to it. My face has been extremely dry all winter and after one use it&#x27;s feeling better already..</li>
            <li> Good service.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I personally couldn&#x27;t take the smell of this product. If you are sensitive to smells find an unscented Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> it smells bad! Can&#x27;t use it.  Waste of money</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the size. I have paid the same price for half the amount. Plus is 100% pure oil.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and everything. HOWEVER. This bottle smells like VOMIT...I don&#x27;t even know how to describe it..but the smell.&lt;br /&gt;It does goes away after about a minute, and it does not stain anywhere. The oil consistency is also very runny, compared to my Josie Maran and my Physician&#x27;s Formula Oil. Anyways I give it a four stars because I got a full refund, no hassle.</li>
