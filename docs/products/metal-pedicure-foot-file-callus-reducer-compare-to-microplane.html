            <li>Leaves feet smooth and tender.</li>
            <li>Excellent product to remove the dead skin off your feet!</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>I have found it works great on dry skin, no need to soak your feet.  </li>
            <li>It will save me money, which is so cool, because I&#x27;m a teacher, and our salaries were cut 10% this year.</li>
            <li>but  she wants to be able to replace the Blade part.</li>
            <li>Super, super sturdy, hard..excellent..salon quality.</li>
            <li>this file really  leaves your feet nice and smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t get too tender, as this level of effectiveness is not common in most foot files.</li>
            <li>Wish is was smaller, but my Dog is it effective.  </li>
            <li>Its cost a lot but its worth it..</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>Got my feet feeling soft and smooth in minutes!  </li>
            <li>well worth the risk to have feet  </li>
            <li>good tool and sharp don&#x27;t press</li>
            <li>It gets my feet super smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>I came right home and bought it.</li>
            <li>Works well on foot right after a bath or shower.</li>
            <li>Soak your feet first and use while wet-you cannot believe</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Just use as directed and you will be amazed at how much clean and soft your feet can be.</li>
            <li>I have pretty feet thanks to,this,files,</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t take off too much the first time.</li>
            <li>, it could be easy to file too deeply.</li>
            <li>This works better than anything I have ever tried on my dry heels, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried just about everything.</li>
            <li>Came fast and it really works..</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>Even my pedicurist wants one.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s stainless.</li>
            <li>It came packaged very well.</li>
            <li>It really shreds the calluses off of my heels.</li>
            <li>Really took off the calluses.</li>
            <li>my feeet are summer ready.</li>
            <li>Make sure to read instructions because it&#x27;s sharp...</li>
            <li>And it worked like a charm, although you can file too deep when you get excited about the callus disappearing.</li>
            <li>My feet feel brand new!</li>
            <li>This is the best all others are feeble especially in my heel area</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product..</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so effective and sharp, that I&#x27;d only recommend this for people with a lot of skin to remove.</li>
            <li>I had the microplane colossal and for sheer skin removal, it doesn&#x27;t compare to this Sunny.</li>
            <li>I mean really what could be more satisfying than scraping away dead skin that makes the South Dakota Badlands look moisturized.</li>
            <li>This is a good file, but you only need one like this if you have really thick skin.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product..just be careful to only go in one direction and not too hard..</li>
            <li>I pair mine with ProLinc Dry Heel Eliminator and ProLinc Callus Eliminator, which, when using all three together, make my feet feel super soft.</li>
            <li>Want that baby soft feel and look</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a professional quality file that gets the job done, this is it.</li>
            <li>This is a professional grade product.  </li>
            <li>Much better than previous purchases on similar items with smaller grates.  </li>
            <li>You could be done very quickly so be careful when you first use it</li>
            <li>I asked if this was sharp blades that cut, like a microplane, or a scraper, more like the Babiface Heavy Duty Metal Foot File Rasp.</li>
            <li>The file is sharp and should be used in one directions to avoid filing too deep, I can say with the right foot soak and</li>
            <li>my feet are incredibly soft after only one use&lt;br /&gt;amazing product</li>
            <li>But, this is exactly like a microplane--&amp;#34;cheese grater&amp;#34; style VERY sharp raised blades that cut, not a scraper.</li>

            <li> my feet are incredibly soft after only one use&lt;br /&gt;amazing product</li>
            <li> But, this is exactly like a microplane--&amp;#34;cheese grater&amp;#34; style VERY sharp raised blades that cut, not a scraper.</li>
            <li> Use this on dry feet outside or have a heavy duty vacuum at the ready for this monster.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this file, you will be amazed how your feet will feel when all the dead skin is gone.</li>
            <li> I was very reluctant to purchase because of the past experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest you just make one pass and take a close look before you keep scraping for a long time.</li>
            <li> If this can&#x27;t tear the old dead hide off your feet then you need to see a blacksmith.</li>
            <li> You just have to be careful that you don&#x27;t go too deep!</li>
            <li> So be careful when filing not to file to deep.</li>
            <li> I soak my feet (even though it says it can be used dry), and I do use a callus gel.</li>
            <li> I have horribly dry and callused feet.  </li>
            <li> As the package states, no need to soak, it will remove the skin when dry.</li>
            <li> A MUST HAVE for anyone that has problems with dry cracked heels.  </li>
            <li> then I suggest you spend those dull evenings you&#x27;ve been having with your new Metal Pedicure Foot File.</li>
            <li> Rub only up and down, never sideways because I think it could slice your skin.  </li>
            <li> Can use on wet or dry feet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so very sharp and the holes are larger than all other files &#x3D; longer blades.</li>
            <li> I have used many products that claim to file away the ugly callus and they never worked.</li>
            <li> Be careful though, it works so well</li>
            <li> Be careful not to overdo it because this file is not bashful about taking the skin off.  </li>
            <li> This foot file actually gets dead skin off.</li>
            <li> I have a rough pair of feet if I must say so myself.</li>
            <li> The first ones - the Microplace Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp - I absolutely hated.</li>
            <li> This is NOT for a basic pedicure where there is very little skin buildup.</li>
            <li> Like others have pointed out.....be careful!</li>
            <li> Tried other itty bitty files that couldn&#x27;t CUT it.</li>
            <li> I chose to,purchase this file after,having to,return a less expensive one, and it was the right choice.  </li>
            <li> This is VERY sharp so use carefully and follow the directions.  </li>
            <li> Works very well on a tough callus, and no more trips to the foot doc</li>
            <li> $16 down the tubes.</li>
            <li> Remember to file up and down..</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t share it with 1000 other people!</li>
            <li> If you want a microplane type cutting tool, this is very much like any other CUTTING callous remover for very thick callouses, so it might work for you (it is very large).</li>
            <li> If you been having problems with dead skin on your feet..</li>
            <li> The seller responded that it is a scraper like the Babiface Heavy Duty Metal Foot File Rasp, so I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Very sharp!</li>
            <li> This puppy got rid of every snaggy/cracky/crumbly bit of bad heel skin and my heels are like a baby&#x27;s butt right now.  </li>
            <li> I asked a very specific question before buying it because I did NOT want a sharp cutting blade like a microplane.</li>
            <li> In picture looks small</li>

            <li> I hope they never stop making this item it has done wonders for me. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I chose to,purchase this file after,having to,return a less expensive one, and it was the right choice.  Sturdy, well,made,and works beautifully.  I have pretty feet thanks to,this,files,</li>
            <li> Have owned a few but none can compare to this one!!! LOVE IT!!! Thank You!!!</li>
            <li> my feet are incredibly soft after only one use&lt;br /&gt;amazing product</li>
            <li> Wish is was smaller, but my Dog is it effective.  It&#x27;s a weapon!</li>
            <li> Came fast and it really works.. If you been having problems with dead skin on your feet.. I highly recommend this product.. Its cost a lot but its worth it..</li>
            <li> Wow, this is great- even better than the salons.  Nice size &amp; sturdy and the best part is you control when to stop not the technician and it really works. ALOT of calloused skin comes off with this gem and you don&#x27;t share it with 1000 other people!</li>
            <li> Works great and saves me a lot of money..not to mention that I no longer have to risk my health,going to get pedicures,were they and most of them don&#x27;t properly clean their equipment....this file really  leaves your feet nice and smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I mean really what could be more satisfying than scraping away dead skin that makes the South Dakota Badlands look moisturized. Want that baby soft feel and look then I suggest you spend those dull evenings you&#x27;ve been having with your new Metal Pedicure Foot File. Scrape out the old to bring in the new then buy those perfect pair of sandals to show them off. I did.</li>
            <li> On time and just as described</li>
            <li> Works very well on a tough callus, and no more trips to the foot doc</li>
            <li> Wow, this file is awesome.  Really works. Like others have pointed out.....be careful!</li>
            <li> I asked if this was sharp blades that cut, like a microplane, or a scraper, more like the Babiface Heavy Duty Metal Foot File Rasp. The seller responded that it is a scraper like the Babiface Heavy Duty Metal Foot File Rasp, so I purchased it. I asked a very specific question before buying it because I did NOT want a sharp cutting blade like a microplane. The foot file rasp I asked about for comparison can NOT cut you--a FILE does not cut, it scrapes. But, this is exactly like a microplane--&amp;#34;cheese grater&amp;#34; style VERY sharp raised blades that cut, not a scraper. Unfortunately, I had ordered it based on the seller&#x27;s answer before I saw that other users answered question saying it is sharp cutting blades. $16 down the tubes. If you want a microplane type cutting tool, this is very much like any other CUTTING callous remover for very thick callouses, so it might work for you (it is very large). It is NOT a foot file.</li>
            <li> Excellent product to remove the dead skin off your feet! Perfect in between my pedicures. I highly recommend this file, you will be amazed how your feet will feel when all the dead skin is gone.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Much better than previous purchases on similar items with smaller grates.  Be careful though, it works so well, it could be easy to file too deeply.</li>
            <li> I have terribly callused feet that are hard to keep smooth. The last time I got a pedicure, they told me about this file. I came right home and bought it. Best purchase ever. I use it once a week. I soak my feet (even though it says it can be used dry), and I do use a callus gel. It gets my feet super smooth and soft! I&#x27;m thrilled!</li>
            <li> Wow-does this thing work!  Even after a salon pedicure, I am always disappointed in the non-smooth heel situation.  Summer sandals make it even worse.  This puppy got rid of every snaggy/cracky/crumbly bit of bad heel skin and my heels are like a baby&#x27;s butt right now.  Amazing.  Soak your feet first and use while wet-you cannot believe how much you &amp;#34;grate&amp;#34; off those awful heels.  Buy it-trust me on this-buy it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth it. Best money ever spent.</li>
            <li> good tool and sharp don&#x27;t press let tool do it&#x27;s job</li>
            <li> Works well on foot right after a bath or shower.</li>
            <li> I have horribly dry and callused feet.  I was getting a pedicure every week to get the awful skin filed off my feet.  It was costing me a LOT of money.  I noticed that the nail techs used a file like this one, so I ordered it.  It was amazing! Got my feet feeling soft and smooth in minutes!  It will save me money, which is so cool, because I&#x27;m a teacher, and our salaries were cut 10% this year.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best invention I have found for treating dry, cracked feet. I have never used any thing that has helped me get rid of the Callus on my feet until I came across this product . Just use as directed and you will be amazed at how much clean and soft your feet can be.</li>
            <li> This is very effective. It&#x27;s so effective and sharp, that I&#x27;d only recommend this for people with a lot of skin to remove. It&#x27;s so very sharp and the holes are larger than all other files &#x3D; longer blades. I&#x27;d suggest you just make one pass and take a close look before you keep scraping for a long time. If you are used to using others that required you to make several passes, like the style used in nail salons, just know that this one will not require all that labor at all. You could be done very quickly so be careful when you first use it so you don&#x27;t get too tender, as this level of effectiveness is not common in most foot files. I know because I&#x27;ve tried most of them out there. As the package states, no need to soak, it will remove the skin when dry. This is a good file, but you only need one like this if you have really thick skin. This is NOT for a basic pedicure where there is very little skin buildup.</li>
            <li> Received it in a timely manner... works good... nothinv to complain about.</li>
            <li> I love it. The place I get pedicures at uses this. It allows me to go longer between visits.</li>
            <li> Very good. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> It is an exceptional product which I strongly recommend</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  Even my pedicurist wants one.</li>
            <li> This file is the truth! If you&#x27;re looking for a professional quality file that gets the job done, this is it.</li>
            <li> This is THE ONE. Rips thru callouses like cheese thru a grater. Tried other itty bitty files that couldn&#x27;t CUT it. Just be careful not to go to far.</li>
            <li> Omg..omg..if this don&#x27;t take off your corns and callus ..nothing will. Make sure to read instructions because it&#x27;s sharp...so take time..This is the best file ever. I think it&#x27;s stainless. In picture looks small but it&#x27;s the largest file I&#x27;ve seen. Super, super sturdy, hard..excellent..salon quality. Don&#x27;t think it could ever break!!! Remember to file up and down..never crossway. Can use on wet or dry feet.  I prefer doing after I shower. I will order 5 more for family.  Worth the price!</li>
            <li> This product arrived faster then I thought it would. It came packaged very well. Upon use of this product it&#x27;s everything that I thought it would be and more. I would order this again.</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered..now i can do my own pedicure..when i cant get a appointment..</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  Discovered this item while paying $$$ for a salon pedicure.  When I commented to the technician that it worked great and I needed to get one for myself, his response was &amp;#34;no, you don&#x27;t need one, you can just keep coming here for us to do the work&amp;#34;  This is VERY sharp so use carefully and follow the directions.  Rub only up and down, never sideways because I think it could slice your skin.  This works better than anything I have ever tried on my dry heels, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried just about everything. I have found it works great on dry skin, no need to soak your feet.  But, I believe it would work either way.  A MUST HAVE for anyone that has problems with dry cracked heels.  Mine will never be bad again!</li>
            <li> If this can&#x27;t tear the old dead hide off your feet then you need to see a blacksmith. It really shreds the calluses off of my heels. I had the microplane colossal and for sheer skin removal, it doesn&#x27;t compare to this Sunny. Be careful not to overdo it because this file is not bashful about taking the skin off.  I will definitely purchase again. A+. Use this on dry feet outside or have a heavy duty vacuum at the ready for this monster.</li>
            <li> It was actually amazing. Really took off the calluses. Worked great in the shower.</li>
            <li> The best  callus remover I have ever purchased. Better than pumice stones, exfoliation scrubs, callus removal gels... Immediate results, great for heels, balls of feet, but I use great care around my toes... well worth the risk to have feet  this fabulous. Just go light so you don&#x27;t take off too much the first time.</li>
            <li> It is a fine foot file that my friend uses that I bought it for as she likes to use it.  There are suppose to be replaceable \\&quot;blades\\&quot; for this file but I have not been able to find any for her. The file is made by Sunny.  The handle and metal bracket are ok but  she wants to be able to replace the Blade part.</li>
            <li> Just saved  myself money by not having to go and get a pedicure.  I do it my myself at home!  Gets the job done very quickly!</li>
            <li> This is the best foot file ever! It works just like the one used at the nail shop I go to! Well...used to go to - now that I have this, I can save my $30 and do a salon pedicure at home! I also use the ProLinc callus remover (as suggested by another reviewer) and also FootWorks exfoliating foot scrub by Avon. My feet feel brand new!</li>
            <li> Works good. Very nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product..just be careful to only go in one direction and not too hard..</li>
            <li> This is the best all others are feeble especially in my heel area</li>
            <li> This is the second style of foot rasp I have bought from this company. The first ones - the Microplace Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp - I absolutely hated. They didn&#x27;t scrape off any skin and they only scratched my feet and made them rougher. This foot file actually gets dead skin off. You just have to be careful that you don&#x27;t go too deep! I pair mine with ProLinc Dry Heel Eliminator and ProLinc Callus Eliminator, which, when using all three together, make my feet feel super soft.</li>
            <li> Best thing since sliced bread. The file is just that a file used to rid ones foot of callus. I have a rough pair of feet if I must say so myself. I have used many products that claim to file away the ugly callus and they never worked. I was very reluctant to purchase because of the past experience. However, I gave it a try. I was very pleased with the outcome. Once I soaked my foot for about 10 mintues I filed away. And it worked like a charm, although you can file too deep when you get excited about the callus disappearing. So be careful when filing not to file to deep. The file is sharp and should be used in one directions to avoid filing too deep, I can say with the right foot soak and this file my feeet are summer ready.</li>
            <li> Good pedicure foot file, ordered another one already.</li>
            <li> This tool is AWESOME.  Last time I had a pedicure the girl used this for my feet.  So I wanted one just like it for between pedicures.  This thing takes all the dead skin off your feet and the best thing is, it will not cut you like those razors can.</li>
            <li> Love this item, my salon that i go and get pedicures from uses this product.</li>
            <li> Very sharp! Leaves feet smooth and tender. the grate/files are  better than microplane</li>
            <li> This is a professional grade product.  Works great.</li>
