    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This 4 oz tube is perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with both.  </li>
            <li>My teeth and gums are in excellent condition.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just great.</li>
            <li>The taste is great and it does whitens teeth as I have noticed on myself.</li>
            <li>I had heard nothing but good things about this product, thus I picked some up to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>It is really amazing.</li>
            <li>Also, this toothpaste has a nice taste and smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since most people are embarrassed to do so, you have to take matters into your own hands.  </li>
            <li>, my teeth are far from being perfect.</li>
            <li>it helps keep them clean and bright too</li>
            <li>but the best part for me was the amazing and long-lasting refreshing taste it left in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Maybe in a month or two I&#x27;ll notice more of a change?  </li>
            <li>I think this toothpaste works more as a preventive measure, rather than a whitening agent.  </li>
            <li>I use dentist provided calcium phosphate toothpaste most of the time and use the Crest just to touch  up my front top and bottom teeth or when I have run out of my special toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>The cap can still be put on, but it is now a separate piece that can be lost easily.</li>
            <li>First impression was very good: in the very first week or maybe two, my teeth became more white, and teeth became more shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>: This package is 4 tubes of Crest Vivid, and offers the best deal (price-wise) on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>took a photo of my teeth on day 1, and expected to be able to post a day 10 picture with great results.</li>
            <li>We only use this toothpaste once a day at night and it has still worked great.  </li>
            <li>I do recommend it for maintaining a whitened smile however!</li>
            <li>really clean-</li>
            <li>I love the minty-ness, and it certainly whitened my teeth.</li>
            <li>may better results if you first use 3D Whitestrips to get your teeth nice and white.  </li>
            <li>yes this is a great toothpaste you will see the difference in a week to 14days as it says but get the other strips to whiten too</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I do think this paste helps eliminate some surface stains via a mild abrasive, it&#x27;s not a miracle cure that will whiten your teeth quickly.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste doesn&#x27;t get rid of 80% of the stains even after 3 months but it is more effective than other whitening toothpastes</li>
            <li>I can say is that I like the fresh mint flavor of this paste.</li>
            <li>i dont think it&#x27;s worth the money and increasing my teeth sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite toothpaste, by far.</li>
            <li>and if I do, but for now, suffice to say I plan on continuing to use Crest Vivid as my daily fluoride toothpaste because it makes my breath fresh and my mouth feel good - not because of its whitening properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always go to Amazon first to see if they have something I can&#x27;t find.</li>
            <li>I have been using this Crest product since it first came out years ago.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste, am on my second tube.</li>
            <li>This is another good product that can&#x27;t find in the drug stores in the 4 small towns around here.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly update this review when</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to use both to make them white.  </li>
            <li>I threw away the Crest 3D White Advanced returned to Mentadent about a month ago.  </li>
            <li>The teeth are much whiter now when compared to a couple of months before.  </li>
            <li>My goal: to &#x27;whiten&#x27; my front teeth, which have appeared darker in recent years, as aging and more frequent coffee drinks have taken their toll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first started using this toothpaste post-whitening treatment to prevent new stains.</li>
            <li>Better than other toothpaste brands I tried.</li>
            <li>When you have something in your teeth or your teeth are just a little off-color; your lucky if someone is kind enough to pull you aside and let you know.  </li>
            <li>The level of whitening in any toothpaste is never as high as a whitestrip; however, after I brush my teeth seem much whiter.     </li>
            <li>When I started to brush my teeth with this Crest 3D Vivid toothpaste, I also started to feel how much the mouth and teeth can be freshened with a toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I am strongly recommending other people to use this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>At the same time, it&#x27;s just really fresh, not overpowering if you want to eat or drink soon after.</li>
            <li>I have got a new experience and feelings.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been brushing with Crest Vivid for 10 days, 3 times a day and have not noticed any gum irritation (I&#x27;m prone to it and cannot use the whitening strips because of it...)</li>
            <li>My first tube of this I threw out because towards the end I was only getting one chamber.</li>
            <li>I usually do squeeze the tube from the bottom and try to make sure its even when it comes out, but that didnt seem to help.</li>
            <li>I really attribute the current healthy whiteness of my teeth to this toothpaste, as nothing else in my routine has changed in the past four months.  </li>
            <li>I can clearly see the difference before and after using it.&lt;br /&gt;Get</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry, we do brush at least twice a day f.y.i.  :)</li>
            <li>after using it for 3 months, my teeth became sensitive to cold/hot temperatures.  </li>
            <li>If you want to maintain your white smile, use this toothpaste regularly.</li>
            <li>I use the Vivid White Day in the daytime and Vivid White Night at night.  </li>
            <li>But at least it helps a bit (and I doubt it&#x27;s possible to deal with my teeth with only toothpaste - but probably magic wand would help).</li>
            <li>It could be my lack of skill as a photographer, but really, to the naked eye, not much</li>
            <li>They are surprised to find that I get the same results with regular use of Crest 3D.  </li>
            <li>Within a few weeks, those people that wouldn&#x27;t say anything if you had the ugliest smile in the world were suddenly paying my complements and asking where I went to have my teeth bleached.  </li>
            <li>Having become cynical about whitening claims, especially ones citing quick results, I was quite pleasantly surprised to find my teeth noticeably whiter and more youthful looking by the time half the tube had been used up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Crest Vivid White for God knows how long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, when purchasing it for the 1st time, it cost me less than $9 (via Subscribe &amp; Save), now price is about $15 - which is just too much.</li>

            <li> While using the product daily, I had 2 episodes lasting a few days where my gums became very sensitive in some spots and bled when I brushed.  </li>
            <li> Just the right amount to last for a few trips without running out, but small enough to not take up a lot of room.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s saying a lot because I get bored easily and tend to switch products every time it&#x27;s time to restock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I really like this brand, but it is expensive at the drug store for just one...</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this toothpaste is the tube.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over a year and a half and my dentist always says I don&#x27;t need to whiten.  </li>
            <li> Much less work than the strips.  </li>
            <li> but it does brighten it up a little.</li>
            <li> my teeth became a little whiter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dual-chamber tube, and when you get to the bottom of it, it starts to come out unevenly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m coffee drinker and tobacco smoker in the past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a daily coffee/tea drinker and usually have really bad discoloration on the backs of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The hinge on the cap is very thin and within 1 week it broke off.</li>

            <li> This 4 oz tube is perfect for traveling. Just the right amount to last for a few trips without running out, but small enough to not take up a lot of room. The only complaint I have with this tootpaste is the cap. The hinge on the cap is very thin and within 1 week it broke off. The cap can still be put on, but it is now a separate piece that can be lost easily.</li>
            <li> I csnnot keep my teeth white without this toothpaste.  I have been using it for over a year and a half and my dentist always says I don&#x27;t need to whiten.  He also says this product will not hurt your teeth. I use the Vivid White Day in the daytime and Vivid White Night at night.  It&#x27;s important to use both to make them white.  This is another good product that can&#x27;t find in the drug stores in the 4 small towns around here.  Thank goodness for Amazon.  I always go to Amazon first to see if they have something I can&#x27;t find.</li>
            <li> I had heard nothing but good things about this product, thus I picked some up to give it a try. My goal: to &#x27;whiten&#x27; my front teeth, which have appeared darker in recent years, as aging and more frequent coffee drinks have taken their toll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a photo of my teeth on day 1, and expected to be able to post a day 10 picture with great results. Well, I took the photos and frankly, I can&#x27;t see a difference - so I didn&#x27;t post them.  It could be my lack of skill as a photographer, but really, to the naked eye, not much change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can say is that I like the fresh mint flavor of this paste. After brushing my teeth feel smoother, like they&#x27;ve been polished, but without the gritty residue you get after a dental hygenist does it. I&#x27;ve been brushing with Crest Vivid for 10 days, 3 times a day and have not noticed any gum irritation (I&#x27;m prone to it and cannot use the whitening strips because of it...) or tooth sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I do think this paste helps eliminate some surface stains via a mild abrasive, it&#x27;s not a miracle cure that will whiten your teeth quickly. Maybe in a month or two I&#x27;ll notice more of a change?  I will certainly update this review when and if I do, but for now, suffice to say I plan on continuing to use Crest Vivid as my daily fluoride toothpaste because it makes my breath fresh and my mouth feel good - not because of its whitening properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This package is 4 tubes of Crest Vivid, and offers the best deal (price-wise) on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/22/10:  I continue to use this product, which has now been repackaged as Crest 3D White.  I still like how it makes me teeth/mouth feel, and I&#x27;ve not noticed any stains accumulating on my teeth, but no appreciable lightening or whitening has occurred with continued use.  I do recommend it for maintaining a whitened smile however!</li>
            <li> My fiance and I had seen a noticeable difference in using this toothpaste, in addition to Listerine whitening mouthwash.  We only use this toothpaste once a day at night and it has still worked great.  Don&#x27;t worry, we do brush at least twice a day f.y.i.  :)</li>
            <li> After using this product for a month, I did not see a difference on my teeth at all. I went back to whitestrips, which actually work on my teeth.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste doesn&#x27;t get rid of 80% of the stains even after 3 months but it is more effective than other whitening toothpastes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest Vivid White for God knows how long. It&#x27;s just great. I can clearly see the difference before and after using it.&lt;br /&gt;Get this pack! It&#x27;s an unbeatable deal.</li>
            <li> I noticed a bit of difference in my teeth. Not drastic- but it does brighten it up a little. It makes my mouth feel really clean- unlike prohealth which I have never been fond of.</li>
            <li> I think this toothpaste works more as a preventive measure, rather than a whitening agent.  I started using this the day I got my teeth deep cleaned at the dentist four months ago.  I still have no stains on my teeth.  I&#x27;m a daily coffee/tea drinker and usually have really bad discoloration on the backs of my teeth.  I really attribute the current healthy whiteness of my teeth to this toothpaste, as nothing else in my routine has changed in the past four months.  I use this only in the morning and use Pro Health Enamel Shield at night to prevent further enamel loss (which I have pretty badly).  I&#x27;m very happy with both.  I&#x27;ll be buying this again when my current tube is empty.  That&#x27;s saying a lot because I get bored easily and tend to switch products every time it&#x27;s time to restock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may better results if you first use 3D Whitestrips to get your teeth nice and white.  Then use this toothpaste to maintain the whiteness afterwards.</li>
            <li> When you have something in your teeth or your teeth are just a little off-color; your lucky if someone is kind enough to pull you aside and let you know.  Since most people are embarrassed to do so, you have to take matters into your own hands.  I have been using this Crest product since it first came out years ago.  Within a few weeks, those people that wouldn&#x27;t say anything if you had the ugliest smile in the world were suddenly paying my complements and asking where I went to have my teeth bleached.  They are surprised to find that I get the same results with regular use of Crest 3D.  Let me end by saying, I can claim same results because I had my teeth bleached when I was a teenager and this toothpaste has brought back that same level of white that I had over fifteen years ago.</li>
            <li> I really like this brand, but it is expensive at the drug store for just one...I can get 4 for the price of 1 on line and avoid the store!</li>
            <li> after using it for 3 months, my teeth became sensitive to cold/hot temperatures.  my teeth became a little whiter.  i dont think it&#x27;s worth the money and increasing my teeth sensitivity.  not buying again.</li>
            <li> Having become cynical about whitening claims, especially ones citing quick results, I was quite pleasantly surprised to find my teeth noticeably whiter and more youthful looking by the time half the tube had been used up.  My husband noticed!  I don&#x27;t have sparkling white toothpaste model teeth - but they do look whiter, shiny and healthier.  I use dentist provided calcium phosphate toothpaste most of the time and use the Crest just to touch  up my front top and bottom teeth or when I have run out of my special toothpaste.  Agree with others that it is a tasty good-feeling toothpaste as well. I am very satisfied.  Much less work than the strips.  No sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> I purchased Crest 3D White Advanced toothpaste and used it twice a day for approximately 3 weeks.  While using the product daily, I had 2 episodes lasting a few days where my gums became very sensitive in some spots and bled when I brushed.  This has never happened before.  My teeth and gums are in excellent condition.  The only change I have made which I believe could trigger this is the toothpaste.  I have been using Mentadent for years without problems.    I threw away the Crest 3D White Advanced returned to Mentadent about a month ago.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems since.</li>
            <li> I gotta say it does what it says it should. The taste is great and it does whitens teeth as I have noticed on myself. Better than other toothpaste brands I tried. If you want to maintain your white smile, use this toothpaste regularly.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste, am on my second tube. I love the minty-ness, and it certainly whitened my teeth. The level of whitening in any toothpaste is never as high as a whitestrip; however, after I brush my teeth seem much whiter.     My only complaint about this toothpaste is the tube. It&#x27;s a dual-chamber tube, and when you get to the bottom of it, it starts to come out unevenly. My first tube of this I threw out because towards the end I was only getting one chamber. I usually do squeeze the tube from the bottom and try to make sure its even when it comes out, but that didnt seem to help. Oh well, I guess if the toothpaste works thats one thing I can deal with.     I&#x27;ll definitely be using this toothpaste for a while.</li>
            <li> I first started using this toothpaste post-whitening treatment to prevent new stains. It seemed to work well but the best part for me was the amazing and long-lasting refreshing taste it left in my mouth. Even through the Listerine that I use after brushing. At the same time, it&#x27;s just really fresh, not overpowering if you want to eat or drink soon after. This is my favorite toothpaste, by far.</li>
            <li> The teeth are much whiter now when compared to a couple of months before.  Using it regularly and twice a day is recommended. Probably will use them in the future to.</li>
            <li> First impression was very good: in the very first week or maybe two, my teeth became more white, and teeth became more shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m coffee drinker and tobacco smoker in the past, my teeth are far from being perfect. But at least it helps a bit (and I doubt it&#x27;s possible to deal with my teeth with only toothpaste - but probably magic wand would help). Also, this toothpaste has a nice taste and smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when purchasing it for the 1st time, it cost me less than $9 (via Subscribe &amp; Save), now price is about $15 - which is just too much.</li>
            <li> When I started to brush my teeth with this Crest 3D Vivid toothpaste, I also started to feel how much the mouth and teeth can be freshened with a toothpaste. It is really amazing. I have got a new experience and feelings. I am strongly recommending other people to use this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> yes this is a great toothpaste you will see the difference in a week to 14days as it says but get the other strips to whiten too it helps keep them clean and bright too</li>
