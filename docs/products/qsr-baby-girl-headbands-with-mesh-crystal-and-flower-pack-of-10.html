            <li>So pretty and nice packaging.</li>
            <li>They are super cute and the colors complement almost every outfit.</li>
            <li>Super cute</li>
            <li>The colors are accurate.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t comfortable with my infant wearing them as they came.  </li>
            <li>They fit my baby at 0 months, and still at 7 months.  </li>
            <li>they still fit but</li>
            <li>Fantastic color choices --</li>
            <li>Super cute and just the right size!</li>
            <li>So clean</li>
            <li>They are nice and soft and stretchy so they do not leave marks on her head.</li>
            <li>A pearl fell off one of these headbands and customer service was quick to respond to my concern.  </li>
            <li>Luckily it was in my hand and not my baby&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li>I like them so much very nice,im a 24 years old women i love head band ,its my style love it</li>
            <li>Exactly what I I was hoping for &amp; you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li>Pretty!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and then some.  </li>
            <li>WOW that&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li>Worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Right after I ordered these headbands, my card information was being used in another country.  </li>
            <li>was delivered, on time, as ordered and right packaging size.</li>
            <li>Fit my newborn (7 months) as well as my older girls (3-5yo).</li>
            <li>My girls love the variety of colors, they fit both my 8mth old and 5yr old with no problems.</li>
            <li>and they fit my 6 month old prefect!</li>
            <li>This is such a great deal on these fabulous little hair bows.  </li>
            <li>Love these they don&#x27;t leave marks and are stretchy but not too big</li>
            <li>Pretty headbands.</li>
            <li>They are nicely made and stay placed without slipping.  </li>
            <li>They all look exact to the pictures shown in description.  </li>
            <li>They also all had hot glue strings stuck all over them that I had to pick off.</li>
            <li>Cuter in real life than they look in the pictures!</li>
            <li>Lots of colors and soft fit.</li>
            <li>They are true to color as shown in the picture, they&#x27;re all very soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>I bought these originally as a stocking stuffer for her stocking but couldn&#x27;t help myself and used them early.</li>
            <li>some are not put on tight but overall for the price they are great</li>
            <li>Would be nice if there was a little variation in style.</li>
            <li>Not very elegant so didnt use them for a wedding but for weekends and everyday outfits they&#x27;re perfect</li>
            <li>Look very fancy for the price</li>
            <li>For the price I paid, I guess I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>so now that she is old enough to actually mouth them, I make sure they are secure before I put the headband on.  </li>
            <li>They are so darn cute that I am considering reordering the whole thing again just to get the pink headband, as a plus, the headbands are individually wrapped so I&#x27;ll give the extra headbands away as gifts :)</li>
            <li>The design is not bad but would prefer a different type of chiffon that did not look frayed on the edge.</li>
            <li>My niece loves these for her new baby!  </li>
            <li>These are extremely cute and comfy on my little one&#x27;s picky skin.</li>
            <li>Soo adorable &amp; not cheap looking at all.</li>
            <li>As such,  I reinforced every single one with more glue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given these to new mommies of daughters twice, and they were a hit both times.</li>
            <li>I Messaged the seller to see if I could get new ones of the 3 that were falling apart since I wanted them for a photo session and no luck yet.</li>
            <li>They fit my daughter perfectly - they don&#x27;t dig into her head and leave nasty marks.</li>
            <li>I did not give them 5 stars because one of the pearls fell off the red on the first time she wore it.</li>
            <li>and I had to hot glue them back on.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to check for those dried up glue pieces before putting it on your baby girl!</li>
            <li>Other than that love it can be used on babies and big girls.</li>
            <li>They fit her head snuggly without being too tight, but also seem like they have a quite a bit of stretch in them</li>
            <li>The flower is a bright yellow and the band is a yellow orange color, which will make it hard to match and/or coordinate with outfits.</li>
            <li>old daughter...</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t even get them on my 2 year old.</li>
            <li>and so I&#x27;ve naturally bought as well as received gifts of all kinds of headbands.</li>
            <li>Fit very well without slipping or being too tight.</li>
            <li>they are very high quality and last a long time.</li>
            <li>The actual bands were different sizes within the bunch &amp; I didn&#x27;t really like the fact that I could see clumps of dried up hot glue.</li>
            <li>So cheaply made it&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li>Go to a craft store and buy the supplies (using better materials than this cheap crap) and make it yourself.</li>

            <li> I like them so much very nice,im a 24 years old women i love head band ,its my style love it</li>
            <li> Exactly what I I was hoping for &amp; you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Pretty!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and then some.  </li>
            <li> WOW that&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> Worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Right after I ordered these headbands, my card information was being used in another country.  </li>
            <li> was delivered, on time, as ordered and right packaging size.</li>
            <li> Fit my newborn (7 months) as well as my older girls (3-5yo).</li>
            <li> My girls love the variety of colors, they fit both my 8mth old and 5yr old with no problems.</li>
            <li> and they fit my 6 month old prefect!</li>
            <li> This is such a great deal on these fabulous little hair bows.  </li>
            <li> Love these they don&#x27;t leave marks and are stretchy but not too big</li>
            <li> Pretty headbands.</li>
            <li> They are nicely made and stay placed without slipping.  </li>
            <li> They all look exact to the pictures shown in description.  </li>
            <li> They also all had hot glue strings stuck all over them that I had to pick off.</li>
            <li> Cuter in real life than they look in the pictures!</li>
            <li> Lots of colors and soft fit.</li>
            <li> They are true to color as shown in the picture, they&#x27;re all very soft and pretty.</li>
            <li> I bought these originally as a stocking stuffer for her stocking but couldn&#x27;t help myself and used them early.</li>
            <li> some are not put on tight but overall for the price they are great</li>
            <li> Would be nice if there was a little variation in style.</li>
            <li> Not very elegant so didnt use them for a wedding but for weekends and everyday outfits they&#x27;re perfect</li>
            <li> Look very fancy for the price</li>
            <li> For the price I paid, I guess I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> so now that she is old enough to actually mouth them, I make sure they are secure before I put the headband on.  </li>
            <li> They are so darn cute that I am considering reordering the whole thing again just to get the pink headband, as a plus, the headbands are individually wrapped so I&#x27;ll give the extra headbands away as gifts :)</li>
            <li> The design is not bad but would prefer a different type of chiffon that did not look frayed on the edge.</li>
            <li> My niece loves these for her new baby!  </li>
            <li> These are extremely cute and comfy on my little one&#x27;s picky skin.</li>
            <li> Soo adorable &amp; not cheap looking at all.</li>
            <li> As such,  I reinforced every single one with more glue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given these to new mommies of daughters twice, and they were a hit both times.</li>
            <li> I Messaged the seller to see if I could get new ones of the 3 that were falling apart since I wanted them for a photo session and no luck yet.</li>
            <li> They fit my daughter perfectly - they don&#x27;t dig into her head and leave nasty marks.</li>
            <li> I did not give them 5 stars because one of the pearls fell off the red on the first time she wore it.</li>
            <li> and I had to hot glue them back on.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to check for those dried up glue pieces before putting it on your baby girl!</li>
            <li> Other than that love it can be used on babies and big girls.</li>
            <li> They fit her head snuggly without being too tight, but also seem like they have a quite a bit of stretch in them</li>
            <li> The flower is a bright yellow and the band is a yellow orange color, which will make it hard to match and/or coordinate with outfits.</li>
            <li> old daughter...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even get them on my 2 year old.</li>
            <li> and so I&#x27;ve naturally bought as well as received gifts of all kinds of headbands.</li>
            <li> Fit very well without slipping or being too tight.</li>
            <li> they are very high quality and last a long time.</li>
            <li> The actual bands were different sizes within the bunch &amp; I didn&#x27;t really like the fact that I could see clumps of dried up hot glue.</li>
            <li> So cheaply made it&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Go to a craft store and buy the supplies (using better materials than this cheap crap) and make it yourself.</li>
            <li> I hope they last since I plan to use them for a long time!</li>
            <li> they were pretty but just too tight for a little baby.</li>
            <li> Totally different then ordering other similar like items from overseas manufacturing and would either fall apart or dies fade immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> She was almost 2 months old around Christmas time and they had a lot of trouble staying on her head (too loose).</li>
            <li> The price is goid and the headbands look way expensive! :)</li>
            <li> and the bands are too small even for my 9 month old.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I ordered the solid headbands, and one of the headbands is two different colors.</li>
            <li> only used about half &amp; my baby is 6 mo</li>
            <li> Not what i Expected</li>
            <li> the package arrived several headbands were missing the pearls/rhinestones.</li>
            <li> Be careful with the beads.</li>
            <li> never felt like i was looking at the same bow everyday!</li>
            <li> I have a baby girl due soon</li>
            <li> The missing pieces had come loose and we&#x27;re in the package</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> would have at least like to have worn it once before I had to start gluing parts back on.</li>
            <li> Way to tight for my 6 mos.</li>
            <li> I also feel like they were a little scrunched in the packaging.</li>
            <li> As others have commented the little beads will come off,</li>
            <li> As another review stated, these bows look expensive, but are only about $1.50 a bow.....</li>
            <li> Parents are putting these on the heads of small children.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> They had glue all over them and looked bad.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> These are absolutely gorgeous!</li>
            <li> I love these always so cute on my daughter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given these to new mommies of daughters twice, and they were a hit both times.</li>
            <li> I just love these headbands. Lovely and durable</li>
            <li> These look great on my 4 month old!  They are a great size and will fit her for a while.</li>
            <li> i bought this when my daughter was 4 or 5 months. she is 16 months now and we still haven&#x27;t used them all! they are very high quality and last a long time. great variety of colors and the make every outfit of hers look so dressy! couldn&#x27;t recommend more for variety, and although they are all the same but in different colors they never did look monotonous, and always fit every outfit just perfectly! never felt like i was looking at the same bow everyday!</li>
            <li> I bought these headbands for my 10 month old and they are just perfect. They fit her head snuggly without being too tight, but also seem like they have a quite a bit of stretch in them so she&#x27;ll be able to wear them for a while.  They are super cute and the colors complement almost every outfit. I did not give them 5 stars because one of the pearls fell off the red on the first time she wore it. I also feel like they were a little scrunched in the packaging. Overall I&#x27;d definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> These bows are very cute. They arrived perfectly without any damage (none of the beads had fallen off in shipping). They are an excellent deal for the money.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I I was hoping for &amp; you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> These bows are super cute! They didn&#x27;t leave a mark on my daughters head and they photograph so nicely! !</li>
            <li> These were perfect, all the colors were absolutely ideal for every outfit. Great value for how many you get. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> These headbands are perfect!! Super cute and just the right size! They are nice and soft and stretchy so they do not leave marks on her head. Great price for 10 adorable headbands. A great variety of colors to go with any outfit!! LOVE them!!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and then some.  These bows are inexpensive, yet very cute.  As another review stated, these bows look expensive, but are only about $1.50 a bow.....WOW that&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> These are extremely cute and comfy on my little one&#x27;s picky skin. They are so darn cute that I am considering reordering the whole thing again just to get the pink headband, as a plus, the headbands are individually wrapped so I&#x27;ll give the extra headbands away as gifts :)</li>
            <li> Way to tight for my 6 mos. old daughter...I returned the bows....they were pretty but just too tight for a little baby.</li>
            <li> A pearl fell off one of these headbands and customer service was quick to respond to my concern.  The design is not bad but would prefer a different type of chiffon that did not look frayed on the edge. Price is great. I could see others liking this style though. Takes a while to arrive but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Not what i Expected but it had all the colors I needed but the way they looked didn&#x27;t look anything like the picture but they are still adorable on my baby</li>
            <li> Are beautiful , nice  size perfecte for my baby 6 months old. Nice colors. Look very fancy for the price</li>
            <li> Great quality and great for photo shoots of newborns.  Love the color variety and goes with any outfit . . .</li>
            <li> I like them so much very nice,im a 24 years old women i love head band ,its my style love it</li>
            <li> So pretty and nice packaging. So clean</li>
            <li> Right after I ordered these headbands, my card information was being used in another country.  I had about 10 charges of thirty to forty dollars. BEWARE!!!!!</li>
            <li> These headbands are absolutely adorable and fit my daughters head perfectly! Love them have and will continue to recommend them to friends!</li>
            <li> So cute on and don&#x27;t bother my baby, plus keeps her from being mistaken for a boy, I&#x27;ve gotten many compliaments</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery and good over all experience. Product as described!</li>
            <li> Love these they don&#x27;t leave marks and are stretchy but not too big</li>
            <li> Some of the beads had come off of several of there when they arrived and I had to hot glue them back on.</li>
            <li> Love them and they look great on my 2month old! :)</li>
            <li> Cute but kinda cheaply made, but for the cost you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid, I guess I can&#x27;t complain too much. The actual bands were different sizes within the bunch &amp; I didn&#x27;t really like the fact that I could see clumps of dried up hot glue. They did look cute if I didn&#x27;t look so closely though. Just make sure to check for those dried up glue pieces before putting it on your baby girl!</li>
            <li> Pretty headbands. Love all the colors. Fit my newborn (7 months) as well as my older girls (3-5yo). Would recommend for the price. Not very elegant so didnt use them for a wedding but for weekends and everyday outfits they&#x27;re perfect</li>
            <li> They were falling apart as I pulled them out if the bag. Which isn&#x27;t safe. Parents are putting these on the heads of small children. Who may put them in their mouths.</li>
            <li> This is such a great deal on these fabulous little hair bows.  My only concern is that once baby starts pulling them off, I will need to pack them away, because the beads could pose a hazard if she gets them in her mouth.</li>
            <li> diamonds fall easily but cute for 1 wear.</li>
            <li> Prettier in person than online. The color variety is great. My daughter (5 months) looks adorable and they fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Cute. Great colors. Worth the wait.</li>
            <li> They had glue all over them and looked bad.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> Some of the colors were different from the description.&lt;br /&gt;When the package arrived several headbands were missing the pearls/rhinestones. The missing pieces had come loose and we&#x27;re in the package but I wasn&#x27;t comfortable with my infant wearing them as they came.  As such,  I reinforced every single one with more glue.</li>
            <li> These are amazing! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the quality for the price! Baby loves them.</li>
            <li> adorable. good quality</li>
            <li> Ordered for newborn, item was quality handmade, washed once no dies washing out. Totally different then ordering other similar like items from overseas manufacturing and would either fall apart or dies fade immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Item was delivered, on time, as ordered and right packaging size.</li>
            <li> Love the head bands, lots of compliments on them, my girls look so cute in them!</li>
            <li> While these are very cute and I love the color combos they fall apart VERY easily and the bands are too small even for my 9 month old. Can&#x27;t even get them on my 2 year old. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Super cute and they fit my 6 month old prefect! The colors are accurate. I would recommend to anyone to buy.</li>
            <li> love them. some are not put on tight but overall for the price they are great</li>
            <li> Nice colors and don&#x27;t hurt baby&#x27;s head. Would be nice if there was a little variation in style.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my newborn Granddaughter.  They are nicely made and stay placed without slipping.  Great color variety.</li>
            <li> Just received these headbands the other day and they look beautiful! Can&#x27;t wait to use them on our baby girl :) My only complaint is that I ordered the solid headbands, and one of the headbands is two different colors. The flower is a bright yellow and the band is a yellow orange color, which will make it hard to match and/or coordinate with outfits. I can&#x27;t speak yet for comfort or how well the headbands hold up, but I am excited to use them! -J Koch</li>
            <li> Pretty! Be careful with the beads. One bead fell off. Luckily it was in my hand and not my baby&#x27;s mouth. This should have a choking hazard disclaimer. Other than that love it can be used on babies and big girls.</li>
            <li> My favorite collection!</li>
            <li> These are the only bows we use now. I loved them!</li>
            <li> These are really great headbands!  They fit my baby at 0 months, and still at 7 months.  As others have commented the little beads will come off, so now that she is old enough to actually mouth them, I make sure they are secure before I put the headband on.  They look great with so many outfits and I literally always get comments when she is wearing them!  Thank you!  Great value too!!</li>
            <li> Very nice and pretty.</li>
            <li> Amazing deal for headbands! So many cute colors and great quality</li>
            <li> Fits my 3 month old great. Flower is a great size for a baby.</li>
            <li> My girls love the variety of colors, they fit both my 8mth old and 5yr old with no problems. They are good quality and super cute on!</li>
            <li> super cute, great choice of colors, great price.</li>
            <li> So cheaply made it&#x27;s ridiculous. My daughter&#x27;s could have made these at home and it would have been cheaper than buying it on here. Definitely not worth the money. Go to a craft store and buy the supplies (using better materials than this cheap crap) and make it yourself. You&#x27;ll be better off.</li>
            <li> Beautiful but some of the pearls fell out</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected. I abs.vlove it !</li>
            <li> They all look exact to the pictures shown in description.  They fit my infant great and don&#x27;t leave a mark on her head.  They are very cute and worth the money.  You can&#x27;t beat the price for the amount you of bows you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you order in advance with plenty of time for shipping.  Since this comes from China standard shipping does take a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 stars because on one of the headbands the pearls had fallen off and I had to glue them back myself.  Not a big deal but would have at least like to have worn it once before I had to start gluing parts back on.</li>
            <li> I got the Bows in the mail in about a week. They are true to color as shown in the picture, they&#x27;re all very soft and pretty. All of the backs are covered so the babies head will not be scratched which is a plus. Great buy I would recommend to everybody!!</li>
            <li> Very cute headbands for a great price!! Good quality!</li>
            <li> The headbands are just as cute as the picture. They fit my daughter perfectly - they don&#x27;t dig into her head and leave nasty marks. Very very cute!</li>
            <li> 3 of mine were falling apart when I took them out. They also all had hot glue strings stuck all over them that I had to pick off. I Messaged the seller to see if I could get new ones of the 3 that were falling apart since I wanted them for a photo session and no luck yet. Pretty disappointed. I worry about putting them on my babies head with the beads falling off.</li>
            <li> These bows are adorable and are a great price!  Perfect gift for a baby girl!  Allow several weeks for shipping</li>
            <li> Love these bows!! Soo adorable &amp; not cheap looking at all. I get so many compliments on these ones everytime my girls wear them! And seriously, I own like 55 bows!!</li>
            <li> Cuter in real life than they look in the pictures!</li>
            <li> Love all of them... They are beautiful and good materiAl.  Get themmm! The price is goid and the headbands look way expensive! :)</li>
            <li> I love these headbands! I have a baby girl due soon and so I&#x27;ve naturally bought as well as received gifts of all kinds of headbands. But none of them compare to the colors and style of these bands! I&#x27;ve even bought some handmade ones from specialty stores, and these are still my favorite. I hope they last since I plan to use them for a long time!</li>
            <li> only used about half &amp; my baby is 6 mo they still fit but some colors just do&#x27;t need</li>
            <li> These are beautiful. My baby gets compliments every where she wears them.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous absolutely love these! my daughter wears one every day!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these bows!</li>
            <li> Best bow buy I&#x27;ve made</li>
            <li> I love the soft elastic, the size fit perfectly, and the variety of colors is awesome!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my 6 month old love it</li>
            <li> The bands don&#x27;t dig into baby&#x27;s head as others do. The colors were great, now I have a bow I can put with almost anything. Fit very well without slipping or being too tight.</li>
            <li> My niece loves these for her new baby!  Lots of colors and soft fit.</li>
            <li> I love these and I&#x27;m so glad that I bought them! I use them for every outfit I use on my baby. I bought these originally as a stocking stuffer for her stocking but couldn&#x27;t help myself and used them early. She was almost 2 months old around Christmas time and they had a lot of trouble staying on her head (too loose). Now that she&#x27;s 3 months, going on 4, they fit wonderfully. Fantastic color choices -- something matches everything she owns. I would definitely buy these again and recommend them to anyone.</li>
