    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent!</li>
            <li>One of the best sun tan lotion with the highest zinc oxide!</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, this sunscreen is awesome.</li>
            <li>great product!</li>
            <li>Great for adults and kids!</li>
            <li>The best part is that this sun screen is water proof and it stays on for hours.  </li>
            <li>The TWO ingredients that I found had the best reviews  were ZINC OXIDE and SULFUR.  </li>
            <li>since I started using this product, I&#x27;ve had the best of both worlds!</li>
            <li>This one absorbs well (no greasy or shiny residue), doesn&#x27;t bother my skin or cause break-outs, is unscented, and, best of all, it doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes, even when I&#x27;m washing it off at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It gets great reviews!</li>
            <li>THE BEST!!!!  </li>
            <li>Very good sun block,  I would recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li>If anybody out there is reading this, and knows a very good sunblock that uses zinc oxide, please drop me a line.</li>
            <li>Very good, recommended the use of</li>
            <li>Product arrived on time and worked beautifully.  </li>
            <li>It stays on great.</li>
            <li>I was happy during swimming in the pool, and I even reapplied once after around 80 minutes.</li>
            <li>This product did not smell at all which was great.  </li>
            <li>Zinc Oxide is a great moisturizer, a sebum reducer, and it has anti inflammatory qualities.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>if you shop around which is a great value for this type of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>its great........</li>
            <li>Not too greasy, great sun protection.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very nicely.</li>
            <li>It is a nice product, and it might be of aid to very fair skinned people who burn at the drop of the hat.</li>
            <li>So, for fair skinned people, I would say it is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and we have fair skin.</li>
            <li>I did not use it yet, this is for my friend, It seems is a good one.  </li>
            <li>It seems is a good one</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, yet, if it was a good investment because the package has yet to be opened.</li>
            <li>If the sulfur smell during the day bothers you &amp;#34;DHC Acne Spot Therapy&amp;#34; cream is a good choice for daytime wear.  </li>
            <li>and my husband is really fair.  </li>
            <li>staying with this product for good.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended with my fair and acne prone skin to use this product (because its basically zinc oxide concentrated) on my face.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best sunscreens I have found for both sensitive skin and great sun protection.  </li>
            <li>In my morning routing, I put on some Murad skin perfect lotion first, then this stuff, and then a mattifier to prevent &amp;#34;shininess&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I like the amount in the bottle and feel safe under the sun!</li>
            <li>It makes the skin on my face look SO NICE, like if I was wearing foundation.</li>
            <li>Stays on nicely too.</li>
            <li>but I feel that it kind of blocks the breathe of my skin.</li>
            <li>or so then it will look nice</li>
            <li>if anyone knows of such a great product that&#x27;s great on those makeup days then please feel free to drop a line &#x3D;D</li>
            <li>This is my go-to affordable and effective sunscreen.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to find a cost effective zinc/titanium oxide based sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, works well.  </li>
            <li>This applies very easily and provided great protection for my wife who burns rather easily.  </li>
            <li>if u do a light dusting of powder over it after it sets, it looks really nice!</li>
            <li>Hey, if the Environmental Working Group says it&#x27;s safe, it&#x27;s safe!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic skin, after use is very moist, the effect is very good, suitable for summer use.</li>
            <li>i love how it is hazardous</li>
            <li>You have to be sure to get every inch of you</li>
            <li>fast delivery great seller will buy this again.</li>
            <li>Since I use the product mostly for tennis, not for swimming, I probably won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li>I was so sure that I could protect myself from the sun, to no avail.</li>
            <li>We were able to avoid sun burn and skin darkening.  </li>
            <li>Zinc oxide gives the best protection from deep penetrating sun rays.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than getting burned or breaking out on top of sunburn.</li>
            <li>Make sure you apply it over all areas of exposed skin.  </li>
            <li>I was astonished to find that many of the name brands in sunscreen did not have qualifying products.  </li>
            <li>They feed off of the oils that our skin makes to stay healthy.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more than Desitin Diaper Rash Cream (which is 13%) .</li>
            <li>Although sulfur is safe to ingest DO NOT do so unless under a Dr.&#x27;s supervision.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really been working great.  </li>
            <li>For a more scientific  discussion about sulfur and acne see this link  </li>
            <li>My favorite mineral sunscreen for the body.  </li>
            <li>This is the best physical sunscreen out there.  </li>
            <li>It ended up effecting my love life, because women would see the rash and think I had an STD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Ok, so sunscreens with zinc oxide do leave a residue, you just have to rub a lot.</li>
            <li>I love the product.......</li>
            <li>so you just need to take a couple more minutes rubbing it in</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>In fact, it will not come off easily, period.</li>
            <li>and it is easy to apply and blend.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of what happened to that once holy grail sunblock BurnOut Eco Sensitive Zinc Oxide Sunscreen that many people loved.</li>
            <li>It works fine in avoiding sunburn, but it is a pain to spread.  </li>
            <li>And like any fine powder, like baby powder,  you should avoid inhaling it or getting the powder in your eyes.   </li>
            <li>Too chalky for my preference, but works fine.</li>
            <li>So keeping your skin moisturized and calm was what some said to be very important in treating acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, light consistency.</li>
            <li>I am light skinned and freckle and live.in the tropics.</li>
            <li>This is a great body sunblock that actually works.</li>
            <li>The product is good for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good quality and more than enough for making skin care lotions.    </li>
            <li>I bought this product because the EWG gives it a good rating (see [...]), it&#x27;s inexpensive, and you can find it pretty much anywhere</li>
            <li>After having used it for months, I&#x27;m certainly not disappointed by how it performs.</li>
            <li>ORIGINAL REVIEW:</li>
            <li>Works well, not expensive, avoids all the stuff (chemicals) many of the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; sun protectants use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it though!  </li>
            <li>Works great and lasts and a long time.</li>
            <li>So, I am confident that this product offers phenomenal sun protection.  </li>
            <li>lol it&#x27;s really dry</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t like it on those full blown makeup look days...</li>
            <li>no bad smell.......</li>
            <li>UVA protection (physical).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:  If you don&#x27;t like pure &amp;#34;physical&amp;#34; sunblocks due to the thickness, the pasty look, or the waxy residue and don&#x27;t mind using &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; sunblock, then this is a great choice that gives you the best of both worlds with little compromise.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin or cause breakouts, it keeps me from getting burned, and I feel good knowing that it scores very well in its ability to block UVA light (which is the spectrum that causes skin aging and cancer).</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s safe to conclude, is 2 more oz of product for the same price.</li>
            <li>I will write a follow-up to this review when the product is used, but for now I will say that I got the sunscreen quickly and it was sealed.</li>
            <li>actually causes skin to produce more sebum and thus give you more clogged pores.  </li>
            <li>it makes my face look smooth and pretty.</li>
            <li>To reduce the whitish cast of this type of sunscreen I normally apply, wait 10-15 minutes, and rub it into the skin some more.</li>
            <li>It helped with burning, but then again, I have the skin type that doesn&#x27;t burn much under the sun, but I do tan ridiculously easy.  </li>
            <li>Both had been claimed to clear up the most severe acne quickly and without  discomfort.  </li>
            <li>I think I will use this product up and will only buy it again if I need a nice zinc oxide sunscreen in a pinch and don&#x27;t have a lot of money to splurge sunscreen-Cadillacs like La Roche Posay or BurnOut.</li>
            <li>It takes longer to apply, but the comfort of knowing it will truly protect from harmful sunlight makes it worth it.</li>
            <li>(I rarely use it.  </li>
            <li>It is said to  work &amp;#34;by making your very top layers of skin dry and peel off.</li>
            <li>(Lots of sunscreens contain micro-particles that go right through cell membranes in our bodies, this one doesn&#x27;t.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ideal if you have minimal body hair and want to use it for the occasional day at the beach.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that since it was for sensitive skin and zinc oxide based that it wouldn&#x27;t have a strong chemical smell, but that was not the case.  </li>
            <li>I applied it liberally on my first day before going out to the beach.</li>
            <li>So, from that day forward, I applied and reapplied diligently each day, but noticed that my cheeks, chests and arm were getting more red and itchy after a day or two.</li>
            <li>We applied 2 times per day as we were outside and swimming most of the day.  </li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now, maybe a month or so, and I&#x27;m starting to like it a bit more.</li>
            <li>Sunblocks (that uses physical blockers) must be worn on top of your lotions and under your makeup, and it works immediately before you go out.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m bumping this up with another star until further notice! :-)  </li>
            <li>We used this sunscreen for hikining the hot sun.  </li>
            <li>so my love life is back on track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to use an oil based moisturizer first before I apply this</li>
            <li>Well suited for the hot weather there.</li>
            <li>It is very thick and leaves a white-ish cast which I think is ok because it seems to be more effective than many other highly rated sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>I spent most of my adult life shying away from nude beaches because I would get sunburned in the most intimate of places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>Zinc sunscreen (a physical barrier) is better for your skin that those sunscreens that are purely a chemical barrier.</li>
            <li>I am able to frequent nude beaches without the fear of burning my taint, and the lotion does not leave a rash in the sensitive places</li>
            <li>Unlike some sunscreens that contain zinc, this one goes on easily and the white virtually disappears.</li>
            <li>It has 3% sulfur.(see my review)  Or mix your own with the Coppertone lotion and half the sulfur.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s because the protection isn&#x27;t strong enough and exposure to the sun caused the roughness or if she&#x27;s having some sort of reaction to the lotion</li>
            <li>It used to be a pure block...</li>
            <li>It makes my face look really pretty, naturally, and even after I wash my face at night, I can see a more even toned facial color.</li>
            <li>I am Indian and have a fairly dark complexion that tans very easily.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen is rated very well on EWGs database.</li>
            <li>My symptoms sound very similar to everything I read about reactions to octinoxate.</li>
            <li>This stuff is going straight into the garbage.</li>
            <li>I almost never leave any product review because I do not have much spare time.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen really doesn&#x27;t leave stains on your clothes.  </li>
            <li>If you apply too much, this will leave a silver/white coating on you skin.  </li>
            <li>I had very itchy raised welts on both cheeks, my neck, and my chest.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be really greasy, but its not.  </li>
            <li>It does require re-application if you are hanging out in the sun all day or at the beach or sweating up a storm, but nothing but success here with it so far.  </li>
            <li>now I can go outside and enjoy the sunB-)</li>
            <li>Very protective.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for a natural look but if applied alone u will be pale as a mofo!</li>
            <li>It also will not come off easily if you get wet or sweat a lot.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend .</li>
            <li>To top it all off, all of the new swimsuits I bought for the trip are now stained white stripes of zinc oxide, and possibly ruined.</li>
            <li>MIX Coppertone Sensitive Skin lotion with PURE SULFUR  </li>
            <li>Coppertone Sensitive Skin lotion with  1/4 t  Pure Sulfur  </li>
            <li>Today, I went to the pool with my little sister and applied the exposed area with this product, confident that I won&#x27;t get tanned.</li>
            <li>We generally use this product on all body parts outside of the face, which we use a tear free lotion so it doesn&#x27;t get in their eyes.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite sunscreen it goes on nice and doesn&#x27;t have the powerful &#x27;sunscreen smell&#x27; that I hate.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen works really well for my 4-yr old.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and needed something gentle.</li>
            <li>My skin looks normal</li>
            <li>It stands up well under normal circumstances</li>
            <li>It does leave a white tinge, but if you are fair skinned, this really isn&#x27;t going to look like a mess of white on your skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and acne-prone skin, and most sunblock makes my eyes sting after a few hours.</li>
            <li>Then I went back to find scientific reasons why the users were right.  </li>
            <li>Excess oil also causes the dead skin cells to stick together and block the pores, so oily skin is more prone to acne.&amp;#34;  Zinc oxide is thought to reduce the production of these oils (called sebum; a light yellow, oily fluid that keeps the skin and hair moisturized).  </li>
            <li>Sunblocks use mineral blocks, such as zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide, and it completely blocks the sun from your skin, and people have success in not burning and tanning with it.</li>
            <li>The lower levels of your skin are alive, but the top layers are dead, so this does not hurt.</li>
            <li>It is the serious zinc kind</li>
            <li>I thank my dermatologist for recommending it, and this bottle will go a long way in these hot summer months!</li>
            <li>Used this on myself and my very sensitive son every day at the pool.</li>
            <li>If you have very sensitive hypoallergenic skin, skip this product.</li>
            <li>I recently tried out this sunblock while I was outdoors swimming, and for the first time in my life, I DID NOT TAN</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve gotta spend several seconds rubbing it in to avoid that white look, but it&#x27;s that fact that it provides a physical barrier that makes it safe.  </li>
            <li>Not sure how waterproof it is -- the product probably wasn&#x27;t designed for torrential downpours in the rainforest. :-)</li>
            <li>For me, that&#x27;s a small price to pay for such excellent sun protection, but it might be a negative for some people.  </li>
            <li>8 oz Pure and Simple 50 SPF Product, and then look at this 6 oz product.</li>
            <li>Waterbabies Pure and Simple</li>
            <li>( i have clear skin FYI)</li>
            <li>Coppertone Sensitive is the way to go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not practical for frequent use.</li>
            <li>It really won&#x27;t come off in the water, and you probably won&#x27;t mind taking some extra time to apply it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using sensitive SPF 30 moisturizer (Coppertone) for years when my dermatologist recommended it after a skin cancer treatment.  </li>
            <li>This review is for Coppertone Sensitive Skin Lotion (year 2015)  </li>
            <li>Coppertone Sensitive Skin</li>
            <li>Coppertone sunscreen otion, Sensitive skin, 50 SPF, stays put in water and no reaction from sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This Coppertone Sensitive can be purchased for about $1.25/oz.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t totally absorb and make my skin look even more pale</li>
            <li>broad spectrum SPF 50  had the highest amount of ZINC OXIDE I could find in a sunscreen lotion  14.5% !  </li>
            <li>I like it so much, that I will continue to choose this Coppertone for the body as long as they sell it.</li>
            <li>BurnOut has created a new sunblock called &amp;#34;BurnOut Broad Spectrum SPF 30 For Face &amp; Body&amp;#34;, it is supposedly the same as their old zinc oxide sunblock, and it isnice for days out where you won&#x27;t be sweating or swimming.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This contains both &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;physical&amp;#34; sunblock ingredients which gives you the advantages of easier application, less ghostly appearance, and less waxy (chemical) and far better</li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t be an everyday sunblock for me (for that, I like Coppertone Oil-Free SPF 30 or 45), but I will stay loyal to this on days when I&#x27;m outdoors and need hardcore sun protection.</li>
            <li>Its not too thick or smelly and goes on really easy.  </li>
            <li>AT ALL despite several hours of direct sun exposure (at midday and 7000+ feet of elevation)!  </li>
            <li>I was never able to wash it cleanly off my body.</li>
            <li>I wiped it off about 2 minutes later and it ate through my nail polish completely to the bare nail.</li>
            <li>(For larger batch use  8 t  Coppertone Sensitive Skin lotion  with  1 t sulfur)  </li>
            <li>I developed an allergy to chemical sunscreens last year and had to switch to zinc/titanium oxide based sunscreens to avoid nightly hives outbreaks.</li>
            <li>I admit that I wasn&#x27;t as diligent as I normally am about reapplying on that first day, since it&#x27;s such a goopy mess to apply, particularly once you have sand on you, and I did get a couple of pink spots on my chest and shoulder.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen is amazing in terms of keeping your skin from breaking out and keeping the sun from burning you, but it&#x27;s hard to work into the skin being a different chemical than the other easier stuff.</li>
            <li>Sometimes they also wear the Coppertone lotion by itself on their entire back or face as well to keep new acne from appearing.  </li>
            <li>It took some work to rub it in, but it eventually absorbed enough that there was no noticeable white cast even on my dark skintone.  </li>
            <li>After doing a little online research, I suspect that I may have had an allergic reaction to octinoxate (the first ingredient listed on the package).</li>
            <li>A little more difficult to sink into skin, but well worth the effort.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way and rubs in completely and will offer near or complete protection from the sun.  </li>
            <li>We almost never reapply (my fault) and so far I and my boys haven&#x27;t gotten burnt even a little bit, and barely even tan, so that tells me barely any sun is getting through even after hours of swimming and not necessarily reapplying.</li>

            <li> One of the best sun tan lotion with the highest zinc oxide!</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, this sunscreen is awesome.</li>
            <li> great product!</li>
            <li> Great for adults and kids!</li>
            <li> The best part is that this sun screen is water proof and it stays on for hours.  </li>
            <li> The TWO ingredients that I found had the best reviews  were ZINC OXIDE and SULFUR.  </li>
            <li> since I started using this product, I&#x27;ve had the best of both worlds!</li>
            <li> This one absorbs well (no greasy or shiny residue), doesn&#x27;t bother my skin or cause break-outs, is unscented, and, best of all, it doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes, even when I&#x27;m washing it off at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It gets great reviews!</li>
            <li> THE BEST!!!!  </li>
            <li> Very good sun block,  I would recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> If anybody out there is reading this, and knows a very good sunblock that uses zinc oxide, please drop me a line.</li>
            <li> Very good, recommended the use of</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and worked beautifully.  </li>
            <li> It stays on great.</li>
            <li> I was happy during swimming in the pool, and I even reapplied once after around 80 minutes.</li>
            <li> This product did not smell at all which was great.  </li>
            <li> Zinc Oxide is a great moisturizer, a sebum reducer, and it has anti inflammatory qualities.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li> if you shop around which is a great value for this type of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> its great........</li>
            <li> Not too greasy, great sun protection.  </li>
            <li> It goes on very nicely.</li>
            <li> It is a nice product, and it might be of aid to very fair skinned people who burn at the drop of the hat.</li>
            <li> So, for fair skinned people, I would say it is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and we have fair skin.</li>
            <li> I did not use it yet, this is for my friend, It seems is a good one.  </li>
            <li> It seems is a good one</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, yet, if it was a good investment because the package has yet to be opened.</li>
            <li> If the sulfur smell during the day bothers you &amp;#34;DHC Acne Spot Therapy&amp;#34; cream is a good choice for daytime wear.  </li>
            <li> and my husband is really fair.  </li>
            <li> staying with this product for good.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended with my fair and acne prone skin to use this product (because its basically zinc oxide concentrated) on my face.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the best sunscreens I have found for both sensitive skin and great sun protection.  </li>
            <li> In my morning routing, I put on some Murad skin perfect lotion first, then this stuff, and then a mattifier to prevent &amp;#34;shininess&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I like the amount in the bottle and feel safe under the sun!</li>
            <li> It makes the skin on my face look SO NICE, like if I was wearing foundation.</li>
            <li> Stays on nicely too.</li>
            <li> but I feel that it kind of blocks the breathe of my skin.</li>
            <li> or so then it will look nice</li>
            <li> if anyone knows of such a great product that&#x27;s great on those makeup days then please feel free to drop a line &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> This is my go-to affordable and effective sunscreen.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice to find a cost effective zinc/titanium oxide based sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, works well.  </li>
            <li> This applies very easily and provided great protection for my wife who burns rather easily.  </li>
            <li> if u do a light dusting of powder over it after it sets, it looks really nice!</li>
            <li> Hey, if the Environmental Working Group says it&#x27;s safe, it&#x27;s safe!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic skin, after use is very moist, the effect is very good, suitable for summer use.</li>
            <li> i love how it is hazardous</li>
            <li> You have to be sure to get every inch of you</li>
            <li> fast delivery great seller will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Since I use the product mostly for tennis, not for swimming, I probably won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I was so sure that I could protect myself from the sun, to no avail.</li>
            <li> We were able to avoid sun burn and skin darkening.  </li>
            <li> Zinc oxide gives the best protection from deep penetrating sun rays.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better than getting burned or breaking out on top of sunburn.</li>
            <li> Make sure you apply it over all areas of exposed skin.  </li>
            <li> I was astonished to find that many of the name brands in sunscreen did not have qualifying products.  </li>
            <li> They feed off of the oils that our skin makes to stay healthy.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s more than Desitin Diaper Rash Cream (which is 13%) .</li>
            <li> Although sulfur is safe to ingest DO NOT do so unless under a Dr.&#x27;s supervision.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really been working great.  </li>
            <li> For a more scientific  discussion about sulfur and acne see this link  </li>
            <li> My favorite mineral sunscreen for the body.  </li>
            <li> This is the best physical sunscreen out there.  </li>
            <li> It ended up effecting my love life, because women would see the rash and think I had an STD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> Ok, so sunscreens with zinc oxide do leave a residue, you just have to rub a lot.</li>
            <li> I love the product.......</li>
            <li> so you just need to take a couple more minutes rubbing it in</li>
            <li> i love this product.</li>
            <li> In fact, it will not come off easily, period.</li>
            <li> and it is easy to apply and blend.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of what happened to that once holy grail sunblock BurnOut Eco Sensitive Zinc Oxide Sunscreen that many people loved.</li>
            <li> It works fine in avoiding sunburn, but it is a pain to spread.  </li>
            <li> And like any fine powder, like baby powder,  you should avoid inhaling it or getting the powder in your eyes.   </li>
            <li> Too chalky for my preference, but works fine.</li>
            <li> So keeping your skin moisturized and calm was what some said to be very important in treating acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, light consistency.</li>
            <li> I am light skinned and freckle and live.in the tropics.</li>
            <li> This is a great body sunblock that actually works.</li>
            <li> The product is good for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality and more than enough for making skin care lotions.    </li>
            <li> I bought this product because the EWG gives it a good rating (see [...]), it&#x27;s inexpensive, and you can find it pretty much anywhere</li>
            <li> After having used it for months, I&#x27;m certainly not disappointed by how it performs.</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW:</li>
            <li> Works well, not expensive, avoids all the stuff (chemicals) many of the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; sun protectants use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it though!  </li>
            <li> Works great and lasts and a long time.</li>
            <li> So, I am confident that this product offers phenomenal sun protection.  </li>
            <li> lol it&#x27;s really dry</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like it on those full blown makeup look days...</li>
            <li> no bad smell.......</li>
            <li> UVA protection (physical).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:  If you don&#x27;t like pure &amp;#34;physical&amp;#34; sunblocks due to the thickness, the pasty look, or the waxy residue and don&#x27;t mind using &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; sunblock, then this is a great choice that gives you the best of both worlds with little compromise.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin or cause breakouts, it keeps me from getting burned, and I feel good knowing that it scores very well in its ability to block UVA light (which is the spectrum that causes skin aging and cancer).</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s safe to conclude, is 2 more oz of product for the same price.</li>
            <li> I will write a follow-up to this review when the product is used, but for now I will say that I got the sunscreen quickly and it was sealed.</li>
            <li> actually causes skin to produce more sebum and thus give you more clogged pores.  </li>
            <li> it makes my face look smooth and pretty.</li>
            <li> To reduce the whitish cast of this type of sunscreen I normally apply, wait 10-15 minutes, and rub it into the skin some more.</li>
            <li> It helped with burning, but then again, I have the skin type that doesn&#x27;t burn much under the sun, but I do tan ridiculously easy.  </li>
            <li> Both had been claimed to clear up the most severe acne quickly and without  discomfort.  </li>
            <li> I think I will use this product up and will only buy it again if I need a nice zinc oxide sunscreen in a pinch and don&#x27;t have a lot of money to splurge sunscreen-Cadillacs like La Roche Posay or BurnOut.</li>
            <li> It takes longer to apply, but the comfort of knowing it will truly protect from harmful sunlight makes it worth it.</li>
            <li> (I rarely use it.  </li>
            <li> It is said to  work &amp;#34;by making your very top layers of skin dry and peel off.</li>
            <li> (Lots of sunscreens contain micro-particles that go right through cell membranes in our bodies, this one doesn&#x27;t.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ideal if you have minimal body hair and want to use it for the occasional day at the beach.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that since it was for sensitive skin and zinc oxide based that it wouldn&#x27;t have a strong chemical smell, but that was not the case.  </li>
            <li> I applied it liberally on my first day before going out to the beach.</li>
            <li> So, from that day forward, I applied and reapplied diligently each day, but noticed that my cheeks, chests and arm were getting more red and itchy after a day or two.</li>
            <li> We applied 2 times per day as we were outside and swimming most of the day.  </li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now, maybe a month or so, and I&#x27;m starting to like it a bit more.</li>
            <li> Sunblocks (that uses physical blockers) must be worn on top of your lotions and under your makeup, and it works immediately before you go out.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m bumping this up with another star until further notice! :-)  </li>
            <li> We used this sunscreen for hikining the hot sun.  </li>
            <li> so my love life is back on track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to use an oil based moisturizer first before I apply this</li>
            <li> Well suited for the hot weather there.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and leaves a white-ish cast which I think is ok because it seems to be more effective than many other highly rated sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I spent most of my adult life shying away from nude beaches because I would get sunburned in the most intimate of places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> Zinc sunscreen (a physical barrier) is better for your skin that those sunscreens that are purely a chemical barrier.</li>
            <li> I am able to frequent nude beaches without the fear of burning my taint, and the lotion does not leave a rash in the sensitive places</li>
            <li> Unlike some sunscreens that contain zinc, this one goes on easily and the white virtually disappears.</li>
            <li> It has 3% sulfur.(see my review)  Or mix your own with the Coppertone lotion and half the sulfur.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s because the protection isn&#x27;t strong enough and exposure to the sun caused the roughness or if she&#x27;s having some sort of reaction to the lotion</li>
            <li> It used to be a pure block...</li>
            <li> It makes my face look really pretty, naturally, and even after I wash my face at night, I can see a more even toned facial color.</li>
            <li> I am Indian and have a fairly dark complexion that tans very easily.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen is rated very well on EWGs database.</li>
            <li> My symptoms sound very similar to everything I read about reactions to octinoxate.</li>
            <li> This stuff is going straight into the garbage.</li>
            <li> I almost never leave any product review because I do not have much spare time.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen really doesn&#x27;t leave stains on your clothes.  </li>
            <li> If you apply too much, this will leave a silver/white coating on you skin.  </li>
            <li> I had very itchy raised welts on both cheeks, my neck, and my chest.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be really greasy, but its not.  </li>
            <li> It does require re-application if you are hanging out in the sun all day or at the beach or sweating up a storm, but nothing but success here with it so far.  </li>
            <li> now I can go outside and enjoy the sunB-)</li>
            <li> Very protective.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for a natural look but if applied alone u will be pale as a mofo!</li>
            <li> It also will not come off easily if you get wet or sweat a lot.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend .</li>
            <li> To top it all off, all of the new swimsuits I bought for the trip are now stained white stripes of zinc oxide, and possibly ruined.</li>
            <li> MIX Coppertone Sensitive Skin lotion with PURE SULFUR  </li>
            <li> Coppertone Sensitive Skin lotion with  1/4 t  Pure Sulfur  </li>
            <li> Today, I went to the pool with my little sister and applied the exposed area with this product, confident that I won&#x27;t get tanned.</li>
            <li> We generally use this product on all body parts outside of the face, which we use a tear free lotion so it doesn&#x27;t get in their eyes.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen it goes on nice and doesn&#x27;t have the powerful &#x27;sunscreen smell&#x27; that I hate.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen works really well for my 4-yr old.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and needed something gentle.</li>
            <li> My skin looks normal</li>
            <li> It stands up well under normal circumstances</li>
            <li> It does leave a white tinge, but if you are fair skinned, this really isn&#x27;t going to look like a mess of white on your skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and acne-prone skin, and most sunblock makes my eyes sting after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Then I went back to find scientific reasons why the users were right.  </li>
            <li> Excess oil also causes the dead skin cells to stick together and block the pores, so oily skin is more prone to acne.&amp;#34;  Zinc oxide is thought to reduce the production of these oils (called sebum; a light yellow, oily fluid that keeps the skin and hair moisturized).  </li>
            <li> Sunblocks use mineral blocks, such as zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide, and it completely blocks the sun from your skin, and people have success in not burning and tanning with it.</li>
            <li> The lower levels of your skin are alive, but the top layers are dead, so this does not hurt.</li>
            <li> It is the serious zinc kind</li>
            <li> I thank my dermatologist for recommending it, and this bottle will go a long way in these hot summer months!</li>
            <li> Used this on myself and my very sensitive son every day at the pool.</li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive hypoallergenic skin, skip this product.</li>
            <li> I recently tried out this sunblock while I was outdoors swimming, and for the first time in my life, I DID NOT TAN</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve gotta spend several seconds rubbing it in to avoid that white look, but it&#x27;s that fact that it provides a physical barrier that makes it safe.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how waterproof it is -- the product probably wasn&#x27;t designed for torrential downpours in the rainforest. :-)</li>
            <li> For me, that&#x27;s a small price to pay for such excellent sun protection, but it might be a negative for some people.  </li>
            <li> 8 oz Pure and Simple 50 SPF Product, and then look at this 6 oz product.</li>
            <li> Waterbabies Pure and Simple</li>
            <li> ( i have clear skin FYI)</li>
            <li> Coppertone Sensitive is the way to go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not practical for frequent use.</li>
            <li> It really won&#x27;t come off in the water, and you probably won&#x27;t mind taking some extra time to apply it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using sensitive SPF 30 moisturizer (Coppertone) for years when my dermatologist recommended it after a skin cancer treatment.  </li>
            <li> This review is for Coppertone Sensitive Skin Lotion (year 2015)  </li>
            <li> Coppertone Sensitive Skin</li>
            <li> Coppertone sunscreen otion, Sensitive skin, 50 SPF, stays put in water and no reaction from sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This Coppertone Sensitive can be purchased for about $1.25/oz.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t totally absorb and make my skin look even more pale</li>
            <li> broad spectrum SPF 50  had the highest amount of ZINC OXIDE I could find in a sunscreen lotion  14.5% !  </li>
            <li> I like it so much, that I will continue to choose this Coppertone for the body as long as they sell it.</li>
            <li> BurnOut has created a new sunblock called &amp;#34;BurnOut Broad Spectrum SPF 30 For Face &amp; Body&amp;#34;, it is supposedly the same as their old zinc oxide sunblock, and it isnice for days out where you won&#x27;t be sweating or swimming.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This contains both &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;physical&amp;#34; sunblock ingredients which gives you the advantages of easier application, less ghostly appearance, and less waxy (chemical) and far better</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t be an everyday sunblock for me (for that, I like Coppertone Oil-Free SPF 30 or 45), but I will stay loyal to this on days when I&#x27;m outdoors and need hardcore sun protection.</li>
            <li> Its not too thick or smelly and goes on really easy.  </li>
            <li> AT ALL despite several hours of direct sun exposure (at midday and 7000+ feet of elevation)!  </li>
            <li> I was never able to wash it cleanly off my body.</li>
            <li> I wiped it off about 2 minutes later and it ate through my nail polish completely to the bare nail.</li>
            <li> (For larger batch use  8 t  Coppertone Sensitive Skin lotion  with  1 t sulfur)  </li>
            <li> I developed an allergy to chemical sunscreens last year and had to switch to zinc/titanium oxide based sunscreens to avoid nightly hives outbreaks.</li>
            <li> I admit that I wasn&#x27;t as diligent as I normally am about reapplying on that first day, since it&#x27;s such a goopy mess to apply, particularly once you have sand on you, and I did get a couple of pink spots on my chest and shoulder.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen is amazing in terms of keeping your skin from breaking out and keeping the sun from burning you, but it&#x27;s hard to work into the skin being a different chemical than the other easier stuff.</li>
            <li> Sometimes they also wear the Coppertone lotion by itself on their entire back or face as well to keep new acne from appearing.  </li>
            <li> It took some work to rub it in, but it eventually absorbed enough that there was no noticeable white cast even on my dark skintone.  </li>
            <li> After doing a little online research, I suspect that I may have had an allergic reaction to octinoxate (the first ingredient listed on the package).</li>
            <li> A little more difficult to sink into skin, but well worth the effort.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and rubs in completely and will offer near or complete protection from the sun.  </li>
            <li> We almost never reapply (my fault) and so far I and my boys haven&#x27;t gotten burnt even a little bit, and barely even tan, so that tells me barely any sun is getting through even after hours of swimming and not necessarily reapplying.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used other lotions on our children and with their sensitive skin they can cause irritation.</li>
            <li> We used this along with a couple other sunblocks in the south Caribbean and this was the far easiest to apply evenly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Whatever I do, it takes lots of work to rub it in completely, and there will always be a slight white tint when all is said and done.    </li>
            <li> By time I left the beach, my skin was dry, red, bumpy and itchy.</li>
            <li> What I noticed was that the sulfur can do this very quickly WITHOUT irritating the skin (like other ingredients can do.)  </li>
            <li> The only down side is when used on African American skin, it gives a bluish hue to the skin</li>
            <li> Coppertone Sensitive Skin Lotion SPF 50 is a mixture of both physical and chemical blockers, so the article states that I should wait at least 15-20 minutes before going outside so that the product can properly sink in and give me a protective layer.  </li>
            <li> This would be something that Casper or Powder would use as it is super thick sunscreen that leaves you pale white.  </li>
            <li> (I use the Face version of it for this), and I wish it didn&#x27;t get on our (mostly dark) swimsuits, but if it&#x27;s in the name of preventing cancer, I&#x27;ll take the bad with the good.</li>
            <li> However, a white cast did reappear once my skin got wet.  </li>
            <li> It will eventually rub in, just takes a long time.</li>
            <li> This product uses zinc oxide, yes, but a long list of chemical screens in it too.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day long under my makeup.</li>
            <li> After discovering I am allergic to traditional sunscreens I carefully tried this one.</li>
            <li> It will takes me some time before I could update my review since I would like to see its effect in a long way.</li>
            <li> white jar with a white lid and  black label.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen, on the other hand, uses chemicals, and I even read this in a medical book that sunscreens prevents burning, but not tanning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll will keep using for my 4-yr since this particular sunscreen is recommended as being less toxic than the usual sunblock, but I plan to try another sunscreen from the recommended list for my younger child.</li>
            <li> The Indications, Active Ingredients, and Directions are all the same, WORD FOR WORD.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, it works well at protecting your skin, but I usually wear a hat and don&#x27;t stay out in the sun a long time.</li>
            <li> One can work it into the skin until the product is only slightly visible however.</li>
            <li> My skin also felt very dry</li>
            <li> Not much effort.  </li>
            <li> I do have one theory as to why it happened to me and why it might happen to someone else; this is not a pure sunBLOCK.</li>
            <li> But I have to warn other people from buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The downside was it was extremely sticky and never soaked into skin.  </li>
            <li> 2 out of 10 according to EWG.org but other than that</li>
            <li> It helps a little bit to wet your skin before applying, but not much, and this practice may reduce the effectiveness of the product.</li>
            <li> After a few days we all had extremely dry skin, and were itching all over as a result.  </li>
            <li> Wear this every day under my makeup and over my moisturizer to prevent/reduce dark spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife because we do quite a bit of fishing, and I hate it when she burns because she&#x27;s allergic to most sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is the really thick white paste fyi.</li>
            <li> The skin on my shoulders look dried out due to the sun damaged</li>
            <li> Yes, it goes on VERY thick and white, but I expected that.</li>
            <li> I wanted to return it but used about half the bottle</li>
            <li> Gave it 4 stars because the quantity is less for the price.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s not good because on makeup days, even with primer, my makeup is too slippery and does not last!</li>
            <li> It needs a little time to absorb.</li>
            <li> A little greasy, yes but was never an issue.  </li>
            <li> Yes you need a little moe effort to rub it in.  </li>
            <li> but I get rashes for no reason, and have sun allergy, and a few eczema spots.</li>
            <li> One type would have killed me if it had not been caught in time.</li>
            <li> This was one of the few that was from a brand</li>
            <li> ( meaning having  dead skin cells on the skin&#x27;s surface)  </li>
            <li> If you wear the mix it heavily you may need to hand wash it out of your clothes with hand soap, baby shampoo or dish washing liquid before you laundry it.  </li>
            <li> And the residue felt pretty stifling and bad</li>
            <li> First of all, It is so hard to wash off!!!!</li>
            <li> Even after a shower were I thoroughly wash all areas I applied the sunscreen, the slight sunscreen smell will linger for at least 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of chalkiness behind, though a pale tint is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I have not had this problem with their product in years past.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount on my arms to try it out.</li>
            <li> However, our whole family used it over the last week, for our lake vacation with horrible results.  </li>
            <li> I agree with previous reviews that this product is very thick and somewhat hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Once you get over how thick it is, it works well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too thick to blend in.</li>
            <li> The only caveat is that this sunscreen is VERY difficult to rub in.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s next to impossible to scrub this stuff off in the shower.</li>
            <li> Well... when I got home and took off my bathing suit, I was shocked to see very deep tanning lines everywhere.</li>
            <li> This is not a good sunscreen for fashion conscience beach goers as you&#x27;ll look a bit silly, but I am pale and it protects me well.</li>
            <li> I read about how to apply a sunscreen/sunblock correctly, and it turns out that I&#x27;ve been applying it sort of wrong.</li>
            <li> but then they added chemical screens, and it suddenly became the worst product since people burned and tanned through it, ruining their skin in the process.  </li>
            <li> and you look quite silly.  </li>
            <li> (Don&#x27;t put on your face if you have a little stubble, looks horrible and doesn&#x27;t rub in.)  </li>
            <li> Also this sunscreen smelled stale, like bad yogurt.</li>
            <li> My skin still had a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> Although I did not have any bad reaction to it, I was stressed out by this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed since I like the coverage it gives.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed with Coppertone.  </li>
            <li> I think this might be the worst sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> My experience with it was completely awful.</li>
            <li> I used to have horrible worts all over my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> This Coppertone is the worst sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> It does leave a white tinge, but if you are fair skinned, this really isn&#x27;t going to look like a mess of white on your skin. It will blend without a lot of rubbing. Hours after you put it on, you can tell it is still there. So, for fair skinned people, I would say it is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it on my face, so I can&#x27;t attest to any breakout issues. I use Christian Dior sunscreen for the face, but because of price and bottle size, it&#x27;s obviously not for summers in the yard even. The Coppertone completes the sunscreen regime. I like it so much, that I will continue to choose this Coppertone for the body as long as they sell it.</li>
            <li> Excellent! One of the best sun tan lotion with the highest zinc oxide! I shopped around and found amazon had the biggest oz bottle, otherwise you find a only like 3 ozs</li>
            <li> I agree with previous reviews that this product is very thick and somewhat hard to apply. You have to be sure to get every inch of you so that a) you&#x27;re thoroughly protected, and b) you don&#x27;t look like a patchwork quilt of skin/paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this sunscreen is awesome. The sun here in Houston is crazy-intense all year, and I get sun damage (freckles, tan lines) even at 9 a.m. during the summer. We almost never reapply (my fault) and so far I and my boys haven&#x27;t gotten burnt even a little bit, and barely even tan, so that tells me barely any sun is getting through even after hours of swimming and not necessarily reapplying. I do think it dries out my kids&#x27; skin a bit, especially on the face (I use the Face version of it for this), and I wish it didn&#x27;t get on our (mostly dark) swimsuits, but if it&#x27;s in the name of preventing cancer, I&#x27;ll take the bad with the good.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used other lotions on our children and with their sensitive skin they can cause irritation. Coppertone Sensitive is the way to go. We generally use this product on all body parts outside of the face, which we use a tear free lotion so it doesn&#x27;t get in their eyes. I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I bought this last summer at walgreens but couldn&#x27;t find it this summer thank goodness I found it on amazon. this is the only sunscreen my son can use that doesn&#x27;t cause him to break out or itch. great product! fast delivery great seller will buy this again. thank you!</li>
            <li> I am Indian and have a fairly dark complexion that tans very easily.  I also use prescription products on my skin that require me to be vigilant about sun protection.  I recently tried out this sunblock while I was outdoors swimming, and for the first time in my life, I DID NOT TAN AT ALL despite several hours of direct sun exposure (at midday and 7000+ feet of elevation)!  So, I am confident that this product offers phenomenal sun protection.  It took some work to rub it in, but it eventually absorbed enough that there was no noticeable white cast even on my dark skintone.  However, a white cast did reappear once my skin got wet.  For me, that&#x27;s a small price to pay for such excellent sun protection, but it might be a negative for some people.  If you have a lighter complexion, I would guess this will not be an issue.  This won&#x27;t be an everyday sunblock for me (for that, I like Coppertone Oil-Free SPF 30 or 45), but I will stay loyal to this on days when I&#x27;m outdoors and need hardcore sun protection.</li>
            <li> I like the product a lot. If you know all about the EWG hype and go to their website to find low-risk lotions, this product is one of them, but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a look at the Coppertone Waterbabies 8 oz Pure and Simple 50 SPF Product, and then look at this 6 oz product. The Indications, Active Ingredients, and Directions are all the same, WORD FOR WORD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Waterbabies Pure and Simple, it&#x27;s safe to conclude, is 2 more oz of product for the same price.</li>
            <li> I bought this without looking at the ingredients. I assumed it was safe(my fault). I put this on my child and in the process I dropped some on my toenail. I wiped it off about 2 minutes later and it ate through my nail polish completely to the bare nail. I looked at the ingredients and it had every chemical that you should avoid in sunscreen in it. I looked up what to avoid in sunscreen and this had them all. Way to go Coppertone. My kid is taking a shower as we speak.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because the EWG gives it a good rating (see [...]), it&#x27;s inexpensive, and you can find it pretty much anywhere (Target, CVS, etc.). After having used it for months, I&#x27;m certainly not disappointed by how it performs. It does not dry out my skin or cause breakouts, it keeps me from getting burned, and I feel good knowing that it scores very well in its ability to block UVA light (which is the spectrum that causes skin aging and cancer). It also will not come off easily if you get wet or sweat a lot.    In fact, it will not come off easily, period. Even after a shower were I thoroughly wash all areas I applied the sunscreen, the slight sunscreen smell will linger for at least 24 hours. And it&#x27;s no easier to apply than it is to remove, especially if you have any body hair. The consistency of the product is almost like glue or paste. It helps a little bit to wet your skin before applying, but not much, and this practice may reduce the effectiveness of the product. Whatever I do, it takes lots of work to rub it in completely, and there will always be a slight white tint when all is said and done.    Since I use the product mostly for tennis, not for swimming, I probably won&#x27;t be buying it again. It&#x27;s just not practical for frequent use. It&#x27;s ideal if you have minimal body hair and want to use it for the occasional day at the beach. It really won&#x27;t come off in the water, and you probably won&#x27;t mind taking some extra time to apply it.</li>
            <li> Works well. Goes on a bit creamy. Need to work it in.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen is amazing in terms of keeping your skin from breaking out and keeping the sun from burning you, but it&#x27;s hard to work into the skin being a different chemical than the other easier stuff. It will eventually rub in, just takes a long time.</li>
            <li> My skin still had a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is rated very well on EWGs database. Smooth, light consistency. Great for adults and kids! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Used this on myself and my very sensitive son every day at the pool. It stays on great. No rash or itches. No sunburns either and we have fair skin. It wasn&#x27;t greasy or slimy but it wasn&#x27;t transparent either. It&#x27;s white and you can see where you have applied it. Once you rub it in and it soaks in there&#x27;s a hint of white. My youngest has texture issues but never once fussed about this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this again next summer.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen it goes on nice and doesn&#x27;t have the powerful &#x27;sunscreen smell&#x27; that I hate.</li>
            <li> This applies very easily and provided great protection for my wife who burns rather easily.  We used this along with a couple other sunblocks in the south Caribbean and this was the far easiest to apply evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This contains both &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;physical&amp;#34; sunblock ingredients which gives you the advantages of easier application, less ghostly appearance, and less waxy (chemical) and far better UVA protection (physical).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:  If you don&#x27;t like pure &amp;#34;physical&amp;#34; sunblocks due to the thickness, the pasty look, or the waxy residue and don&#x27;t mind using &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; sunblock, then this is a great choice that gives you the best of both worlds with little compromise.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen for a trip to the beach after reading about it on EWG. I think this might be the worst sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. I applied it liberally on my first day before going out to the beach. Yes, it goes on VERY thick and white, but I expected that. I admit that I wasn&#x27;t as diligent as I normally am about reapplying on that first day, since it&#x27;s such a goopy mess to apply, particularly once you have sand on you, and I did get a couple of pink spots on my chest and shoulder. So, from that day forward, I applied and reapplied diligently each day, but noticed that my cheeks, chests and arm were getting more red and itchy after a day or two. My skin also felt very dry and it&#x27;s next to impossible to scrub this stuff off in the shower. By time I left the beach, my skin was dry, red, bumpy and itchy. After doing a little online research, I suspect that I may have had an allergic reaction to octinoxate (the first ingredient listed on the package). My symptoms sound very similar to everything I read about reactions to octinoxate. To top it all off, all of the new swimsuits I bought for the trip are now stained white stripes of zinc oxide, and possibly ruined. This stuff is going straight into the garbage. My experience with it was completely awful.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well and stings the eyes</li>
            <li> I used this sunscreen on my kids over the last year occasionally without any problems.  It is very thick and leaves a white-ish cast which I think is ok because it seems to be more effective than many other highly rated sunscreens.  (Don&#x27;t put on your face if you have a little stubble, looks horrible and doesn&#x27;t rub in.)  However, our whole family used it over the last week, for our lake vacation with horrible results.  We applied 2 times per day as we were outside and swimming most of the day.  After a few days we all had extremely dry skin, and were itching all over as a result.  I&#x27;m really disappointed since I like the coverage it gives.</li>
            <li> I did not use it yet, this is for my friend, It seems is a good one.  It seems is a good one</li>
            <li> I considered this sunblock because it has low toxicity (as per EWG site). It works fine in avoiding sunburn, but it is a pain to spread.  We end up all white even after been rubbing in for a while.</li>
            <li> I almost never leave any product review because I do not have much spare time. But I have to warn other people from buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I have sensitive skin. My skin looks normal but I get rashes for no reason, and have sun allergy, and a few eczema spots. I used to have horrible worts all over my hands and feet. I would like to avoid using UV all over my body, however, because of my sun allergy I have to use it on daily basis. This Coppertone is the worst sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. Although I did not have any bad reaction to it, I was stressed out by this product. First of all, It is so hard to wash off!!!! I was never able to wash it cleanly off my body. And the residue felt pretty stifling and bad sitting on my skin after the showers. The bottle did not state any expiration date or ingredients. Also this sunscreen smelled stale, like bad yogurt. I wanted to return it but used about half the bottle so I just threw it out.</li>
            <li> Very good sun block,  I would recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen really doesn&#x27;t leave stains on your clothes.  Highly recommend .</li>
            <li> Wear this every day under my makeup and over my moisturizer to prevent/reduce dark spots on my face.  I also put it on the back of my hands.</li>
            <li> Unlike some sunscreens that contain zinc, this one goes on easily and the white virtually disappears. It stands up well under normal circumstances but I don&#x27;t think I would use it for swimming. As far as I can tell, it works well at protecting your skin, but I usually wear a hat and don&#x27;t stay out in the sun a long time.</li>
            <li> UPDATE 07/28/2015: I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now, maybe a month or so, and I&#x27;m starting to like it a bit more. It makes my face look really pretty, naturally, and even after I wash my face at night, I can see a more even toned facial color. I think the zinc oxide is finally helping with evening out my skin tone and not letting me tan as severely than if I went out without this on. I read about how to apply a sunscreen/sunblock correctly, and it turns out that I&#x27;ve been applying it sort of wrong. If you are wearing a sunscreen (that uses chemical blockers), you have to apply that under your lotions and makeup, and wait 20-30 minutes before going outside to let the product sink in and protect you. Sunblocks (that uses physical blockers) must be worn on top of your lotions and under your makeup, and it works immediately before you go out. Coppertone Sensitive Skin Lotion SPF 50 is a mixture of both physical and chemical blockers, so the article states that I should wait at least 15-20 minutes before going outside so that the product can properly sink in and give me a protective layer.  I think I will use this product up and will only buy it again if I need a nice zinc oxide sunscreen in a pinch and don&#x27;t have a lot of money to splurge sunscreen-Cadillacs like La Roche Posay or BurnOut. So, I&#x27;m bumping this up with another star until further notice! :-)  ORIGINAL REVIEW: It goes on very nicely. Doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of chalkiness behind, though a pale tint is to be expected. It makes the skin on my face look SO NICE, like if I was wearing foundation. It is not greasy at all and it is easy to apply and blend. Today, I went to the pool with my little sister and applied the exposed area with this product, confident that I won&#x27;t get tanned. I was happy during swimming in the pool, and I even reapplied once after around 80 minutes. Well... when I got home and took off my bathing suit, I was shocked to see very deep tanning lines everywhere. That means I tanned from thesun, which is a big no no for me. I was so sure that I could protect myself from the sun, to no avail. The skin on my shoulders look dried out due to the sun damaged I&#x27;ve received today. It helped with burning, but then again, I have the skin type that doesn&#x27;t burn much under the sun, but I do tan ridiculously easy.  The only thing I can do now is finish the product up while I&#x27;m at home. It is a nice product, and it might be of aid to very fair skinned people who burn at the drop of the hat. But for those of us who aren&#x27;t into the tanned look, personally, this is not the product. I like that it makes my face look smooth and pretty. I guess I&#x27;ll have to find another product to protect me from tanning. I do have one theory as to why it happened to me and why it might happen to someone else; this is not a pure sunBLOCK. Sunblocks use mineral blocks, such as zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide, and it completely blocks the sun from your skin, and people have success in not burning and tanning with it. Sunscreen, on the other hand, uses chemicals, and I even read this in a medical book that sunscreens prevents burning, but not tanning. This product uses zinc oxide, yes, but a long list of chemical screens in it too. It reminds me of what happened to that once holy grail sunblock BurnOut Eco Sensitive Zinc Oxide Sunscreen that many people loved. It used to be a pure block... but then they added chemical screens, and it suddenly became the worst product since people burned and tanned through it, ruining their skin in the process.  If anybody out there is reading this, and knows a very good sunblock that uses zinc oxide, please drop me a line. I hope the above information can help someone who is wondering about the difference between a sunblock and a sunscreen. Two very different products, I promise!  UPDATE: BurnOut has created a new sunblock called &amp;#34;BurnOut Broad Spectrum SPF 30 For Face &amp; Body&amp;#34;, it is supposedly the same as their old zinc oxide sunblock, and it isnice for days out where you won&#x27;t be sweating or swimming.</li>
            <li> We used this sunscreen for hikining the hot sun.  WE also use it for the kids when they go to the beach and play outside in the pool. We were able to avoid sun burn and skin darkening.  The best part is that this sun screen is water proof and it stays on for hours.  The only down side is when used on African American skin, it gives a bluish hue to the skin and you look quite silly.  Use sparingly if you want to avoid looking neon blue.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my dermatologist because of its zinc oxide content.  I have had all 3 types of skin cancers which have been surgically removed. One type would have killed me if it had not been caught in time. Zinc oxide gives the best protection from deep penetrating sun rays.</li>
            <li> I could not find this product in the retail stores.  I have been using sensitive SPF 30 moisturizer (Coppertone) for years when my dermatologist recommended it after a skin cancer treatment.  I thought they discontinued it.  It lasts all day long under my makeup.</li>
            <li> This product did not smell at all which was great.  The downside was it was extremely sticky and never soaked into skin.  I&#x27;m a bit disappointed with Coppertone.  I have not had this problem with their product in years past.</li>
            <li> After discovering I am allergic to traditional sunscreens I carefully tried this one. It doesn&#x27;t totally absorb and make my skin look even more pale but it&#x27;s better than getting burned or breaking out on top of sunburn. Once you get over how thick it is, it works well. Stays on nicely too.</li>
            <li> The product is good for my sensitive skin but I feel that it kind of blocks the breathe of my skin. It needs a little time to absorb. It will takes me some time before I could update my review since I would like to see its effect in a long way.</li>
            <li> If you apply too much, this will leave a silver/white coating on you skin.  A little bit goes a long way and rubs in completely and will offer near or complete protection from the sun.  Make sure you apply it over all areas of exposed skin.  It will be obvious where you missed a spot.  A little greasy, yes but was never an issue.  Yes you need a little moe effort to rub it in.  Not much effort.  Good stuff. Works well, not expensive, avoids all the stuff (chemicals) many of the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; sun protectants use.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen works really well for my 4-yr old. But for my 1.5 yr old, it caused her skin to be bumpy and rough. I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s because the protection isn&#x27;t strong enough and exposure to the sun caused the roughness or if she&#x27;s having some sort of reaction to the lotion itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll will keep using for my 4-yr since this particular sunscreen is recommended as being less toxic than the usual sunblock, but I plan to try another sunscreen from the recommended list for my younger child.</li>
            <li> It has all the characteristics that my dermatologist told me to look for.&lt;br /&gt;I work in a day camp and use it on my arms, neck and ears and it truly works all day.</li>
            <li> Having researched a bit on sunscreen, EWG rates this as one of their &#x27;approved&#x27; sunscreens for 2013.  I was astonished to find that many of the name brands in sunscreen did not have qualifying products.  This was one of the few that was from a brand I recognized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen works as described.  The only caveat is that this sunscreen is VERY difficult to rub in.  I&#x27;ve found that this is a recurring issue with &#x27;quality&#x27; sunscreens, so I didn&#x27;t deduct any points.  It takes longer to apply, but the comfort of knowing it will truly protect from harmful sunlight makes it worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife because we do quite a bit of fishing, and I hate it when she burns because she&#x27;s allergic to most sunscreen. I don&#x27;t know, yet, if it was a good investment because the package has yet to be opened. I will write a follow-up to this review when the product is used, but for now I will say that I got the sunscreen quickly and it was sealed. So far, so good. And I did get the product in a timely manner. I figure if it&#x27;s a garbage product the burden lies on Coppertone&#x27;s shoulders, not this dealer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This review is for Coppertone Sensitive Skin Lotion (year 2015)  I was looking for an overnight cream to combat ACNE.  I researched for two days on line.  The amount of contradictory information between the product producers vs the users on what works is staggering.  I finally decided to listen to the users.  Then I went back to find scientific reasons why the users were right.  The TWO ingredients that I found had the best reviews  were ZINC OXIDE and SULFUR.  Both had been claimed to clear up the most severe acne quickly and without  discomfort.  Scientifically speaking:  &amp;#34;Acne is basically tiny infections in skin pores.The bacteria that cause the infection are on every ones skin. They feed off of the oils that our skin makes to stay healthy. Excess oil also causes the dead skin cells to stick together and block the pores, so oily skin is more prone to acne.&amp;#34;  Zinc oxide is thought to reduce the production of these oils (called sebum; a light yellow, oily fluid that keeps the skin and hair moisturized).  Also,  Inflammation and dryness ( meaning having  dead skin cells on the skin&#x27;s surface)  actually causes skin to produce more sebum and thus give you more clogged pores.  So keeping your skin moisturized and calm was what some said to be very important in treating acne prone skin.  And this product does both..  Zinc Oxide is a great moisturizer, a sebum reducer, and it has anti inflammatory qualities.  Coppertone Sensitive Skin broad spectrum SPF 50  had the highest amount of ZINC OXIDE I could find in a sunscreen lotion  14.5% !  That&#x27;s more than Desitin Diaper Rash Cream (which is 13%) . Sulfur is the second ingredient I choose.  It is said to  work &amp;#34;by making your very top layers of skin dry and peel off. The lower levels of your skin are alive, but the top layers are dead, so this does not hurt. This can unclog the pores, reduce the oil, and reduce the acne.&amp;#34;  The SECOND thing sulfur does is kill the  bacteria.  What I noticed was that the sulfur can do this very quickly WITHOUT irritating the skin (like other ingredients can do.)  I also noticed that instead of making those big white heads and bumps bursting and leaving scars, they just shrank away or shrank releasing a small amount of stuff and a small, healthy looking pore.  (NOTE: I read that deliberately  popping pimples is a NO NO.)  SO THIS IS WHAT I DID ......MIX Coppertone Sensitive Skin lotion with PURE SULFUR  purchased off of Amanzon. ( I am going to try and put a link here.)  search Amazon for &amp;#34;Braunfels Labs Sulfur Powder&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s a 2 oz.  white jar with a white lid and  black label. It&#x27;s good quality and more than enough for making skin care lotions.    DO NOT purchase a big bag of sulfur used for gardening to use on your skin!   Although sulfur is safe to ingest DO NOT do so unless under a Dr.&#x27;s supervision.  And like any fine powder, like baby powder,  you should avoid inhaling it or getting the powder in your eyes.   Mix  2 t  Coppertone Sensitive Skin lotion with  1/4 t  Pure Sulfur  (For larger batch use  8 t  Coppertone Sensitive Skin lotion  with  1 t sulfur)  That should give you a lotion with 10% sulfur I think.  My teenagers  wear the mix  overnight on the areas where they have breakouts.  Sometimes they also wear the Coppertone lotion by itself on their entire back or face as well to keep new acne from appearing.  It&#x27;s really been working great.  It can also be worn during the day on breakouts.  You&#x27;ll need to rub it in.  If the sulfur smell during the day bothers you &amp;#34;DHC Acne Spot Therapy&amp;#34; cream is a good choice for daytime wear.  It has 3% sulfur.(see my review)  Or mix your own with the Coppertone lotion and half the sulfur.  NOTE:  Neither sulfur or zinc oxide damage clothing.  If you wear the mix it heavily you may need to hand wash it out of your clothes with hand soap, baby shampoo or dish washing liquid before you laundry it.  Otherwise you may notice a sulfur smell in that part of your clothing even afterit&#x27;s been laundered.  It&#x27;s worth it though!

            <li> My favorite mineral sunscreen for the body.  We go to the beach every week and my husband is really fair.  This is the best physical sunscreen out there.  He also uses it when jogging outside in the summer.  (I rarely use it.  He looks about 5 years younger than me).</li>
            <li> I spent most of my adult life shying away from nude beaches because I would get sunburned in the most intimate of places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other suntan lotions would give me a rash on those areas. It ended up effecting my love life, because women would see the rash and think I had an STD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I started using this product, I&#x27;ve had the best of both worlds! I am able to frequent nude beaches without the fear of burning my taint, and the lotion does not leave a rash in the sensitive places so my love life is back on track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thank you Coppertone for making this product, and so do the ladies.</li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive hypoallergenic skin, skip this product. I bought it recently and tried it this weekend. Within hours of putting it on my face, neck, and chest I had very itchy raised welts on both cheeks, my neck, and my chest. They were so itchy, I had to go out and purchase hydrocortisone and take Benadryl. The next morning, the areas that had been itchy were still somewhat red and burned. I will not use this product again.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and acne-prone skin, and most sunblock makes my eyes sting after a few hours. This one absorbs well (no greasy or shiny residue), doesn&#x27;t bother my skin or cause break-outs, is unscented, and, best of all, it doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes, even when I&#x27;m washing it off at the end of the day. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> i CANNOT wear this alone! it&#x27;s too thick to blend in. I have to use an oil based moisturizer first before I apply this and that&#x27;s not good because on makeup days, even with primer, my makeup is too slippery and does not last! it&#x27;s good for a natural look but if applied alone u will be pale as a mofo! I have a yellow tint to my skin so i find that when i apply oil (EVOO) and then this and let it sit for 30 min or so then it will look nice ( i have clear skin FYI) but I will look 2 toned and if u do a light dusting of powder over it after it sets, it looks really nice! I just don&#x27;t like it on those full blown makeup look days...i love how it is hazardous 2 out of 10 according to EWG.org but other than that, I am still on the search for a low hazard product for moisture and SPF...I have hit 30 BTW and my skin is QUENCHING FOR THIRST lol it&#x27;s really dry (hence it being winter now)...if anyone knows of such a great product that&#x27;s great on those makeup days then please feel free to drop a line &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> This would be something that Casper or Powder would use as it is super thick sunscreen that leaves you pale white.  This is not a good sunscreen for fashion conscience beach goers as you&#x27;ll look a bit silly, but I am pale and it protects me well.</li>
            <li> This is the really thick white paste fyi.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to affordable and effective sunscreen. Check out its ratings on the Consumer working Group&#x27;s Sunscreen Guide. It gets great reviews! Zinc sunscreen (a physical barrier) is better for your skin that those sunscreens that are purely a chemical barrier.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that since it was for sensitive skin and zinc oxide based that it wouldn&#x27;t have a strong chemical smell, but that was not the case.  I put a small amount on my arms to try it out. 24 hours and 2 showers later, I can still smell it.</li>
            <li> Works great and lasts and a long time. Takes a bit of time to soak in.</li>
            <li> Coppertone sunscreen otion, Sensitive skin, 50 SPF, stays put in water and no reaction from sensitive skin. Goes on well and is greasless.</li>
            <li> unlike the neutrogena &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; product, this one didn&#x27;t cause my arms and neck to have red, puffy blotches.  staying with this product for good.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best sunscreens I have found for both sensitive skin and great sun protection.  My daughter works 8+hours a day in the sun and dirt and this product keeps her from burning and does not cause break outs on her face.</li>
            <li> Love the product. I think 50 SPF is quite enough protection for a moderate sunny day. I bought it for a trip overseas to India. Well suited for the hot weather there. Gave it 4 stars because the quantity is less for the price.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended with my fair and acne prone skin to use this product (because its basically zinc oxide concentrated) on my face.  I thought it would be really greasy, but its not.  In my morning routing, I put on some Murad skin perfect lotion first, then this stuff, and then a mattifier to prevent &amp;#34;shininess&amp;#34;. This stuff is great.  No longer do I feel like I get burnt through makeup.  It does require re-application if you are hanging out in the sun all day or at the beach or sweating up a storm, but nothing but success here with it so far.  Its not too thick or smelly and goes on really easy.  I thank my dermatologist for recommending it, and this bottle will go a long way in these hot summer months!</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for my wife and she uses it when out in the sun at the beach.  A little more difficult to sink into skin, but well worth the effort. Would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic skin, after use is very moist, the effect is very good, suitable for summer use. Very good, recommended the use of</li>
            <li> Too chalky for my preference, but works fine.</li>
            <li> I like the zinc oxide component of this product although it takes a bit getting used to the opacity. One can work it into the skin until the product is only slightly visible however.</li>
            <li> I developed an allergy to chemical sunscreens last year and had to switch to zinc/titanium oxide based sunscreens to avoid nightly hives outbreaks. I&#x27;ve tried several brands and they all work well. This Coppertone Sensitive can be purchased for about $1.25/oz. if you shop around which is a great value for this type of sunscreen. I work out four days a week in the sun so it&#x27;s nice to find a cost effective zinc/titanium oxide based sunscreen. It does have a sort of chemical odor to it so I personally use it on my arms/legs and use Blue Lizard Faces on my face (which has no odor.) To reduce the whitish cast of this type of sunscreen I normally apply, wait 10-15 minutes, and rub it into the skin some more.</li>
            <li> Hey, if the Environmental Working Group says it&#x27;s safe, it&#x27;s safe!  Smells nice, works well.  You&#x27;ve gotta spend several seconds rubbing it in to avoid that white look, but it&#x27;s that fact that it provides a physical barrier that makes it safe.  (Lots of sunscreens contain micro-particles that go right through cell membranes in our bodies, this one doesn&#x27;t.)</li>
            <li> I am light skinned and freckle and live.in the tropics. This is a great body sunblock that actually works. It does sweat off on the face and burns the eyes. I recommend using vertra face stick for your face and this for the rest of you . The vertra is $$$ but it never sweats off. Split the difference use both and save your skin!</li>
            <li> Ok, so sunscreens with zinc oxide do leave a residue, you just have to rub a lot. I like the amount in the bottle and feel safe under the sun!</li>
            <li> I love the product....... its great........no stickyness.......no bad smell....... mostvof all no irritation now I can go outside and enjoy the sunB-)</li>
            <li> Very protective. It is the serious zinc kind so you just need to take a couple more minutes rubbing it in so it is transparent.</li>
            <li> i love this product. i will buy again</li>
            <li> See my review for the smaller bottle.  THE BEST!!!!  I would never use anything else.  Try it you&#x27;ll like it!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for a trip to Costa Rica.  I have sensitive skin and needed something gentle. I also wanted something without fragrance since I was going to be spending a lot of time in the jungle and didn&#x27;t want to attract insects.  Product arrived on time and worked beautifully.  Not too greasy, great sun protection.  Not sure how waterproof it is -- the product probably wasn&#x27;t designed for torrential downpours in the rainforest. :-)</li>
