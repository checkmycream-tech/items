            <li>Good product and service.</li>

            <li>Looks nice.</li>
            <li>Using and enjoying it.</li>
            <li>You can put your powder or cornstarch in the dish and use the puff that way, it works out so much better.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have found this.</li>
            <li>I just might order more for gift giving.</li>
            <li>For the money, I&#x27;m ok with it.</li>
            <li>I bought to put Baby Powder in and was glad it came with the powder puff as well.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty sitting on my bathroom counter, and holds a fair amount of powder.  </li>
            <li>It holds plenty of powder, and comes with a good puff that is capable of picking up even talcum powder (as opposed to cornstarch).  </li>
            <li>A gift for special sister birthday!</li>
            <li>Super cute and suits the purpose.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think I will need to replace it for at least 6 - 10 years as the one provided is of excellent quality and is machine washable.</li>
            <li>I filled the jar with talcum powder, the powder puff picks up just the right amount of talcum for dusting myself before getting dressed.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Elegant, feminine, and no mess.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday, its a very nice set for the price.</li>
            <li>This is a small, attractive powder dish that will be at home on any vanity.  </li>
            <li>Both pieces are glass and they are exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Looks quite pretty sitting on my bureau.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>And I love the pink color.</li>

            <li> B002ZW3FNA WHITE Silky Powder Puff 4.5 Inch (12cm) in a Pretty Satin Bag]]</li>
            <li> No mess .</li>
            <li> It looks much more expensive than it was and has a very 1950s vibe to it.</li>
            <li> my top is broken and i dont know who to talk to ????</li>
            <li> The seller packaged it very carefully and shipped it fast.</li>
            <li> I think if they were to modify it just slightly so that it was easier to grasp the (comparatively heavy) lid without fear of dropping and breaking it, it would be a very positive thing.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I definitely recommend this to anyone who buys powder in quantity so that it needs to be put into a dish or other holder and refilled from time to time.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no indentation where the knob meets the lid, and if your hands are dry due to the powder you&#x27;re using, the lid can slip through your fingers.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes old fashioned items should not be so hard to find as they still are applicable to this day and age.</li>
            <li> Harder to lift lid.  </li>
            <li> One issue I have discovered is that because the handle is tapered, and powder tends to get on and around this dish, it is difficult to lift the lid--my fingers slip right off.</li>
            <li> My only complaint with this dish is the &amp;#34;knob&amp;#34; on the lid.  </li>
            <li> Works well with powder, less mess and waste  than shaking it out of a container.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy glass, so it&#x27;s not going anywhere unless you INTEND to move it.  </li>
            <li> No more powder mess in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> like it if it wasnt broken ;(</li>

            <li> Both pieces are glass and they are exactly what I was expecting. I am so glad to have found this. Sometimes old fashioned items should not be so hard to find as they still are applicable to this day and age. Now I don&#x27;t have to wash and dig out the powder from under my nails after application. I ordered an extra puff but I don&#x27;t think I will need to replace it for at least 6 - 10 years as the one provided is of excellent quality and is machine washable. Looks quite pretty sitting on my bureau. I just might order more for gift giving.

            <li> A gift for special sister birthday!</li>
            <li> perfect dish, very elegant</li>
            <li> This item is not quality I thought it would.  It gets the job done, but isn&#x27;t like my grandmothers powder puff, which is what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> I received what I was supposed to. Delivery was prompt.  The puff is good size and quality.  The puff and dish are a good combination.  For the money, I&#x27;m ok with it.</li>
            <li> This is pretty sitting on my bathroom counter, and holds a fair amount of powder.  One issue I have discovered is that because the handle is tapered, and powder tends to get on and around this dish, it is difficult to lift the lid--my fingers slip right off. I have to tilt the lid so I can put my hand under it to lift it without the handle. This is really annoying, but I am happy I can buy the powder I want and still apply it with a puff.</li>
            <li> I filled the jar with talcum powder, the powder puff picks up just the right amount of talcum for dusting myself before getting dressed.</li>
            <li> This is a small, attractive powder dish that will be at home on any vanity.
