            <li>I&#x27;ve since tried mixing it with my Got2Be Curling Foam and got a better result, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay this much for this product again.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product that provides hold for my curls without being too stiff or crunchy.  </li>

            <li>This cream does absolutely nothing for my wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>so this cream really helped hold my curls.</li>
            <li>I know the price is a bit high</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t perform as advertised, but that could be due to my particular hair type, which is naturally curly, but somewhat fine.</li>

            <li> I saw good results with using it on my hair. I have AA hair-4A-very thick which has been damaged by heat. I have one side that needs some TLC with curling. Once I cut out the heat damage, I will see great results with this product. My other side of my hair curls up nicely with the product. I recognize that it not the product but more my hair challenges at this point.I also use the phyto 7 with it for moisture or the relaxing balm for frizz.</li>
            <li> I have used literally dozens of products on my damp hair and then left it to air dry.  This is by far the best of all I have tried.

            <li> This is a very good product. I have used it several times now and it does help with the body and curls.</li>
            <li> It seems like this product has been sitting around for a while.  When I pump it, it has a strong odor and the cream is yellow, not the usual white.  I had to buy another one locally because it just smelled so bad.</li>
            <li> Not so &amp;#34;Curl Energizing&amp;#34; for me. No problem at all wth the speed of delivery, which was great. Only issue is with the product itself. It didn&#x27;t perform as advertised, but that could be due to my particular hair type, which is naturally curly, but somewhat fine. It was very difficult to comb through/detangle my wet hair after application, and  I had that halo of frizzies the next day after using this.

            <li> My hair is curly and frizzy. Phyto Curl Energizing Cream helps tame down the frizz and lets me have the soft curls.</li>
            <li> Product was as ordered</li>
            <li> Bought it originally at the salon on the stylist&#x27;s recommendation- always on the lookout for my curly/ sometimes frizzy hair.  Need to use 2-3 \\&quot;quarter-size-\\&quot; squirts AND comb it through before finger scrunching it . Sometimes air dry, sometimes a 3 min blow dry with a diffuser.Have used it for a year now and it&#x27;s the only product I use- love it!</li>
            <li> Love this styling cream.  I have thin, wavy hair and this gives my hair volume without being sticky.  I no longer need hairspray!</li>
            <li> I have thinning hair and definitely need a stying product.  Anything I have ever used has always turned my hair sticky and/or stiff.  Phyto Pro Curl Energizing Cream is perfect for my hair.  Just one pump rubbed through my hair gives my hair great body and keeps is nice and soft.  No need for hairspray any longer either.  Love this product and this is a great price from this seller.</li>
            <li> I used to be a Bumble and bumble junkie but this stuff is even better. It gives my nature curls definition and bounce but isn&#x27;t sticky or thick and doesn&#x27;t weigh the curl down. It smells faint but nice. It&#x27;s my new go-to curl cream.</li>
            <li> as usual the phyto comes through&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend these products to anyone who wants to look great&lt;br /&gt;buy it</li>

            <li> I love this product. It does not lay heavy on my hair or freeze it in place like hair spray. It defines the curls.&lt;br /&gt; The order was on time and well packaged. I will definitely buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> This product leaves a residue on my hair every time I&#x27;ve used it.  I&#x27;ve tried it three times, on wet hair, dry hair that was a few days old and dry hair that was freshly shampooed...it left residue that looked like little white beads in my hair each time.  What a waste! It went in the trash!</li>

            <li> Great product!! I truly recommend it to anyone that has curly hair. It gives you good definition. It does not make your hair stiff, but rather managable curls.  Try it. Its a white cream, with no scent. Also it does not have harsh chemicals that can damage or dry out your hair.</li>

            <li> Wonderful! I use it all the time to help my curls!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly light even with a cream like texture.  Two pumps, spread evenly on hair and scrunch on the low maintenance days.  Does not have a &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; texture when dry.  Hair is soft- not sticky.  So far - so good...  :)</li>
