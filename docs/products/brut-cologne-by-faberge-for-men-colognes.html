            <li>Everything is good in Amazon.com and AAAMerchand.  </li>

            <li>I LIKED THE SMELL OF  BRUTE AND WOULD RECOMMENDED TO EVERYONE.THE SMELL OF THE COLOGNE</li>
            <li>Love this product and the bottle is  gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>but if someone hugs you they will get a nice smell of this stuff, and compliment you.</li>
            <li>I USED FOR MANY YEARS.  </li>
            <li>Either you love the smell or you do not.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s the real deal and is a truly great price in terms of cost per ounce.</li>
            <li>It smells better and lasts longer then the Brut that comes in a plastic bottle.</li>
            <li>Brut was Elvis&#x27;s favorite fragrance, and this size container is not a misprint.  </li>
            <li>I use the Brut as a nice scent to spray in the house to keep it nice and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Brut for many years.</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments when wearing Brut Cologne.</li>
            <li>I BEEN USING BRUT FOR MORE THAT 45 YEARS, TO</li>
            <li>Loved the smell as a teenager - not so much now!</li>
            <li>Worth the price !!</li>
            <li>This was HUGE and alcoholicky smelling, except bourbon would have smelled better.  </li>
            <li>I LOVEd it then in younger  years and still LOVE it now !</li>
            <li>This container is huge, repeat huge.</li>
            <li>So buying a huge size made sense.</li>
            <li>this is a huge bottle so oz per oz if you use the stuff</li>
            <li>Those who have not tried Brut should buy the smallest size first or better yet, check it out in a drug store before buying.</li>
            <li>Brut&#x27;s unique smell encourages being close.</li>
            <li>I find the old school colognes (Brut, Old Spice) to b a good change of pace and most people will comment on it as nice and ask what it is as no longer main stream cologne.  </li>
            <li>I have sweet memories from Brut  Cologne from my 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I love this scent so much.</li>
            <li>My wife and I laughed out loud the first time I ordered this.  </li>
            <li>even in us married folk!  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the huge size.</li>
            <li>but i do like the fresh smell</li>
            <li>If Brut is one of your most used or daily cologne, I recommend buying this size as you save money and the stuff does not spoil.  </li>
            <li>is right for the large bottle.</li>
            <li>I use it consistently and never tire of the fragrance,,Thank you</li>
            <li>( first applied it at 3 in the afternoon</li>
            <li>the aroma in this one is a lot better and there has actually been some thought and work put into executing this version of Brut, so much so that for the price you pay for this bottle</li>
            <li>This smells great - maybe not exactly like back in the day, but very close.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine ever needing to buy another since it was so large.  </li>
            <li>This is a HUGE bottle, like having a liquor bottle out on my counter, so if that&#x27;s a concern then buy a smaller version.  </li>
            <li>And who really made it?</li>
            <li>Brut Cologne for Men is available in several sizes, splash or spray -</li>
            <li>It is just not as intense as I remember from what I bought decades ago.  </li>
            <li>What can I really say it&#x27;s Brut</li>
            <li>The bottle is large - very large - and will impress most and even shock a few.</li>
            <li>This Brut By Faberge Cologne Splash, is nothing like the original Brut Cologne, much weaker, much less aromatic than the original.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say if this is the &amp;#34; original &amp;#34; or &amp;#34; Classic &amp;#34; Brut, I bought 3 bottles of &amp;#34; original &amp;#34; or &amp;#34; Classic &amp;#34; Brut in a foreign country 9 years ago, so I REALLY DON&#x27;T REMEMBER THE SMELL (</li>
            <li>The classic Brut fragrance in a large bottle.  </li>
            <li>Will keep ordering it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>LOVE HAVING THE BIG BOTTLE TO PUT SOME IN SMALLER BOTTLE TO TRAVEL WITH.</li>
            <li>to is buy a bottle of the &amp;#34; Classic &amp;#34; version ( the 3oz bottle ) and see if there is any difference...</li>
            <li>people say can you find a bigger bottle and laugh When it is wrapped it looks like a bottle of wine</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know the old Brut or the new Brut smell.</li>
            <li>Further, the top was slightly ajar when it arrived and some of the contents spilled into the packagine.  </li>
            <li>Clearly a misrepresentation in  my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Bought bulk size for reasonable price and spread contents over various smaller spray bottles for gym etc.  </li>
            <li>Nothing like the original Brut Cologne I&#x27;ve used in the past but can no longer find in my area (Danville,Pa.</li>
            <li>But, surprised to see this big.</li>
            <li>Generally, I&#x27;ll buy a small Brut spray and then use the large bottle for refills.</li>

            <li> I got tired of always buying the little bottles of Brut</li>
            <li> If you use Brut just from time to time or not at all, this is not a good buy for you.</li>
            <li> BUT I WAS NOT HAPPY WHEN I RECEIVED THE PRODUCT FROM AAA COMPANY.  </li>
            <li> With this you can not go wrong with the ladies.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I USED FOR MANY YEARS.  I STILL LIKE THE BRUT PRODUCT.  BUT I WAS NOT HAPPY WHEN I RECEIVED THE PRODUCT FROM AAA COMPANY.  CUSTOMER SERVICE SOLVED THE PROBLEM.  I RECOMMEND TO BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne....always has....always will!!! Thanks for the huge size.</li>
            <li> What can I say about Brut? Either you love the smell or you do not. This container is huge, repeat huge. I bought it because my son also uses it and unlike me, he seems to use it by the quart. So buying a huge size made sense. If Brut is one of your most used or daily cologne, I recommend buying this size as you save money and the stuff does not spoil.  If you use Brut just from time to time or not at all, this is not a good buy for you. Those who have not tried Brut should buy the smallest size first or better yet, check it out in a drug store before buying. If you like it you can then go for the bigger containers. No complaints</li>
            <li> Espatacular, extraordinário e muito economico comprar na Amazon.com  Meu produto chegou no Brasil em perfeito estado.   Everything is good in Amazon.com and AAAMerchand.  I thank you all.  Lucio[[ASIN:B000C1VWJU Brut By Faberge For Men. Cologne Splash 25.6 Oz.]]</li>
            <li> Price is very low when compared with local market. I wonder why? And who really made it? Gray market price or imitation? I migh be wrong, but something is strange.</li>
            <li> I LOVEd it then in younger  years and still LOVE it now ! I will use this till I die .</li>
            <li> Brut Cologne for Men, by Faberge, is a man&#x27;s cologne - but designed with us women in mind.  My husband doesn&#x27;t buy it, I buy it for him (Me)! If it were up to him, he&#x27;d still be wearing that stuff with the ship on the bottle!  Brut&#x27;s unique smell encourages being close. It doesn&#x27;t enter the room well in advance of its wearer - then linger to drive people away. Close is good... even in us married folk!  Brut Cologne for Men is available in several sizes, splash or spray - but I like the value I get buying the 25.6 Oz bottle from Amazon.com.  Generally, I&#x27;ll buy a small Brut spray and then use the large bottle for refills.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my dad, he loves this stuff. His last bottle lasted him for two years.</li>
            <li> This was HUGE and alcoholicky smelling, except bourbon would have smelled better.  I gave it away.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay attention to size. But, surprised to see this big. Worth the price !!</li>
            <li> LOVE HAVING THE BIG BOTTLE TO PUT SOME IN SMALLER BOTTLE TO TRAVEL WITH. ITS A  GREAT VALUE AND WILL REORDER WHEN ITS GONE. HUSBANDS FAVORITE.&lt;br /&gt;SHIRLEY</li>
            <li> My husband used this cologne years ago and I purchased it as a joke.  Well the joke is on me.  He loves it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband who has been using Brut for years people know hes been in the room by the scent--when he opens it up people say can you find a bigger bottle and laugh When it is wrapped it looks like a bottle of wine but he knows what it is  Will keep ordering it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> A little old for my taste but i do like the fresh smell.. used it 3 years ago.. now it kinda just sits on my desk.. probably will never use it all in this life time lol..</li>
            <li> The bottle is really, really big.  Brut just works for me.  I will buy this size again.</li>
            <li> 25oz  bottle sounds like alot of calogne,  tust me it IS HUGE this is like a life time supply for 1 person lol,</li>
            <li> I LIKED THE SMELL OF  BRUTE AND WOULD RECOMMENDED TO EVERYONE.THE SMELL OF THE COLOGNE COMES OFF LIKE A TASTE OF MIDDAY SUN.</li>
            <li> I got tired of always buying the little bottles of Brut and when I saw this bottle on line, I immediately purchased it.  I can&#x27;t imagine ever needing to buy another since it was so large.  The price was very good and the service and delivery were excellent.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I have sweet memories from Brut  Cologne from my 70&#x27;s. I like the 25 ounce bottle and pricing is right for the large bottle.</li>
            <li> The bottle is large - very large - and will impress most and even shock a few. But it&#x27;s the real deal and is a truly great price in terms of cost per ounce. Buy it and enjoy...and pass it on in your will...because you will never, ever use this bottle up.</li>
            <li> This Brut By Faberge Cologne Splash, is nothing like the original Brut Cologne, much weaker, much less aromatic than the original.  Clearly a misrepresentation in  my opinion.  Nothing like the original Brut Cologne I&#x27;ve used in the past but can no longer find in my area (Danville,Pa.</li>
            <li> My fiance loves the original Brut and won&#x27;t wear anything else so this is perfect! It smells better and lasts longer then the Brut that comes in a plastic bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the bottle is  gorgeous.  It smells divine and lasts all year. It also looks great in bathroom.</li>
            <li> Bought this mainly for nostalgic reasons.  Loved the smell as a teenager - not so much now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for quite a while now, and given the size of the bottle (no its not a misprint) I have hardly made a dent in it.  The classic Brut fragrance in a large bottle.  If you love Brut this is a great value.</li>
            <li> Smells great and got a good deal on it. With this you can not go wrong with the ladies. I use it consistently and never tire of the fragrance,,Thank you</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say if this is the &amp;#34; original &amp;#34; or &amp;#34; Classic &amp;#34; Brut, I bought 3 bottles of &amp;#34; original &amp;#34; or &amp;#34; Classic &amp;#34; Brut in a foreign country 9 years ago, so I REALLY DON&#x27;T REMEMBER THE SMELL ( EXCEPT THAT IT WAS DELICIOUS ) but what I can say about this product is that for the price, and for what you get, and for how this one SMELLS like... IT&#x27;S DAMN GOOD, FOR SURE!!!  This version of Brut is EXCELLENT.  It DEFINITELY IS NOT THE DRUGSTORE VERSION, the aroma in this one is a lot better and there has actually been some thought and work put into executing this version of Brut, so much so that for the price you pay for this bottle I think they&#x27;re undercutting how much profit they can get out of it, they should charge at least DOUBLE what they&#x27;re charging for this bottle now!  I received my bottle today in the morning and the scent is still lingering on my skin now ( first applied it at 3 in the afternoon and I can still smell it at 10 at night, now ) so it lasts about as long as 3 to 6 hours... it is REALLY, REALLY, REALLY good... now all I have to is buy a bottle of the &amp;#34; Classic &amp;#34; version ( the 3oz bottle ) and see if there is any difference... if there is one, I think it will be negligible.  Good job, you BRUTe of a manly fragrance!</li>
            <li> Brut was Elvis&#x27;s favorite fragrance, and this size container is not a misprint.  Enlarge the photo and you can see the ounces as stated on the container you receive.  It&#x27;s a great value!</li>
            <li> I use the Brut as a nice scent to spray in the house to keep it nice and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Brut for many years. It is not overbearing. I have received many compliments when wearing Brut Cologne.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a diluted version of the product. Doesnt really last all day like others</li>
            <li> I BEEN USING BRUT FOR MORE THAT 45 YEARS, TO MY KNOWLEDGE BRUT IS THE BEST MANY PEOPLE ASK ME WHAT AM I WEARING I TELL THEM  B  R  U  T  BRUT.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the old Brut or the new Brut smell. What I do know is that this is a great smelling Cologne, it has a barbershop scent too me. I love this scent so much. People cannot smell it from a mile away but if someone hugs you they will get a nice smell of this stuff, and compliment you. It&#x27;s a dab bottle which I would prefer a spray but either way very good cologne. Lasts a while too. 2 thumbs up</li>
            <li> This smells great - maybe not exactly like back in the day, but very close.  It is just not as intense as I remember from what I bought decades ago.  Oh well, my wife loves this anyway.  This is a HUGE bottle, like having a liquor bottle out on my counter, so if that&#x27;s a concern then buy a smaller version.  My wife and I laughed out loud the first time I ordered this.  I told her I had a &#x27;76 Trans Am on order too for the garage, and that I would be wearing V-neck velour short sleeve shirts from now on...</li>
            <li> good smelling colonge</li>
            <li> HUSBAND WAS OVERWHELMED WITH THE SIZE--IT IS HUGE-HE LOVED IT. EVERYONE GOT A KICK OUT OF IT AND SMELLS GREAT</li>
            <li> Like product, but the last 2 times I received it the cap was off &amp;&#x27;the content was emptied all over the inside of the box</li>
            <li> Bought bulk size for reasonable price and spread contents over various smaller spray bottles for gym etc.  I find the old school colognes (Brut, Old Spice) to b a good change of pace and most people will comment on it as nice and ask what it is as no longer main stream cologne.  Further, the top was slightly ajar when it arrived and some of the contents spilled into the packagine.  The seller offered a 50% refund which I thought was very fair</li>
            <li> As I just reached age 70, i have tried most colognes on the market and found Brut to be the best in my opinion and associates who express their gratitude that Brut is pleasant and not over-bearing.</li>
            <li> What can I really say it&#x27;s Brut and the wife loves it... this is a huge bottle so oz per oz if you use the stuff it&#x27;s the way to go.</li>
