            <li>Fits perfect and great price..</li>
            <li>Perfect and great price</li>
            <li>Still, a good value!</li>
            <li>Great value &amp; work</li>
            <li>As good as the originals.</li>
            <li>Well, my check up was great, so these brush heads seem to be holding their own against the name brand alternative.</li>
            <li>These heads are a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>Great quaility and the price can&#x27;t get any better.</li>
            <li>Nice value for the price.</li>
            <li>and they are holding up nicely.</li>
            <li>perfect for my sonicare healthy white!</li>
            <li>you replace them more often.</li>
            <li>Pretty good replacement for my son&#x27;s Sonicair toothbrush.</li>
            <li>These seemed fine, but I wanted to wait until I had a six month cleaning to weigh in.  </li>
            <li>Huge savings</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have the brush head caps or the fancy color rings for identifying different users&#x27; brush heads, but they work, and they fit, and I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit 100%, they rattle when</li>
            <li>But at about $1.00 each (including free shipping) they&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>And WAY cheaper than the original.</li>
            <li>These work great but are not as tightly fitting on my Sonic as the ones I have received in the past.  </li>
            <li>Only more time will tell but so far great value.</li>
            <li>The stiffer ones clean better (in my opinion) and last longer.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t even tell a difference from the real ones.</li>
            <li>They are somewhat softer than other replacement ones I bought and of the MUCH higher priced original Sonicare ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they will only last a month.</li>
            <li>(If you&#x27;re buying some for yourself, I&#x27;d recommend keeping one of your old brush head covers to use on these!)</li>
            <li>but wish they came with the clear brush head covers.</li>
            <li>but no where near the quality.</li>
            <li>These were really soft.</li>
            <li>These Replacement Brush heads, unlike some I purchased from a &amp;#34;deal&amp;#34; web site, at least fit my SonicCare.</li>

            <li> Nice value for the price.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Very happy with the performance. A month in and they are holding up nicely. Only more time will tell but so far great value. As good as the originals.</li>
            <li> I could not tell the difference between these and the Sonicare brand. Huge savings</li>
            <li> Fits perfect and great price..</li>
            <li> These seemed fine, but I wanted to wait until I had a six month cleaning to weigh in.  Well, my check up was great, so these brush heads seem to be holding their own against the name brand alternative. I plan to keep buying them as I need them. I would recommend them to others.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. They look just like the orignal ones but no where near the quality. They don&#x27;t fit 100%, they rattle when using.&lt;br /&gt; The bristles are poor quality, they don&#x27;t clean and contour to the teeth like the originals. They also break down after a week of use. I would not recommend these, even though they are cheaper than the originals you&#x27;ll pay the price when you get a checkup at your dentist.</li>
            <li> Perfect and great price</li>
            <li> These Replacement Brush heads, unlike some I purchased from a &amp;#34;deal&amp;#34; web site, at least fit my SonicCare. They don&#x27;t have the brush head caps or the fancy color rings for identifying different users&#x27; brush heads, but they work, and they fit, and I&#x27;m happy with them. (If you&#x27;re buying some for yourself, I&#x27;d recommend keeping one of your old brush head covers to use on these!)</li>
            <li> These are awesome. Like the originals but at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> These heads are a perfect fit. Great quaility and the price can&#x27;t get any better.</li>
            <li> These work great but are not as tightly fitting on my Sonic as the ones I have received in the past.  Still, a good value!</li>
            <li> perfect for my sonicare healthy white! can&#x27;t even tell a difference from the real ones.</li>
            <li> I think they actually last longer than the overpriced Philips ones, will only get these from now on.</li>
            <li> I could not tell a difference in the feel of the brushhead!  I will see how long the blue indicator bristles stay blue- that could determine the overall value of this buy.  But at 1/5 of the cost of buying somewhere else, I would still come out ahead even replacing these sooner!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this generic replacement brand - but from a different vendor this time (same pkg though). They are somewhat softer than other replacement ones I bought and of the MUCH higher priced original Sonicare ones. I chose these because some posters said they were stiffer. The stiffer ones clean better (in my opinion) and last longer. These were really soft. I&#x27;m sure they will only last a month. But at about $1.00 each (including free shipping) they&#x27;ll do. I&#x27;ll probably look for stiffer ones next time. (5 months?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review was helpful to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve Ramm&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Anything Phonographic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well these replacements work and the cost let&#x27;s you replace them more often.</li>
            <li> Pretty good replacement for my son&#x27;s Sonicair toothbrush. And WAY cheaper than the original.</li>
            <li> Great value &amp; work well but wish they came with the clear brush head covers.</li>
