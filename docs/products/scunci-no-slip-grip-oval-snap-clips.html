            <li>Nice looking.</li>
            <li>So is the ending, nice and tight.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>She liked this size and quality.</li>
            <li>Nice testament I would say.</li>
            <li>They work good for fine hair</li>
            <li>I use these to put the fly aways back when i wear my hair up and they work great.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable</li>
            <li>These are the first clips of their kind that I&#x27;ve ever owned that I don&#x27;t have to readjust throughout the day!</li>
            <li>They are snug, so better for fine/thin hair .  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy any more of them.</li>
            <li>Cute and practical.</li>
            <li>Cute, discreet clips</li>
            <li>Glad I did.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my red hair.  </li>
            <li>So glad Amazon has these, I can&#x27;t find them in Europe.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also really cute.  </li>
            <li>Most of mine, when you view from the side when clipped, don&#x27;t even make any contact.</li>
            <li>I have baby-fine hair and most days</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to get on and they stay in without pulling on the hair.  </li>
            <li>I like how they work and would recommend at a good decent price</li>
            <li>Bought these for my daughter&#x27;s fine hair.  </li>
            <li>these work fine</li>
            <li>The non-slip feature is helpful for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Excellent little clips.</li>
            <li>These are great for holding back my fine hair (bangs) and come out smooth.</li>
            <li>They are secure and unobtrusive, not intended to be decorative.</li>
            <li>The plastic on these, however, tug against my hair as I attempt to secure them against my scalp.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing special about these clips.</li>
            <li>I had a hard time finding them in a drugstore, so this worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>These do not grip well and slide right out of my daughters fine hair.</li>
            <li>and they stay in place really well,way better than bobby pins</li>
            <li>They are perfect for people with thick yet slippery hair like mine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true, they don&#x27;t slip out of my hair.</li>
            <li>There is no plasticized surface to worry about in terms of chipping off, like you might have experienced with other brands.</li>
            <li>Not very large but a good size and grips like</li>
            <li>They hold fine hair really well.</li>
            <li>with more coarse hair will be probably fine.</li>
            <li>They stay in very well and are light weight</li>
            <li>This is just worth for the price.</li>
            <li>They are nice clips, they do slip occasionally but whatever.</li>
            <li>These are the first clips that actually stay in my very fine hair.</li>
            <li>I bought these in hopes they would be better than the normal cheap snap clips I buy because the regular metal snap clips sometimes pull out my hair.  </li>
            <li>They stay in place very well!</li>
            <li>Really no-slip grip!</li>
            <li>The rubbery no slip on the clip really works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I have very fine and soft hair, and this are the only clips that will not slip!</li>
            <li>These are a bit smaller than I was hoping for them to be, but they work just fine.</li>
            <li>Cute little way to control your hair a bit or just for fun.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find good hair clips in the store</li>
            <li>Really like these barrettes.  </li>
            <li>So the clips don&#x27;t hold much hair.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>These really do well.</li>
            <li>and they really do stay put.  </li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t pay too much for them.</li>
            <li>, you really have to look at them in person.</li>
            <li>Clipping further from my scalp doesn&#x27;t provide secure hold and forcing it causes breakage.</li>
            <li>These pinch my hair more than other ones of this type I&#x27;ve used before</li>
            <li>Handy for small tasks.</li>
            <li>They are so tight, with such good grip, that they pull her hair out when you try to take them out.</li>
            <li>I should have studied the review that gave their dimensions and made sure they were big enough for my purpose.</li>
            <li>Love these clips, they hold tight and don&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li>I especially like that the top is completely flat with no pieces to snag hair.</li>
            <li>I love these little things.  </li>
            <li>the middle the clip is nice and tight with layer of non-slip rubber/silicone.</li>
            <li>very pleased how it holds my thin hair in place</li>
            <li>But, on more than one occasion, a slight bump to the clip causes it to snap open.  </li>
            <li>They work in any style and are adult in design.</li>
            <li>My one year old forgets she has them in and wears them all day with no problem.</li>
            <li>They also don&#x27;t leave a crinkle in your hair and are gentle at the same time.</li>
            <li>Luckily you can bend the metal a bit to adjust for various amounts of hair and to help keep the clip snapped closed.</li>
            <li>I like and use almost daily the black clips from this set, but the other colors are just not useful or attractive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried tons of different kinds and these are my favorites by far.  </li>
            <li>daughter has straight silky hair, so it is slipping a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Kids</li>
            <li>solid build thus far</li>
            <li>These work well in my young daughter&#x27;s hair, but aren&#x27;t nearly big enough to hold any of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I use my tiny embroidery scissors to remove the plastic grips and they work better.. but still not great.</li>

            <li> These work well in my young daughter&#x27;s hair, but aren&#x27;t nearly big enough to hold any of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use my tiny embroidery scissors to remove the plastic grips and they work better.. but still not great.</li>
            <li> They are constantly sliding out and I have to keep placing them all day long.  </li>
            <li> and they are still in (and roughly in the same place in my hair) even after sleeping on them.  </li>
            <li> I really like these because I have thick hair</li>
            <li> A little bigger than my last set</li>
            <li> so the colors weren&#x27;t all that different from each other.</li>
            <li> I wear the front in a pompadour secured with a single clip that holds all day.</li>
            <li> Each clip is 2 inches long and 3/8th inch wide.</li>
            <li> then in the beginning there is a little open loop, where the hair slips off</li>
            <li> squished it a little together, and it seemed like it will work after all, but the metal broke there shortly after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 30s and have been looking for something to use in my hair that doesn&#x27;t look as if it&#x27;s thirty years too young.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m in the military and have to take my patrol cap on and off</li>
            <li> Not much to say about these.</li>
            <li> I like the colors, and the idea behind these clips, but they don&#x27;t grip the hair very well at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find larger clips in this style to hold a lot of hair, which I have.</li>
            <li> And unlike every other clip I have used the finish does not come off!</li>
            <li> For thick, slick,Asian hair this does not stay put for long.  </li>
            <li> There is a little tug sometimes when I take them out</li>
            <li> Wanted to love these, but unfortunately, the silicone is too thick and grips the hair too tight, making it difficult to put on and then pulls the hair when taking off.</li>
            <li> To small and have got tangled in my hair.. won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> The rubberized backing does very little to prevent slippage, at least in my hair.</li>
            <li> Sturdy but a little thin for thick hair.</li>
            <li> They can hold my thick hair and not slip out of place.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is shorter around my face.</li>
            <li> These are very small.  </li>
            <li> No barrettes would stay in except these and the big (usually ugly) claw thing.</li>
            <li> Stay put in thin hair.</li>
            <li> It always seems weird to me when the dimensions of an item are not provided by Amazon.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  </li>

            <li> These are the first clips of their kind that I&#x27;ve ever owned that I don&#x27;t have to readjust throughout the day! And they are all metal, not epoxy over metal. I am very happy with them!</li>
            <li> These pinch my hair more than other ones of this type I&#x27;ve used before</li>
            <li> Sturdy but a little thin for thick hair. Nice looking.</li>
            <li> I love these clips! They work in any style and are adult in design. I&#x27;m in my late 30s and have been looking for something to use in my hair that doesn&#x27;t look as if it&#x27;s thirty years too young. If you are looking for the perfect clip, you&#x27;ve found it.</li>

            <li> Why can&#x27;t i find these in the stores!  I love these little things.  A little bigger than my last set but they do a great job.  They stay in place very well!</li>
            <li> Great Product, Perfect Seller A+</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought they would be; but they stay in place just like the larger ones.</li>
            <li> I really like these because I have thick hair and they stay in place really well,way better than bobby pins</li>
            <li> There is nothing special about these clips. I wouldn&#x27;t buy any more of them. They do slip and the color change over time.</li>
            <li> I bought these in hopes they would be better than the normal cheap snap clips I buy because the regular metal snap clips sometimes pull out my hair.  Well, these would be great if they would stay snapped.  But, on more than one occasion, a slight bump to the clip causes it to snap open.  And I&#x27;m in the military and have to take my patrol cap on and off whenever I go outside/inside.  So, as you can imagine, this wasn&#x27;t the best scenario.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find larger clips in this style to hold a lot of hair, which I have. these work fine but are maybe 1 1/2 inches, I was looking for bigger ones.</li>
            <li> The problem is a follows:&lt;br /&gt;In the middle the clip is nice and tight with layer of non-slip rubber/silicone. So is the ending, nice and tight.&lt;br /&gt;But then in the beginning there is a little open loop, where the hair slips off constantly.&lt;br /&gt;I squished it a little together, and it seemed like it will work after all, but the metal broke there shortly after. Same with the rest.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has straight silky hair, so it is slipping a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Kids with more coarse hair will be probably fine.</li>
            <li> These clips have worked out great.  They stay in very well and are light weight so you don&#x27;t even know you are wearing them.  My one year old forgets she has them in and wears them all day with no problem.</li>
            <li> It always seems weird to me when the dimensions of an item are not provided by Amazon. Each clip is 2 inches long and 3/8th inch wide. So the clips don&#x27;t hold much hair. Luckily you can bend the metal a bit to adjust for various amounts of hair and to help keep the clip snapped closed. My packet had 2 copper, 2 gold and 2 silver clips, and all 6 of the clips were antique finish so the colors weren&#x27;t all that different from each other. The non-slip feature is helpful for fine hair. There is no plasticized surface to worry about in terms of chipping off, like you might have experienced with other brands.</li>
            <li> good product &#x3D; using it for crafting</li>
            <li> Not very large but a good size and grips like it should. And unlike every other clip I have used the finish does not come off!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. She liked this size and quality. This is just worth for the price. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> These are great clips. I especially like that the top is completely flat with no pieces to snag hair. The rubbery no slip on the clip really works pretty well. Cute and practical.</li>
            <li> I like and use almost daily the black clips from this set, but the other colors are just not useful or attractive.  They do stay put though!</li>
            <li> but then again I didn&#x27;t whip out a ruler to actually see the measurement. I like the rubber bottom, helps the clip to stay in place.</li>
            <li> These really do well.</li>
            <li> Stay put in thin hair.</li>
            <li> very pleased how it holds my thin hair in place</li>
            <li> For thick, slick,Asian hair this does not stay put for long.  Cute, discreet clips but I will not purchase them again. Still searching for the &amp;#34;no-slip&amp;#34; clips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find good hair clips in the store so I checked Amazon and found these.  Glad I did.  They work good for fine hair and I like them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my red hair.  No barrettes would stay in except these and the big (usually ugly) claw thing.</li>
            <li> Love these clips, they hold tight and don&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li> The rubberized backing does very little to prevent slippage, at least in my hair. I find I have it reinforce one of these with a few bobby pins if I really need it to hold.</li>
            <li> These are a bit smaller than I was hoping for them to be, but they work just fine.</li>
            <li> These are very small.  I should have studied the review that gave their dimensions and made sure they were big enough for my purpose.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and they really do stay put.  Cute little way to control your hair a bit or just for fun.  I&#x27;ve fallen asleep with them in and they are still in (and roughly in the same place in my hair) even after sleeping on them.  Nice testament I would say. There is a little tug sometimes when I take them out but that&#x27;s okay because they don&#x27;t take any hair out!</li>
            <li> Wanted to love these, but unfortunately, the silicone is too thick and grips the hair too tight, making it difficult to put on and then pulls the hair when taking off.</li>
            <li> These work well in my young daughter&#x27;s hair, but aren&#x27;t nearly big enough to hold any of my hair.  They seem to be well-made though.</li>
            <li> So glad Amazon has these, I can&#x27;t find them in Europe. They are perfect for people with thick yet slippery hair like mine. They also don&#x27;t leave a crinkle in your hair and are gentle at the same time. Scunci are a great brand , I love their products.!</li>
            <li> bought for a girl. she loved them. good quality, they have a plastic / rubber sleeve that helps keep the hair in place. solid build thus far</li>
            <li> Excellent little clips. Wish I could order just the gold colored ones, though.  They hold fine hair really well.</li>
            <li> These are the first clips that actually stay in my very fine hair.</li>
            <li> terrific.  sticky plastic undersheath works great.  stays in hair, looks good.</li>
            <li> works well with my hair.My co-worker wanted to knwo where i bought them and I told her so she wouldn&#x27; t as for any.</li>
            <li> Really no-slip grip! They can hold my thick hair and not slip out of place.</li>
            <li> They do a great job of holding my unruly hair in place.  They&#x27;re also really cute.  I had a hard time finding them in a drugstore, so this worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> To small and have got tangled in my hair.. won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, they don&#x27;t slip out of my hair.</li>
            <li> (wife) these are smaller than expected and a bit thin ---but are holding up OK</li>
            <li> They are nice clips, they do slip occasionally but whatever. I like how they work and would recommend at a good decent price but I wouldn&#x27;t pay too much for them.</li>
            <li> They hold perfect and they are the perfect size to hold all the hair i have and it lasts all day</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is shorter around my face. I use these to put the fly aways back when i wear my hair up and they work great.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about these. I bought them for my daughters hair. These slip even faster then regular snap clips, so it doesn&#x27;t wotk at all for her.&lt;br /&gt;So still looking for a miracle clip.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t grip at all. Most of mine, when you view from the side when clipped, don&#x27;t even make any contact. So unless I&#x27;m clipping a lot of hair, they don&#x27;t hold. Terrible.  Just not the thing to buy online, you really have to look at them in person.</li>
            <li> The clips still slipped on my hair.</li>
            <li> These hold my hair for a while but still gradually slip during the day.  I find myself not using them.</li>
            <li> I think I may have cried actual tears at an unsuspecting Walgreens employee when she said that the version of these clips WITHOUT the plastic grips had been discontinued. I have baby-fine hair and most days I wear the front in a pompadour secured with a single clip that holds all day. The plastic on these, however, tug against my hair as I attempt to secure them against my scalp.  Clipping further from my scalp doesn&#x27;t provide secure hold and forcing it causes breakage. I use my tiny embroidery scissors to remove the plastic grips and they work better.. but still not great.</li>
            <li> I have semi-fine hair but a lot of it and I buy clips like these to help keep my hair up in a pony tail. The clips work for about 10-20 minutes but then all my hair starts sliding out of them. For me, the &#x27;no-slip&#x27; does not work.</li>
            <li> I like the colors, and the idea behind these clips, but they don&#x27;t grip the hair very well at all.  They are constantly sliding out and I have to keep placing them all day long.  Bummer.</li>
