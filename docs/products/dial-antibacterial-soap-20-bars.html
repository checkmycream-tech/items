            <li>It lathers nicely, and rinses off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We truly like Dial, nice lather, nice clean scent, and a really good clean feeling.    </li>
            <li>Dial is a old brand &amp; a very good one.  </li>
            <li>Ok, its 20 bars of soap.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve never been able to use the gold variety on my face.  </li>
            <li>; a must have for all out there, best deal on the net!!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Delivery was more than speedy.</li>
            <li>eh ive had better soap</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite soap since I was a kid.</li>
            <li>It is great for the whole family to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found that Amazon was selling Dial in bulk packs of 20 bars.</li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied with Dial.</li>
            <li>Love the smell....and prefer using bars instead of bodywash.  </li>
            <li>Fell in love with this deodorant soap when on holiday in Florida in 1992 we connot get it in UK so have to import it</li>
            <li>Good quality and no issues, arrives right to the front stoop.  </li>
            <li>nice soap that gets you clean without leaving moisture film</li>
            <li>Feel very clean after using this.</li>
            <li>The price for even three bars in the store is astronomical, so I was thrilled to see this at such as great price.  </li>
            <li>the its perfume always takes us back to a great holiday we had there love it love it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to have a good soapy shower.</li>
            <li>Goes on and comes off easily</li>
            <li>so its easy to wash with.</li>
            <li>The scent is very mild.</li>
            <li>For some reason I get a strong burning sensation on the skin of my nose when I use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong too, and do NOT get soap bubbles caught in your nostrils.  </li>
            <li>You will strongly regret that when you sneeze this stuff out in gooey snotty fashion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used and loved Gold Dial forever; it&#x27;s that shower time classic</li>
            <li>Good soap, normal dial bars.  </li>
            <li>but summertime is fine.  </li>
            <li>If you need to make more money, raise the price, but don&#x27;t rip off your loyal customers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a huge Dial soap fan.  </li>
            <li>This package is a fantastic deal.  </li>
            <li>current managers of this formerly great product are reckless in their quest to cheat us.</li>
            <li>Love this soap because it has a light and fresh and clean scent.</li>
            <li>Dial is truly a deodorant soap, and gets you squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Have always preferred Dial at our house, washes and rinses clean.</li>
            <li>This was available at such a good price from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>In fact, Dial brand managers have redesigned all products to not last, and no longer be good value.</li>
            <li>I think it was a good buy since it has last us a lot.</li>
            <li>I feel fresh and clean after showering with it.</li>
            <li>As agreed with quick delivery...</li>
            <li>Most of the time the sliver breaks and ends up being thrown away because it won&#x27;t stay stuck to the new bar.  </li>
            <li>My husband only uses one kind of soap - dial.  </li>
            <li>My favorite general purpose soap.</li>
            <li>so you could easily get someone elses germs on your skin if a complete stranger touched the soap.</li>
            <li>This soap is essential and nothing else seems to clean as well or smell as good, and is for the entire family.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After 30 years of solidly supporting with my purchase dollars, I now emphatically recommend \\&quot;Don&#x27;t touch that dial.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>So we keep buying them because we used a lot of soap and this one has last us more than 4 months.</li>
            <li>However the good news is that Dial soap is one of the few soaps that actually makes me feel clean afterwards, and even though I detest the smell, at least it makes my skin soft and wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I was an adult on my own, I continued to buy Dial Gold, and 40 years later that&#x27;s all we use in my family&#x27;s shower.  </li>
            <li>Item is easy to order online than going to a big box store.  </li>
            <li>AND I WAS LOOKING FOR A LARGE QUABTITY</li>
            <li>Fast shipping...packaged very well...and thanks for shipping to APOs.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Dial Gold Bar Soap!</li>
            <li>I am waiting for someone to really get hurt and SUE THEM.</li>
            <li>Having tried nearly every brand of shower gel out there from Axe to Alba Botanical to Dove for men to Irish Spring to Coast, it seems we (wife) always end up back with a good ol&#x27; bar soap.  </li>
            <li>A memorable scent, an iconic color, and the fact it doesn&#x27;t generate a lot of suds or scum all make it a major winner.</li>
            <li>Economical, effective and long lasting until recently.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes the mundane things in life get in the way of enjoying your life.</li>
            <li>This is the classic definition of &amp;#34;Bait and Switch.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It cleaned well, and kept us smelling clean all day long.</li>
            <li>just like the old days</li>
            <li>By having things like this available you give us that few extra moments to relax.  </li>
            <li>only complaint is that they&#x27;ve changed the bars from a rectangle to hollowed out on the top and bottom.  </li>
            <li>I must have sensitive skin in just one area of my face because the skin on my nose and the immediate area surrounding it turns red if I wash my face with this soap.  </li>
            <li>Hey, Dial, when this product no longer lasts long enough to remind me of Dial Soap (or any soap, for that matter), you need to get your teams together to come up with a new name, but don&#x27;t call it Dial.</li>
            <li>new scooped shape bars reduces the ounces of the bar, so it doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making it just a little bit easier.</li>

            <li> This is the classic definition of &amp;#34;Bait and Switch.&amp;#34;  </li>

            <li> It cleaned well, and kept us smelling clean all day long.</li>
            <li> just like the old days</li>

            <li> new scooped shape bars reduces the ounces of the bar, so it doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making it just a little bit easier.</li>
            <li> As for it being smaller or not lasting as long.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s hard to get the old sliver of soap to stick to the new bar because it&#x27;s concave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But, as long as they make Dial Gold with the same scent and cleaning power, I&#x27;ll continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> It was formerly nearly flat on bottom.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I don&#x27;t enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not really much to say other than it cleans well, disinfects, and seems to last longer than shower gels as one is not as tempted to over use.  </li>
            <li> I doubt that I&#x27;m the only reviewer to notice this change, because most Dial users are long-term users, but I don&#x27;t stay with a company that thinks I&#x27;m too stupid to know when their product becomes ineffective and uneconomical.  </li>
            <li> (unless you like slipping in the shower!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than the skin irritation on my nose/face, I like this soap. . .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what one could say concerning soap other than it works and gives me confidence to start the day.</li>
            <li> Dial YELOW bars dry the skiin a little bit in the winter....</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of other brands (a bar here &amp; there), but nothing compares to DIAL!</li>
            <li> One thing I always found odd is that when buying soap in the Dollar Store, there&#x27;s never any protective plastic around the box</li>
            <li> and less soap, an ever shrinking bar.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Either the formulation or the shape of the bar has been drastically altered (probably both), but we now get about 3 days of showers out of one bar before it softens in the middle and breaks into two small, useless and soggy lumps instead of one sturdy bar that used to last 10 days.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s such a waste, and unfair to the fans of this soap who have used it for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago, Mr. Bean Counter, MBA, CPA,  didn&#x27;t think anything was wrong with cutting off 1/5 of the bar and packaging it in the original size package.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Deciding to cheat us by cutting a large chunk out of the bar is one thing, but to create also create safety hazard that could really hurt someone is beyond stupid.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years, but is has become difficult to find in the local stores.</li>

            <li> I have used Dial soap in the shower for years and this package price made it all the sweeter to shower!  Lots of soap for the price.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the mundane things in life get in the way of enjoying your life. By having things like this available you give us that few extra moments to relax.  Thanks for making it just a little bit easier.</li>
            <li> I have serious problems with &amp;#34;skin bars&amp;#34; in that they leave my skin feeling greasy!!!  Dial YELOW bars dry the skiin a little bit in the winter.... but summertime is fine.  My favorite general purpose soap.</li>
            <li> Ok, its 20 bars of soap.  Not really much to say other than it cleans well, disinfects, and seems to last longer than shower gels as one is not as tempted to over use.  Having tried nearly every brand of shower gel out there from Axe to Alba Botanical to Dove for men to Irish Spring to Coast, it seems we (wife) always end up back with a good ol&#x27; bar soap.  We truly like Dial, nice lather, nice clean scent, and a really good clean feeling.    Best price around, got it for like $16.00 for a 20 pack, bought two to stock up.</li>
            <li> Great product and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> My mother used to swear by Dial soap but I&#x27;ve never been able to use the gold variety on my face.  For some reason I get a strong burning sensation on the skin of my nose when I use it. I must have sensitive skin in just one area of my face because the skin on my nose and the immediate area surrounding it turns red if I wash my face with this soap.  I get an irritating and mildly painful burning sensation that continues to sting for an hour or two after I wash or shower.  It&#x27;s the weirdest thing because the soap doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me anywhere else on my body.  Needless to say, I don&#x27;t enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found I can use the white Dial soap without issue so I assume it may have something to do with my skin reacting adversely to the dye used.  Other than the skin irritation on my nose/face, I like this soap. . . even if I won&#x27;t use it myself.</li>
            <li> This soap smells AWESOME and keeps you CLEAN! Will get you ALLLLLL the laides in the club! BUY IT NOW!</li>
            <li> Great item and saves the lug from the store routine; a must have for all out there, best deal on the net!!</li>
            <li> Keeps my balls from smelling all day. Goes on and comes off easily so its easy to wash with.</li>
            <li> Love it. Works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap all my life.  Economical, effective and long lasting until recently.  Either the formulation or the shape of the bar has been drastically altered (probably both), but we now get about 3 days of showers out of one bar before it softens in the middle and breaks into two small, useless and soggy lumps instead of one sturdy bar that used to last 10 days.  I doubt that I&#x27;m the only reviewer to notice this change, because most Dial users are long-term users, but I don&#x27;t stay with a company that thinks I&#x27;m too stupid to know when their product becomes ineffective and uneconomical.  What graduate MBA program teaches that an unusable product is preferable to raising the price when expenses start creeping up?  Hey, Dial, when this product no longer lasts long enough to remind me of Dial Soap (or any soap, for that matter), you need to get your teams together to come up with a new name, but don&#x27;t call it Dial.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a huge Dial soap fan.  The biggest problem is that the smell just flat out stinks.  It&#x27;s strong too, and do NOT get soap bubbles caught in your nostrils.  You will strongly regret that when you sneeze this stuff out in gooey snotty fashion.  However the good news is that Dial soap is one of the few soaps that actually makes me feel clean afterwards, and even though I detest the smell, at least it makes my skin soft and wonderful.  Actually the smell isn&#x27;t so bad after you rinse off.  One thing I always found odd is that when buying soap in the Dollar Store, there&#x27;s never any protective plastic around the box so you could easily get someone elses germs on your skin if a complete stranger touched the soap.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what one could say concerning soap other than it works and gives me confidence to start the day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell like B/O when I use this product. Thank God.</li>
            <li> Dial is the one brand of deodorant soap which does the job here. Its antibacterial effect is superlative. Accept no substitutes. Additionally, from Amazon we got the lowest price. Delivery was more than speedy. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> eh ive had better soap</li>
            <li> good soap, good price.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRICE AND VERY SATISFIED</li>
            <li> This package is a fantastic deal.  The price for even three bars in the store is astronomical, so I was thrilled to see this at such as great price.  Thank you, AMZ!</li>
            <li> Good soap -- recommended by a surgeon I know.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite soap since I was a kid. I&#x27;ve tried others, but I&#x27;ve always come back to Dial. This gold bar smells just as it did 40 years ago. I feel fresh and clean after showering with it. Good stuff, and this is a good price.</li>
            <li> This is the kind of soap we have always used</li>
            <li> Dial is a very good soap. The scent is very mild. Dial is a old brand &amp; a very good one.  It is great for the whole family to use. Works very good &amp; I don&#x27;t get a rash or head ache after or during use. It is, 4oz. pack of 20. It doesn&#x27;t take much to have a good soapy shower. One need this size with a family of 6. I think this is good soap. Try it see what U think.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best soaps on the market. I have been using it for years, but is has become difficult to find in the local stores. I stocked up on it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49 years old and have been using Dial Gold Bar Soap since I entered the military in 1980. I have tried a couple of other brands (a bar here &amp; there), but nothing compares to DIAL! Dial is truly a deodorant soap, and gets you squeaky clean. I&#x27;m glad I found that Amazon was selling Dial in bulk packs of 20 bars. I was tired of spending a lot of money at Walgreens for 6 packs. I highly recommend Dial Gold Bar Soap!</li>
            <li> I have used Dial soap since1952.  I entered the Navy then and that was recommended by the Navy Doctors.  I still use it  reclusively.</li>
            <li> Love this soap because it has a light and fresh and clean scent. It does a great job of sud-sing on my washcloth in my shower and best of all it rinses off clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A perfect and reliable soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> My mother bought Dial Gold soap when I was a kid, and I always loved the smell of it.  It cleaned well, and kept us smelling clean all day long. It lathers nicely, and rinses off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I was an adult on my own, I continued to buy Dial Gold, and 40 years later that&#x27;s all we use in my family&#x27;s shower.  It has the same scent as it did when I was a kid, and works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that they&#x27;ve changed the bars from a rectangle to hollowed out on the top and bottom.  I understand that prices are going up and companies hate to raise prices and alienate consumers, but this is yet another example of a product being made smaller and represented as the same as before.  A bar used to last our family for 7 - 10 days, and now it&#x27;s gone in 5-6 days.  Plus, it&#x27;s hard to get the old sliver of soap to stick to the new bar because it&#x27;s concave.  Most of the time the sliver breaks and ends up being thrown away because it won&#x27;t stay stuck to the new bar.  That&#x27;s such a waste, and unfair to the fans of this soap who have used it for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, as long as they make Dial Gold with the same scent and cleaning power, I&#x27;ll continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> nice soap that gets you clean without leaving moisture film</li>
            <li> Item is easy to order online than going to a big box store.  Good quality and no issues, arrives right to the front stoop.  Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied with Dial. Also very satisfied with buy this on Amazon, thereby saving a lot of money. Even Walgreen&#x27;s prices for Dial packs of three are a rip-off. Great value all the way around.</li>
            <li> A scandalous ripoff.&lt;br /&gt;Less and less soap, an ever shrinking bar.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m through being a sucker.&lt;br /&gt; Time to switch brands</li>
            <li> My order came promptly and with no problems.  It was a regular order of a product&lt;br /&gt;that was in stock.</li>
            <li> Have always preferred Dial at our house, washes and rinses clean. The bulk price is hard to beat in the store</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using dial for 40 years.  A couple of years ago, Mr. Bean Counter, MBA, CPA,  didn&#x27;t think anything was wrong with cutting off 1/5 of the bar and packaging it in the original size package.  This is the classic definition of &amp;#34;Bait and Switch.&amp;#34;  Shame on you Dial!  If you need to make more money, raise the price, but don&#x27;t rip off your loyal customers.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T TOUCH THAT DIAL! (unless you like slipping in the shower!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FALL IN THE SHOWER.&lt;br /&gt;Dial (owned by Henkel, Germany) new scooped shape bars reduces the ounces of the bar, so it doesn&#x27;t last as long. It was formerly nearly flat on bottom. There is no reason for this scoop except greed. Problem is the scoop causes a HAZARD. The bars now WILL NOT STAY IN THE SOAP DISH. The bars continually fall under foot. I picked up the bar 2 or 3 times every shower. It gets under my feet. I am seriously worried about a SLIP AND FALL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deciding to cheat us by cutting a large chunk out of the bar is one thing, but to create also create safety hazard that could really hurt someone is beyond stupid. I am waiting for someone to really get hurt and SUE THEM. The bar is out of balance on soap dishes. If you have that smaller piece left over from before, you&#x27;ll never get the bar to stay put. It is under foot every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current managers of this formerly great product are reckless in their quest to cheat us. In fact, Dial brand managers have redesigned all products to not last, and no longer be good value. Like we&#x27;re stupid! This bar shape has added DANGEROUS to their list of product profit enhancements. Good job Dial Brand management!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 30 years of solidly supporting with my purchase dollars, I now emphatically recommend \\&quot;Don&#x27;t touch that dial.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My husband only uses one kind of soap - dial.  This was the biggest container of it for the best price I could find.</li>
            <li> I think it was a good buy since it has last us a lot. So we keep buying them because we used a lot of soap and this one has last us more than 4 months. That makes me happy even though I prefer moisturizing soaps but my fiance prefers this one. I like the smell so I don&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THIS AS PART OF THE $25 ADD ON FOR FREE SHIPPING, THE PRCE WAS GREAT AND I WAS LOOKING FOR A LARGE QUABTITY FOR MY DAUGHTER TO TAKE TO COLLEGE.</li>
            <li> Good soap, normal dial bars.  Makes you smell great all day!</li>
            <li> This was available at such a good price from Amazon.  This soap is essential and nothing else seems to clean as well or smell as good, and is for the entire family.</li>
            <li> Love the smell....and prefer using bars instead of bodywash.  Awesome price for 20 bars!  Fast shipping...packaged very well...and thanks for shipping to APOs.  Love this soap!</li>
            <li> Fell in love with this deodorant soap when on holiday in Florida in 1992 we connot get it in UK so have to import it .It&#x27;s the best soap we have ever used and the its perfume always takes us back to a great holiday we had there love it love it</li>
            <li> Feel very clean after using this. As for it being smaller or not lasting as long. Welcome to economics people. Still a good product. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> As agreed with quick delivery...</li>
            <li> We purchased this for use by our entire household. We&#x27;re quite happy with the value and the way it was packaged/shipped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used and loved Gold Dial forever; it&#x27;s that shower time classic I can&#x27;t do without! A memorable scent, an iconic color, and the fact it doesn&#x27;t generate a lot of suds or scum all make it a major winner.</li>
            <li> just like the old days</li>
            <li> Ive used this for years, the bars keep getting smaller.</li>
            <li> Good Soap, good price - good serve e</li>
