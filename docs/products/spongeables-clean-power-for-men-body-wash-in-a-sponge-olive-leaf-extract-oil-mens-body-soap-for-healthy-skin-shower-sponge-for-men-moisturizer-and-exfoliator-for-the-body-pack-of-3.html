            <li>BEST SMELL EVER</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, wakes me up in the morning,</li>
            <li>Great for handicapped husband in shower!</li>
            <li>It is infused with Body Wash (soap) which in the case of my elderly father was a ideal for his loss of balance in the bath and shower.  </li>
            <li>made this product the ideal solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is great, smells awesome.</li>
            <li>Great product for my husband.....</li>
            <li>These are great.  </li>
            <li>fan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foot scrubbers are also great.  </li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>Smells great</li>
            <li>These things feel good.</li>
            <li>It smells good</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a very strong smell too</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean smell and the sponge has a nice exfoliating texture to it.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>Enjoyed it and now use it with bar soap for continued usage.  </li>
            <li>We love them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found these here because I got one for the boyfriend for Christmas and</li>
            <li>Love the suds and smell.will</li>
            <li>But I just love, love Spongeables.</li>
            <li>too!&lt;br /&gt;Great invention, hope they are always available!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>What can I say, the price is right, they smell great and are easy to use for a quick morning shower.</li>
            <li>The sponges have a nice clean manly scent, but i enjoy it too.</li>
            <li>Besides being more convenient than having to pour the contents of a bottle on to something, it is more economical since I am able to keep a $6.00 sponge longer than a $9.00 bottle of body wash.</li>
            <li>I originally found these at Ulta</li>
            <li>He was bugging me about getting more of the Spongeables after the first use of the generic sponge (which I thought felt pretty nice).  </li>
            <li>If the answer is &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t have a strong opinion,&amp;#34; try out the product and you&#x27;ll most likely like</li>
            <li>It smells very nice, sort of a general manly scent, much like you&#x27;d find with a traditional men&#x27;s soap.  </li>
            <li>The order was for THREE sponges and the first shipment came with one, so I contacted Amazon and they said they would send a replacement order and</li>
            <li>they are great......nice smell, but not too powerful n gentle soap......</li>
            <li>now it&#x27;s all he wants to use!  </li>
            <li>have super tea-cup fragile skin, and this thing is fantastic.</li>
            <li>They have a clean scent and they help to keep his skin soft.  </li>
            <li>The scent is mild and masculine.  </li>
            <li>He thinks they sometimes run out too fast</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the shape of it.</li>
            <li>Also, after the &amp;#34;suds&amp;#34; run out, he just uses other body washes with it and he keeps reusing it until I determine it&#x27;s outlived its usefulness. :)</li>
            <li>Look, I&#x27;ll be honest with you: At first, they are rigid and somewhat rough, but not sandpaper rough.</li>
            <li>Luckily, they seem to last longer than they state, which is nice because it&#x27;s usually the opposite.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a gift that you could give to an adult as well as kid, although I understand they make fun kid ones now anyway.  </li>
            <li>The last time we ran out of them, I went to the local pharmacy and bought another generic spongey thing for him to use until I could order more Spongeables.</li>
            <li>is convenient in how you can hold onto it, and it lasts far beyond the twenty washes it promises (I go through about one a month or so...</li>
            <li>I bought these for graduating young men and my husband.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re large with one end acting as a handle and the other as the scrubber.  </li>

            <li> $17.00 was a high price to pay for only TWO and I am not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> I have written TWICE and still my order is not complete.  </li>
            <li> the surface is not as coarse as I expected</li>
            <li> Nay, they are rough like a dry sponge.</li>
            <li> So, what do you do when your sponge is dry and rough?</li>
            <li> wide.  </li>
            <li> You wet it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the thing is thoroughly drenched, it feels like a wet sponge.</li>
            <li> Ask yourself this: Do you like the feeling of a wet sponge against your skin?</li>
            <li> Soapy sponge lasts longer than expected.  </li>
            <li> They save on soap and last at least 20 showers.  </li>
            <li> but they are meant for less than 20 showers.  </li>
            <li> I feel that because of the shape and the fact it has no buffer it lathers less.</li>
            <li> a little stronger.</li>
            <li> round and 2.5 in.</li>
            <li> so I am STILL missing a sponge.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a strong smell like Axe.  </li>
            <li> no more wash rags to wash.</li>
            <li> He said they are terrible bad scent and rough!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Found these out west and came home to Florida and looked them up on line. Great product for my husband.....</li>
            <li> Cleans my sack like nothing else. Outstanding product. And as always, EAD.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend LOVES these. The last time we ran out of them, I went to the local pharmacy and bought another generic spongey thing for him to use until I could order more Spongeables. He was bugging me about getting more of the Spongeables after the first use of the generic sponge (which I thought felt pretty nice).  Lesson learned!  Also, after the &amp;#34;suds&amp;#34; run out, he just uses other body washes with it and he keeps reusing it until I determine it&#x27;s outlived its usefulness. :)</li>
            <li> The sponge is approx. 4 in. round and 2.5 in. wide.  It is infused with Body Wash (soap) which in the case of my elderly father was a ideal for his loss of balance in the bath and shower.  We had installed extra hand rails for added safety and not having to soap up a wash cloth or deal with a slippery bar of soap made this product the ideal solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with the product as a Men&#x27;s Body Wash has been excellent.  Besides being more convenient than having to pour the contents of a bottle on to something, it is more economical since I am able to keep a $6.00 sponge longer than a $9.00 bottle of body wash.</li>
            <li> USED FOR YEARS..BEST SMELL EVER</li>
            <li> Not a 3 pack-received a single-had to return</li>
            <li> These things feel good. Look, I&#x27;ll be honest with you: At first, they are rigid and somewhat rough, but not sandpaper rough. Nay, they are rough like a dry sponge. So, what do you do when your sponge is dry and rough? You wet it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the thing is thoroughly drenched, it feels like a wet sponge. Ask yourself this: Do you like the feeling of a wet sponge against your skin? If the answer is &amp;#34;yes,&amp;#34; then you should definitely get it. If the answer is &amp;#34;no,&amp;#34; you should refrain. If the answer is &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t have a strong opinion,&amp;#34; try out the product and you&#x27;ll most likely like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super tea-cup fragile skin, and this thing is fantastic. It smells wonderful, wakes me up in the morning, is convenient in how you can hold onto it, and it lasts far beyond the twenty washes it promises (I go through about one a month or so...maybe a bit over).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it out!</li>
            <li> I have written TWICE and still my order is not complete.  The order was for THREE sponges and the first shipment came with one, so I contacted Amazon and they said they would send a replacement order and when that arrived once again there was ONE sponge so I am STILL missing a sponge.  $17.00 was a high price to pay for only TWO and I am not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> I bought these for graduating young men and my husband.  He said they are terrible bad scent and rough! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product. I originally found these at Ulta but they don&#x27;t sell them anymore. I only gave 4 stars because you only get 20 uses out of it then you throw it away. It smells good but it&#x27;s a very strong smell too so if you don&#x27;t like that I wouldn&#x27;t get these.</li>
            <li> Soapy sponge lasts longer than expected.  Enjoyed it and now use it with bar soap for continued usage.  Will probably repurchase.</li>
            <li> What can I say, the price is right, they smell great and are easy to use for a quick morning shower. The sponges have a nice clean manly scent, but i enjoy it too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these for years at Ulta store n they are great......nice smell, but not too powerful n gentle soap......even if you get it in your eyes!&lt;br /&gt;Really only get 15 showers though!</li>
            <li> I purchased some Spongeables products for Christmas presents for myself and my partner.  We love them.  These are great.  They&#x27;re large with one end acting as a handle and the other as the scrubber.  The scent is mild and masculine.  I&#x27;m a fan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foot scrubbers are also great.  Give them a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found these here because I got one for the boyfriend for Christmas and now it&#x27;s all he wants to use!  Luckily, they seem to last longer than they state, which is nice because it&#x27;s usually the opposite.  It smells very nice, sort of a general manly scent, much like you&#x27;d find with a traditional men&#x27;s soap.  It&#x27;s not a strong smell like Axe.  It&#x27;s definitely a gift that you could give to an adult as well as kid, although I understand they make fun kid ones now anyway.  I&#x27;ve used a couple of these myself now and I like them, especially the pedicure one!</li>
            <li> I buy these sponges for my husband and he likes them.  They have a clean scent and they help to keep his skin soft.  He thinks they sometimes run out too fast but they are meant for less than 20 showers.  I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> great product. no more wash rags to wash. Love the suds and smell.will continue to use. Can&#x27;t wait for next shower</li>
            <li> I just keep buying these again and again.  They save on soap and last at least 20 showers.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This one is great, smells awesome. But it run out of soap for me in about 7 washes. I don&#x27;t really like the shape of it. I feel that because of the shape and the fact it has no buffer it lathers less. Spongeables, just got bought out by another company and they have created a Sports version of this one. Is blue as well. Same smell but a little stronger. The shape is easier to hold in your hand and it does have a buffer. They made that sponge targeting man and woman. I prefer it over this one. But I just love, love Spongeables.</li>
            <li> Great for handicapped husband in shower! Doesn&#x27;t have to use two hands to shower. Smells great too!&lt;br /&gt;Great invention, hope they are always available!</li>
            <li> A friend gave me one as a gift and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it. It has a nice clean smell and the sponge has a nice exfoliating texture to it. I think I&#x27;ve gotten about 20 or so showers out of it.</li>
            <li> the surface is not as coarse as I expected</li>
