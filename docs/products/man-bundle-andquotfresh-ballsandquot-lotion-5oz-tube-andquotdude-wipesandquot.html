            <li> These wipes fall apart the second they hit your skin and leave pieces behind - gross...</li>

            <li> But my complaint is in the packaging, the box came crushed</li>

            <li> For those that do not know, it is not a pleasant scent!</li>

            <li> The wipes are great, and the &amp;#34;liquid power&amp;#34; does exactly what it says.  goes on as a cream, dries to a power.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend is very happy with this product and so am I lol</li>
            <li> Keeps your junk smelling fresh all day</li>
            <li> I have to say, the concept is great! The only drawback is the lotion tends to smell like a men&#x27;s urinal cake. For those that do not know, it is not a pleasant scent! IF the scent was different, it would get 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Dude wipes are the best thing since sliced bread  the quality is great and the individual packages make them easy to take on the go</li>
            <li> Fresh balls works great just make sure you wash your hands after you apply. may leave white marks on your hands if you let it dry.</li>
            <li> dude wipes was great idea for camping and traveling instead of dealing with hard 1 ply toilet paper and the fresh lotions helps with chaffing</li>
            <li> Buy these wipes if you are using it as a gag gift. It smells exactly like baby powder/ baby wipes. Waste of money and I think they clog my sewer line because they are larger than most wipes. I did not give it 1 star because The dry lotion product is pretty good so far.</li>
            <li> It works great the wipes the best and the lotion is cool.</li>
            <li> Fresh Balls Lotion works. Definitely keeps that area smelling...fresh, but it dries pasty white. So if you get some on your underwear it looks like you had a certain type of &amp;#34;accident&amp;#34;. As for the Dude Wipes, don&#x27;t bother. They are just moist towelettes nothing fancy. Get the generic brand flushable wipes from the store.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes these products, he said they smell really good and work great. But my complaint is in the packaging, the box came crushed so I had to count to make sure I got all the wipes.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I keep it in my gym bag, and a couple of wipes at work, too.</li>
            <li> Got these for a family member as a gag gift, but he actually uses both products and reports that they are quite effective.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do it.  These wipes fall apart the second they hit your skin and leave pieces behind - gross...</li>
            <li> Great stuff!!! really works</li>
            <li> they guys thought this was a great gift, including the lots of laughs.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a god send!! I mean it really works and smells great!!! Lasts all the live long day! Cool and refreshing!!!</li>
            <li> Works great I love both items. They are ideal for work. Keeps my ba11s dry and my sewer clean</li>
            <li> No more Swamp Crotch at work</li>
            <li> The wipes are very convenient and effective in a pinch after a sweaty workout when there is no time to shower right away, leaving you feeling relatively clean before hitting the showers.  Fresh Balls is a great and soothing in the groin area to minimize chaffing and jock itch, especially for athletic men with thick muscular thighs which tend to rub together when involved in sporting activities.  Feels good and smells good on my man parts, too</li>
            <li> I ordered this out of curiosity.  From the description it seemed like it could work on lady parts and it does.  Without being graphic,  it doesn&#x27;t burn your skin and it keeps you from chafing.  I don&#x27;t know if it works for dudes, but it worked for this lady, Dude.  Wipes fit in your purse, quite umm effective.  Oh I later found out they make a product for women for under your bra area, works great no rash yet!</li>
            <li> The wipes are nice but the creme isnt very good.  Better off just using powder.</li>
            <li> Bought as a joke.  Went hiking with a group of guys and wanted to show I was &amp;#34;better prepared&amp;#34; than them.</li>
