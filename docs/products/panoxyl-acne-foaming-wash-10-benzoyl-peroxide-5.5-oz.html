            <li> I loved this product. I used to purchase it at CVS. they no longer sell it.&lt;br /&gt;all the other sellers charged too much. I got a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Used this twice per day to cure body acne during summer months, with a rough cloth designed to scoff-off skin. So far after two weeks, no results.</li>
            <li> I used to have really painful, cystic acne and an oily forehead. This product works wonders on me. I use it once a day, right before bed because I am in the sun too much during the day. Always use a moisturizer immediately following because it will dry your skin. If you use it in the morning, you will get a sunburn no matter how much sunscreen you use.</li>
            <li> Awesome face cream, cleared up my acne within a few days, didn&#x27;t overly dry my skin. Will definitely buy this face wash from now on</li>
            <li> Amazing results with my face brush! It is  strong so once a week is a good start and you will see results. There is some drying but make sure to use your toner and moisturizing cream. The texture is very thick and rich so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended I use this wash. I can get ingrown hairs and this is supposed to help prevent these infections. My face is clearly improving only after using it a few times. It will bleach clothes or a towel, so I use it only in the shower so I can throughly rinse my face.</li>
            <li> It works great for my body. It makes everything (acne, red marks, etc) vanish in one or two weeks.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested I try using this years ago to clear up some minor acne on my face. I use just a tad every morning and it has worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work  at all....</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, growing up I had really bad acne and my doctor recommended that I try this product. I have used Panoxyl for five years. This is the only product that has ever helped with my acne. The only thing I reccomend is using a moisturizer lotion after each use. I use Olay complete lotion with spf 15 in it to keep my skin from being dry and irritated from Panoxyl and to protect my skin from the sun. I would reccomend to use this product only once a day on your face until you see how your skin reacts since it does have benzoyl peroxide in it. I now use this face wash twice a day followed by my Olay moisturizer after each use.</li>
            <li> I have back acne and it didn&#x27;t work for me.  Used it twice a day in the shower and still had the same problem.  I will keep searching I guess.</li>
            <li> Works in clearing acne on my very oily skin. Recommended by a friend and I would recommend to others. Does make your skin dry out a little bit, but for very oily skin like mine the drying is not that bad.</li>
            <li> Worked great. 10% is the way to go when it comes to benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> I had okay skin up until last year when I turned 27 then my acne became severe. I use this for two weeks straight and all my acne (cystic) goes away. After that, I use about 3 times a week at night. It is a high percentage so make sure you get a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I definitely noticed a difference in my skin. Fewer pimples and less oily.</li>
            <li> This seems to work the best for my son.  However if you use the dermatologist recommended using cetaphil lotion immediately after using, because it is very drying since it is 10% Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
            <li> Even in my 30&#x27;s, I get acne. This product is the only thing I&#x27;ve found to help dry out those breakouts. I keep this on for a minute or two after scrubbing and sometimes use it twice a day. Definitely recommend this product after trying to find something like this for 17years.</li>
            <li> Made my skin SO clear! Loved this wash.</li>
