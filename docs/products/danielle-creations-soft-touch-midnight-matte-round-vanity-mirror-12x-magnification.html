            <li>, it&#x27;s been great, it looks great, and it is exactly what I wanted in a mirror!</li>
            <li>oh how I love it!  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve never used magnification of this strength, you will be startled (or thrilled or horrified) at the secrets it reveals.  </li>
            <li>Nice styling, shock resistant.</li>
            <li>but the mirror did not have its own box.</li>
            <li>This is a great and handy bathroom mirror, and I love its huge magnification on the reverse side!  </li>
            <li>Looks good though :)</li>
            <li>a light weight mirror that looks great and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>excellent tool for makeup application, especially for those of us who are optically challenged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;looking</li>
            <li>Ok, so I hit the 40+ age and my eyes don&#x27;t just see like they used to.</li>
            <li>The stand itself is rubberized, and if you like that feel and texture (I do), you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for myself from my mom for my birthday (did I lose you? &#x3D;)).  </li>
            <li>It arrived, and it&#x27;s adorable.</li>
            <li>It takes a minute for your eyes to adjust to how big it is, but it is perfect for eyeliner and eyebrow-plucking.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>the item is perfect and simple and helps out when your shaving or when your spouse is using it to put makeup</li>
            <li>They love them.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to sit on the top of the glass showcase in a shop where I sell my jewelry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have designed one better for my needs!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t agree, you can return it, but I promise you won&#x27;t find anything on Amazon you like better.</li>
            <li>, so they didn&#x27;t peel off as clean as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>I like the mirror, but it had legit stickers (not the kind on sunglasses that slide right off leaving no residue)</li>
            <li>RUBBERIZED CONSTRUCTION EASY TO HOLD ONTO.</li>
            <li>MY EYEBROWS ARE SO EASY TO TWEEZE NOW.</li>
            <li>displays are black velvet necklace boards &amp; busts, so this fits in perfectly.</li>
            <li>Received quickly and safely from UPS</li>
            <li>VERY, VERY MAGNIFIED!!</li>
            <li>So if you don&#x27;t see things the same in the mirror, this is a great addition to your beauty arsenal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase so far.</li>
            <li>The mirror is a good quality and the magnification is sufficient enough for me to pluck my eyebrows and apply eye lines with precision.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t joking, that magnified side is super magnified.</li>
            <li>I received this mirror quickly and damage</li>
            <li>This a great little mirror for spying those errant hairs - chin, eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>not afraid of reality?  </li>
            <li>I liked the idea of the matte color, and I wanted something slightly smaller</li>
            <li>I love this mirror, short but great if you dont have much space plus it so goes with my black and sliver vanity</li>
            <li>The soft touch rubber coating makes them easy to handle.</li>
            <li>The magnification was too strong or it was ground incorrectly, but I couldn&#x27;t see clearly using it.</li>
            <li>SHIPPING WAS SUPER FAST.</li>
            <li>I really took my time comparing various mirrors on Amazon, and came down to this one, and I think I made an excellent choice!  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Had this for several months pleased with it</li>
            <li>The rubberized coating is exactly what you would wish it to be.</li>
            <li>This little mirror is nice and useful.</li>
            <li>The magnification is pretty intense for putting on makeup.  </li>
            <li>They seem very sturdy and will likely last a good while.</li>
            <li>Nice little mirror.....</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll actually be able to see those little buggers and get rid of them before they get bigger, more noticeable and start stretching your pores.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>This one is convex which is like a fish eye.  </li>
            <li>it is well-made and sturdy, and there&#x27;s something very pleasing about the texture of its components.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all, I really like the mirror</li>
            <li>Too much magnification,,  Returned...</li>
            <li>12x magnification is a bit much for my daughter, a college student.</li>
            <li>It was just what I needed and it is very well made.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a good-looking and high-quality mirror.</li>
            <li>I suppose if I really wanted to get Goo Gone or</li>
            <li>It would be nice if this same mirror came in a lesser magnification.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a matte black finish, &amp; that it isn&#x27;t tall like so many others.</li>
            <li>This is a great mirror overall, the price point wasn&#x27;t bad and it came to my door very quickly!</li>
            <li>High quality/price ratio</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li>Why do I need to know from a sticker that it has 12x magnification when the tag that is attached says the exact same thing.  </li>
            <li>The magnifying side has to be held super close, other than that..</li>
            <li>15.&lt;br /&gt;I did keep the mirror because it does have a clear view and works well for what I needed.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m near sighted and because the magnification is so much, nothing actually comes into focus until i place it</li>
            <li>I PURCHASED THIS MIRROR FOR MY 85yr OLD MOTHER.</li>
            <li>And wow...just wow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a relatively unhairy woman, but I never even knew how much peach fuzz I had til I looked myself in this mirror.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I definitely like the modern look of this mirror (compared to its counterparts).  </li>
            <li>It has a soft rubber feel.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for a 96 year old woman.</li>
            <li>Once you use this, no other will do.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, this mirror is amazing for brow plucking.</li>
            <li>It actually looks quite classy, for being the cheapest I found at $19.99.</li>
            <li>believe it should hold up fine for it&#x27;s intended purpose, &amp; in this case I&#x27;m glad the base is made of plastic (albeit a bit thinner than I would&#x27;ve preferred), so it&#x27;s safer to use on the glass.</li>
            <li>but the other side is normal and that&#x27;s what i was looking for</li>
            <li>It is not big, nor small, just the right size what I want.</li>
            <li>Looks decent but not worth the money.</li>

            <li> Looks decent but not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a simple little 2-sided mirror with a normal side and a magnifying side, but</li>
            <li> But only the one side the other side is magnifier</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure that being farsighted would allow you to use this mirror from far away because the curvature is so extreme...</li>
            <li> Arrived as pictured and I got what I expected.</li>
            <li> As stated in other reviews, you have to put your face close to the mirror in order to see correctly.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s soooo large you are unable to see yourself or any part of yourself in it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth at this point.  </li>
            <li> I should have ordered one with less enlargement.  </li>
            <li> This mirror seems less magnified.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy, even though the black might make it look like it is.  </li>
            <li> The black edges are a weird, soft paint-material, like the soft-touch paint in my car.  </li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s no light in it but</li>
            <li> This one is, in the sense it&#x27;s not burdensomely heavy.</li>
            <li> The mirrors are well made and not cheap, so</li>
            <li> Very small space in center without distortion.</li>
            <li> I got a little eager to remove all the stickers all over the mirror, and it was still extremely cold from being delivered (I live in MN)</li>
            <li> you will also be grateful that someone who is just standing there casually looking at you can probably not see with the same detail this mirror provides.  </li>
            <li> the 12x magnification side is a bit ridiculous though.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, however, if it was because of the cold or the stickers itself.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to do eyeliner, even with the magnification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was so angry that I had to spend 20 minutes removing these stupid super-sticky stickers.  </li>
            <li> 4 inches from my nose which makes applying makeup impossible.  </li>
            <li> That sounds like bad news, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> Sturdy base.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed - returned it.</li>

            <li> great mirror and size!</li>
            <li> The magnifying side has to be held super close, other than that..it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This a great little mirror for spying those errant hairs - chin, eyebrows.  The magnification is pretty intense for putting on makeup.  It would be nice if this same mirror came in a lesser magnification.  I like its sturdy build and size.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize the strength.  I really can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> The product description is not correct, it is only 9 inches tall not 15.&lt;br /&gt;I did keep the mirror because it does have a clear view and works well for what I needed.</li>
            <li> This is the best mirror ever.  Once you use this, no other will do.</li>
            <li> Good magnification but there&#x27;s no light in it but a good size mirror</li>
            <li> I love this mirror, short but great if you dont have much space plus it so goes with my black and sliver vanity</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Shipped promptly.  Sturdy base.</li>
            <li> I should have ordered one with less enlargement.  This one is convex which is like a fish eye.  Very small space in center without distortion.</li>
            <li> this mirror will show you the truth, the meaning of life and the way to san jose.  it is well-made and sturdy, and there&#x27;s something very pleasing about the texture of its components.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;ve never used magnification of this strength, you will be startled (or thrilled or horrified) at the secrets it reveals.  you will also be grateful that someone who is just standing there casually looking at you can probably not see with the same detail this mirror provides.  excellent tool for makeup application, especially for those of us who are optically challenged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;looking for the truth?  not afraid of reality?  buy this mirror!  it will show you everything but your skin&#x27;s molecular structure.</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED THIS MIRROR FOR MY 85yr OLD MOTHER. WITH IT, SHE CAN SEE HERSELF W/O HER GLASSES AND RUBBERIZED CONSTRUCTION EASY TO HOLD ONTO.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I hit the 40+ age and my eyes don&#x27;t just see like they used to. I purchased this for my vanity so I could see to put my eye makeup on. The mirror is a good quality and the magnification is sufficient enough for me to pluck my eyebrows and apply eye lines with precision. I know I&#x27;m not alone with this problem. So if you don&#x27;t see things the same in the mirror, this is a great addition to your beauty arsenal.</li>
            <li> I have a regular lighted makeup mirror, but I rely on a smaller hand mirror with a stand to do eye makeup. Maybe I&#x27;m getting blinder, but the smaller mirror just hasn&#x27;t been working for me. It&#x27;s difficult to do eyeliner, even with the magnification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in the market for a replacement that didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg, and this one seemed ideal. And wow...just wow. I can actually SEE without my glasses! I&#x27;m actually able to do winged liner faster and without screw ups, the magnification is that wonderful. Oh, and you know how you thought your exfoliant was working and getting rid of all those teeny blackheads? If you look at yourself in this mirror, your nose and chin are going to look like a minefield! That sounds like bad news, but it&#x27;s not. You&#x27;ll actually be able to see those little buggers and get rid of them before they get bigger, more noticeable and start stretching your pores. Needless to say, this mirror is amazing for brow plucking. I&#x27;m a relatively unhairy woman, but I never even knew how much peach fuzz I had til I looked myself in this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the mirror is quality all the way through. My current crappy mirror is lightweight. This one is, in the sense it&#x27;s not burdensomely heavy. But it has a heft to it that indicates quality. Even when you spin the mirrors from regular to magnified, it has a sense of solidity and substance. The mirrors are well made and not cheap, so no distortion. The stand itself is rubberized, and if you like that feel and texture (I do), you&#x27;ll love this. It&#x27;s pleasant to hold and just looks great on your dressing table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this mirror enough if you wan to see what you REALLY look like (trust me...initially, you&#x27;ll jump!)</li>
            <li> Great mirror, beautiful and functional.</li>
            <li> Very good quality for the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for myself from my mom for my birthday (did I lose you? &#x3D;)).  I used to have a Conair makeup mirror that had built in lights, but it disappeared in a move a couple years ago.  I decided to not go with another lighted makeup mirror because I only use the makeup mirror for my detail makeup application, not all over (like foundation, if I wear it).  I liked the idea of the matte color, and I wanted something slightly smaller so it could stay on my bathroom sink all the time. It arrived, and it&#x27;s adorable. I like the feel of it.  It&#x27;s like rubber, but not grippy like.  It seems to repel dust well, so that&#x27;s definitely a plus!  I got a little eager to remove all the stickers all over the mirror, and it was still extremely cold from being delivered (I live in MN), so they didn&#x27;t peel off as clean as I would have liked.  I&#x27;m not sure, however, if it was because of the cold or the stickers itself.  All in all, I really like the mirror, it&#x27;s been great, it looks great, and it is exactly what I wanted in a mirror!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to put on make up without using my eyeglasses!</li>
            <li> Nice styling, shock resistant.</li>
            <li> this mirror isn&#x27;t for me.. the magnifying part was so blurry... had to send it back.  the mirror itself is very cute.. but no way was it one that I could use.</li>
            <li> Ni.ce low profile mirror</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great mirror for the price.  The black edges are a weird, soft paint-material, like the soft-touch paint in my car.  The magnified side is 10 times magnified.  It takes a minute for your eyes to adjust to how big it is, but it is perfect for eyeliner and eyebrow-plucking.</li>
            <li> Too much magnification,,  Returned...</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I need it for, putting make up on at the couch!  ;-)</li>
            <li> I definitely like the modern look of this mirror (compared to its counterparts).  However, I wish it came in 5x instead.  The 12x is a bit much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does feel nice though!  It has a soft rubber feel.</li>
            <li> Works as it should.  Good height.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a 96 year old woman. She truly loves it. I looked at several. Bought this because not being metal it won&#x27;t pit at the beach.</li>
            <li> I had another 12x magnification mirror but the frame broke.  This mirror seems less magnified.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a very nice mirror.</li>
            <li> beccause it&#x27;s a mirror...so...yeah.  the 12x magnification side is a bit ridiculous though.  i&#x27;m near sighted and because the magnification is so much, nothing actually comes into focus until i place it 4 inches from my nose which makes applying makeup impossible.  i&#x27;m not sure that being farsighted would allow you to use this mirror from far away because the curvature is so extreme...but the other side is normal and that&#x27;s what i was looking for so i&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Received quickly and safely from UPS but the mirror did not have its own box. A mirror at this price should not arrive in bubble wrap packaging, making it look like I purchased it used. 12x magnification is a bit much for my daughter, a college student. Looks decent but not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.  It was just what I needed and it is very well made.  I would recommend it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail and the mirror is very good quality. The plastic is not cheap at all, very sturdy and well made. Totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> As stated in other reviews, you have to put your face close to the mirror in order to see correctly.</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror overall, the price point wasn&#x27;t bad and it came to my door very quickly! It does the job.</li>
            <li> the item is perfect and simple and helps out when your shaving or when your spouse is using it to put makeup</li>
            <li> Nice little mirror.....This little mirror is nice and useful. But only the one side the other side is magnifier and it&#x27;s soooo large you are unable to see yourself or any part of yourself in it. It&#x27;s just a blurrrrrrrrr.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a good-looking and high-quality mirror. It is not big, nor small, just the right size what I want.</li>
            <li> This is a great and handy bathroom mirror, and I love its huge magnification on the reverse side!  I really took my time comparing various mirrors on Amazon, and came down to this one, and I think I made an excellent choice!  It isn&#x27;t heavy, even though the black might make it look like it is.  It is just perfect!</li>
            <li> High quality/price ratio</li>
            <li> Arrived as pictured and I got what I expected. They aren&#x27;t joking, that magnified side is super magnified.</li>
            <li> Ordered them for my wife and daughter. They love them. The soft touch rubber coating makes them easy to handle. They seem very sturdy and will likely last a good while. Happy with them.</li>
            <li> The magnification was too strong or it was ground incorrectly, but I couldn&#x27;t see clearly using it.</li>
            <li> I received this mirror quickly and damage free!&lt;br /&gt;It’s a light weight mirror that looks great and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> When you need to use a wheelchair, you&#x27;re too low to see the mirror on the bathroom wall. Stand this mirror on the sink for brushing teeth and applying make-up. Take the guesswork out of daily routines!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to sit on the top of the glass showcase in a shop where I sell my jewelry.&lt;br /&gt;My displays are black velvet necklace boards &amp; busts, so this fits in perfectly. I like the fact it&#x27;s a matte black finish, &amp; that it isn&#x27;t tall like so many others. (Why do they list it as \\&quot;tall\\&quot;?) It actually looks quite classy, for being the cheapest I found at $19.99. I couldn&#x27;t have designed one better for my needs!&lt;br /&gt;I believe it should hold up fine for it&#x27;s intended purpose, &amp; in this case I&#x27;m glad the base is made of plastic (albeit a bit thinner than I would&#x27;ve preferred), so it&#x27;s safer to use on the glass. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase so far.</li>
            <li> Had this for several months pleased with it</li>
            <li> Very disappointed - returned it.</li>
            <li> Why oh why would mirror manufactures put stickers on the mirror face!?  I like the mirror, but it had legit stickers (not the kind on sunglasses that slide right off leaving no residue) and now it still has smudges where even cleaner won&#x27;t take off.  I suppose if I really wanted to get Goo Gone or something I could get off the marks, but it&#x27;s not worth at this point.  I was so angry that I had to spend 20 minutes removing these stupid super-sticky stickers.  Why do I need to know from a sticker that it has 12x magnification when the tag that is attached says the exact same thing.  Grr.  Looks good though :)</li>
            <li> This is a simple little 2-sided mirror with a normal side and a magnifying side, but oh how I love it!  You will too -- I swear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for tweezing, managing pores, looking for something in your eye, etc. The thing is stable and solid feeling. The rubberized coating is exactly what you would wish it to be. If you are like me, agonizing over all the choices out there, trust me -- this one beats everything else in its class.  I&#x27;m not kidding or exaggerating. If you don&#x27;t agree, you can return it, but I promise you won&#x27;t find anything on Amazon you like better.</li>
            <li> VERY, VERY MAGNIFIED!! MY EYEBROWS ARE SO EASY TO TWEEZE NOW. BLACKHEADS I NEVER KNEW I HAD ARE NOW VISIBLE!!!! GREAT MIRROR. SHIPPING WAS SUPER FAST. PACKAGED WELL IN BUBBLE WRAP INSIDE BOX. WELL MADE AND DURABLE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> Great and nice looking</li>
