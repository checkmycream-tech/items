            <li>The blush is nice, but the color I choose doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>Its build able not overly pigmented.</li>

            <li>I just love this blush.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my favorite...</li>
            <li>This shade is sultry and sun kissed with this Hollywood Photoshop filler thing going on, it simply looks delicious.</li>
            <li>beautiful colour..looks natural</li>
            <li>I love this blush... easy to apply... stays on all day...</li>
            <li>Would recommend it to anyone - although the name might not be so great for a young girl stealing her mom&#x27;s makeup!</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;m still a huge fan of NARS blush.</li>
            <li>Overall, good buy!</li>
            <li>And the color really is so nice, natural, and lovely.  </li>
            <li>The texture is fine, but nothing special in comparison with cheaper brands.  </li>
            <li>I think this color may be good for pretty much any complexion.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and can not get it to show, even after using multiple applicators.</li>
            <li>I love the whole range</li>
            <li>Might be okay for a young girl going to prom or something, but not for me!!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying just the Orgasm and not the Super.</li>
            <li>Been using the same product for many years - love it.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try Super Orgasm rather than Orgasm, because it looked nicer in the box.  </li>
            <li>a lot lighter than i thought it would be but its still very pretty.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Was fun for nights out</li>
            <li>Love this Blush, it is the only brand of blush I will wear.</li>
            <li>(I only say “talked into it”, because I wasn&#x27;t thinking I would ever be the person to spend more that $12 on blush, but I did and I&#x27;m not sad about it.)  </li>
            <li>This is my first excursion into &amp;#34;fancy,&amp;#34; non-drugstore blush.  </li>
            <li>I saw it in Sephora, and was aware of all the hullabaloo about this blush.</li>
            <li>Been using this for a few years, love the shiny glitter in it!</li>
            <li>BUT it has way too much sparkle/glitter in it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even put that much on and it was in the evening.</li>
            <li>It looks VERY glittery in the packaging, like clubwear almost.  </li>
            <li>It appears to go with everything, and lasts the whole day.  </li>
            <li>I kept trying to set it and many other methods.</li>
            <li>but I saw reviews that said Super Orgasm was similar.</li>
            <li>NARS is a treasure for those who get to hold the velvety feeling case in their hand and the blush and eye shadow are my particular favorites here.</li>
            <li>Super Orgasm by NARS is a glowing, dispersed mash of papaya and raspberry shade with a metallic cloud of shimmer with tiny bits of chunky glitter.</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest taj mahal in nars for dark skin women</li>
            <li>While regular Orgasm is shimmery and has peachy/pink highlights, Super Orgasm is VERY glittery, with actual chips of glitter...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad blush, it just wasn&#x27;t the color expected.</li>
            <li>That might sound scary but it’s so wonderfully fine that it looks radiant and as if it was coming from within.</li>
            <li>Maybe in my early 20&#x27;s this would&#x27;ve worked.</li>
            <li>wearing or what makeup goes on, it just looks alive even before I have my coffee without looking over done.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I accidentally bought this instead of the regular NARS &#x27;Orgasm&#x27; blush I normally use.  </li>
            <li>It is super chunky glitter like in the case and the powder transfers to your cheeks pale in hue</li>
            <li>I love the pale sheer pink</li>
            <li>I do like this blush, it&#x27;s just not as dark as it looked online, is pretty sheer.</li>
            <li>I think I will try a more dramatic shade of pink/red for date nights and such.  </li>

            <li> The color of this blush is beautiful BUT it has way too much sparkle/glitter in it. Someone told me that I had glitter on my face. I didn&#x27;t even put that much on and it was in the evening. I would recommend buying just the Orgasm and not the Super.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for Orgasm but I saw reviews that said Super Orgasm was similar. It is, the only issue is that it is EXTREMELY glittery which i&#x27;m not a huge fan of.</li>
            <li> Love this Blush, it is the only brand of blush I will wear. NARS is quality and you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> I have always loved Nars and this color appears perfect w/a beautiful shimmer, but the pigment is very light...I have fair skin and can not get it to show, even after using multiple applicators.</li>
            <li> a lot lighter than i thought it would be but its still very pretty. i just dont like how all the glitter gets everywhere on the case.</li>
            <li> Its a sheer glowy blush. Its build able not overly pigmented. I don&#x27;t like the chunks of glitter because they fall out and get everywhere. Minus the glitter I love the pale sheer pink I am a NW 47 in Mac so it does work on dark skin. I strongly suggest taj mahal in nars for dark skin women</li>
            <li> I love this blush!  I was talked into it by the sales lady at the Sephora store.  (I only say “talked into it”, because I wasn&#x27;t thinking I would ever be the person to spend more that $12 on blush, but I did and I&#x27;m not sad about it.)  It&#x27;s just beautiful!  It&#x27;s a great color and goes on easily and stays on.  (I think it needs a touch up ever 8 hours, but I think that&#x27;s to be expected.)  I&#x27;ve purchased this item several times now and I&#x27;m going to continue to buy it..</li>
            <li> Been using the same product for many years - love it.  Would recommend it to anyone - although the name might not be so great for a young girl stealing her mom&#x27;s makeup!</li>
            <li> This is the longest wearing, silky, best color I ever found in blush. Well worth the price. I tan 3 times a week and needed a blush that would give me some color. It does that and so much more.I am addicted</li>
            <li> This is my first excursion into &amp;#34;fancy,&amp;#34; non-drugstore blush.  I have been using this for the past month.  I saw it in Sephora, and was aware of all the hullabaloo about this blush. I decided to try Super Orgasm rather than Orgasm, because it looked nicer in the box.  It looks VERY glittery in the packaging, like clubwear almost.  However, on the face it is quite subtle, it doesn&#x27;t make me look like a go go dancer or anything.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it every day with different colors of eye shadow. It appears to go with everything, and lasts the whole day.  The texture is fine, but nothing special in comparison with cheaper brands.  It is more expensive than what I&#x27;m used to, however, it appears that it will last for quite some time.  And the color really is so nice, natural, and lovely.  I think I will try a more dramatic shade of pink/red for date nights and such.  Overall, good buy!</li>
            <li> I just love this blush.  It looks great on everybody!!  You won&#x27;t be dissappointed!!  It came quickly as promised, at a great price too!!</li>
            <li> I love this blush... easy to apply... stays on all day... it&#x27;s my favorite...</li>
            <li> I love this blush! Very nice color, shows up nicely. It does have glitter in it, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting, but it isn&#x27;t over powering. I absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t read the description well enough. I had used the regular orgasm color for a couple years and decided to try this one. Maybe in my early 20&#x27;s this would&#x27;ve worked. Now in my mid-30&#x27;s, looks a little inappropriate for the office with all the sparkle. :) I&#x27;m still a huge fan of NARS blush.</li>
            <li> I think this color may be good for pretty much any complexion.</li>
            <li> beautiful colour..looks natural</li>
            <li> NARS is a treasure for those who get to hold the velvety feeling case in their hand and the blush and eye shadow are my particular favorites here. Super Orgasm by NARS is a glowing, dispersed mash of papaya and raspberry shade with a metallic cloud of shimmer with tiny bits of chunky glitter. That might sound scary but it’s so wonderfully fine that it looks radiant and as if it was coming from within. For everyday makeup I reach for this no matter what I’m wearing or what makeup goes on, it just looks alive even before I have my coffee without looking over done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This shade is sultry and sun kissed with this Hollywood Photoshop filler thing going on, it simply looks delicious. I love the whole range and I’m also a fan of the NARS Sin  and Orgasm blushes, but this is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Kasia S.</li>
            <li> I do like this blush, it&#x27;s just not as dark as it looked online, is pretty sheer. If I&#x27;d gone in person to purchase, I would have gotten a different color.  It&#x27;s not a bad blush, it just wasn&#x27;t the color expected.</li>
            <li> The blush is nice, but the color I choose doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This product got dumped. I kept trying to set it and many other methods. It is super chunky glitter like in the case and the powder transfers to your cheeks pale in hue (I&#x27;m translucent) and you wind up covered in glitter. Was fun for nights out but I got sick of it as glitter was everywhere in my make up bag.</li>
            <li> I swear these containers are getting smaller and smaller?!</li>
            <li> I accidentally bought this instead of the regular NARS &#x27;Orgasm&#x27; blush I normally use.  While regular Orgasm is shimmery and has peachy/pink highlights, Super Orgasm is VERY glittery, with actual chips of glitter... yuck!  Might be okay for a young girl going to prom or something, but not for me!!!</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few years, love the shiny glitter in it! Great product!</li>
