            <li>It was so nice to find this discontinued blush.  </li>
            <li>the color is nice</li>
            <li>So I was so thrilled to find it here</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>but I paid more for the product than I should have.  </li>
            <li>love the product but it came in a foundation package and looked used.</li>
            <li>I love this blush.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t the color I ordered, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>It works better for me than a brush-on blush.</li>
            <li>While I love the original product, this appears to be an item that &amp;#34;couldn&#x27;t make the grade&amp;#34; for retail.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products but this one works best for me.</li>
            <li>goes on so easily and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>Since this has apparently been discontinued in stores, I was happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have ivory toned skin &amp; dark hair, this color is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Like others, I am a Bzzz Agent and got to try this for free.  </li>
            <li>this bulky box won&#x27;t fit my cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li>For a low price, this blush was wonderful, and outperformed blush that I&#x27;ve spent three times more for.</li>
            <li>This blush goes on evenly, stays fresh looking.  </li>
            <li>I had actually been eyeballing it at the store for a while and was thrilled when I got to try it out.</li>
            <li>This stuff is highly pigmented -- easy to wind up looking like Baby Jane.  </li>
            <li>but when you run your finger across it the blend isn&#x27;t right and/or consistant.  </li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t as dark as it looks like it would be, which is good.  </li>
            <li>I can say I am pretty happy with this blush, though I was surprised that Cinnamon color 210 looks very natural on me as I usually tend to use more pinkish hues.</li>
            <li>I will most likely repurchase.</li>
            <li>Im planning to order more in the future.</li>
            <li>I tried a different shade, however, and was pleased.</li>
            <li>Love this product especially for &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; skin!</li>
            <li>that I ordered two of them to make sure I had enough for a year or two .It  </li>
            <li>Glad I was able to purchase 2; it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li>once you touched your cheek with it, it didn&#x27;t spread very well leaving one spot that was much darker than the rest.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Color is VERY BERRY.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s too much.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore the Revlon&#x27;s cream blush and minimum packaging they use.</li>
            <li>It is a very natural looking blush that says on very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The color is buildable so I can use a little for day/work and add more for evening.</li>
            <li>I am older &amp; it looks very natural on me.  </li>
            <li>Considering how little I&#x27;ve used with each application, I am expecting this to last a very long time, which makes it a great value for the price.</li>
            <li>Just have to get used to using it in small amounts but it does come off easily if you happen to use a bit too much.</li>
            <li>Love this product; not sure why it was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>I bought this directly from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>So far I like this</li>
            <li>it gives a natural blush with staying power.  </li>
            <li>The blush is smooth and  silky but not greasy or oily and does not concentrate on uneven skin.</li>
            <li>Goes on creamy and looks natural.</li>
            <li>Color is a little more vibrant than I would like, but it&#x27;s easy to just use a little less!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for older women 40 above.  </li>

            <li> I recommend this product for older women 40 above.  </li>
            <li> , it takes a little practice for beginners like me, but not hard to get the hang of at all.</li>
            <li> Customers already know this old trick: bigger packaging - less product.</li>
            <li> I prefer cream blushes, but, sometimes they streak, or have strange color changes.</li>

            <li> I have dark hair &amp; dark complexion</li>
            <li> I use this product on a daily basis, I used liquid and powder blush, and it leaves my complexion in a poor taste.  </li>
            <li> The strange thing is that manufacturers still think we are dumb.</li>
            <li> But the packaging is disappointing, very bulky, excess of transparent plastic around the actual plate with the product,  the sponge is useless and flimsy and I would prefer to have a mirror on the lid than this useless oversized sponge compartment.</li>
            <li> was disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple years and was so disappointed when Cover Girl quit making it.</li>
            <li> My son saw that I was very disappointed.  </li>

            <li> This blush goes on evenly, stays fresh looking.  It is the best blush I have ever used.  Love the color.</li>
            <li> Fabulous!! Love my cream blush!!</li>
            <li> I bought this directly from Amazon.  I like the product but I paid more for the product than I should have.  Walmart sells the same product in different colors for less money in their stores.</li>
            <li> Again, I like this product.</li>
            <li> It was so nice to find this discontinued blush.  I was so bummed that they quit making a great product.</li>
            <li> Like others, I am a Bzzz Agent and got to try this for free.  I had actually been eyeballing it at the store for a while and was thrilled when I got to try it out. I have ivory toned skin &amp; dark hair, this color is perfect for me. The color is buildable so I can use a little for day/work and add more for evening. I am a novice at using cream blush, I&#x27;ve used powder for years. So far I like this, it takes a little practice for beginners like me, but not hard to get the hang of at all. Considering how little I&#x27;ve used with each application, I am expecting this to last a very long time, which makes it a great value for the price. I will most likely repurchase.</li>
            <li> was disappointed in this product.  the color is nice but when you run your finger across it the blend isn&#x27;t right and/or consistant.  once you touched your cheek with it, it didn&#x27;t spread very well leaving one spot that was much darker than the rest.</li>
            <li> While I love the original product, this appears to be an item that &amp;#34;couldn&#x27;t make the grade&amp;#34; for retail.  That comment is strictly about the appearance of the product. I purchased two of them and they both have similar appearance.  However, it still works like what I bought at retail stores (and can no longer find at retail locations).</li>
            <li> Loved this product. Hope it is sold again</li>
            <li> love the product but it came in a foundation package and looked used.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this item. It has been discontinued by CoverGirl, although I don&#x27;t know why. So I bought 3 of the same. I don&#x27;t want to run out. It&#x27;s the best blush I&#x27;ve ever had. Thanks</li>
            <li> I use this product on a daily basis, I used liquid and powder blush, and it leaves my complexion in a poor taste.  This product leaves my complextion looking youthful it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.  I recommend this product for older women 40 above.  It met my expections 100% percent.  I&#x27;ve been looking for this product for 6 months driving to 6 targets, 5 pharmacies, and it wasn&#x27;t on their  shelves.  My son saw that I was very disappointed.  He decided to order it through Amazon, and thank god he found it.  Thank you Amazon.  It&#x27;s a great product, Im planning to order more in the future.</li>
            <li> Color is VERY BERRY. I have dark hair &amp; dark complexion but it&#x27;s too much. Prob best on someone of color.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this product in our local stores anymore.  it gives a natural blush with staying power.  I&#x27;ve tried other products but this one works best for me.</li>
            <li> I love this blush.  The color isn&#x27;t as dark as it looks like it would be, which is good.  It&#x27;s a beautiful flush color on my olive skin.  It is creamy, but not greasy.  I am older &amp; it looks very natural on me.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> La mercancia es de excelente calidad, y llego a tiempo segun lo establecido en el sistema. Lo recomiendo 100 %... Venezuela</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the color I ordered, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>

I absolutely adore the Revlon&#x27;s cream blush and minimum packaging they use.I wish Covergirl follow their example.Customers already know this old trick: bigger packaging - less product. The strange thing is that manufacturers still think we are dumb.</li>
            <li> CoverGirl took this blush off the market, so  I bought 2 on amazon.com.  It is a very natural looking blush that says on very well.</li>
            <li> Great product for a really good price. Goes on creamy and looks natural.</li>
            <li> This product has been discontinued by the company, but I like it, &amp; was looking for way to continue using it.  It works better for me than a brush-on blush.</li>
            <li> Since this has apparently been discontinued in stores, I was happy to find it on Amazon.  Color is a little more vibrant than I would like, but it&#x27;s easy to just use a little less!</li>
            <li> Way too &amp;#34;berry&amp;#34; for me.  This stuff is highly pigmented -- easy to wind up looking like Baby Jane.  I tried a different shade, however, and was pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this product; not sure why it was discontinued.  Glad I was able to purchase 2; it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this product especially for &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; skin! I hope it is never discontinued!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  I have used it for years!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple years and was so disappointed when Cover Girl quit making it. So I was so thrilled to find it here that I ordered two of them to make sure I had enough for a year or two .It  goes on so easily and stays on all day. Just have to get used to using it in small amounts but it does come off easily if you happen to use a bit too much.</li>
