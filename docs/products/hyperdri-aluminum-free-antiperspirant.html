    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This item is awesome.  </li>
            <li>I am very impressed with it.  </li>
            <li>and it is the best antiperspirant I have ever found.</li>
            <li>This is NOT the perfect replacement for aluminum based antiperspirants, but it does work to lessen perspiration.</li>
            <li>I also apply an antiperspirant-free stick deodorant as needed, and the combination provides very good odor control.</li>
            <li>It smells so good like lemon!</li>
            <li>My 5 month experience has been great.  </li>
            <li>I have now been using this for almost a month and am extremely happy with it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, a great product.</li>
            <li>this product&#x27;s effectiveness, my air conditioning malfunctioned for three weeks during 90 degree F weather, and it worked fabulously!!!</li>
            <li>This would be a very easy fix for Klima!  </li>
            <li>It is a good alternative to Aluminum antiperspirant, but when you sweat, you sweat out all sorts of toxins; toxins that cause breast cancer.  </li>
            <li>This is a good antiperspirant without all the aluminum.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing how well this has worked for me.  </li>
            <li>It is however ideal for those of us who without the use of an antiperspirant nor deodorant have MINIMAL odor at best.</li>
            <li>The product information states that it may take 30 days to be fully effective.  </li>
            <li>love it and it does a good job as described,  recomend it to everyone.  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything on the market and nothing was all that effective -</li>
            <li>It also has a lemon scent which I really liked.</li>
            <li>Do I still sweat, sure, but having this aluminum free option is great.  </li>
            <li>Thrilled with the product, tried many types but none worked like this.</li>
            <li>This antiperspirant works fairly well after the month it explicitly states it will take to reach full effectiveness.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I just love it.  </li>
            <li>and now I can be sweat free again, without having to worry about aluminum!  </li>
            <li>It is better than just deodorant, for sure.  </li>
            <li>A bottle lasts me closer to 45 days, but that is more by choice.  </li>
            <li>It reduces sweating better than aluminum-based antiperspirants ever did for me (</li>
            <li>Baby powder worked better than this.</li>
            <li>but it is too viscous for the spray bottle, would be better in a roll on</li>
            <li>well anyway; the combination of this and the stick deodorant works better.</li>
            <li>and I have hung in there more than a month,</li>
            <li>I was, however, expecting to get more than 6 weeks of use out of something that cost $30.  </li>
            <li>I love the product, I&#x27;m giving 4 out of 5 because the packaging needs work.</li>
            <li>and I had better results putting the Klima on and then waiting like 10 minutes and then putting deodorant on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to the aluminum ingreduents in most anti perspirant products, so I&#x27;ve been looking every where for some that is aluminum free.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of aluminum free.</li>
            <li>, this product doesn&#x27;t keep you from smelling great and needs a natural deodorant to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But 90% of the time I did not sweat, and much much more importantly to me, when I did sweat, I did not smell.  </li>
            <li>The product is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This product does a very good job in keeping me dry.  </li>
            <li>Despite this, I love the product and am now a loyal customer.  </li>
            <li>some that were tied were moderately effective for those tested whom did not have much of an odor to begin with when using no antiperspirant or deodorant (baseline control).</li>
            <li>It DID make me smell fresh most of the Day.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions precisely, and, after one month, I exclusively use this antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I tried all different kinds of antiperspirant, and none of them worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using HyperDri, and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Worked first application, better than aluminum deodorants, no odor</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>So far I love it!</li>
            <li>Also, it does not cover the B.O smell, so I suggest using a light deodorant afterwards to keep yourself smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>Other than that, great.</li>
            <li>So, I think I will just stick with deodorant and talc free powder and just apply it more frequently.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another theory I have as to who this product works best for is about your overall internal health</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a product to effectively control perspiration and you perspire an AVERAGE amount, this is the product for you, otherwise it is not and it AINT CHEAP!</li>
            <li>Seems like the Klima needs to totally soak into the skin first after you rub it in really good.</li>
            <li>This product has worked exactly as the description claims!  </li>
            <li>there is over 75% of the stuff left still, amazing</li>
            <li>And it is so worth it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even worth the hefty price.  </li>
            <li>SVENDOCTOR REVIEWS: 100% non-bias reviews, 100% honest and tested personally.  </li>
            <li>is worth it.</li>
            <li>It has some essential oils that make it smell nice, but they don&#x27;t work well as a deodorant.</li>
            <li>Worth the price, will buy again when out.</li>
            <li>I found it interesting though as I do not actually sweat much, or historically have not, so I wondered if this might be a good sign for my health.  </li>
            <li>However, one of my good friends has had the same bottle for more than 60 days and still has some left.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>but really it&#x27;s worth it to me-</li>
            <li>I like to play it safe and use a little more than required.  </li>
            <li>In case you do sweat even slightly throughout the day it is a good idea to put a spray-on deodorant over the hyper-dri.  </li>
            <li>In the average individual, this will control perspiration for 75%-90% of the 24-hour effective period whether you exercise or not, however in the AVERAGE person, the odor is controlled for 6-12 hours AT BEST WITH the use of an additional deodorant and then only SOME deodorants are effective for this purpose, its really a hit or miss.</li>
            <li>I just got this in the mail today and tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li>It worked at first</li>
            <li>I followed the directions for 30+ days and the product didn&#x27;t work exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>- I eat gluten free, all natural foods, lots of water and do cardio</li>
            <li>I am 40, and I&#x27;ve had some auto-immune issues most of my life, worsening in the last 10 years.  </li>
            <li>Be aware, you need a deodorant as well</li>
            <li>Basically I was pretty smelly for a month.</li>
            <li>The best solution I have come up with is to apply the HyperDri right after I shower and then smear on a little bit of homemade deodorant (I mix together 2T baking soda, 2T cornstarch, and 2-3T coconut oil and store it in a little jar).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this bottle for exactly five months now, and I still have some left, which makes the high price tag a bit more tolerable.</li>
            <li>one of my skin&#x27;s reactions to the aluminum is to sweat more), but I still have damp underarms all summer long, and any time I&#x27;m under stress.</li>
            <li>I have held it up to the light and tried to find some kind of indication, but I can only ascertain from the weight of it that I am likely ready for a new one.</li>
            <li>It is certainly better than no antiperspirant, but for the price I paid I had hoped it would keep me dry all the time.  </li>
            <li>But for a product that costs several times more than a normal stick of deodorant...</li>
            <li>For not having aluminum, which is why I bought it in the first place, it worked decently well.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice to see a little window or something.</li>
            <li>If I were only paying a few dollars for the HyperDri, I&#x27;d be happy with this solution.  </li>
            <li>After only about 2 weeks of use, I could tell a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li>I sweat as much as if I wasn&#x27;t wearing deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I have gone through 3 of these, and it really seems to work.  </li>
            <li>really care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really really really wanted this product to work bc</li>
            <li>The product keeps the skin feeling very sticky and the perspiration is definately not stopped.</li>
            <li>It did take several days for it to start working, but since then I&#x27;ve been comfortable throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>There is no way to know when this will happen, as there is no discernible way to tell how much is in the bottle at any point in time.  </li>
            <li>Be patient, it took 5 weeks to really start working for me.</li>
            <li>I purchased this antiperspirant because I developed an allergy to aluminum and was no longer able to use traditional antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li>considering I doubled up for the first week because I was nervous it wouldn&#x27;t work - maybe that&#x27;s a new trick?</li>
            <li>Incidentally, I live in the south, and it&#x27;s hot here.</li>
            <li>It is effective, has a subtle fresh scent</li>
            <li>It works, for the most part, but I do have to use something stronger for extreme perspiration.</li>
            <li>but since I live in a warm climate I just went back to regular anti-perspirant yesterday.</li>
            <li>A container lasts a fairly long time (months), so, although it isn&#x27;t cheap, the price isn&#x27;t outrageous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s just this particular bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll know for sure when I finish it and open the next one.</li>
            <li>Not a big deal, but creates more steps with the subsequent washing of hands.  </li>
            <li>Follow the directions and remember it will take a month or a little more to work.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who sweats a lot and wants to use a natural product.</li>
            <li>It took a week or 2 for the sweat to be completely gone, but now I go through the whole day without any sweat.</li>
            <li>I think if your someone who sweats normally, this product would work.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure how much of an effect going aluminum-free has had on my health, as I&#x27;ve been doing many things simultaneously, but I will say, I&#x27;m improving, and I&#x27;m not sweating profusely, nor am I uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first I only switched to a natural deodorant, which at first seemed to work.  </li>
            <li>Also, make certain you completely dry your underarms after your shower, with a freshly laundered towel each time.  </li>
            <li>I am definitely not sweating any more than normal, and my clothes remain dry when I&#x27;ve worn sleeves.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my solution to eliminating aluminum chlorhydrate, which is the primary ingredient in all other antiperspirants.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li>After careful research I decided to try Hyper Dri due to the fact that it is supposed to be highly effective at preventing perspiration as well as odor, without the use of aluminum.  </li>
            <li>I had the exact opposite experience.</li>
            <li>Double the amount for the first week?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I order this with high hopes, however, after using the entire product it was very ineffective.</li>
            <li>During the 1st month of use, I continued using regular (aluminum based) antiperspirant with it to give HyperDri time to reach its full potential.</li>
            <li>I did break a sweat doing things like rolling out pie dough and scrubbing down the shower, and I am sure it would not have held up in a gym, if I ever went to such a place.  </li>
            <li>and I believe It certainly does not provide enough protection to help some one with hyperhidrosis.</li>
            <li>After a few days I was sweat free.  </li>
            <li>After nearly 2 months of use it has yet to do either.  </li>
            <li>It completely stopped my underarm sweat.</li>
            <li>The smell problem is easily fixed with aluminum-free deodorant or body spray, so I don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I use it at night and use a natural (non-antiperspirant) in the morning.</li>
            <li>I pair this additionally with a stick of natural deodorant from another company.  </li>
            <li>You cannot see how much product is left.</li>
            <li>Also if you work out hard or are super stressed or it is extremely hot</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how well this product might work on a man, (typically men sweat more heavily than women), but on this woman it works pretty well.    </li>
            <li>My findings were that in an individual who does not exercise, the odor control may last from 6-12 hours MAXIMUM however ONLY WHEN combined with a deodorant (aluminum free of course, otherwise what&#x27;s the point) that also takes rigorous testing as NOT ALL deodorants tried were effective (Every Man Jack, Tom&#x27;s were completely useless)</li>
            <li>I had been using the clinical strength stuff that was now available over the counter and had little to no benefit over what regular antipersperant would do.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be curious to know if others with this same lifestyle would have as much success with this antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>The pump that this deodorant comes with twists up out of the bottle, and every time I depressed it it would twist right down into the bottle again.  </li>
            <li>hope they continue to manufacture this product, because those of us who are allergic to aluminum-based products have no other choices.</li>
            <li>I was having some major issues with sweat.  </li>
            <li>Not strong enough for me to help with odor control after a whole day at work or outdoors in hot weather</li>
            <li>I finally found this product, which seemed to be the only one with semi decent reviews.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions of use - one small pump per underarm for one month straight, no skipping days, and I did gradually stop sweating and the essential oils seem to balance out with any body odour - I just end up smelling like skin, which is exactly what I want to smell  like.</li>
            <li>In the last 5, I&#x27;ve been doing everything I can to get it under control naturally, which included ditching my aluminum deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Although the perspiration is effectively controlled approximately 75-90% on average and including all tested individuals, the odor is NOT.</li>
            <li>This has been less effective for me than standard Secret deodorant.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> SVENDOCTOR REVIEWS: 100% non-bias reviews, 100% honest and tested personally.  </li>
            <li> is worth it.</li>
            <li> It has some essential oils that make it smell nice, but they don&#x27;t work well as a deodorant.</li>
            <li> Worth the price, will buy again when out.</li>
            <li> I found it interesting though as I do not actually sweat much, or historically have not, so I wondered if this might be a good sign for my health.  </li>
            <li> However, one of my good friends has had the same bottle for more than 60 days and still has some left.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> but really it&#x27;s worth it to me-</li>
            <li> I like to play it safe and use a little more than required.  </li>
            <li> In case you do sweat even slightly throughout the day it is a good idea to put a spray-on deodorant over the hyper-dri.  </li>
            <li> In the average individual, this will control perspiration for 75%-90% of the 24-hour effective period whether you exercise or not, however in the AVERAGE person, the odor is controlled for 6-12 hours AT BEST WITH the use of an additional deodorant and then only SOME deodorants are effective for this purpose, its really a hit or miss.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today and tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li> It worked at first</li>
            <li> I followed the directions for 30+ days and the product didn&#x27;t work exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> - I eat gluten free, all natural foods, lots of water and do cardio</li>
            <li> I am 40, and I&#x27;ve had some auto-immune issues most of my life, worsening in the last 10 years.  </li>
            <li> Be aware, you need a deodorant as well</li>
            <li> Basically I was pretty smelly for a month.</li>
            <li> The best solution I have come up with is to apply the HyperDri right after I shower and then smear on a little bit of homemade deodorant (I mix together 2T baking soda, 2T cornstarch, and 2-3T coconut oil and store it in a little jar).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this bottle for exactly five months now, and I still have some left, which makes the high price tag a bit more tolerable.</li>
            <li> one of my skin&#x27;s reactions to the aluminum is to sweat more), but I still have damp underarms all summer long, and any time I&#x27;m under stress.</li>
            <li> I have held it up to the light and tried to find some kind of indication, but I can only ascertain from the weight of it that I am likely ready for a new one.</li>
            <li> It is certainly better than no antiperspirant, but for the price I paid I had hoped it would keep me dry all the time.  </li>
            <li> But for a product that costs several times more than a normal stick of deodorant...</li>
            <li> For not having aluminum, which is why I bought it in the first place, it worked decently well.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice to see a little window or something.</li>
            <li> If I were only paying a few dollars for the HyperDri, I&#x27;d be happy with this solution.  </li>
            <li> After only about 2 weeks of use, I could tell a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li> I sweat as much as if I wasn&#x27;t wearing deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I have gone through 3 of these, and it really seems to work.  </li>
            <li> really care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really really really wanted this product to work bc</li>
            <li> The product keeps the skin feeling very sticky and the perspiration is definately not stopped.</li>
            <li> It did take several days for it to start working, but since then I&#x27;ve been comfortable throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> There is no way to know when this will happen, as there is no discernible way to tell how much is in the bottle at any point in time.  </li>
            <li> Be patient, it took 5 weeks to really start working for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this antiperspirant because I developed an allergy to aluminum and was no longer able to use traditional antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li> considering I doubled up for the first week because I was nervous it wouldn&#x27;t work - maybe that&#x27;s a new trick?</li>
            <li> Incidentally, I live in the south, and it&#x27;s hot here.</li>
            <li> It is effective, has a subtle fresh scent</li>
            <li> It works, for the most part, but I do have to use something stronger for extreme perspiration.</li>
            <li> but since I live in a warm climate I just went back to regular anti-perspirant yesterday.</li>
            <li> A container lasts a fairly long time (months), so, although it isn&#x27;t cheap, the price isn&#x27;t outrageous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s just this particular bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll know for sure when I finish it and open the next one.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, but creates more steps with the subsequent washing of hands.  </li>
            <li> Follow the directions and remember it will take a month or a little more to work.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who sweats a lot and wants to use a natural product.</li>
            <li> It took a week or 2 for the sweat to be completely gone, but now I go through the whole day without any sweat.</li>
            <li> I think if your someone who sweats normally, this product would work.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how much of an effect going aluminum-free has had on my health, as I&#x27;ve been doing many things simultaneously, but I will say, I&#x27;m improving, and I&#x27;m not sweating profusely, nor am I uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first I only switched to a natural deodorant, which at first seemed to work.  </li>
            <li> Also, make certain you completely dry your underarms after your shower, with a freshly laundered towel each time.  </li>
            <li> I am definitely not sweating any more than normal, and my clothes remain dry when I&#x27;ve worn sleeves.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my solution to eliminating aluminum chlorhydrate, which is the primary ingredient in all other antiperspirants.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li> After careful research I decided to try Hyper Dri due to the fact that it is supposed to be highly effective at preventing perspiration as well as odor, without the use of aluminum.  </li>
            <li> I had the exact opposite experience.</li>
            <li> Double the amount for the first week?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I order this with high hopes, however, after using the entire product it was very ineffective.</li>
            <li> During the 1st month of use, I continued using regular (aluminum based) antiperspirant with it to give HyperDri time to reach its full potential.</li>
            <li> I did break a sweat doing things like rolling out pie dough and scrubbing down the shower, and I am sure it would not have held up in a gym, if I ever went to such a place.  </li>
            <li> and I believe It certainly does not provide enough protection to help some one with hyperhidrosis.</li>
            <li> After a few days I was sweat free.  </li>
            <li> After nearly 2 months of use it has yet to do either.  </li>
            <li> It completely stopped my underarm sweat.</li>
            <li> The smell problem is easily fixed with aluminum-free deodorant or body spray, so I don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I use it at night and use a natural (non-antiperspirant) in the morning.</li>
            <li> I pair this additionally with a stick of natural deodorant from another company.  </li>
            <li> You cannot see how much product is left.</li>
            <li> Also if you work out hard or are super stressed or it is extremely hot</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well this product might work on a man, (typically men sweat more heavily than women), but on this woman it works pretty well.    </li>
            <li> My findings were that in an individual who does not exercise, the odor control may last from 6-12 hours MAXIMUM however ONLY WHEN combined with a deodorant (aluminum free of course, otherwise what&#x27;s the point) that also takes rigorous testing as NOT ALL deodorants tried were effective (Every Man Jack, Tom&#x27;s were completely useless)</li>
            <li> I had been using the clinical strength stuff that was now available over the counter and had little to no benefit over what regular antipersperant would do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be curious to know if others with this same lifestyle would have as much success with this antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> The pump that this deodorant comes with twists up out of the bottle, and every time I depressed it it would twist right down into the bottle again.  </li>
            <li> hope they continue to manufacture this product, because those of us who are allergic to aluminum-based products have no other choices.</li>
            <li> I was having some major issues with sweat.  </li>
            <li> Not strong enough for me to help with odor control after a whole day at work or outdoors in hot weather</li>
            <li> I finally found this product, which seemed to be the only one with semi decent reviews.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions of use - one small pump per underarm for one month straight, no skipping days, and I did gradually stop sweating and the essential oils seem to balance out with any body odour - I just end up smelling like skin, which is exactly what I want to smell  like.</li>
            <li> In the last 5, I&#x27;ve been doing everything I can to get it under control naturally, which included ditching my aluminum deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Although the perspiration is effectively controlled approximately 75-90% on average and including all tested individuals, the odor is NOT.</li>
            <li> This has been less effective for me than standard Secret deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month, it started working very well after 2 weeks and by a month my underarms were completely dry all the time save a little overall &#x27;verging on damp&#x27; feeling considering your skin is constantly pressed together in this area.</li>
            <li> have a medical condition, and my Doctor said I had high heavy metal counts in my body.  </li>
            <li> I have used Certain Dri in the past, and it worked, but I wanted to try and fix the issue without aluminum.  </li>
            <li> nice, swampy underarms are still an unpleasant feeling.  </li>
            <li> There really aren&#x27;t any other alternatives besides using plain deodorant, which doesn&#x27;t keep you from sweating...and while minimizing odor is</li>
            <li> I can wear grey tee shirts again!</li>
            <li> It is a bit sticky at first annoying to put on your fingers, but worth it for no yellow stains!</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry unless I&#x27;m engaged in extra-strenuous activities.</li>
            <li> it has worked for others, so I would at least try it (just not with high expectations) if you have $25 to spare, as it may just be me.</li>
            <li> It twists open, but when I depress the pump to apply the product, it will close on itself if I don&#x27;t hold the twisting part in place while pressing down.</li>
            <li> Even if the product worked only a little bit, I would probably purchase it again, but the product did not work at all.</li>
            <li> It is not really a deodorant thought</li>
            <li> After just under six weeks of directed use (one pump per underarm per day), the bottle was empty.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few months now, and can definitely tell the difference.</li>
            <li> But the every day wet marks under the arms will gradually stop.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that the application were a little different - does Klima not work in a roller ball or other typical underarm applicator?</li>
            <li> My sister had breast cancer 2 years ago and her doctors will not let her use Antiperspirant due to the aluminum.  </li>
            <li> like some of the other reviewers, I also had a problem with odor.  </li>
            <li> I have not had a problem with odor when I used ANY other product, or even with NO deodorant or antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After trying at least 20 different products, all of which claimed to be an aluminum-free antiperspirant,  I am adding this to my list of products that absolutely do not work!  </li>
            <li> NOT a product for the average person wishing to eliminate odor and stay away from aluminum-containing products.</li>
            <li> The only negative I have is that it is not a deodorant.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the packaging is odd.</li>
            <li> I just got used to keeping my arms down and avoiding contact that might show my arm pit sweat.  </li>
            <li> so I just by a deodorant (Kenneth Cole Black) and use both.</li>
            <li> but on top of the the fact that they can&#x27;t seem to make this a roll-on product, it was very annoying to essentially have to reopen the bottle for each underarm each day.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I decided to try this product because I hate sweating and I wanted an aluminum free alternative.  </li>
            <li> I switched to this because it is aluminum-free, and aluminum has been implicated (if not necessarily conclusively) in both breast cancer and Alzheimer&#x27;s, and the clinical-strength antiperspirant wasn&#x27;t working that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not particularly thrilled with: the price, the fact that it&#x27;s a little messy (it&#x27;s a gel that needs to be rubbed into your armpits with your fingers), and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain a deodorant (which would be an added bonus, I think).</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it and would recommend this to anyone unable to use aluminum based deodorants!!</li>
            <li> So whatever they do to control really bad BO, which I have, really does work.  </li>
            <li> I have an issue with excessive sweating in my armpit area, and have since I was about 15</li>
            <li> I will update in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used serums in this type of packaging in the past and they don&#x27;t have this flaw.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product - it seems ridonkulously expensive</li>
            <li> No more stains on my t-shirts from the sweat.  </li>
            <li> But it dries within a very few minutes.  </li>
            <li> My three star rating is broken down as follows: 1) 2 stars for container 2) 4 stars for effectiveness 3)</li>
            <li> and I hardly ever sweat anymore.  </li>
            <li> But I promise I have had no wet spots or unpleasant odour and also - its been a month and</li>
            <li> /&gt;The packaging is garbage; the twist top is unnecessary and horrible to</li>
            <li> It is not effective at all.  </li>
            <li> What sucks is that I was at work at the time this happened, and didn&#x27;t have the bottle with me.</li>
            <li> I am sick of the yellow stains in my fav shirts.</li>
            <li> almost didn&#x27;t purchase because of all of the bad reviews on how annoying it is to use, how it plan doesn&#x27;t work and that it apparently isn&#x27;t even lasting a month for people.</li>
            <li> I work out hard at the gym 5 days a week, so I sweat a lot, and I do not want to stink!</li>
            <li> Sadly, it&#x27;s been almost 3 weeks, and  there has been 0% improvement in my excessive underarm perspiration.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but it works at least as well as the clinical strength (20% aluminum) antiperspirant I had been using.</li>
            <li> It has dramatically decreased my underarm sweat without exposing me to harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I am a convert.  </li>
            <li> Klima may look expensive but it lasts about 6 months.</li>
            <li> Deodorants, of course, are merely meant to reduce or disguise odor - they do nothing to reduce perspiration.</li>
            <li> I know it is expensive and takes time to work</li>
            <li> I would sweat when it was cold.  </li>
            <li> Some people state they do get results from this stuff, but it just isn&#x27;t cutting it for me</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s disappointing.</li>
            <li> But as the effects of the aluminum wore off (my hypothesis), I began to feel dampness, which I found too unpleasant to tolerate.  </li>
            <li> I am highly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I hate to sweat</li>
            <li> The reason I am giving 4 stars is that it is annoying to apply (you have to rub it in with your hands).  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This item is awesome.  I just love it.  I had switched from antiperspirant, to deodorant, about a year ago.  I was concerned about aluminum.  When I found this, I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes!  I hate to sweat and now I can be sweat free again, without having to worry about aluminum!  This product does a very good job in keeping me dry.  I am very impressed with it.  I do wish it came in a  spray or a solid, instead of gel.  But it dries within a very few minutes.  And it is so worth it.  It&#x27;s even worth the hefty price.  Yaaaaaaaaaaay!  Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  8-29-13  After using this product for awhile, I still sweat.  It is better than just deodorant, for sure.  But it still doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as aluminum antiperspirant in my opinion.  But, I will never use Aluminum antiperspirants again, either.  They can cause breast cancer.  My sister had breast cancer 2 years ago and her doctors will not let her use Antiperspirant due to the aluminum.  I tried this aluminum HyperDri and I do like it; however, after prolonged use, I give it only 4 stars.  It is a good alternative to Aluminum antiperspirant, but when you sweat, you sweat out all sorts of toxins; toxins that cause breast cancer.  So, I think I will just stick with deodorant and talc free powder and just apply it more frequently.  Also, make certain you completely dry your underarms after your shower, with a freshly laundered towel each time.  Then, odor causing bacteria, does not collect. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Just does not work! You cannot even use it as a deodorant let alone as an antiperspirant. I order this with high hopes, however, after using the entire product it was very ineffective.</li>
            <li> I would sweat when it was cold.  I just got used to keeping my arms down and avoiding contact that might show my arm pit sweat.  I had been using the clinical strength stuff that was now available over the counter and had little to no benefit over what regular antipersperant would do.  I searched and found HyperDri.  After a few days I was sweat free.  Amazing how well this has worked for me.  The product is easy to use.  My 5 month experience has been great.  A bottle lasts me closer to 45 days, but that is more by choice.  I like to play it safe and use a little more than required.  If you sweat no matter what, give this a try.</li>
            <li> SVENDOCTOR REVIEWS: 100% non-bias reviews, 100% honest and tested personally.  Product DOES NOT work as advertised, this was tried by 5 different individuals and tested in compliance with the product instructions, followed in detail, mixture of BOTH men and women. Although the perspiration is effectively controlled approximately 75-90% on average and including all tested individuals, the odor is NOT. My findings were that in an individual who does not exercise, the odor control may last from 6-12 hours MAXIMUM however ONLY WHEN combined with a deodorant (aluminum free of course, otherwise what&#x27;s the point) that also takes rigorous testing as NOT ALL deodorants tried were effective (Every Man Jack, Tom&#x27;s were completely useless) some that were tied were moderately effective for those tested whom did not have much of an odor to begin with when using no antiperspirant or deodorant (baseline control). Verdict: marginal product for current advertisement choice. In the average individual, this will control perspiration for 75%-90% of the 24-hour effective period whether you exercise or not, however in the AVERAGE person, the odor is controlled for 6-12 hours AT BEST WITH the use of an additional deodorant and then only SOME deodorants are effective for this purpose, its really a hit or miss. NOT a product for the average person wishing to eliminate odor and stay away from aluminum-containing products. It is however ideal for those of us who without the use of an antiperspirant nor deodorant have MINIMAL odor at best. If you&#x27;re looking for a product to effectively control perspiration and you perspire an AVERAGE amount, this is the product for you, otherwise it is not and it AINT CHEAP!</li>
            <li> Worked first application, better than aluminum deodorants, no odor no sweat and  it can&#x27;t be washed off one applied.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted to like this product.  I even bought two bottles, hoping it was just taking longer to work for me.  I followed the instructions, and have not missed a day for over two months.  I sweat as much as if I wasn&#x27;t wearing deodorant.  I have an issue with excessive sweating in my armpit area, and have since I was about 15 (i&#x27;m 24 now).  I have used Certain Dri in the past, and it worked, but I wanted to try and fix the issue without aluminum.  I think if your someone who sweats normally, this product would work.  Also, it does not cover the B.O smell, so I suggest using a light deodorant afterwards to keep yourself smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to the aluminum ingreduents in most anti perspirant products, so I&#x27;ve been looking every where for some that is aluminum free. I finally found this product, which seemed to be the only one with semi decent reviews. It DID make me smell fresh most of the Day. However, this product did not help with wetness protection. Some people state they do get results from this stuff, but it just isn&#x27;t cutting it for me and I believe It certainly does not provide enough protection to help some one with hyperhidrosis.</li>
            <li> After careful research I decided to try Hyper Dri due to the fact that it is supposed to be highly effective at preventing perspiration as well as odor, without the use of aluminum.  After nearly 2 months of use it has yet to do either.  This has been less effective for me than standard Secret deodorant.  Given the price I paid I am highly disappointed.  Based on the reviews I read it has worked for others, so I would at least try it (just not with high expectations) if you have $25 to spare, as it may just be me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a number of articles that suggest there may be a link between aluminum and Alzheimers Disease, so I decided to try this aluminum-free antiperspirant. Don&#x27;t let all those companies who brag about their deodorants being aluminum-free fool you: they are NOT antiperspirant/deodorants, they are simply deodorants! Personally I can&#x27;t stand the feeling of wetness under my arms, although I realize there are some people who aren&#x27;t bothered by it at all (my husband, for instance).     I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5-6 months now, and I quite like it. It keeps me dry unless I&#x27;m engaged in extra-strenuous activities. I don&#x27;t know how well this product might work on a man, (typically men sweat more heavily than women), but on this woman it works pretty well.    There are three things about it I&#x27;m not particularly thrilled with: the price, the fact that it&#x27;s a little messy (it&#x27;s a gel that needs to be rubbed into your armpits with your fingers), and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain a deodorant (which would be an added bonus, I think). I&#x27;ll continue to buy this product, however, because it works for me and the peace-of-mind I have in keeping aluminum out of my bloodstream is worth it.</li>
            <li> I have gone through 3 of these, and it really seems to work.  Do I still sweat, sure, but having this aluminum free option is great.  The reason I am giving 4 stars is that it is annoying to apply (you have to rub it in with your hands).  Other than that, great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 8 months because I&#x27;m allergic to aluminum. It reduces sweating better than aluminum-based antiperspirants ever did for me (one of my skin&#x27;s reactions to the aluminum is to sweat more), but I still have damp underarms all summer long, and any time I&#x27;m under stress. It is certainly better than no antiperspirant, but for the price I paid I had hoped it would keep me dry all the time.  It has some essential oils that make it smell nice, but they don&#x27;t work well as a deodorant. The best solution I have come up with is to apply the HyperDri right after I shower and then smear on a little bit of homemade deodorant (I mix together 2T baking soda, 2T cornstarch, and 2-3T coconut oil and store it in a little jar). If I were only paying a few dollars for the HyperDri, I&#x27;d be happy with this solution.  But for a product that costs several times more than a normal stick of deodorant...it&#x27;s disappointing.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today and tried it for the first time. I have been going without deo/antiperisperant for a couple days now trying to get it out of my system for this. I am sick of the yellow stains in my fav shirts. It is a bit sticky at first annoying to put on your fingers, but worth it for no yellow stains! It smells so good like lemon! So far I love it! I will update in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> It says it takes 30 days for it to build up, and each container lasts 60 days. It worked at first and I was ecstatic, so I bought another one. Don&#x27;t know what happened, but when I apply after my shower, it gives out at noon. I kept getting a whif of rancid onions, and it was me! I was so embarrassed. I reapply every morning, and it&#x27;ll last till 4 or 5 pm. And my armpits have been feeling damp. After spending all this money I&#x27;m loathe to throw it away, but it looks as though I&#x27;ll have to go back to regular antiperspirant (it&#x27;s too worrisome). Baby powder worked better than this.</li>
            <li> The product does make a difference, however I continued to have Hidradenitis Suppurative breakouts.</li>
            <li> Pros: It completely stopped my underarm sweat. That&#x27;s the only reason I bought this thing. I use it every day, once a day, and the bottle has lasted for 1 1/2 months so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: When I go to the gym at the end of the day, I start to smell, but still do not sweat. The smell problem is easily fixed with aluminum-free deodorant or body spray, so I don&#x27;t really care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros outweigh the cons.</li>
            <li> Really really really wanted this product to work bc I love the idea of aluminum free. BUT, I didn&#x27;t notice that this product worked, made zero difference. Even if the product worked only a little bit, I would probably purchase it again, but the product did not work at all.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions for 30+ days and the product didn&#x27;t work exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product doesn&#x27;t keep you from smelling great and needs a natural deodorant to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is garbage; the twist top is unnecessary and horrible to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makers of this product need to go back and re-think their formula.</li>
            <li> I purchased this antiperspirant because I developed an allergy to aluminum and was no longer able to use traditional antiperspirants.  There really aren&#x27;t any other alternatives besides using plain deodorant, which doesn&#x27;t keep you from sweating...and while minimizing odor is nice, swampy underarms are still an unpleasant feeling.  The product information states that it may take 30 days to be fully effective.  After only about 2 weeks of use, I could tell a huge difference.  I have now been using this for almost a month and am extremely happy with it.  It is effective, has a subtle fresh scent and I have had no side effects.  Based on the amount I have used in about a month and what is left in the bottle, it should last me about 6 months.  Definitely worth it and would recommend this to anyone unable to use aluminum based deodorants!!</li>
            <li> This antiperspirant works fairly well after the month it explicitly states it will take to reach full effectiveness. I use it at night and use a natural (non-antiperspirant) in the morning. During the 1st month of use, I continued using regular (aluminum based) antiperspirant with it to give HyperDri time to reach its full potential. I&#x27;m still using the 1st container and it&#x27;s been almost 2 months. I bought my 2nd one a week or 2 ago so I won&#x27;t run out. My only complaint is that the packaging is odd. It twists open, but when I depress the pump to apply the product, it will close on itself if I don&#x27;t hold the twisting part in place while pressing down. I&#x27;ve used serums in this type of packaging in the past and they don&#x27;t have this flaw. Perhaps it&#x27;s just this particular bottle. I&#x27;ll know for sure when I finish it and open the next one.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions of use - one small pump per underarm for one month straight, no skipping days, and I did gradually stop sweating and the essential oils seem to balance out with any body odour - I just end up smelling like skin, which is exactly what I want to smell  like. I am not a flower and don&#x27;t wish to pretend to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost didn&#x27;t purchase because of all of the bad reviews on how annoying it is to use, how it plan doesn&#x27;t work and that it apparently isn&#x27;t even lasting a month for people. I had the exact opposite experience. I have been using it for a month, it started working very well after 2 weeks and by a month my underarms were completely dry all the time save a little overall &#x27;verging on damp&#x27; feeling considering your skin is constantly pressed together in this area. But I promise I have had no wet spots or unpleasant odour and also - its been a month and there is over 75% of the stuff left still, amazing considering I doubled up for the first week because I was nervous it wouldn&#x27;t work - maybe that&#x27;s a new trick? Double the amount for the first week?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another theory I have as to who this product works best for is about your overall internal health - I eat gluten free, all natural foods, lots of water and do cardio and/or yoga 4-5 times a week. I&#x27;d be curious to know if others with this same lifestyle would have as much success with this antiperspirant. I definitely recommend this product - it seems ridonkulously expensive I know, but its $25 and it will last me another month or two - so you break that up and its $10 - $12 a month and I wont get cancer. I&#x27;m sold on it.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for me to help with odor control after a whole day at work or outdoors in hot weather</li>
            <li> worked immediately instead of the 2 weeks as suggested per owner.  Thrilled with the product, tried many types but none worked like this. Worth the price, will buy again when out.</li>
            <li> I like the product but it is too viscous for the spray bottle, would be better in a roll on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but it works at least as well as the clinical strength (20% aluminum) antiperspirant I had been using. I also apply an antiperspirant-free stick deodorant as needed, and the combination provides very good odor control. I work out hard at the gym 5 days a week, so I sweat a lot, and I do not want to stink! I switched to this because it is aluminum-free, and aluminum has been implicated (if not necessarily conclusively) in both breast cancer and Alzheimer&#x27;s, and the clinical-strength antiperspirant wasn&#x27;t working that well anyway; the combination of this and the stick deodorant works better.</li>
            <li> It works, for the most part, but I do have to use something stronger for extreme perspiration.</li>
            <li> I suffer from axillary hyperhidrosis and I am allergic to aluminum, so I had truly hoped that this product would be the solution to my problem.  Sadly, it&#x27;s been almost 3 weeks, and  there has been 0% improvement in my excessive underarm perspiration.  After trying at least 20 different products, all of which claimed to be an aluminum-free antiperspirant,  I am adding this to my list of products that absolutely do not work!  I bought 2 bottles and I plan to return the second one to Amazon.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I decided to try this product because I hate sweating and I wanted an aluminum free alternative.  While this product did work.....like some of the other reviewers, I also had a problem with odor.  I have not had a problem with odor when I used ANY other product, or even with NO deodorant or antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for over 6 months, and tried everything I could think of to stop the odor--added deodorant, washed often, products to mask the smell--nothing worked!&lt;br /&gt;I quit using it last week and have not had a problem since.  So I have to conclude something in the product is causing the odor. I will not be buying this again. In fact, I am throwing away what is left of mine.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it didn&#x27;t contain aluminum.  It is not effective at all.  I am very disappointed.  I still sweat and stunk!  I will be returning it.  Going back to Mitchum.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t an antiperspirant! It also wore off after about four hours and would need to be reapplied. What sucks is that I was at work at the time this happened, and didn&#x27;t have the bottle with me.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to stop using Aluminum products including anti-perspirant so I was excited to try this product. The instructions explaine that it takes repeated use to work and I have hung in there more than a month, but since I live in a warm climate I just went back to regular anti-perspirant yesterday. The product keeps the skin feeling very sticky and the perspiration is definately not stopped.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I am a convert.  I am 40, and I&#x27;ve had some auto-immune issues most of my life, worsening in the last 10 years.  In the last 5, I&#x27;ve been doing everything I can to get it under control naturally, which included ditching my aluminum deodorant.  I am not sure how much of an effect going aluminum-free has had on my health, as I&#x27;ve been doing many things simultaneously, but I will say, I&#x27;m improving, and I&#x27;m not sweating profusely, nor am I uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I only switched to a natural deodorant, which at first seemed to work.  But as the effects of the aluminum wore off (my hypothesis), I began to feel dampness, which I found too unpleasant to tolerate.  I found it interesting though as I do not actually sweat much, or historically have not, so I wondered if this might be a good sign for my health.  Regardless, I don&#x27;t want sweat stains, so after some research, I chose Klima HyperDri.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely took a week for me to start noticing the drying effect, just as they describe in their literature.  I pair this additionally with a stick of natural deodorant from another company.  I&#x27;ve had this bottle for exactly five months now, and I still have some left, which makes the high price tag a bit more tolerable. Incidentally, I live in the south, and it&#x27;s hot here. I am definitely not sweating any more than normal, and my clothes remain dry when I&#x27;ve worn sleeves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons, as others have pointed out, include the pump dispenser which requires application with your fingertips. Not a big deal, but creates more steps with the subsequent washing of hands.  Second drawback is that I can not tell how much is left in my dispenser. I have held it up to the light and tried to find some kind of indication, but I can only ascertain from the weight of it that I am likely ready for a new one. But I have no idea if it will be tomorrow, or next month.  This would be a very easy fix for Klima!  I&#x27;d like to see that remedied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, a great product. I&#x27;m ordering a second bottle today.</li>
            <li> love it and it does a good job as described,  recomend it to everyone.  you won&#x27;t be disappomted at all</li>
            <li> This stuff simply works.  I used to sweat profusely every day under my arms no matter what temperature it was outside.  I&#x27;ve been using Hyper-Dri for over a year now and I hardly ever sweat anymore.  It did take several days for it to start working, but since then I&#x27;ve been comfortable throughout the day.  No more stains on my t-shirts from the sweat.  In addition, I&#x27;ve found that one bottle lasts almost 6 months, longer than advertised.  The only negative I have is that it is not a deodorant.  In case you do sweat even slightly throughout the day it is a good idea to put a spray-on deodorant over the hyper-dri.  Despite this, I love the product and am now a loyal customer.  I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have tried everything on the market and nothing was all that effective - until I found Klima. I was initially attracted because it is aluminum-free but I have been using it for 2 years now and it is the best antiperspirant I have ever found. It is not really a deodorant thought so I just by a deodorant (Kenneth Cole Black) and use both. Klima may look expensive but it lasts about 6 months.</li>
            <li> This is a good antiperspirant without all the aluminum. It has dramatically decreased my underarm sweat without exposing me to harmful chemicals. It has a nice scent and is easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone who sweats a lot and wants to use a natural product.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me at all, didn&#x27;t do anythign for my problem, and I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> My three star rating is broken down as follows: 1) 2 stars for container 2) 4 stars for effectiveness 3) 2 stars for value.  The pump that this deodorant comes with twists up out of the bottle, and every time I depressed it it would twist right down into the bottle again.  Perhaps it was user error, I don&#x27;t know, but on top of the the fact that they can&#x27;t seem to make this a roll-on product, it was very annoying to essentially have to reopen the bottle for each underarm each day. 2) For not having aluminum, which is why I bought it in the first place, it worked decently well.  I did break a sweat doing things like rolling out pie dough and scrubbing down the shower, and I am sure it would not have held up in a gym, if I ever went to such a place.  But 90% of the time I did not sweat, and much much more importantly to me, when I did sweat, I did not smell.  So whatever they do to control really bad BO, which I have, really does work.  It also has a lemon scent which I really liked. 3) After just under six weeks of directed use (one pump per underarm per day), the bottle was empty.  There is no way to know when this will happen, as there is no discernible way to tell how much is in the bottle at any point in time.  I was, however, expecting to get more than 6 weeks of use out of something that cost $30.  And for that reason, I do not think I will be trying this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few months now, and can definitely tell the difference. My pits are finally dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of warning, use a Non-Antipersperent deodorent with this stuff; if you only use HyperDri, your pits will start to smell funky.</li>
            <li> This is NOT the perfect replacement for aluminum based antiperspirants, but it does work to lessen perspiration. It does NOT stop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m allergic to aluminum-based antiperspirants, and thus, must use something else. Deodorants, of course, are merely meant to reduce or disguise odor - they do nothing to reduce perspiration. Klima does help, so it is an acceptable solution for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that the application were a little different - does Klima not work in a roller ball or other typical underarm applicator? You must dispense some on your fingers, and apply to your underarms. The only way to gauge how much is left in the container is by the weight. It would be nice to see a little window or something. A container lasts a fairly long time (months), so, although it isn&#x27;t cheap, the price isn&#x27;t outrageous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they continue to manufacture this product, because those of us who are allergic to aluminum-based products have no other choices.</li>
            <li> This product has worked exactly as the description claims!  I followed the directions precisely, and, after one month, I exclusively use this antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;I have a medical condition, and my Doctor said I had high heavy metal counts in my body.  This is my solution to eliminating aluminum chlorhydrate, which is the primary ingredient in all other antiperspirants.&lt;br /&gt;To this product&#x27;s effectiveness, my air conditioning malfunctioned for three weeks during 90 degree F weather, and it worked fabulously!!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Be patient, it took 5 weeks to really start working for me. I love the product, I&#x27;m giving 4 out of 5 because the packaging needs work. You cannot see how much product is left. However, one of my good friends has had the same bottle for more than 60 days and still has some left. It is worth the money.  Follow the directions and remember it will take a month or a little more to work. Also if you work out hard or are super stressed or it is extremely hot you may still get sweaty. But the every day wet marks under the arms will gradually stop. Be aware, you need a deodorant as well and I had better results putting the Klima on and then waiting like 10 minutes and then putting deodorant on. Seems like the Klima needs to totally soak into the skin first after you rub it in really good. I know it is expensive and takes time to work but really it&#x27;s worth it to me- I can wear grey tee shirts again!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would work because antiperspirants with aluminum make me break out.  However, HyperDri didn&#x27;t work for me.  Basically I was pretty smelly for a month.</li>
            <li> I was having some major issues with sweat.  I tried all different kinds of antiperspirant, and none of them worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using HyperDri, and it works great.  It took a week or 2 for the sweat to be completely gone, but now I go through the whole day without any sweat.</li>
