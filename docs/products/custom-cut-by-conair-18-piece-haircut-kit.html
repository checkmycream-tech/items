            <li>AMAZING MY WIFE LOVES ME</li>
            <li>Light weight and works great.</li>
            <li>Great, now I can cut the hair of my children and my grandfather smoothly</li>
            <li>It comes in a really nice package, and looks really nice.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Makes a nice cut for my beard.</li>
            <li>However I did cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>for that kind of use, these clippers seem to do the job</li>
            <li>Great price and arrived quick.</li>
            <li>Very useful and good acessories.</li>
            <li>It does the job well and is easy to use!</li>
            <li>but nothing built very cheap.</li>
            <li>I like that its very light to hold.</li>
            <li>Cuts better than my battery clippers.</li>
            <li>Purchased this more for its variety of pieces that allows to groom oneself as needed.</li>
            <li>It has so many parts etc, just love it..</li>
            <li>; Yes, OK, I&#x27;m a lesbian.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I used the 3/4 inch comb for the top and the 1/2 inch one for the rest.</li>
            <li>so theyre ok.</li>
            <li>We love it</li>
            <li>That being said pay more money and get something better</li>
            <li>So if for any reason, my opinion on these clippers change, I will be sure to change my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ecxellent Product at a Great Price, I really Recommended...</li>
            <li>Was better than I expected, works great with no problems, would buy it again if needed, was happy with purchase</li>
            <li>My plastic preschool safety scissors would cut hair better than these do.</li>
            <li>still better then paying for a buzz at a haircut place once a month</li>
            <li>It MORE then paid for itself on the first hair cut !!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with my new haircut. :-)</li>
            <li>Good if under 12$ because you can buy that exact model at the Rite Aids for that price.</li>
            <li>It works fine, does a great job, but it is really really noisy.</li>
            <li>Wizzed through my hair like a breeze, cuts cleanly!</li>
            <li>Wizzed through my hair like a breeze, cuts cleanly!</li>
            <li>I should know better to buy something so cheap</li>
            <li>but once we adjusted the power level screw on the side that fixed the issue and these clippers work great for buzzing my hair.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, product as described, good buy for the cost</li>
            <li>Easy to handle and use on self to cut hair.  </li>
            <li>Easy to cut others.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m cut my own hair for the first time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m cut my own hair for the first time</li>
            <li>And it is easy to use ,and cheap.</li>
            <li>works perfect and almost no sound which is a plus</li>
            <li>This should be used for light body grooming.</li>
            <li>cheap plastic and louder than a lawn mower</li>
            <li>i purchased this item it is of cheap quality</li>
            <li>Works great but only goes up to 3/4&amp;#34</li>
            <li>The quality is worth more than the price I paid.</li>
            <li>Made a lot of buzzing sound vibrating too vigorously to handle.</li>
            <li>The quality of the extra features and parts where great...</li>
            <li>Very powerful tool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always gone to Supercuts for a quick easy haircut.</li>
            <li>Wen I got these I was so excited.</li>
            <li>not so the best work ok not the same as a regular clipper</li>
            <li>At first, it more like thinned my hair out than cut it.</li>
            <li>There are enough blades that it&#x27;s a nice set, though most people will use one or two blades and not need the rest.</li>
            <li>he liked the shape of it and that it was blue (his favorite color).</li>
            <li>dryer)--i make him shave his head out on the porch to keep our bathroom sink clean and</li>
            <li>The packaging was great but these clippers don&#x27;t cut as expected.</li>
            <li>Gives a good hair cut, especially with all the attachments.</li>
            <li>Powerful light weight , just what i was looking for</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t super sturdy and at that price you can&#x27;t expect everything.</li>
            <li>I preferred the weight of the older one, and the better feel it had.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, I already had my money&#x27;s worth after my first haircut...</li>
            <li>This is a great little clipper.</li>
            <li>While not made for commercial use by any means, this looks like it will hold up to our household demands quite nicely.</li>
            <li>I LOOK SO FRESH</li>
            <li>If you have any kind of hand problems like carpel tunnel these will definitely aggravate it.</li>
            <li>At first, it didn&#x27;t want to work at all when he&#x27;d put at full strength</li>
            <li>Spend another 10 and get something worth it.</li>
            <li>I saw this in my local Sally&#x27;s the other day for around $30... $15 is an excellent price to pay.</li>
            <li>They might not be ideal for commercial use or anything outside of doing your own hair or family but who knows, I am not really an expert with hair clippers.</li>
            <li>and I had no trouble; this kit was easy to use and fun as well.</li>
            <li>and I had no trouble; this kit was easy to use and fun as well.</li>
            <li>Would have rather payed a little more for better quality.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a super nice feature, keeps the blades sharp ...</li>
            <li>Works OK and the different attachments are useful.</li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t have very much power.</li>
            <li>and I think that was part of the problem in my first go-around.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was my first time using a machine like this.</li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant at first with this kit</li>
            <li>My uncle likes mine so much that he made me buy another one for him!</li>
            <li>This thing really works and is fun to use.</li>
            <li>Clippers have a plug in motor and comes with many different guard types.</li>
            <li>Clippers have a plug in motor and comes with many different guard types.</li>
            <li>Nothing more to buy, well I&#x27;ll buy an extra tube of oil, thats some thing you don&#x27;t want to run out of !!!</li>
            <li>and right ear combs are very helpful too.  </li>
            <li>Ready to use right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>I know I shouldn&#x27;t have had real high hopes at this price point, but shouldn&#x27;t hair clippers CUT HAIR??</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine but not very sharp.</li>
            <li>Junk, pure junk.</li>
            <li>definitely do not recommend using for hair cuts (if you expect a nice clean blend and sharp line up).</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.  .</li>
            <li>They also have an intense vibration sensation when using them.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cut straight</li>
            <li>Glides easily a absolute for parents and men</li>
            <li>The clipper is really noisy.</li>
            <li>REALLY.</li>
            <li>Manuel included is very helpful</li>
            <li>Does not cut real well</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used this product yet, as i already have one but couldn&#x27;t pass this one up, but will try it very soon.</li>
            <li>I bought this to trim my beard and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>And in a straight marriage.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;t very noisy</li>
            <li>I imagine if you have straight thinner hair this would work really well.</li>
            <li>Its too much for this thing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The case is very helpful.</li>
            <li>This one is much lighter and so vibrates  a lot.</li>
            <li>Now that I am married and lived 3 states away, I don&#x27;t have the convenience of asking my mom to do it for me, however, she did send me off with a pair of her old used clippers...</li>
            <li>Gets jammed easily.  </li>
            <li>this gets the job done decently</li>
            <li>It works, but not as well as an older model I had.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I was afraid to try it out in the first place, but was happy to find the motor made a softer buzzing noise than perceived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was afraid to try it out in the first place, but was happy to find the motor made a softer buzzing noise than perceived.</li>
            <li>That definitely helped though it began to make a loud noise at the full strength</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want my hair this short, but it grows out quickly and they never want to cut enough off in the first place.</li>
            <li>but I ended up just purchasing a new pair at walmart instead of re-ordering.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very clear when hair getting longer let bit</li>
            <li>It still seemed to have a lot more power behind it than the first time.</li>
            <li>I finally got fed up and bought these purely based on the price alone.  </li>
            <li>These clippers do a great job cutting hair.</li>
            <li>Great for cutting hair.</li>
            <li>Cuts hair for the whole family with multiple attachments.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really though, I can tell it will have trouble going through a lot of hair hence why I recommend it for light shaving.</li>
            <li>Gosh this thing so loud</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace clippers that are close to 20 years old.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I need to get used to these, but they do not seem to cut as well as my old clippers.</li>
            <li>and she told me that as long as you are not using it for long hours, the cheaper the better, since they all work the same way.</li>
            <li>The instructions are clear and make you feel like a professional.</li>
            <li>Took a chunk out of my hair, and made loud noises.</li>
            <li>I am 25 years old and have never been to the barber...</li>
            <li>Lost 1 star cause its loud.</li>
            <li>Ive always bought conair clippers but this latest set only lasted a few trims.</li>
            <li>cutter itself works, we usually use it without a blade cover providing a pretty consistent cut.</li>
            <li>Really not a bad little unit for the money</li>
            <li>would highly recommend these clippers for anyone under the same circumstances...</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected and wanted.</li>
            <li>Very unsatisfied the product is not to as it appears in the image order or the one in the box, the features are totally different a generic product.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a woman who wears her hair very short, you know how difficult it can be to get a good haircut.</li>
            <li>One of the major reasons we bought this kit was because it came with scissors.</li>
            <li>Absolute ease of cutting hair not loud silent great one to buy especially if you have kids!</li>
            <li>Only used twice so far.  </li>
            <li>I received this product as was expected, it worked very well</li>
            <li>At first it&#x27;s performance seemed pretty poor</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping,  but clippers are incredibly loud and excessively vibrate.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t super thick, and it would tear or grab hair as it goes.</li>

            <li> Was better than I expected, works great with no problems, would buy it again if needed, was happy with purchase</li>
            <li> My plastic preschool safety scissors would cut hair better than these do.</li>
            <li> still better then paying for a buzz at a haircut place once a month</li>
            <li> It MORE then paid for itself on the first hair cut !!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with my new haircut. :-)</li>
            <li> Good if under 12$ because you can buy that exact model at the Rite Aids for that price.</li>
            <li> It works fine, does a great job, but it is really really noisy.</li>
            <li> Wizzed through my hair like a breeze, cuts cleanly!</li>
            <li> Wizzed through my hair like a breeze, cuts cleanly!</li>
            <li> I should know better to buy something so cheap</li>
            <li> but once we adjusted the power level screw on the side that fixed the issue and these clippers work great for buzzing my hair.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, product as described, good buy for the cost</li>
            <li> Easy to handle and use on self to cut hair.  </li>
            <li> Easy to cut others.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cut my own hair for the first time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cut my own hair for the first time</li>
            <li> And it is easy to use ,and cheap.</li>
            <li> works perfect and almost no sound which is a plus</li>
            <li> This should be used for light body grooming.</li>
            <li> cheap plastic and louder than a lawn mower</li>
            <li> i purchased this item it is of cheap quality</li>
            <li> Works great but only goes up to 3/4&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The quality is worth more than the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Made a lot of buzzing sound vibrating too vigorously to handle.</li>
            <li> The quality of the extra features and parts where great...</li>
            <li> Very powerful tool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always gone to Supercuts for a quick easy haircut.</li>
            <li> Wen I got these I was so excited.</li>
            <li> not so the best work ok not the same as a regular clipper</li>
            <li> At first, it more like thinned my hair out than cut it.</li>
            <li> There are enough blades that it&#x27;s a nice set, though most people will use one or two blades and not need the rest.</li>
            <li> he liked the shape of it and that it was blue (his favorite color).</li>
            <li> dryer)--i make him shave his head out on the porch to keep our bathroom sink clean and</li>
            <li> The packaging was great but these clippers don&#x27;t cut as expected.</li>
            <li> Gives a good hair cut, especially with all the attachments.</li>
            <li> Powerful light weight , just what i was looking for</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t super sturdy and at that price you can&#x27;t expect everything.</li>
            <li> I preferred the weight of the older one, and the better feel it had.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, I already had my money&#x27;s worth after my first haircut...</li>
            <li> This is a great little clipper.</li>
            <li> While not made for commercial use by any means, this looks like it will hold up to our household demands quite nicely.</li>
            <li> I LOOK SO FRESH</li>
            <li> If you have any kind of hand problems like carpel tunnel these will definitely aggravate it.</li>
            <li> At first, it didn&#x27;t want to work at all when he&#x27;d put at full strength</li>
            <li> Spend another 10 and get something worth it.</li>
            <li> I saw this in my local Sally&#x27;s the other day for around $30... $15 is an excellent price to pay.</li>
            <li> They might not be ideal for commercial use or anything outside of doing your own hair or family but who knows, I am not really an expert with hair clippers.</li>
            <li> and I had no trouble; this kit was easy to use and fun as well.</li>
            <li> and I had no trouble; this kit was easy to use and fun as well.</li>
            <li> Would have rather payed a little more for better quality.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a super nice feature, keeps the blades sharp ...</li>
            <li> Works OK and the different attachments are useful.</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t have very much power.</li>
            <li> and I think that was part of the problem in my first go-around.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a machine like this.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant at first with this kit</li>
            <li> My uncle likes mine so much that he made me buy another one for him!</li>
            <li> This thing really works and is fun to use.</li>
            <li> Clippers have a plug in motor and comes with many different guard types.</li>
            <li> Clippers have a plug in motor and comes with many different guard types.</li>
            <li> Nothing more to buy, well I&#x27;ll buy an extra tube of oil, thats some thing you don&#x27;t want to run out of !!!</li>
            <li> and right ear combs are very helpful too.  </li>
            <li> Ready to use right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> I know I shouldn&#x27;t have had real high hopes at this price point, but shouldn&#x27;t hair clippers CUT HAIR??</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine but not very sharp.</li>
            <li> Junk, pure junk.</li>
            <li> definitely do not recommend using for hair cuts (if you expect a nice clean blend and sharp line up).</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed</li>
            <li> Reasonable price.  .</li>
            <li> They also have an intense vibration sensation when using them.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut straight</li>
            <li> Glides easily a absolute for parents and men</li>
            <li> The clipper is really noisy.</li>
            <li> REALLY.</li>
            <li> Manuel included is very helpful</li>
            <li> Does not cut real well</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this product yet, as i already have one but couldn&#x27;t pass this one up, but will try it very soon.</li>
            <li> I bought this to trim my beard and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> And in a straight marriage.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;t very noisy</li>
            <li> I imagine if you have straight thinner hair this would work really well.</li>
            <li> Its too much for this thing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The case is very helpful.</li>
            <li> This one is much lighter and so vibrates  a lot.</li>
            <li> Now that I am married and lived 3 states away, I don&#x27;t have the convenience of asking my mom to do it for me, however, she did send me off with a pair of her old used clippers...</li>
            <li> Gets jammed easily.  </li>
            <li> this gets the job done decently</li>
            <li> It works, but not as well as an older model I had.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to try it out in the first place, but was happy to find the motor made a softer buzzing noise than perceived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was afraid to try it out in the first place, but was happy to find the motor made a softer buzzing noise than perceived.</li>
            <li> That definitely helped though it began to make a loud noise at the full strength</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want my hair this short, but it grows out quickly and they never want to cut enough off in the first place.</li>
            <li> but I ended up just purchasing a new pair at walmart instead of re-ordering.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very clear when hair getting longer let bit</li>
            <li> It still seemed to have a lot more power behind it than the first time.</li>
            <li> I finally got fed up and bought these purely based on the price alone.  </li>
            <li> These clippers do a great job cutting hair.</li>
            <li> Great for cutting hair.</li>
            <li> Cuts hair for the whole family with multiple attachments.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really though, I can tell it will have trouble going through a lot of hair hence why I recommend it for light shaving.</li>
            <li> Gosh this thing so loud</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace clippers that are close to 20 years old.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I need to get used to these, but they do not seem to cut as well as my old clippers.</li>
            <li> and she told me that as long as you are not using it for long hours, the cheaper the better, since they all work the same way.</li>
            <li> The instructions are clear and make you feel like a professional.</li>
            <li> Took a chunk out of my hair, and made loud noises.</li>
            <li> I am 25 years old and have never been to the barber...</li>
            <li> Lost 1 star cause its loud.</li>
            <li> Ive always bought conair clippers but this latest set only lasted a few trims.</li>
            <li> cutter itself works, we usually use it without a blade cover providing a pretty consistent cut.</li>
            <li> Really not a bad little unit for the money</li>
            <li> would highly recommend these clippers for anyone under the same circumstances...</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected and wanted.</li>
            <li> Very unsatisfied the product is not to as it appears in the image order or the one in the box, the features are totally different a generic product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a woman who wears her hair very short, you know how difficult it can be to get a good haircut.</li>
            <li> One of the major reasons we bought this kit was because it came with scissors.</li>
            <li> Absolute ease of cutting hair not loud silent great one to buy especially if you have kids!</li>
            <li> Only used twice so far.  </li>
            <li> I received this product as was expected, it worked very well</li>
            <li> At first it&#x27;s performance seemed pretty poor</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping,  but clippers are incredibly loud and excessively vibrate.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t super thick, and it would tear or grab hair as it goes.</li>
            <li> The problem I have with them is that they are very noisy compared to others I have owned in the past.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make a long story short, I had no problems with these clippers.</li>
            <li> I use it a lot and wonder how long it will hold up.</li>
            <li> The only minus I have is that we had some difficulty in adjusting the power.</li>
            <li> I mean, really...</li>
            <li> This particular item unfortunately did not work after it was so joyfully unpackaged, and continues to be a constant reminder of the addiction to online shopping that I have developed and of the $20 that I will never regain.</li>
            <li> ; haha only real complaint is that it has a very short cord (about the length of a hair</li>
            <li> i have to cut my hair outside with out borthering other people in the house.</li>
            <li> The clips have limited utility: since they don&#x27;t have any sort of grips or ridges on them, they fall out.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Given the typical architectural constraints of bathrooms, the cord simply isn&#x27;t long enough.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations (not high with respect to hair style, however).  </li>
            <li> I was afraid to tell my sister, a hair dresser, that I bought a cheap electric clipper</li>
            <li> i now dont mind having spent 50 for a heavier, stronger set of clippers.</li>
            <li> it &amp;#34;gets jammed</li>
            <li> Plus, having to endure endless questions... &amp;#34;Have you always worn your hair this short?&amp;#34; &amp;</li>
            <li> I have purchased other inexpensive trimmers for years.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no power!</li>
            <li> got this the other day</li>
            <li> Must have some very soft thin hair or no chance it will work.</li>
            <li> but it shouldn&#x27;t be thick enough to stop the trimmer all together.</li>
            <li> As soon as clippers touch hair, the motor bogs down.</li>
            <li> Half of the hair was pulled out because it jams as soon as the blades come in contact with my hair.</li>
            <li> it still ends up making a mess</li>
            <li> to cut my daughter&#x27;s hair, which is a little shorter than shoulder length.</li>
            <li> I bought this little darling a year ago.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I was a little kid, my mother had ALWAYS cut my hair...</li>
            <li> Unless your cutting Medusa&#x27;s do, or an afro of steel, I&#x27;m certain these clippers could cut without a problem.</li>
            <li> Unless your cutting Medusa&#x27;s do, or an afro of steel, I&#x27;m certain these clippers could cut without a problem.</li>
            <li> Hair&#x27;s car had broken down and we run a low-grade twice.</li>
            <li> but it at least should work---</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t that thick</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and curly.</li>
            <li> but if you have thick hair I would upgrade a bit.</li>
            <li> i would recommend this item to guys who keep their hair shorter ALL THE TIME and just need to touch it up, where as my husband let his hair grow out all shaggy, then tries to use these clippers and gets all mad bc</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy unless you have relatively thin hair.</li>
            <li> Probably never use it it is so dull, painful and slow cutting.</li>
            <li> I am unable to continue using it.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li> They were horrible and it would take me 2 hours minimum to cut my hair properly.</li>
            <li> The apron is similarly useless.</li>
            <li> so he has to bend his neck and shoulders in all kinds of crazy positions to get his head out the door.</li>
            <li> Bad product.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after one use. :(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the scissors are absolutely dreadful.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed! :(</li>
            <li> BUT WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got these as a gift because I&#x27;m always barrowing clippers to cut my son boyfriend and brothers hair. Wen I got these I was so excited. Once I used them on my son they didn&#x27;t work. I went threw my son&#x27;s hair over n over n nothing was being cut. Very disappointed! :( I&#x27;ll be looking for another pair.</li>
            <li> It comes in a really nice package, and looks really nice. But it didn&#x27;t have very much power. My hair isn&#x27;t super thick, and it would tear or grab hair as it goes. I am unable to continue using it.</li>
            <li> It is a family purchase for 4 people over 55 (&amp; 2 at 84).  Easy to handle and use on self to cut hair.  Easy to cut others.  Left ear and right ear combs are very helpful too.  Good instructions also.</li>
            <li> works perfect and almost no sound which is a plus</li>
            <li> Ive always bought conair clippers but this latest set only lasted a few trims. Very dissapointed</li>

            <li> For the price it is good. They adjustment does worry me since it&#x27;s plastic. I use it a lot and wonder how long it will hold up. I have used it once and it cuts great.</li>
            <li> Ready to use right out of the box.  Nice and sharp.  While not made for commercial use by any means, this looks like it will hold up to our household demands quite nicely.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected and wanted. My son is going to love it!</li>
            <li> not so the best work ok not the same as a regular clipper</li>

            <li> B002CUK9S4&lt;br /&gt;Tried to cut my daughter&#x27;s hair, which is a little shorter than shoulder length. Clippers would not cut hair, just not enough power. Have to return it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, I already had my money&#x27;s worth after my first haircut... Easy to use</li>
            <li> These clippers do a great job cutting hair. The problem I have with them is that they are very noisy compared to others I have owned in the past. They also have an intense vibration sensation when using them. If you have any kind of hand problems like carpel tunnel these will definitely aggravate it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, product as described, good buy for the cost</li>
            <li> I received this product as was expected, it worked very well and i was very impressed with the style and handling of the clippers, I would recommend this product to any one, I am thinking of giving one as a gift.</li>
            <li> GREAT GIFT HUSBAND LOVED IT!</li>
            <li> It was great. I use  it  on my husband. gives a great hair cut Thank you</li>
            <li> Cuts better than my battery clippers.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut straight it&#x27;s very clear when hair getting longer let bit</li>
            <li> Absolute ease of cutting hair not loud silent great one to buy especially if you have kids! No pulling of hair. Glides easily a absolute for parents and men</li>
            <li> Nice. Works well. Good for the Price. Makes a nice cut for my beard.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, arrived in good condition, thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Lot of accessory. Good if under 12$ because you can buy that exact model at the Rite Aids for that price. The clipper is really noisy. REALLY. It works fine, does a great job, but it is really really noisy. Very powerful tool. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> 100 % recommended . equal to that offered .</li>
            <li> Junk, pure junk. I know I shouldn&#x27;t have had real high hopes at this price point, but shouldn&#x27;t hair clippers CUT HAIR?? I mean, really...</li>
            <li> Seems to work well, feels sturdy, great price. Cuts hair for the whole family with multiple attachments. Manuel included is very helpful</li>
            <li> good product and practical</li>
            <li> Very useful and good acessories.</li>
            <li> Does not cut real well</li>
            <li> Not the best out there but perfect for body grooming which I am sure lots of people would use it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dnot expect to use this item for years to come, in fact I consider it a disposable clipper just like you ha e disposable razors.. I am however hoping it will last me about a year or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely do not recommend using for hair cuts (if you expect a nice clean blend and sharp line up). This should be used for light body grooming. If you haven&#x27;t shaved in years then this isn&#x27;t the item for you, perhaps a weed Wacker might be sufficient (just kidding).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really though, I can tell it will have trouble going through a lot of hair hence why I recommend it for light shaving.</li>
            <li> thank you, very satisfied</li>
            <li> Purchased this more for its variety of pieces that allows to groom oneself as needed. The brand name carries itself well in this product.</li>
            <li> cheap plastic and louder than a lawn mower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didnt even cut and just pulls your hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save up and buy a more expensive one</li>
            <li> Gosh this thing so loud i have to cut my hair outside with out borthering other people in the house. AVOID BUYING.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace clippers that are close to 20 years old.  They arrived on time and were packed well.  Maybe I need to get used to these, but they do not seem to cut as well as my old clippers.</li>
            <li> I bought this little darling a year ago. I still use it about once a week. The blades have dulled, but it just means I have to go slower and maybe go over an area two or three times.  I used up all the oil that came with the unit. Now, I use spray canola oil. As, canola oil is an industrial oil. DO NOT EAT CANOLA OIL! For the price, I&#x27;ve had a year of hair-cuts and I haven&#x27;t run a razor over my beautiful face since. These clippers are the cat&#x27;s meow!</li>
            <li> good for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has everything I need. I like this one . And it is easy to use ,and cheap.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this product yet, as i already have one but couldn&#x27;t pass this one up, but will try it very soon. It has so many parts etc, just love it..</li>
            <li> Must have some very soft thin hair or no chance it will work. Probably never use it it is so dull, painful and slow cutting.</li>
            <li> This particular item unfortunately did not work after it was so joyfully unpackaged, and continues to be a constant reminder of the addiction to online shopping that I have developed and of the $20 that I will never regain.</li>
            <li> I bought this to trim my beard and it works really well.  I was afraid to tell my sister, a hair dresser, that I bought a cheap electric clipper and she told me that as long as you are not using it for long hours, the cheaper the better, since they all work the same way.</li>
            <li> I should know better to buy something so cheap but it at least should work--- this does not ---  but can&#x27;t return as I just put it away when it arrived to use when needed  -- BUT WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a woman who wears her hair very short, you know how difficult it can be to get a good haircut. I don&#x27;t want my hair this short, but it grows out quickly and they never want to cut enough off in the first place. Plus, having to endure endless questions... &amp;#34;Have you always worn your hair this short?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Does you husband like your hair short?&amp;#34; Yes, OK, I&#x27;m a lesbian. And in a straight marriage. It happens... Anyway, I used the 3/4 inch comb for the top and the 1/2 inch one for the rest. At first, it more like thinned my hair out than cut it. My hair isn&#x27;t that thick but I do have a lot of it. The&lt;br /&gt;combs got stuck so the blade couldn&#x27;t get it. My husband was reading the instruction book and found out how to adjust the strength. That definitely helped though it began to make a loud noise at the full strength so he had to dial it back a bit. It still seemed to have a lot more power behind it than the first time. I had also had some gel in my hair that made it sticky and I think that was part of the problem in my first go-around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with my new haircut. :-) I didn&#x27;t even need my husband to get the back part for me. This was my first time using a machine like this. The only minus I have is that we had some difficulty in adjusting the power. At first, it didn&#x27;t want to work at all when he&#x27;d put at full strength which&lt;br /&gt;paniced me. He had to put it back to what it had been, then try again. Then, like I said, it began to make that noise. Whatever he set it at now is&lt;br /&gt;good. I just wish it was easier to do and it concerns me that it made that noise. I hope it continues to work as well as it did this second time.&lt;br /&gt;Because I&#x27;m really happy that I&#x27;m able to do this at home.</li>
            <li> This is a great little clipper. I like that its very light to hold.</li>
            <li> Worked awesome for what I needed it for and good price.</li>
            <li> Light weight and works great.</li>
            <li> Works great and my husband loves it</li>
            <li> Great price and arrived quick. I was a bit hesitant at first with this kit but I&#x27;m happy I got it. At first it&#x27;s performance seemed pretty poor but once we adjusted the power level screw on the side that fixed the issue and these clippers work great for buzzing my hair.</li>
            <li> It Does What It Has To Do.</li>
            <li> i purchased this item it is of cheap quality</li>
            <li> This only gets 2 stars because it can be used as a body trimmer. If you want to shave your head or trim the sides then do not buy this! I have thick hair but it shouldn&#x27;t be thick enough to stop the trimmer all together. An hour later and my head is finally shaved. Half of the hair was pulled out because it jams as soon as the blades come in contact with my hair. It is now in the trash.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;t very noisy i can&#x27;t work with it</li>
            <li> I saw this in my local Sally&#x27;s the other day for around $30... $15 is an excellent price to pay. It comes with several attachments, scissors, a comb, and a cape. 10/10, would buy again. My uncle likes mine so much that he made me buy another one for him!</li>
            <li> I imagine if you have straight thinner hair this would work really well. My hair is thick and curly. Its too much for this thing. Don&#x27;t buy unless you have relatively thin hair.</li>
            <li> Great price for this product. It does the job well and is easy to use!</li>
            <li> This thing really works and is fun to use. Have to remember to oil it!</li>
            <li> Used it already. Works well, I like it. Will buy another one in the future if I feel the need to do so.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other inexpensive trimmers for years. This brand cuts the best and is easier to keep adjusted in a range of motion that is not too noisy.</li>
            <li> excellent works great ...</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping,  but clippers are incredibly loud and excessively vibrate.</li>
            <li> Works great but only goes up to 3/4&amp;#34; I wish it would have gone up to 1&amp;#34;. Has a great grip and on?off switch</li>
            <li> great ..works wonderful</li>
            <li> Great for cutting hair. Use all the time on hubby</li>
            <li> Unless your cutting Medusa&#x27;s do, or an afro of steel, I&#x27;m certain these clippers could cut without a problem. Wizzed through my hair like a breeze, cuts cleanly! I&#x27;m cut my own hair for the first time and I had no trouble; this kit was easy to use and fun as well. Clippers have a plug in motor and comes with many different guard types. Very happy. I was afraid to try it out in the first place, but was happy to find the motor made a softer buzzing noise than perceived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Issues at all, pleasure to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: i dropped the clipper and snapped one of my most used comb attachments, rendering my fade haircuts with these clippers useless. i bought another wahl for 50 dollars,abour 4 times this product. I definitely feel the quality difference. i now dont mind having spent 50 for a heavier, stronger set of clippers. however, for 13 dollars!! this gets the job done decently</li>
            <li> What a great buy.  Comes with a storage case.  Even includes a plastic cape to catch all that cut hair!!  Very impressed with the quality. Gives a good hair cut, especially with all the attachments. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works well, great for trimming your beard or for haircuts. No problems using it at all. No complaints at all.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t trim close enough to where you&#x27;d want, and the attachments are not as diverse as they should be. Spend another 10 and get something worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift and I hear that they work well and get the job done. They aren&#x27;t super sturdy and at that price you can&#x27;t expect everything. There are enough blades that it&#x27;s a nice set, though most people will use one or two blades and not need the rest.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after one use. :(</li>
            <li> Really not a bad little unit for the money but if you have thick hair I would upgrade a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a clipper savant but I think that they don&#x27;t cut so well. However I did cut my own hair. so theyre ok.</li>
            <li> This product is great . It&#x27;s easy to use. The instructions are clear and make you feel like a professional. The quality is worth more than the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Great for the price! We love it</li>
            <li> Took a chunk out of my hair, and made loud noises.</li>
            <li> Gets jammed easily.  Would have rather payed a little more for better quality.  Take forever just to trim some hair</li>
            <li> Made a lot of buzzing sound vibrating too vigorously to handle. Would  not recommend!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is very good.&lt;br /&gt;However, it is fair for its price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use about six times and the it stoped working during I was dealing my hair, and I had to fix the iron part by myself during that haircutting...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying it doesn&#x27;t come with enough cutters , the shortest one doesn&#x27;t even compare to the cut I used to get with my last one ( different brand) . That being said pay more money and get something better</li>
            <li> Good quality, works well.</li>
            <li> I had to give this 5 stars simply based on the price and quality alone... The clippers just arrived this morning and I have only used them once. So if for any reason, my opinion on these clippers change, I will be sure to change my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I was a little kid, my mother had ALWAYS cut my hair... I am 25 years old and have never been to the barber... Now that I am married and lived 3 states away, I don&#x27;t have the convenience of asking my mom to do it for me, however, she did send me off with a pair of her old used clippers... They were horrible and it would take me 2 hours minimum to cut my hair properly. Since I only cut my hair once every 2-3 months, I put up with it for a couple of years. I finally got fed up and bought these purely based on the price alone.  I figured anything at this point was an upgrade from what I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make a long story short, I had no problems with these clippers. I got the job done in under 10 minutes. I simply just shave my head basically, let it grow out 2 or 3 inches and then shave again and for that kind of use, these clippers seem to do the job just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend these clippers for anyone under the same circumstances... They might not be ideal for commercial use or anything outside of doing your own hair or family but who knows, I am not really an expert with hair clippers.</li>
            <li> Ecxellent Product at a Great Price, I really Recommended...</li>
            <li> Works OK and the different attachments are useful.</li>
            <li> Was better than I expected, works great with no problems, would buy it again if needed, was happy with purchase</li>
            <li> One of the major reasons we bought this kit was because it came with scissors. Unfortunately, the scissors are absolutely dreadful. My plastic preschool safety scissors would cut hair better than these do. The apron is similarly useless. The clips have limited utility: since they don&#x27;t have any sort of grips or ridges on them, they fall out.&lt;br /&gt;The cutter itself works, we usually use it without a blade cover providing a pretty consistent cut. Given the typical architectural constraints of bathrooms, the cord simply isn&#x27;t long enough. We use an orange, outdoor extension cord so that I can move the cutter without pulling the cord taut of constantly moving the hair cutee. The case is very helpful.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> It works, but not as well as an older model I had. This one is much lighter and so vibrates  a lot. I preferred the weight of the older one, and the better feel it had.</li>
            <li> Cut both my sons and my boyfriends hair. Works great. Lost 1 star cause its loud.</li>
            <li> Hair&#x27;s car had broken down and we run a low-grade twice.</li>
            <li> Great, now I can cut the hair of my children and my grandfather smoothly</li>
            <li> Very unsatisfied the product is not to as it appears in the image order or the one in the box, the features are totally different a generic product. Lacks a piece brush shake does not come in the box. I pay for a silver machine, and sent me a blue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not even look like the box they sent me to that contained in</li>
            <li> Absolutely no power! Waste of money &amp; very timely to try and cut anything. Used once &amp; threw in the garbage. You have to pass over the same spot over and over and over and OVER. As soon as clippers touch hair, the motor bogs down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always gone to Supercuts for a quick easy haircut. got this the other day and i wont ever need to go back again. saves lots of money.</li>
            <li> What is with the side screw?</li>
            <li> ordered this item for the hubby as a smaller christmas present last year. he liked the shape of it and that it was blue (his favorite color). i would recommend this item to guys who keep their hair shorter ALL THE TIME and just need to touch it up, where as my husband let his hair grow out all shaggy, then tries to use these clippers and gets all mad bc it &amp;#34;gets jammed up&amp;#34; haha only real complaint is that it has a very short cord (about the length of a hair dryer)--i make him shave his head out on the porch to keep our bathroom sink clean and the cord is just too dang short so he has to bend his neck and shoulders in all kinds of crazy positions to get his head out the door. it still ends up making a mess but i just sweep/vacuum it up. still better then paying for a buzz at a haircut place once a month i guess.</li>
            <li> This was the perfect gift and my husband loves it</li>
            <li> Powerful light weight , just what i was looking for</li>
            <li> Best deal I could find on hair clippers, and they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not get as close as I had hoped for trimming my beard, but it&#x27;s not advertised as a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I read the booklet, followed the setup instructions, oiling the blades, and setting the power screw... Remember to take the blade protector off... That&#x27;s a super nice feature, keeps the blades sharp ... Cut my hair in record time &amp; had it inspected, didn&#x27;t miss A spot, all nice and even !!! It MORE then paid for itself on the first hair cut !!! Super good price for a well featured  Haircutter !!! The quality of the extra features and parts where great... Nothing more to buy, well I&#x27;ll buy an extra tube of oil, thats some thing you don&#x27;t want to run out of !!!</li>
