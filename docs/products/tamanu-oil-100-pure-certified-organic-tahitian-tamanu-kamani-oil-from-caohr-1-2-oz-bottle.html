            <li>Many claims where given of the benefits of this product.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I tried this yesterday.</li>
            <li>Now I won&#x27;t have to hide it any more.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>When I got this oil, I applied it and saw an amazing, significantly improvement after applying two dosages over one day.</li>
            <li>If what I have seen is any indication of what is to come I believe if I consistently use the product that by the time the 2 ounces are used that there is a good possibility that the rashes will heal.</li>
            <li>I smooth it lightly over my face after toning with a mix of witch hazel and rose water.  </li>
            <li>This product is also good for scars, stretch marks, cuts and any other kind of skin ailment of any kind, just try it, it really does work I&#x27;m not kiddin!!</li>
            <li>so it was fine.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really say how effective it is on skin ailments.  </li>
            <li>He never checked how they fit in my shoes.</li>
            <li>This oil is truly fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d originally purchased it for my skin.  </li>
            <li>To solve this I just use a small make-up brush which works perfectly.</li>
            <li>This has such a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>The disease-free, healthy toenail tissue is almost to the top now -- not much further to go until the whole toenail looks and feels perfectly healthy again.  </li>
            <li>I am truly amazed at how quickly this product works.</li>
            <li>I personally use it to treat fungus on my toe and can say that I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for keeping cuts and minor abrasions moisturized.</li>
            <li>It works exactly as described!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this oil twice a day for about a week on clean exfoliated skin,&amp; so far the changes are pretty exciting :)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just amazing overall.  </li>
            <li>I think this product is worth every penny.</li>

            <li>I also hear it&#x27;s good for acne, psoriasis, and other skin conditions.</li>
            <li>In February, 2011, I had the 5th toe on my right foot along with that foot&#x27;s metatarsal bone amputated.</li>
            <li>Dr OZ was right to recommend it.</li>
            <li>I applied it as directed and this product started working right as soon as I put it on.</li>
            <li>and it is especially useful for dry, cracked fingernails and toenails.</li>
            <li>Super gentle on my skin and my family.</li>
            <li>A little bit better than before, but not sure if that&#x27;s because of the time factor or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked excellent on removing the fungus from my toenail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I had a challenge as I spend approx.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>I witnessed it first hand myself</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>First, the itching went away, then the rash started leaving, then the blisters went away as well.</li>
            <li>I tried everything and bought many different products but nothing seemed to work, until I started using this product.</li>
            <li>The 3rd day it felt better</li>
            <li>For me it has done exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>First heard about it from Dr Manny Alvarez on Fox News.  </li>
            <li>When I first tried this I think I put it on a spot that was precancerous</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend that you give this product a try, it really does work, I promise!!</li>
            <li>i used it on a patch of scaling skin on the bottom of my foot and cleared it right up after trying many other things this oil worked</li>
            <li>Specifically, they are nice and pink, and normal thickness, not deformed and yellowed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been one day but the improvement is impressive less red and noticeable.</li>
            <li>I expected more in results, but it&#x27;s satisfactory.</li>
            <li>Where, for years, the skin all over my body peeled constantly, by using the TAMANU OIL, my skin is smooth all over my body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very thankful that this has worked so well.</li>
            <li>Every morning I would wet a piece of cotton with Tamanu oil and placed it on top of the infected nail and then placed a bandage over it.</li>
            <li>this is the real stuff.</li>
            <li>I tried this product not knowing if it would really work for me or not.</li>
            <li>This does wanders on my face, really keeps breakouts away</li>
            <li>Now 6 weeks later my toenail is smooth and color is getting there.</li>
            <li>my skin was raw and I \\&quot;had\\&quot; nice legs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it on any part of your body that you want a more youthful, healthy glow for:  hands, chest / neckline, feet (mixed with another thick body butter),</li>
            <li>I found that his oil evened out my blotchy skin on my face, left my skin super soft and on the first use lightened up my age spots.</li>
            <li>and it went away by the next day and now my scalp is soft and smooth with no sores or scabs.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>, is worth the extra money, believe me!</li>
            <li>I found when I added the Organic 100% pure Tamanu Oil it made such a positive difference in the healing process and development of new skin tissue.</li>
            <li>I was being threatened with not only another toe being amputated, but my RIGHT LOWER LEG AS WELL.</li>
            <li>Have used three bottles, and new skin is forming.&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
            <li>fortunately i poured some selsun blue on the itch last night and it stopped.</li>
            <li>you, I&#x27;m giving it four stars because I have a very sensitive sense of smell and this product smell like it should:  </li>
            <li>Now, my hands are so smooth, soft and pink with no black scaring like before.</li>
            <li>I absolutely did not expect this oil to perform as it does, specially not on the first try!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s helped clear blemishes, faded my stretch marks, and it seems the depth of them has smoothed out also.</li>
            <li>google searched natural products for skin and nails.</li>
            <li>The rash was completely gone.</li>
            <li>I wait about 3-5 minutes for the oil to completely absorb before putting anything else</li>
            <li>Like an earlier reviewer, I am also using Curaderm and found this to really help in the healing of skin afterwards.</li>
            <li>I believe that my toe fungus is improving, but it is too early to make a definitive comment.</li>
            <li>After a year of use, nearly every night,  her toenails look like she is a young woman again.  </li>
            <li>I used it every day for about 9 weeks on a scar, but then developed a rash and had to stop using.  </li>
            <li>Also developed  a rash/open sore on my toe and had to stop using.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make me break out, leaves my skin so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, I use the oil undiluted on areas needing more attention&amp; mix a few drops in my body lotion for other areas.</li>
            <li>The fungus grows over many years and to expect an immediate reversal is probably unrealistic, but initially it appears to have a positive impact.</li>
            <li>and now my thumb has grown almost the entire first half of a new nail</li>
            <li>I researched high and low and used countless number of products to no avail.</li>
            <li>I had to stop wearing shorts way back in early August</li>
            <li>I totally avoided the product going to my old address.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cI am 52 year old male.  </li>
            <li>I use this almost daily to help with sensitive skin areas.  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend this for toe fungus, thick toenail, discolored toenail!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I read the reviews, but unfortunately most reviews about Tamanu oil where of doubtful credibility as these reviews were given in exchange of a discounted or free Tamanu oil.</li>
            <li>So a few months after I started using coconut oil,  which works pretty well but just never seemed to take care of everything.  </li>
            <li>In less than a week much of the problems simply disappeared.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> it&#x27;s helped clear blemishes, faded my stretch marks, and it seems the depth of them has smoothed out also.</li>
            <li> google searched natural products for skin and nails.</li>
            <li> The rash was completely gone.</li>
            <li> I wait about 3-5 minutes for the oil to completely absorb before putting anything else</li>
            <li> Like an earlier reviewer, I am also using Curaderm and found this to really help in the healing of skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> I believe that my toe fungus is improving, but it is too early to make a definitive comment.</li>
            <li> After a year of use, nearly every night,  her toenails look like she is a young woman again.  </li>
            <li> I used it every day for about 9 weeks on a scar, but then developed a rash and had to stop using.  </li>
            <li> Also developed  a rash/open sore on my toe and had to stop using.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make me break out, leaves my skin so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, I use the oil undiluted on areas needing more attention&amp; mix a few drops in my body lotion for other areas.</li>
            <li> The fungus grows over many years and to expect an immediate reversal is probably unrealistic, but initially it appears to have a positive impact.</li>
            <li> and now my thumb has grown almost the entire first half of a new nail</li>
            <li> I researched high and low and used countless number of products to no avail.</li>
            <li> I had to stop wearing shorts way back in early August</li>
            <li> I totally avoided the product going to my old address.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cI am 52 year old male.  </li>
            <li> I use this almost daily to help with sensitive skin areas.  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend this for toe fungus, thick toenail, discolored toenail!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, but unfortunately most reviews about Tamanu oil where of doubtful credibility as these reviews were given in exchange of a discounted or free Tamanu oil.</li>
            <li> So a few months after I started using coconut oil,  which works pretty well but just never seemed to take care of everything.  </li>
            <li> In less than a week much of the problems simply disappeared.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and dewy and is less dry overall.  </li>
            <li> I still have a long way to go, but the benefits are undeniable.</li>
            <li> It barely took about a week and a half</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t been using it on my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I mixed it in my facial moisturizer and ended up with a few pimples.  </li>
            <li> My nose is just too sensitive and I have to mix a small drop of lavender EO or grapefruit EO to mask it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have had it less than a week and have already realize its benefits for dry skin (elbows especially), acne, nails, and cuts and scrapes.</li>
            <li> Who would have ever thought that a little product like this would actually do the trick in clearing up my hands.</li>
            <li> and she said; \\&quot;That looks really bad we better get you into the doctor\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I changed to the WOUND CENTER at UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL.</li>
            <li> Yes its expensive, but to me it was worth it.</li>
            <li> This is helpful for bug bites, itchy places, rough skin.</li>
            <li> I used it on my toe nails for about four months, per the other reviews--</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I question if the other reviews are legit.</li>
            <li> want to start using it on other parts of my body like hair and face soon.</li>
            <li> but I have a lot of brown spots aand other lesions.  </li>
            <li> It is a little expensive but to me it is worth it.</li>
            <li> After trying Every product available at the store for a heat rash I started to get frustrated that nothing was working.</li>
            <li> organic, deeply earthy / nutty and has a slightly thick consistency.  </li>
            <li> i tried a few other brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dark green in color</li>
            <li> I get under skin zits they stay for months this stuff gets rid of them in a few days  </li>
            <li> I did the carac cream which killed the pre cancerous growths</li>
            <li> I have vicious candida skin rashes all over my legs due to an over consumption of coconut oil over a short span of time (and not realizing that I should have gradually increase my consumption of the oil and not knowing how powerful an antifungal coconut oil is), \\&quot;anyway\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This product spreads well and is not as thick as other oils I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> It sounds expensive but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> not sure what that will do to my feet</li>
            <li> and it was completely gone, and this rash and blisters were really bad.</li>
            <li> Does not really help troubled skin which is what we bought it for.  </li>
            <li> I use it at least once a day.</li>
            <li> It could work as a moisturizer...but do not expect it to work on troubled skin when other products or prescriptions will not.</li>
            <li> i think it made my feet worse.</li>
            <li> instead of just toe nail fungus, which it made no dent in at all, in using the 2nd bottle of this crap</li>
            <li> I think it would have cured it if I hadn&#x27;t ran out because the rash got worse and spread after I stopped using it.  </li>
            <li> The toe was broken.</li>
            <li> the fungi came rushing out on my legs severly compromising the integrity of the skin on my legs leaving large, vicious, ugly, horrific rashes all over my legs that itched to high heaven.</li>
            <li> It works but stinks.</li>
            <li> Does not have a bad odor</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> it was a very expensive mistake!</li>
            <li> My mother in law had bad toenail fungus for years and nasty looking toenails.</li>
            <li> i now also have what looks like the worst case of athlete&#x27;s foot i&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> However, my legs looked horrible and I was sickened.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> excellent product and fast service from seller!</li>
            <li> this did nothing good for my feet at all! i fact i think it made my feet worse. instead of just toe nail fungus, which it made no dent in at all, in using the 2nd bottle of this crap i now also have what looks like the worst case of athlete&#x27;s foot i&#x27;ve ever seen. the itch is enough to make me want to scour my feet with a brillo pad! fortunately i poured some selsun blue on the itch last night and it stopped. not sure what that will do to my feet but i figured if it&#x27;s safe for your scalp... oh well..&lt;br /&gt;anyway i would NOT recommend this stuff. it was a very expensive mistake!</li>
            <li> Great for older skin care!</li>
            <li> A doctor recommended it for tonail fungus.  I have been putting a drop of tamanu oil on my infected toe after every shower (and then putting socks on) for over six months now.  The disease-free, healthy toenail tissue is almost to the top now -- not much further to go until the whole toenail looks and feels perfectly healthy again.  I&#x27;m sure this oil does all the other stuff the reviewers say, but here&#x27;s one more accolade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay..I expected more in results, but it&#x27;s satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Does not have a bad odor and it is especially useful for dry, cracked fingernails and toenails.</li>
            <li> Thank you this stuff is amazing I get under skin zits they stay for months this stuff gets rid of them in a few days  Make my skin wonderful ordering more thank you</li>
            <li> Uh...not sure what to make of this oil.  I&#x27;d originally purchased it for my skin.  I mixed it in my facial moisturizer and ended up with a few pimples.  I used it on my toe nails for about four months, per the other reviews--but I didn&#x27;t see any changes so I gave up; I had a sudden rash break out on my neck and it seemed like it was healing until I ran out so I can&#x27;t really say how effective it is on skin ailments.  I think it would have cured it if I hadn&#x27;t ran out because the rash got worse and spread after I stopped using it.  Not a miracle oil for me.</li>
            <li> I have an illness, Eosinophilia Myalgia Syndrome, that only 1700 people in the US have. I think I&#x27;ve tried every moisturizing lotion made. None work. From this illness, I have had foot problems since diagnosis in 1988. In February, 2011, I had the 5th toe on my right foot along with that foot&#x27;s metatarsal bone amputated. I am at CLEVELAND CLINIC for my care. The Chief Podiatrist for Vascular Surgery had me get custom made orthotics. He never checked how they fit in my shoes. Within 19 days of getting the orthotics, I had over 1 inch in diameter blisters on both feet. The bone from the 3rd toe on my R foot was showing. The toe was broken. I was being threatened with not only another toe being amputated, but my RIGHT LOWER LEG AS WELL. I changed to the WOUND CENTER at UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL. I started using the TAMANU OIL about 3 weeks ago. Where, for years, the skin all over my body peeled constantly, by using the TAMANU OIL, my skin is smooth all over my body. The best news is that there&#x27;s a scab covering the bone on my 3rd toe. I should be able to \\&quot;walk for more than 10 steps/day\\&quot; (with a walker). The best thing is IT DOESN&#x27;T LOOK LIKE MY TOE WILL BE AMPUTATED. This is a product I&#x27;ll use daily. It sounds expensive but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. I never had a reaction on coconuts, but oil started irritate my skin. It had Certified label, but who cares if it does not work.</li>
            <li> This oil is awesome and it works! We have had it less than a week and have already realize its benefits for dry skin (elbows especially), acne, nails, and cuts and scrapes. Not recommended for people with nut allergies, which we did not know until we received, but no nut allergies in our household so it was fine. Has a nutty fragrance to it that fades as the oil absorbs. Great product!</li>
            <li> google searched natural products for skin and nails. this was recommended.pleasant aroma,consistency of mineral oil and seems to be working.</li>
            <li> After trying Every product available at the store for a heat rash I started to get frustrated that nothing was working. So I started reading everything I could find on line, and came across Tamanu Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After it arrived I showed my wife the rash and she said; \\&quot;That looks really bad we better get you into the doctor\\&quot;. That night I put Tamanu Oil on it and went to bed. The next morning I told my wife to take a look. The rash was completely gone. We were both amazed.  I am sold on this product. I ordered 2 more bottles just so we always have some on the shelf. I&#x27;m very thankful that this has worked so well. Yes its expensive, but to me it was worth it.</li>
            <li> This product spreads well and is not as thick as other oils I have purchased.  I would buy again without hesitation.</li>
            <li> very nice , processed as it should be, the higher end finishing , noticed changes. And would recommend .</li>
            <li> I read a lot about this amazing oil and its benefits. I personally use it to treat fungus on my toe and can say that I am very pleased. I still have a long way to go, but the benefits are undeniable. At first I had a challenge as I spend approx. 10-12 hrs a day, but then I found solution for it. Every morning I would wet a piece of cotton with Tamanu oil and placed it on top of the infected nail and then placed a bandage over it. Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> About 2 months of faithful use 2x / day has made a big difference in the texture, smoothness and youthfulness of my skin (and hands, too!)  My skin feels soft and dewy and is less dry overall.  I smooth it lightly over my face after toning with a mix of witch hazel and rose water.  I wait about 3-5 minutes for the oil to completely absorb before putting anything else on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind you, I&#x27;m giving it four stars because I have a very sensitive sense of smell and this product smell like it should:  organic, deeply earthy / nutty and has a slightly thick consistency.  It&#x27;s a dark green in color and it&#x27;s just amazing overall.  But I don&#x27;t like the smell.  My nose is just too sensitive and I have to mix a small drop of lavender EO or grapefruit EO to mask it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it on any part of your body that you want a more youthful, healthy glow for:  hands, chest / neckline, feet (mixed with another thick body butter), THE BACK OF YOUR NECK....just some ideas....and I could on, and on, and on...</li>
            <li> This oil is truly fantastic. I read the reviews, but unfortunately most reviews about Tamanu oil where of doubtful credibility as these reviews were given in exchange of a discounted or free Tamanu oil. I took the risk and bought the oil. I found that his oil evened out my blotchy skin on my face, left my skin super soft and on the first use lightened up my age spots. I absolutely did not expect this oil to perform as it does, specially not on the first try! Very impressed! I am not likely to ever be without this oil again.</li>
            <li> This is a very soothing and great product for your skin.  Like an earlier reviewer, I am also using Curaderm and found this to really help in the healing of skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> amazing product from a great company. helped heal my skin post radiation therapy. no scars, no burn, no peeling... just beautiful skin. i truly believe that using it before my cancer treatment saved my skin from damage. not all tamanu oils are the same. i tried a few other brands. this is the real stuff. great customer service as well:) thanks!</li>
            <li> Very good product. It works exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the smell so I haven&#x27;t been using it on my dry skin.  I bought it because of the Dr. Oz show.  It works but stinks.</li>
            <li> I believe that my toe fungus is improving, but it is too early to make a definitive comment. The fungus grows over many years and to expect an immediate reversal is probably unrealistic, but initially it appears to have a positive impact.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Curaderm for skin cancer. It is working great. I found when I added the Organic 100% pure Tamanu Oil it made such a positive difference in the healing process and development of new skin tissue. I also found California Academy to be everything you hope for in customer service.</li>
            <li> You are \\&quot;NOT\\&quot; going to believe what this oil can do. I witnessed it first hand myself and I still don&#x27;t believe it. I have vicious candida skin rashes all over my legs due to an over consumption of coconut oil over a short span of time (and not realizing that I should have gradually increase my consumption of the oil and not knowing how powerful an antifungal coconut oil is), \\&quot;anyway\\&quot; the fungi came rushing out on my legs severly compromising the integrity of the skin on my legs leaving large, vicious, ugly, horrific rashes all over my legs that itched to high heaven. It was a nightmare. I had to stop wearing shorts way back in early August my skin was raw and I \\&quot;had\\&quot; nice legs. I researched high and low and used countless number of products to no avail. Finally, I came upon this oil and by then the itchiness had subsided almost 80%. However, my legs looked horrible and I was sickened. When I got this oil, I applied it and saw an amazing, significantly improvement after applying two dosages over one day. I simply could not beleive what I saw. You need to take the time to research this oil. It is truly amazing. If what I have seen is any indication of what is to come I believe if I consistently use the product that by the time the 2 ounces are used that there is a good possibility that the rashes will heal. According to what I have read this oil has the capability of restoring and repairing damaged skin. Buy it you will not be dissapointed. It has numerous medicinal and health benefits according to the documentation and I believe it.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality! Arrived promptly. I&#x27;ve been using this oil twice a day for about a week on clean exfoliated skin,&amp; so far the changes are pretty exciting :) it&#x27;s helped clear blemishes, faded my stretch marks, and it seems the depth of them has smoothed out also. It has a greenish yellow tint that I believed contributed to my fading but even after showering, before use the color of my stretch marks are still faded. Anyhow, I use the oil undiluted on areas needing more attention&amp; mix a few drops in my body lotion for other areas. A little goes a long way! NOT FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALLERGIES TO NUTS! I have also Started using it on my three boys who are constantly getting scraped up. Super gentle on my skin and my family. Test a spot on your skin first , enjoy &amp; good luck!</li>
            <li> This oil is great...prevents acne and nourishes skin deeply...I use it daily on my face and on any skin problem that needs healing</li>
            <li> This is helpful for bug bites, itchy places, rough skin. Dr OZ was right to recommend it.</li>
            <li> Husband used this daily for several weeks after having moles removed and he doesn&#x27;t have any scarring! Highly recommend. It will stain clothing if it comes in contact.</li>
            <li> I bought some of this for my  parents and my Mother in law.  My mother in law had bad toenail fungus for years and nasty looking toenails. After a year of use, nearly every night,  her toenails look like she is a young woman again.  Specifically, they are nice and pink, and normal thickness, not deformed and yellowed.  This is a miracle product...</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!!! I tried this product not knowing if it would really work for me or not. To my surprise it worked like a charm!! This stuff really works! I had a rash with blisters on both of my hands that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of for months, some call it Psoriasis. I applied it as directed and this product started working right as soon as I put it on. First, the itching went away, then the rash started leaving, then the blisters went away as well. It barely took about a week and a half and it was completely gone, and this rash and blisters were really bad. I tried everything and bought many different products but nothing seemed to work, until I started using this product. If you have Psoriasis, blisters or rashes that just won&#x27;t go away no matter what you try, I highly recommend that you give this product a try, it really does work, I promise!! Who would have ever thought that a little product like this would actually do the trick in clearing up my hands. Now, my hands are so smooth, soft and pink with no black scaring like before. This product also works for scabs and scales on your scalp too, I used to have this problem also and it went away by the next day and now my scalp is soft and smooth with no sores or scabs. This product is also good for scars, stretch marks, cuts and any other kind of skin ailment of any kind, just try it, it really does work I&#x27;m not kiddin!! I think this product is worth every penny. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I am truly amazed at how quickly this product works. It is a little expensive but to me it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Applied it to a scar but the scar is still visible.  A little bit better than before, but not sure if that&#x27;s because of the time factor or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked excellent on removing the fungus from my toenail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t remove age spots at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One warning...........I used it every day for about 9 weeks on a scar, but then developed a rash and had to stop using.  Also developed  a rash/open sore on my toe and had to stop using.</li>
            <li> This is the brand to buy, it pulls infection out into cotton well.  Have used three bottles, and new skin is forming.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, is worth the extra money, believe me!</li>
            <li> This stuff is not a 10,I give this a 20!! Awsome for cracked feet.I have used every cream you can think of and this was the only stuff that worked.My feet are like baby feet :)A friend used it for a scare and it almost healed it to profection.</li>
            <li> I NEVER USED THIS OIL BEFORE BUT FOUND IT TO BE EVERYTHING IT SAID IT WOULD BE AND THEN MORE.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but I tried it on a ffungus that had appeared on my left thumb. The firsr 2 days my thumb ached under the nail. The 3rd day it felt better and now my thumb has grown almost the entire first half of a new nail and it&#x27;s clearing up from the nail bed to the tip. The yellowing has all but disappeared, This stuff works!!!</li>
            <li> This does wanders on my face, really keeps breakouts away</li>
            <li> I was such a skeptic but i would try ANYTHING to get rid of this almost 3 year problem. I have been using 2 times a day since i have rec&#x27;vd and after about 2-1/2 weeks i started seeing a difference. Now 6 weeks later my toenail is smooth and color is getting there. I haven&#x27;t been able to wear sandals for 2-1/2 years and i love to wear sandals and paint my toes :)  i highly recommend this for toe fungus, thick toenail, discolored toenail!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> This product is used for a variety of skin disorders and ailments.  For me it has done exactly as promised.  I will not be without it.  First heard about it from Dr Manny Alvarez on Fox News.  I then did my own research and am glad I did.  The one thing I would change is to attach a brush to the cap as an applicator.  To solve this I just use a small make-up brush which works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This has such a pleasant smell. I have used this as a disinfectant &amp; antiviral oil. It&#x27;s good for keeping cuts and minor abrasions moisturized. I also hear it&#x27;s good for acne, psoriasis, and other skin conditions. Get it!</li>
            <li> Disappointed. Many claims where given of the benefits of this product. I did not experience any. I question if the other reviews are legit.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this I think I put it on a spot that was precancerous and I thought it made it redder and didn&#x27;t use it. It probably has anti cancer properties. I finally had a biopsy confirming that it was actinic keratosis and the biopsy appeared to get it all but that was 3 months ago and the scar has been bothering me. I&#x27;ve tried coconut oil, flax oil and perrin&#x27;s cream but I&#x27;m so glad I tried this yesterday. It&#x27;s only been one day but the improvement is impressive less red and noticeable. After putting it on yesterday I actually went out with out putting makeup on it. I&#x27;ll have to repost after a month.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make me break out, leaves my skin so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with a scar  and from this seller&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and I already see results on my stretch marks on my belly. I haven&#x27;t delivered my child yet so this is during pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping and great response from seller I totally avoided the product going to my old address.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to start using it on other parts of my body like hair and face soon.</li>
            <li> cI am 52 year old male.  An outdoors,  aathletic type with olive skin.  I had precancerous lesions on forehead and arms.  I did the carac cream which killed the pre cancerous growths but I have a lot of brown spots aand other lesions.  So a few months after I started using coconut oil,  which works pretty well but just never seemed to take care of everything.  Then I got Tamanu oil.  In less than a week much of the problems simply disappeared.  Everything about me looks 10-15 years younger except for my skin.  Now I won&#x27;t have to hide it any more.  This is miraculous stuff,  hope it works as well for you as it has for me.</li>
            <li> Yes it is amazing i used it on a patch of scaling skin on the bottom of my foot and cleared it right up after trying many other things this oil worked</li>
            <li> Gross product. should have sent it back.</li>
            <li> Does not really help troubled skin which is what we bought it for.  It could work as a moisturizer...but do not expect it to work on troubled skin when other products or prescriptions will not.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best product I have ever bought. Great for the skin. I use it at least once a day.</li>
            <li> I use this almost daily to help with sensitive skin areas.  The itching stops almost immediately on contact. Love it.</li>
