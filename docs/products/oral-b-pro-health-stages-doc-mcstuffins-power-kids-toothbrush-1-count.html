            <li>cute and easy to use !</li>
            <li>Huge hit with my grandson!  </li>
            <li>and so this is the perfect tooth brush for Miss Independent.  </li>
            <li>Hello Kitty / Disney Princesses are on it :)</li>
            <li>Someone recommended using cute tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>We still struggle sometimes, but it&#x27;s gotten a lot better.</li>
            <li>My kids love the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It works ok, but the ad for the product was somewhat misleading and not age appropriate.</li>
            <li>This is perfect, my son&#x27;s teach are so white.  </li>
            <li>I arrived on time and the product is perfect , only Doc ordered because it was for my daughter and sent the monster in</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain, my kids love brushing their teeth with their toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My son thinks this is great, makes morning brushing much easier.  </li>
            <li>At this price you can&#x27;t get anything better.</li>
            <li>Could be great for older kids, but mine wasn&#x27;t a fan.</li>
            <li>it works pretty good</li>
            <li>Works as expected the color scheme is very beautiful, will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my three year old daughter and it works great.  </li>
            <li>We have tried other electric brushes, but I found that this one works best.</li>
            <li>so our toddler will be more excited to brush his teeth</li>
            <li>My 3 and 4 yr olds love the power brushes to clean their teeth, it&#x27;s an added bonus that Doc McStuffins /</li>
            <li>The battery is easy to replace... since it will get used.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect for little hands and the buttons are easy to operate.  </li>
            <li>Our son loved it and brushing teeth in the morning became a pleasant 3 minute job from a non-stop crying, us begging, struggling experience.</li>
            <li>I love it - waiting for my 2 year old grandson to love it too!  </li>
            <li>Perfect for little people.</li>
            <li>very good as expected</li>
            <li>for transport free ....  </li>
            <li>She absolutely adores the characters and now loves brushing her own teeth.</li>
            <li>She loves the monsters on it and actually does a great job brushing her teeth now.</li>
            <li>One nice thing is that when she or I pull it out of her mouth while brushing - it doesn&#x27;t move so fast that you get toothpaste spatter on everything.  </li>
            <li>good for our 2 year old son</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a bit young for that feeling of putting a &amp;#34;vibrating tool&amp;#34; in his mouth...all in good time.</li>
            <li>Kid friendly size.....they like the characters.</li>
            <li>These are great little toothbrushes, much better than some others we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My 5-year-old loves the Monsters Inc. movie so he was thrilled to get this new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It helps them clean their teach well</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is ok - not exactly what I was hoping for, but a good brush for the toy.</li>
            <li>Although we never had a problem getting our son to brush his teeth, he certainly enjoys doing it more with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Baby love, things very well</li>
            <li>the kids love it, works very well and reliable</li>
            <li>They actually spin and do a good job cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li>I also like this particular brand as we have gone through a variety  of electric tooth brushes and these by far have been the most effective.</li>
            <li>Battery does seem to run out quickly but then again our son just keeps it on longer than he needs to.</li>
            <li>but my 26mo is pretty advanced on a lot of things and loves to brush, so I thought, why not.</li>
            <li>great，baby like it very much!</li>
            <li>After the first use with this one it was GONE!</li>
            <li>She really likes my husbands electric spin brush, so I figured this would be fine, but she refuses to put this one in her mouth when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>It helps out that it&#x27;s fun looking</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li>better way for a complete oral clean.&lt;br /&gt;makes</li>
            <li>brushing teeth a fun activity .</li>
            <li>There is also a fun factor which makes it exciting for her to use the brush.  </li>
            <li>These toothbrushes work way better than the many other baby toothbrushes we tried.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t get it turned off right away</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s ready to use right away!</li>
            <li>The advantage of using the electric toothbrush over a handheld or finger toothbrush is that it&#x27;s fast, gentle, and you can reach into the crevices of her mouth easily.  </li>
            <li>It makes it much easier to quickly brush her teeth.</li>
            <li>My son likes it very much.</li>
            <li>good，my daughter like it very much</li>
            <li>I love the on and off buttons as they don&#x27;t stick out and get in a way, and they require enough pressure to where my daughter can&#x27;t just accidentally turn it off when in use.</li>
            <li>This tooth brush made brushing fun and that was the whole point.</li>
            <li>and they actually want to brush their teeth more.  </li>
            <li>We took her for her first dentist check up</li>
            <li>Twice a day was a pretty traumatizing experience, until we found this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>She asks first thing in the morning and runs in the bathroom to get it herself before bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Obviously I would say results may vary, your child might love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My son loves this as his first electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Not only does he love Monsters inc</li>
            <li>Plus it helps that the spinning actually cleans his teeth better than he would with a manual brush.  </li>
            <li>Even my 3 year old can use it comfortably.</li>
            <li>looks very cute and my little one likes it</li>
            <li>friends of my daughter like the toothbrush very much, so I bought too much.</li>
            <li>He hasn&#x27;t gotten used to the noise yet, so right now, we are just using it as a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I use it to brush her back teeth without turning it on because it is easy to hold</li>
            <li>The bristles are good, the batteries last a long time...</li>
            <li>works fine, but the batteries were already low when we received it.</li>
            <li>Good but soft bristles for little teeth.</li>
            <li>So the head will wear off much faster.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real bummer that the brush head on this brush cannot be replaced.</li>
            <li>It makes so much noise she will have nothing to do with it when it is turned on.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be working really well.</li>
            <li>It really motivates him to brush his teeth now.</li>
            <li>Nothing worked to get her to cooperate as much as this one did.</li>
            <li>Fast, looked good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice way to get your child to brush his/her teeth, at least mine enjoys the buzzy toothbrush more than his regular one.</li>
            <li>Hahaha</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>It is so much easier and faster to brush her teeth.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I should have read the title more carefully</li>
            <li>This was more for a younger child (my son is 7 years old).  </li>
            <li>What I did find was a related toothpaste with the same kind of marketing--Doc McStuffins pic but a label about monsters.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the toothbrush is fantastic!</li>
            <li>much better than conventional brush</li>
            <li>Nice toothbrush for the price,,, when mine arrived the battery was dead and had to change it,, the battery itself was probably more than the unit so kinda defeated spending so little on the brush itself.  </li>
            <li>do, however enjoy the toothbrush (as he went back to his old ones and now I use it, haha).</li>
            <li>Far too powerful for a young toddler.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The head is a bit large, but it still works for our 18 mo old.</li>
            <li>Love the oral-b tooth brushes for the little ones.</li>
            <li>He (1 year old) has no issue brushing his teeth because he loves the brush so much.</li>
            <li>So, I got this because my three year old is apprehensive about brushing his teeth; I figured a Monsters toothbrush, plus it being motorized would really get him pumped about brushing ...</li>
            <li>He used to have this orangish tinge on his front two teeth that I couldn&#x27;t get to truly go away with a normal brush.</li>
            <li>I like the electric toothbrushes because it adds a few more brushstrokes for kids who might not do as well with a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the brush works just fine.</li>
            <li>My tooth very sensitive,</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft.  </li>
            <li>Oral B could easily have designed this product to be long lasting, which leaves me to think that it&#x27;s a shameless money making scheme.</li>
            <li>Barely fits to brush the back teeth, and definitely doesn&#x27;t fit easily to brush the outside of the back molars.</li>
            <li>My three year old loves this tooth brush!  </li>
            <li>Mom tested 3 year old approved!</li>
            <li>My 2, almost 3 year old loves brushing her teeth with &amp;#34;Michael&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty big and cumbersome for her 2yo mouth.</li>
            <li>This brush works well for our 18 month old (who loves our electric toothbrushes!)</li>
            <li>My 2 year old loves brushing her teeth with her new Doc McStuffins toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My 2 years old daughter loves this one, she didn&#x27;t usually let me brush her teeth, but after this one she enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>my child like it very much, i will buy again, by the way ,how long need to change ?</li>
            <li>The handle is larger than usual and very easy for child to hold.</li>
            <li>Like many parents, we were having really hard time brushing our daughter&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li>I ordered Doc McStuffins toothbrush for my 2 yr old daughter and received a Monsters Inc toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My 3 years old kid like it.</li>
            <li>I only wish you could replace the head instead of having to replace the whole brush eventually.</li>
            <li>My two year old loves it.</li>
            <li>The electric toothbrushes really seem to help them get their teeth cleaner compared to regular manual toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>It helps him get his teeth much cleaner than when using a regular brush.</li>
            <li>My 2 yrs old son loves brushing his teeth</li>
            <li>This one is my third buy since 3 months as it was appreciated and wanted by my nephews.</li>
            <li>Bought one for my 3 year old and</li>
            <li>my 1 year old wanted one, so I bought him one too.</li>
            <li>It is really loud when it is on, which freaks my son out a bit.</li>
            <li>Since I got this for my 4 year old, she always look forward to brushing her teeth.</li>
            <li>We have struggled getting our 3 year old to brush his teeth until we bought this.  </li>
            <li>I know it can take off valuable natural layers on children&#x27;s teeth, so I use this sparingly.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t mind it at all, even though it does emit a loud buzzing noise when on.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time and my 3 year old loves using it.</li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely loves this toothbrush always willing to brush her teeth herself even though she&#x27;s a little too young for it</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is fun for little ones to learn on, but</li>
            <li>This is working well to maximize the amount of teeth cleaning we can do in the short amount of time my 22 month old son will tolerate.  </li>
            <li>this is too big for 3 years old.</li>
            <li>Bought as a birthday present for my 4 year old niece (she asked for one).</li>
            <li>but apparently it&#x27;s disposable since I can&#x27;t see a way to replace the battery or brush.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s only 18 months old</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd electric toothbrush our 5 yr old has had.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are easily bent and mushed by little kids inexperienced tooth brushing skills.</li>
            <li>At this price, it&#x27;s simple enough to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>It has very little power and the batteries drain quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little heavy for them but its ok</li>
            <li>fun to use, tho kids might get lazy.</li>
            <li>worked pretty well after a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I pull her mouth back from her teeth, get the toothbrush in there, and the whole process of brushing her teeth takes less than three minutes.  </li>
            <li>The bush itself is easy for little hands to grasp, the head of the brush is made up of a round rotating brush that vibrates gently and a square non vibrating section that aids is brushing areas where the round part missed.</li>

            <li> We still struggle sometimes, but it&#x27;s gotten a lot better.</li>
            <li> My kids love the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It works ok, but the ad for the product was somewhat misleading and not age appropriate.</li>
            <li> This is perfect, my son&#x27;s teach are so white.  </li>
            <li> I arrived on time and the product is perfect , only Doc ordered because it was for my daughter and sent the monster in</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain, my kids love brushing their teeth with their toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> My son thinks this is great, makes morning brushing much easier.  </li>
            <li> At this price you can&#x27;t get anything better.</li>
            <li> Could be great for older kids, but mine wasn&#x27;t a fan.</li>
            <li> it works pretty good</li>
            <li> Works as expected the color scheme is very beautiful, will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my three year old daughter and it works great.  </li>
            <li> We have tried other electric brushes, but I found that this one works best.</li>
            <li> so our toddler will be more excited to brush his teeth</li>
            <li> My 3 and 4 yr olds love the power brushes to clean their teeth, it&#x27;s an added bonus that Doc McStuffins /</li>
            <li> The battery is easy to replace... since it will get used.  </li>
            <li> It is perfect for little hands and the buttons are easy to operate.  </li>
            <li> Our son loved it and brushing teeth in the morning became a pleasant 3 minute job from a non-stop crying, us begging, struggling experience.</li>
            <li> I love it - waiting for my 2 year old grandson to love it too!  </li>
            <li> Perfect for little people.</li>
            <li> very good as expected</li>
            <li> for transport free ....  </li>
            <li> She absolutely adores the characters and now loves brushing her own teeth.</li>
            <li> She loves the monsters on it and actually does a great job brushing her teeth now.</li>
            <li> One nice thing is that when she or I pull it out of her mouth while brushing - it doesn&#x27;t move so fast that you get toothpaste spatter on everything.  </li>
            <li> good for our 2 year old son</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a bit young for that feeling of putting a &amp;#34;vibrating tool&amp;#34; in his mouth...all in good time.</li>
            <li> Kid friendly size.....they like the characters.</li>
            <li> These are great little toothbrushes, much better than some others we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My 5-year-old loves the Monsters Inc. movie so he was thrilled to get this new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It helps them clean their teach well</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is ok - not exactly what I was hoping for, but a good brush for the toy.</li>
            <li> Although we never had a problem getting our son to brush his teeth, he certainly enjoys doing it more with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Baby love, things very well</li>
            <li> the kids love it, works very well and reliable</li>
            <li> They actually spin and do a good job cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> I also like this particular brand as we have gone through a variety  of electric tooth brushes and these by far have been the most effective.</li>
            <li> Battery does seem to run out quickly but then again our son just keeps it on longer than he needs to.</li>
            <li> but my 26mo is pretty advanced on a lot of things and loves to brush, so I thought, why not.</li>
            <li> great，baby like it very much!</li>
            <li> After the first use with this one it was GONE!</li>
            <li> She really likes my husbands electric spin brush, so I figured this would be fine, but she refuses to put this one in her mouth when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> It helps out that it&#x27;s fun looking</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li> better way for a complete oral clean.&lt;br /&gt;makes</li>
            <li> brushing teeth a fun activity .</li>
            <li> There is also a fun factor which makes it exciting for her to use the brush.  </li>
            <li> These toothbrushes work way better than the many other baby toothbrushes we tried.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get it turned off right away</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s ready to use right away!</li>
            <li> The advantage of using the electric toothbrush over a handheld or finger toothbrush is that it&#x27;s fast, gentle, and you can reach into the crevices of her mouth easily.  </li>
            <li> It makes it much easier to quickly brush her teeth.</li>
            <li> My son likes it very much.</li>
            <li> good，my daughter like it very much</li>
            <li> I love the on and off buttons as they don&#x27;t stick out and get in a way, and they require enough pressure to where my daughter can&#x27;t just accidentally turn it off when in use.</li>
            <li> This tooth brush made brushing fun and that was the whole point.</li>
            <li> and they actually want to brush their teeth more.  </li>
            <li> We took her for her first dentist check up</li>
            <li> Twice a day was a pretty traumatizing experience, until we found this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> She asks first thing in the morning and runs in the bathroom to get it herself before bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> Obviously I would say results may vary, your child might love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My son loves this as his first electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Not only does he love Monsters inc</li>
            <li> Plus it helps that the spinning actually cleans his teeth better than he would with a manual brush.  </li>
            <li> Even my 3 year old can use it comfortably.</li>
            <li> looks very cute and my little one likes it</li>
            <li> friends of my daughter like the toothbrush very much, so I bought too much.</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t gotten used to the noise yet, so right now, we are just using it as a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I use it to brush her back teeth without turning it on because it is easy to hold</li>
            <li> The bristles are good, the batteries last a long time...</li>
            <li> works fine, but the batteries were already low when we received it.</li>
            <li> Good but soft bristles for little teeth.</li>
            <li> So the head will wear off much faster.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real bummer that the brush head on this brush cannot be replaced.</li>
            <li> It makes so much noise she will have nothing to do with it when it is turned on.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be working really well.</li>
            <li> It really motivates him to brush his teeth now.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked to get her to cooperate as much as this one did.</li>
            <li> Fast, looked good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice way to get your child to brush his/her teeth, at least mine enjoys the buzzy toothbrush more than his regular one.</li>
            <li> Hahaha</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> It is so much easier and faster to brush her teeth.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I should have read the title more carefully</li>
            <li> This was more for a younger child (my son is 7 years old).  </li>
            <li> What I did find was a related toothpaste with the same kind of marketing--Doc McStuffins pic but a label about monsters.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the toothbrush is fantastic!</li>
            <li> much better than conventional brush</li>
            <li> Nice toothbrush for the price,,, when mine arrived the battery was dead and had to change it,, the battery itself was probably more than the unit so kinda defeated spending so little on the brush itself.  </li>
            <li> do, however enjoy the toothbrush (as he went back to his old ones and now I use it, haha).</li>
            <li> Far too powerful for a young toddler.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The head is a bit large, but it still works for our 18 mo old.</li>
            <li> Love the oral-b tooth brushes for the little ones.</li>
            <li> He (1 year old) has no issue brushing his teeth because he loves the brush so much.</li>
            <li> So, I got this because my three year old is apprehensive about brushing his teeth; I figured a Monsters toothbrush, plus it being motorized would really get him pumped about brushing ...</li>
            <li> He used to have this orangish tinge on his front two teeth that I couldn&#x27;t get to truly go away with a normal brush.</li>
            <li> I like the electric toothbrushes because it adds a few more brushstrokes for kids who might not do as well with a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the brush works just fine.</li>
            <li> My tooth very sensitive,</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft.  </li>
            <li> Oral B could easily have designed this product to be long lasting, which leaves me to think that it&#x27;s a shameless money making scheme.</li>
            <li> Barely fits to brush the back teeth, and definitely doesn&#x27;t fit easily to brush the outside of the back molars.</li>
            <li> My three year old loves this tooth brush!  </li>
            <li> Mom tested 3 year old approved!</li>
            <li> My 2, almost 3 year old loves brushing her teeth with &amp;#34;Michael&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty big and cumbersome for her 2yo mouth.</li>
            <li> This brush works well for our 18 month old (who loves our electric toothbrushes!)</li>
            <li> My 2 year old loves brushing her teeth with her new Doc McStuffins toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My 2 years old daughter loves this one, she didn&#x27;t usually let me brush her teeth, but after this one she enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> my child like it very much, i will buy again, by the way ,how long need to change ?</li>
            <li> The handle is larger than usual and very easy for child to hold.</li>
            <li> Like many parents, we were having really hard time brushing our daughter&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li> I ordered Doc McStuffins toothbrush for my 2 yr old daughter and received a Monsters Inc toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My 3 years old kid like it.</li>
            <li> I only wish you could replace the head instead of having to replace the whole brush eventually.</li>
            <li> My two year old loves it.</li>
            <li> The electric toothbrushes really seem to help them get their teeth cleaner compared to regular manual toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It helps him get his teeth much cleaner than when using a regular brush.</li>
            <li> My 2 yrs old son loves brushing his teeth</li>
            <li> This one is my third buy since 3 months as it was appreciated and wanted by my nephews.</li>
            <li> Bought one for my 3 year old and</li>
            <li> my 1 year old wanted one, so I bought him one too.</li>
            <li> It is really loud when it is on, which freaks my son out a bit.</li>
            <li> Since I got this for my 4 year old, she always look forward to brushing her teeth.</li>
            <li> We have struggled getting our 3 year old to brush his teeth until we bought this.  </li>
            <li> I know it can take off valuable natural layers on children&#x27;s teeth, so I use this sparingly.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t mind it at all, even though it does emit a loud buzzing noise when on.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time and my 3 year old loves using it.</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves this toothbrush always willing to brush her teeth herself even though she&#x27;s a little too young for it</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fun for little ones to learn on, but</li>
            <li> This is working well to maximize the amount of teeth cleaning we can do in the short amount of time my 22 month old son will tolerate.  </li>
            <li> this is too big for 3 years old.</li>
            <li> Bought as a birthday present for my 4 year old niece (she asked for one).</li>
            <li> but apparently it&#x27;s disposable since I can&#x27;t see a way to replace the battery or brush.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s only 18 months old</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd electric toothbrush our 5 yr old has had.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are easily bent and mushed by little kids inexperienced tooth brushing skills.</li>
            <li> At this price, it&#x27;s simple enough to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> It has very little power and the batteries drain quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy for them but its ok</li>
            <li> fun to use, tho kids might get lazy.</li>
            <li> worked pretty well after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I pull her mouth back from her teeth, get the toothbrush in there, and the whole process of brushing her teeth takes less than three minutes.  </li>
            <li> The bush itself is easy for little hands to grasp, the head of the brush is made up of a round rotating brush that vibrates gently and a square non vibrating section that aids is brushing areas where the round part missed.</li>
            <li> Cute toothbrush, but the bristles would become rock hard  and stiff.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to get it into my 2 year old&#x27;s mouth because it&#x27;s probably meant for an older child, the toothbrush head is too big.</li>
            <li> Other than that it works well,,, my 4 yr old has no problem using it.</li>
            <li> honestly...it will not last you long.</li>
            <li> We brush and floss, but before we got her a power brush, started to notice a little bit of staining on her teeth near her gums.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not something you&#x27;ll have for long.</li>
            <li> Only the top part of the toothbrush turns which is a little disappointing but overall our toddler likes it.</li>
            <li> But strangely, here the head is not replaceable!</li>
            <li> I had to pin her down and force open her mouth every time.</li>
            <li> if anything it set us back a little bit.</li>
            <li> But it is such a waste of resources.  </li>
            <li> I wish the head was replaceable, because it will be worn down before the battery needs replacing.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t make a mess.  </li>
            <li> I tried soaking it in hydrogen peroxide, which helped a little but not much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So what do I do with it in a few months when the bristles get worn?  </li>
            <li> I usually use a finger brush to do her front teeth.</li>
            <li> I never thought to check this because the idea of an electric toothbrush that you toss in a few months is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> She would do a poor job, and if we tried to help she would freak out and cry.</li>
            <li> My daughter was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Also useless, I hope it can help son of brushing your teeth</li>
            <li> Or maybe the mechanism twisted, bent or stretched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair wrong design, too angry</li>
            <li> Nothing too crazy, in the way of motion and strength.</li>
            <li> What a bad idea.</li>
            <li> Bad choice.</li>
            <li> Inc. My granddaughter was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Have a very disappointed toddler on my hands</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually outrageous in it&#x27;s wastefulness.</li>

            <li> Title is doc mcstuffins and the picture is doc mcstuffins but a monsters inc. Toothbrush came. Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for kids! So the head will wear off much faster. But strangely, here the head is not replaceable! Should have been! As such it&#x27;s use and throw. Good thing battery is included.</li>
            <li> Arrived as Monsters Inc. design. My daughter was not impressed.</li>
            <li> My son likes it and it&#x27;s been working well.</li>
            <li> I ordered Doc McStuffins toothbrush for my 2 yr old daughter and received a Monsters Inc toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real bummer that the brush head on this brush cannot be replaced. It&#x27;s actually outrageous in it&#x27;s wastefulness.

            <li> I bought this to use on my dog. It makes so much noise she will have nothing to do with it when it is turned on.  I use it to brush her back teeth without turning it on because it is easy to hold and I think it does a good job.  I usually use a finger brush to do her front teeth.</li>
            <li> My 3-year-old loves it!</li>
            <li> My three year old loves this tooth brush!  It is perfect for little hands and the buttons are easy to operate.  She likes to do things on her own and so this is the perfect tooth brush for Miss Independent.  The bristles are good, the batteries last a long time...I&#x27;ve found this left on an hour after bed time.  Mom tested 3 year old approved!</li>
            <li> Good children toothbrush, son love, comes with batteries inside</li>
            <li> Nice for kids. It&#x27;s a little heavy for them but its ok</li>
            <li> My son loves this toothbrush! Seems to be working really well.</li>

            <li> Great child&#x27;s toothbrush!!! The handle is larger than usual and very easy for child to hold. Good but soft bristles for little teeth.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this and haven&#x27;t even opened it.  I&#x27;ll probably be returning it.  I&#x27;ve never heard of an electric toothbrush that doesn&#x27;t let you replace the head.  So what do I do with it in a few months when the bristles get worn?  Just throw it in the trash?  I never thought to check this because the idea of an electric toothbrush that you toss in a few months is ridiculous.  What a bad idea.</li>

            <li> My 3 yo loves this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Perfect for introducing brushing 3 years old kids.</li>
            <li> for transport free ....  look good...</li>
            <li> Also useless, I hope it can help son of brushing your teeth</li>
            <li> My 3 and 4 yr olds love the power brushes to clean their teeth, it&#x27;s an added bonus that Doc McStuffins / Hello Kitty / Disney Princesses are on it :)</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. My two year old loves it. It really motivates him to brush his teeth now. No complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Like many parents, we were having really hard time brushing our daughter&#x27;s teeth. I had to pin her down and force open her mouth every time. Someone recommended using cute tooth brushes. Nothing worked to get her to cooperate as much as this one did. She absolutely adores the characters and now loves brushing her own teeth. Mommy or daddy, of course, help in the end. We still struggle sometimes, but it&#x27;s gotten a lot better. We have tried other electric brushes, but I found that this one works best. I love the on and off buttons as they don&#x27;t stick out and get in a way, and they require enough pressure to where my daughter can&#x27;t just accidentally turn it off when in use. The head is a bit large, but it still works for our 18 mo old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good,I like this.</li>
            <li> My kids love the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> my child like it very much, i will buy again, by the way ,how long need to change ?</li>
            <li> working good. much better than conventional brush</li>
            <li> this is too big for 3 years old.</li>
            <li> My 2 years old daughter loves this one, she didn&#x27;t usually let me brush her teeth, but after this one she enjoyed it. It makes it much easier to quickly brush her teeth. I defiantly recommend this for toddlers.</li>
            <li> very good as expected</li>
            <li> Bought as a birthday present for my 4 year old niece (she asked for one). She loves it! Also bought some stages toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Great for getting kids to brush longer and better.This tooth brush made brushing fun and that was the whole point.</li>
            <li> This was more for a younger child (my son is 7 years old).  It works ok, but the ad for the product was somewhat misleading and not age appropriate.</li>
            <li> 3 year old twins love!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great design and cleans my 3 yr old teeth perfectly!</li>
            <li> This is perfect, my son&#x27;s teach are so white.  I was taking pictures and noticed how white his teeth were in the photo compared to others (he is nine).  I recommend a spin brush for all children.  It helps them clean their teach well and they actually want to brush their teeth more.  Awesome.</li>
            <li> i use this to brush my dog&#x27;s teeth. it works pretty good but apparently it&#x27;s disposable since I can&#x27;t see a way to replace the battery or brush.</li>
            <li> Initially, this toothbrush worked well.  Fast, looked good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a month, the speed of the bristles dropped way off.  The slightest pressure from my 5 yo&#x27;s bite would make it stop.  (I&#x27;m operating the toothbrush)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried changing the battery, but that didn&#x27;t help.  I tried soaking it in hydrogen peroxide, which helped a little but not much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think gunk was getting into the drainage holes and clogging it up.  Or maybe the mechanism twisted, bent or stretched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I do not think this is a good value.</li>
            <li> Our pediatrician recommended for the babies teeth . He&#x27;s only 18 months old but he loves it</li>
            <li> I arrived on time and the product is perfect , only Doc ordered because it was for my daughter and sent the monster in</li>
            <li> Baby love, things very well</li>
            <li> Love the oral-b tooth brushes for the little ones. The electric toothbrushes really seem to help them get their teeth cleaner compared to regular manual toothbrushes. I also like this particular brand as we have gone through a variety  of electric tooth brushes and these by far have been the most effective.</li>
            <li> He really liked this toothbrush with the characters and the electric toothbrush but it&#x27;s hard to get it into my 2 year old&#x27;s mouth because it&#x27;s probably meant for an older child, the toothbrush head is too big.</li>
            <li> GOOD! My son likes it very much.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son for Christmas... He used it twice a day under my supervision and it only worked for 5 days... I just contacted Oral B for a replacement... My son loved it before it stopped working.</li>
            <li> IT IS GOOD,FIVE STARS</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great. My boyfriend&#x27;s 4 year-old son loves using it. It helps him get his teeth much cleaner than when using a regular brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered doc mcstuffins and received a monsters Inc toothbrush...</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fun for little ones to learn on, but honestly...it will not last you long. It has very little power and the batteries drain quickly. The bristles are easily bent and mushed by little kids inexperienced tooth brushing skills. It helps out that it&#x27;s fun looking so our toddler will be more excited to brush his teeth but it&#x27;s not something you&#x27;ll have for long.</li>
            <li> Perfect for little people.</li>
            <li> Nothing too crazy, in the way of motion and strength. Nice way to get your child to brush his/her teeth, at least mine enjoys the buzzy toothbrush more than his regular one.</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves this toothbrush always willing to brush her teeth herself even though she&#x27;s a little too young for it but I got it anyway. We love it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> My tooth very sensitive,But I used this feel better!</li>
            <li> very good but no refills admited</li>
            <li> My kids love using these tooth brushes and that makes me happy! The Monster University theme is perfect for fans of the show. The bush itself is easy for little hands to grasp, the head of the brush is made up of a round rotating brush that vibrates gently and a square non vibrating section that aids is brushing areas where the round part missed. The handle has an on and off switch made of a rubber material and a battery is included with every toothbrush so it&#x27;s ready to use right away!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain, my kids love brushing their teeth with their toothbrushes. I would buy this again and am very  happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Very good toothbrush. My 2 yrs old son loves brushing his teeth it&#x27;s fun. I wish it came with a cap.</li>
            <li> Our son loved it and brushing teeth in the morning became a pleasant 3 minute job from a non-stop crying, us begging, struggling experience. I would highly recommend it. Battery does seem to run out quickly but then again our son just keeps it on longer than he needs to.</li>
            <li> Somewhat of a battery eater, but its PERFECT for my son&#x27;s Monsters Inc fetish!&lt;br /&gt;He BEGS me to brush his teeth 5 times a day now, and besides all that excitement to brush his teeth, this toothbrush actually CLEANS well! He used to have this orangish tinge on his front two teeth that I couldn&#x27;t get to truly go away with a normal brush. After the first use with this one it was GONE! Just needed more power and circular motions to get it off I guess! Great buy!</li>
            <li> My 2, almost 3 year old loves brushing her teeth with &amp;#34;Michael&amp;#34;! We took her for her first dentist check up and he said her teeth look well maintained. We brush and floss, but before we got her a power brush, started to notice a little bit of staining on her teeth near her gums. These toothbrushes work way better than the many other baby toothbrushes we tried.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish was different would be if you could replace the brush.  My son likes to use this as a teether after he&#x27;s done &amp;#34;brushing teeth with Mike Wazowski.&amp;#34;  He wanted nothing to do with manual toothbrushes and it was a battle to brush his teeth until we found this.</li>
            <li> My toddler has been resistant to brushing her teeth since we started. She would do a poor job, and if we tried to help she would freak out and cry. Twice a day was a pretty traumatizing experience, until we found this toothbrush. She loves the monsters on it and actually does a great job brushing her teeth now. She asks first thing in the morning and runs in the bathroom to get it herself before bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve had the toothbrush for a couple months, and it still works like a charm. I wish the head was replaceable, because it will be worn down before the battery needs replacing. Other than that, the toothbrush is fantastic!</li>
            <li> My son has been more self motivated to brush! Hahaha thanks!</li>
            <li> Love it. Great item and great process.</li>
            <li> My kids liked it, but fell in love with him after brushing up!</li>
            <li> My 4yo loves this toothbrush, but the batteries ran out after only 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> These actually spin instead of just vibrate. This is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> too big, for my 2.6-y son, but works well</li>
            <li> looks very cute and my little one likes it</li>
            <li> Mother-to-be has bought lots of stuff for my unborn baby.</li>
            <li> This one is my third buy since 3 months as it was appreciated and wanted by my nephews.</li>
            <li> fun to use, tho kids might get lazy.</li>
            <li> Kid friendly size.....they like the characters. Whatever it takes to assist them in brushing their teeth. Battery has lasted quite a while.</li>
            <li> friends of my daughter like the toothbrush very much, so I bought too much.</li>
            <li> Bought one for my 3 year old and my 1 year old wanted one, so I bought him one too. He (1 year old) has no issue brushing his teeth because he loves the brush so much. Both kids like it.</li>
            <li> Works as expected the color scheme is very beautiful, will buy it again. Mi kids are very pleased and very happy</li>
            <li> Far too powerful for a young toddler. I know it&#x27;s suggested for 3+ but my 26mo is pretty advanced on a lot of things and loves to brush, so I thought, why not. My fault. Bad choice. The brush itself is 5 stars, but not for my child. She really likes my husbands electric spin brush, so I figured this would be fine, but she refuses to put this one in her mouth when it&#x27;s on. She loves Mike and Sully so she&#x27;ll use it while its off but it&#x27;s pretty big and cumbersome for her 2yo mouth. Could be great for older kids, but mine wasn&#x27;t a fan.</li>
            <li> good for our 2 year old son</li>
            <li> So, I got this because my three year old is apprehensive about brushing his teeth; I figured a Monsters toothbrush, plus it being motorized would really get him pumped about brushing ... if anything it set us back a little bit. Obviously I would say results may vary, your child might love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do, however enjoy the toothbrush (as he went back to his old ones and now I use it, haha).</li>
            <li> works fine, but the batteries were already low when we received it.</li>
            <li> Great product for the kids. Works very well</li>
            <li> Although we never had a problem getting our son to brush his teeth, he certainly enjoys doing it more with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> the kids love it, works very well and reliable</li>
            <li> My son loves this as his first electric toothbrush.  But it is such a waste of resources.  After 2 months it&#x27;s headed for the landfill since you can&#x27;t replace the head.</li>
            <li> My son thinks this is great, makes morning brushing much easier.  He fits in with mom and dad now.  Have used for about a month now and not needed to replace batteries yet. A+</li>
            <li> Huge hit with my grandson!  Makes him want to brush his teeth whenever he can!</li>
            <li> worked pretty well after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> My son loves it. Not only does he love Monsters inc but it is a power toothbrush like mine.</li>
            <li> These are great little toothbrushes, much better than some others we&#x27;ve tried. They actually spin and do a good job cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is ok - not exactly what I was hoping for, but a good brush for the toy. It is really loud when it is on, which freaks my son out a bit. He hasn&#x27;t gotten used to the noise yet, so right now, we are just using it as a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd electric toothbrush our 5 yr old has had.  The first (crayola one) was great.  Cute toothbrush, but the bristles would become rock hard  and stiff.  I&#x27;d have to try and soften them with my finger before he could brush with it. Which is gross to put your finger on. This would occur between his morning brushing and evening brushing.  We&#x27;ve had it 2 months and finally threw it away after we bough another crayola one.</li>
            <li> Great, my kids love it.&lt;br /&gt;the better way for a complete oral clean.&lt;br /&gt;makes brushing teeth a fun activity .</li>
            <li> I bought this for my three year old daughter and it works great.  It is so much easier and faster to brush her teeth.  There is also a fun factor which makes it exciting for her to use the brush.  One nice thing is that when she or I pull it out of her mouth while brushing - it doesn&#x27;t move so fast that you get toothpaste spatter on everything.  So if it comes out of her mouth and I don&#x27;t get it turned off right away, it doesn&#x27;t make a mess.  Its great.</li>
            <li> cute and easy to use !</li>
            <li> Since I got this for my 4 year old, she always look forward to brushing her teeth. Great product and quite easy to use.</li>
            <li> My 5-year-old loves the Monsters Inc. movie so he was thrilled to get this new toothbrush. We also both like how you press a button and the toothbrush brushes for him.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old loves brushing her teeth with her new Doc McStuffins toothbrush.  I like the electric toothbrushes because it adds a few more brushstrokes for kids who might not do as well with a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> We have struggled getting our 3 year old to brush his teeth until we bought this.  It ROCKS.  My wife and I both use SonicCare brushes and so I think it helps him to think that he is a big kid like mom and dad.  Plus it helps that the spinning actually cleans his teeth better than he would with a manual brush.  The battery is easy to replace... since it will get used.  I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush for the price. Deceptive marketing, though. It was labeled Monsters Inc but showed a doc McStuffins pic. There is no Doc McStuffins toothbrush in this line, though. Yes, I should have read the title more carefully but when I checked to see if there was an actual Doc McStuffins toothbrush but there was none. What I did find was a related toothpaste with the same kind of marketing--Doc McStuffins pic but a label about monsters. Seems like a burgeoning pattern. Anyway, the external feature gas no bearing in the actual quality mechanics of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is a great tooth brush for Kids. It has a nice grip and Kids love brushing with it. Even my 3 year old can use it comfortably. At this price you can&#x27;t get anything better.</li>
            <li> The Monsters power toothbrush is TOO big. Barely fits to brush the back teeth, and definitely doesn&#x27;t fit easily to brush the outside of the back molars. I can&#x27;t believe this is still in the market. I know it can take off valuable natural layers on children&#x27;s teeth, so I use this sparingly.</li>
            <li> The brush worked for about two weeks then stopped working suddenly and doesnot spin at all. Have a very disappointed toddler on my hands</li>
            <li> Got this for my grandson&#x27;s sleepovers.  He loves it and it works great.</li>
            <li> good，my daughter like it very much</li>
            <li> The title is misleading.  It says &amp;#34;Doc McStuffins Power Toothbrush&amp;#34; and all of the pictures are Doc McStuffins but they sent Monster&#x27;s Inc. My granddaughter was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is very beautiful, like children, brush my teeth are clean。</li>
            <li> great，baby like it very much!</li>
            <li> I use this product to brush my dog&#x27;s teeth.  She doesn&#x27;t mind it at all, even though it does emit a loud buzzing noise when on.  The bristles are very soft.  I pull her mouth back from her teeth, get the toothbrush in there, and the whole process of brushing her teeth takes less than three minutes.  The advantage of using the electric toothbrush over a handheld or finger toothbrush is that it&#x27;s fast, gentle, and you can reach into the crevices of her mouth easily.  There&#x27;s a simple on switch and an off switch.  It&#x27;s been working great for months, although I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s a way to replace the battery.  At this price, it&#x27;s simple enough to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and my 3 year old loves using it.</li>
            <li> I love it - waiting for my 2 year old grandson to love it too!  He&#x27;s a bit young for that feeling of putting a &amp;#34;vibrating tool&amp;#34; in his mouth...all in good time.</li>
            <li> This brush works well for our 18 month old (who loves our electric toothbrushes!) Only the top part of the toothbrush turns which is a little disappointing but overall our toddler likes it.</li>
            <li> Hair wrong design, too angry</li>
