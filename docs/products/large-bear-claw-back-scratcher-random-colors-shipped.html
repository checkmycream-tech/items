            <li>I love the fact it is a telescoping tool!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>more so I can give some away (and also have one downstairs and one upstairs!)</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and superior quality!</li>

            <li>I found this handy for storage purposes, and I think u will to.</li>
            <li>Handy item.  </li>
            <li>Almost forgot to mention how handy it is for retrieving dropped items from under the desk without a hands and knees  evolution.</li>
            <li>Nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have access to those dirt-cheap bamboo things, these are really nice.</li>
            <li>This well designed device comes in handy in the car, in the briefcase and</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re handy wherever I am in the house.</li>

            <li>we own 4</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very well made and I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice bear claw scratcher.</li>
            <li>I thought it would have Bear Claw written on the handle and would have liked it in another color.  </li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s perfect for him and highly recommends the bear claw.</li>
            <li>Best one we&#x27;ve purchased by far.</li>
            <li>Is by far the best backscratcher I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I keep thinking I&#x27;ll file it to a nice appropriate edge.  </li>
            <li>Very cheap (as in price) but well made.</li>
            <li>Love this product as the claws and very smooth and does not hurt to use.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe the price for this and plan to buy many more for stocking stuffers this season.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed using it when it was working</li>
            <li>and you need it and will love it.</li>
            <li>Quality appears to be okay.  </li>
            <li>The tines are of the perfect roundness such that they relieve itching without literally scratching you to shreds.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard cats love them also--if you happen to have cats.</li>
            <li>He loves it! :)</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>i may get one more</li>
            <li>Best of all, I no longer look like a dog lying on the carpet wiggling its back around trying to get rid of the itch.</li>
            <li>Maybe someone with longer arms might find it more efficient?  </li>
            <li>that works more efficiently on the angle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Bear Claw Back Scratcher is a wonderful solution to those itches in the unreachable spots.  </li>
            <li>, I had to order two more on 11/30.  </li>
            <li>The best back scratcher ever!</li>
            <li>I ordered two, fell in love with them and immediately ordered 3 more.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love It.  </li>
            <li>I love it and ordered three more for \\&quot;friends and family\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>fiance uses it more than i.  </li>
            <li>The $1 dollar bamboo scratchers work way better.</li>
            <li>I love the handle and the extendability of the scratcher.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll give it a try&amp;#34; and am I ever glad I did.</li>
            <li>SO much better than the bamboo ones.  </li>
            <li>This one does the job much, much better.</li>
            <li>I then bought 4 more from Amazon.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love Amazon&#x27;s no-hassle return policy.  </li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s not as satisfying a scratch as fingernails are.  </li>
            <li>Note sure what that might do to the durability of the metal finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way better than not being able to scratch a hard-to-reach</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Best back scratcher ever!  </li>
            <li>I just love it.  </li>
            <li>The claws are a nice smooth casting and I would recommend this for anyone who has an itch they can&#x27;t quite reach by hand.</li>
            <li>He even scratched me and it felt pretty good.</li>
            <li>I find these are great for persons who live alone</li>
            <li>It would be better if the handle was rubber for easy grip.</li>
            <li>While they are cheaply made from CHINA (which is why they are also cheap on Amazon) , mine have held together nicely.</li>
            <li>It can lay next to your bed or fit perfectly in your purse or suitcase</li>
            <li>What more can I say other than it works flawlessly.</li>
            <li>the best money i have spent in a long-time.</li>
            <li>the one I bought before had a more secure metal scratcher attached to the extendable.</li>
            <li>Ideal back scratcher.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely  the best back scratcher,sturdy,extends to a nice length. ...</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!! :)</li>
            <li>We are happy with the product itself at well and are thinking of purchasing more to have in other handy areas.</li>
            <li>Some other reviewers have said that theirs broke easily, but mine seems perfectly sturdy.</li>
            <li>Seems like an easy fix.  </li>
            <li>Being retractable makes it easy to store also.  </li>
            <li>Stores easily in the glove box of the car or a desk drawer.  </li>
            <li>It is still holding up strong for three months with nightly use.</li>
            <li>They seem fine, though I haven&#x27;t taken them out of the plastic sleeves yet.  </li>
            <li>Take advantage of this item because coming across a great back scratcher is not an easy task.</li>
            <li>this little backscratcher is perfect.</li>
            <li>Great back scratcher with retractable length</li>
            <li>All around fantastic.</li>
            <li>Enjoy all.</li>
            <li>Great back scratcher</li>
            <li>What a great back scratcher!  </li>
            <li>I see why it was soo cheap</li>
            <li>Cheap.  </li>
            <li>What a cheap design,</li>
            <li>but then again they were cheap</li>
            <li>Great back scratcher.  </li>
            <li>Great back scratcher</li>
            <li>All is out there is cheap junk.</li>
            <li>My 9 year old wanted one, good price.  </li>
            <li>i am of the opinion that a good back scratcher is a most for every household.  </li>
            <li>Good, but broke quite quickly in the hands of a 10 year old.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect gift since it telescopes out to a long size and can really put out the most intense itch, through clothes or sans - it works.  </li>
            <li>but it just wasn&#x27;t satisfying or effective enough.</li>
            <li>The best by far, back scratcher I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Get it great for back scratching and fun to use with pets</li>
            <li>So far this is the best back scratcher that I have purchased and believe me, I have purchased a lot!</li>
            <li>gets those hard to reach spots real good!!</li>
            <li>Really good back scratcher!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how fast it arrived :)</li>
            <li>and when you need a quick scratch....perfect</li>
            <li>Excellent - wife loves it, uses regularly for last 8 months.</li>
            <li>Not too sharp (some back scratchers can be) and fits in the basket that you keep your remotes in--which is great when your having one of those binge on netflix kind of days.</li>
            <li>Perfect for those hard to reach itches!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s were the magic is, it&#x27;s in the sharp claws, gotta love it, had to replace the original one that I bought at the 7-11 , the ole lady broke it..</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the weight &amp; quality of it, especially for the price, and have it tucked away for Father&#x27;s Day so that this year there will be SOMETHING useful &amp; unexpected for him :)</li>
            <li>This is a great little scratcher.</li>
            <li>Nice back scratcher!</li>
            <li>nice and solid, not flimsy.  </li>
            <li>the shipping took forever but worth it</li>
            <li>Works good, it performed as expected and it does the job .</li>
            <li>THIS HANDY BACK SCRATCHER!</li>
            <li>For easily accessible areas this works well but for the back ( which is where most of us need it) it doesn’t work worth beans.  </li>
            <li>This feels solid, opens easy, and fits easy in bag.</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>The rubber handle just slides right off of the product when you extend the scratcher.  </li>
            <li>If I ever lose it, I&#x27;ll go right out and get another one.</li>
            <li>Perfect back scratcher for those hard to reach places and who would have thought that it would be so cheap.</li>
            <li>Much larger than expected, very sturdy, does a wonderful job!</li>
            <li>I love it, and will probably order a few more as gifts because everyone should have this.  </li>
            <li>Then I would have to learn to do a lot more things with metal non-articulating hands and that just seems silly, so I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the handle grip has come off a few times when I&#x27;m pulling on the end to extend it, but it is otherwise perfect,</li>
            <li>The length is adjustable, which is nice, but the real reason I love this is simply that my back is not itching right now.</li>
            <li>I give them as gifts and the price is very reasonable and everyone I have given them to loves them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Nothing more to say it&#x27;s just a back scratcher</li>
            <li>It has rubberized grip that comes in favorite blue color.</li>
            <li>My FAVORITE back scratcher.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Love the back scratcher!</li>
            <li>Wooden ones work much better.</li>
            <li>I wanted to, initially, buy him a more fancy one but after reading the reviews I went with this one.</li>
            <li>They work well and seem to be pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>They won&#x27;t cut you but they will sure scratch your back.</li>
            <li>They love this back scratcher.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Performs exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>The handle is grippy and it works very well!</li>
            <li>I love using this when I have itch on my back and my fianc&amp;eacute; is not around to save me.</li>
            <li>but you need a powerful and strong back scratcher to take care of itch.</li>
            <li>The back scratcher I received is extremely well made, and works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I use my back scratcher daily, and bear claw holds up pretty good with all the miles I use it.</li>
            <li>I will never regret buying this, in fact, I got two of different colors so that I have one and a present for someone in particular because they&#x27;re very handy at getting those spots you can&#x27;t quite reach yourself.</li>
            <li>This one fit the bill, except the &amp;#34;claws&amp;#34; set out barely 1/2&amp;#34;, which&lt;br /&gt;means</li>
            <li>that scratch are rounded off enough and smoothly finished enough not to do damage to skin, but provide a satisfyingly brisk scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the blue handle makes it easy to locate in a pile of stuff.</li>
            <li>Extension works well making a good, long back scratcher.</li>
            <li>Large??</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s fine, but not as pictures and NOT the same as the ones you can purchase here.</li>
            <li>Took forever to arrive but for the price it is a nice little item.</li>
            <li>so well I won&#x27;t have to push as hard to get a good scratch.</li>
            <li>When you really got the bear back scratch, you do not need a cheap toy</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>ready to scratch, when needed..</li>
            <li>very inexpensive</li>
            <li>It was delivered when promised and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Very durable, seems well made.</li>
            <li>This one swivels too much and when you need it to be on target</li>
            <li>He loves it and wants another one to take to work.</li>
            <li>Thanks, guys.</li>
            <li>REALLY</li>
            <li>It works and it&#x27;s very stable.  </li>
            <li>AND it is very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>It scratches really well.</li>
            <li>This one does the job though at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>really like this.</li>
            <li>With the telescoping handle I can keep it in the pencil cup on my desk and have it ready whenever I need it.  </li>
            <li>but I do have one problem with it my kids like it so much that they took it over</li>
            <li>but this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>This is the Real Deal.</li>
            <li>for some reason she REALLY liked the wood of that scratcher, not chewing anything else in the house but all but destroying it.  </li>
            <li>I only bought 6 of these - come in handy for back itches and reaching things ...great for Christmas stocking stuffers for adults as well</li>
            <li>WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>Most back scratchers do not have have a sharp enough edge to be effective.</li>
            <li>But other than that the product was ok and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Amazing little scratcher!</li>
            <li>im always needing my back scratched, found these little handy back scratchers online, ordered and glad i did.  </li>
            <li>They are great due to being able to extend out to get at the hard to reach back area.  </li>
            <li>I know the picture looks like a full size back scratcher but its not, it pulls out in to a full size back scratcher.</li>
            <li>This is reasonably priced and considering the fact that this is delivered from Asia, it arrived in few days and the product was intact: Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Scratching with my fingernails (which I&#x27;ve done plenty of) always just made my skin more irritated, and the wood and bamboo back scratchers that I&#x27;ve tried did the same.</li>
            <li>Works better than the standard wood back scratcher.</li>
            <li>This one telescopes which is the main reason I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>received this product a few weeks ago, and as of right now, I consider it some of the best few bucks I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
            <li>Would be better if there was a little curvature to it</li>
            <li>, the telescoping handle is study and has not collapsed in on itself, and this works much better than the old wooden spoon I was keeping in my desk drawer to help with my itchy back, which was creepy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for at least a month now and am as pleased today as the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>so I am sure I will use this heavily, and I will update this review with any new information gleamed.</li>
            <li>The claw is strong and reaches the entire back</li>
            <li>The price was right, so I purchased two of these back scratchers.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a stocking stuffer for a certain someone who always wants their back scratched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I lay in bed most nights and just drag this along my back.</li>
            <li>My other one has a BLUE handle and is a more flimsy material with NO logo on it.</li>
            <li>Product is exactly as described and arrived weeks earlier than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and small enough to be easily transportable!  </li>
            <li>It was pretty much what I expected.  </li>
            <li>When it is extended there is considerable wobble and it is easy to see that it will break with any amount of heavy scratching.</li>
            <li>I bought two of these and then came back for two more - so we have these scattered around the house in the family room, office, bedroom, etc., Sturdy little tool</li>
            <li>hard to say much, when it works it works I have an order for cough drops, drops were cheap enough but shiping very high.</li>
            <li>This little hing is great and after a few months of daily use, it is still holding up.</li>
            <li>These were the clear winner.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband who ALWAYS wants his back scratched.  </li>
            <li>Try one for yourself; you will not believe how much your back needs to be scratched.</li>
            <li>Far from.</li>
            <li>Love them I have at least seven all around the house &amp; car</li>
            <li>extends with soft handle.  </li>
            <li>use it frequently.  </li>
            <li>I also use it to get things far from reach</li>
            <li>I got the brown one because it was the cheapest and who really cares about the color of their back scratcher.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scratcher part is plastic but has held up well so far.</li>
            <li>Not too sharp and not too dull - good back scratcher for the price&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is large, strong, well built and it scratches so hard that you must be careful not to cut yourself!</li>
            <li>fantastic for those hard to reach spots.</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s actually small enough to fit in a purse.</li>
            <li>So far he&#x27;s had it for several months</li>
            <li>The claws are sturdy enough that it easily stands up to me going to town on those hard to pinpoint itchy areas.</li>
            <li>size is very portable (though mine stays in my desk drawer at work), and the telescoping extension if long enough to reach any part of my back.  </li>
            <li>The handle smells strongly of rubber though which is not pleasant.</li>
            <li>A little right, left etc!</li>
            <li>This is not sharp enough to scratch anything.</li>
            <li>cheap price and not a good design</li>
            <li>Just when I was ready to file the edges down I bought one of these from my daughter&#x27;s fund raiser.</li>
            <li>It arrived promptly and is easy to store due to the small size.</li>
            <li>so your arm doesn&#x27;t have to be stretched back so far.</li>
            <li>While the claw works well at scratching, the handle is not long enough!  </li>
            <li>I have dry skin on my back and it frequently itches.</li>
            <li>This back scratcher extends pretty far and the claw part isn&#x27;t sharp or anything, not sure what else to say as far as back scratcher praise.</li>

            <li> Well made item with a good extension in the handle.  </li>

            <li> I love the fact it is a telescoping tool!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> more so I can give some away (and also have one downstairs and one upstairs!)</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and superior quality!</li>
            <li> Now I can carry an effective backscratcher with me in my purse, and never have to discretely rub up against a cubicle corner like a bear.  </li>
            <li> I found this handy for storage purposes, and I think u will to.</li>
            <li> Handy item.  </li>
            <li> Almost forgot to mention how handy it is for retrieving dropped items from under the desk without a hands and knees  evolution.</li>
            <li> Nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have access to those dirt-cheap bamboo things, these are really nice.</li>
            <li> This well designed device comes in handy in the car, in the briefcase and</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re handy wherever I am in the house.</li>
            <li> I would have liked to have chosen my own.</li>
            <li> keep it handy in my purse.</li>
            <li> we own 4</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very well made and I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice bear claw scratcher.</li>
            <li> I thought it would have Bear Claw written on the handle and would have liked it in another color.  </li>
            <li> He says it&#x27;s perfect for him and highly recommends the bear claw.</li>
            <li> Best one we&#x27;ve purchased by far.</li>
            <li> Is by far the best backscratcher I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I keep thinking I&#x27;ll file it to a nice appropriate edge.  </li>
            <li> Very cheap (as in price) but well made.</li>
            <li> Love this product as the claws and very smooth and does not hurt to use.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the price for this and plan to buy many more for stocking stuffers this season.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed using it when it was working</li>
            <li> and you need it and will love it.</li>
            <li> Quality appears to be okay.  </li>
            <li> The tines are of the perfect roundness such that they relieve itching without literally scratching you to shreds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard cats love them also--if you happen to have cats.</li>
            <li> He loves it! :)</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> i may get one more</li>
            <li> Best of all, I no longer look like a dog lying on the carpet wiggling its back around trying to get rid of the itch.</li>
            <li> Maybe someone with longer arms might find it more efficient?  </li>
            <li> that works more efficiently on the angle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Bear Claw Back Scratcher is a wonderful solution to those itches in the unreachable spots.  </li>
            <li> , I had to order two more on 11/30.  </li>
            <li> The best back scratcher ever!</li>
            <li> I ordered two, fell in love with them and immediately ordered 3 more.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love It.  </li>
            <li> I love it and ordered three more for \\&quot;friends and family\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> fiance uses it more than i.  </li>
            <li> The $1 dollar bamboo scratchers work way better.</li>
            <li> I love the handle and the extendability of the scratcher.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll give it a try&amp;#34; and am I ever glad I did.</li>
            <li> SO much better than the bamboo ones.  </li>
            <li> This one does the job much, much better.</li>
            <li> I then bought 4 more from Amazon.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Love Amazon&#x27;s no-hassle return policy.  </li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s not as satisfying a scratch as fingernails are.  </li>
            <li> Note sure what that might do to the durability of the metal finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way better than not being able to scratch a hard-to-reach</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Best back scratcher ever!  </li>
            <li> I just love it.  </li>
            <li> The claws are a nice smooth casting and I would recommend this for anyone who has an itch they can&#x27;t quite reach by hand.</li>
            <li> He even scratched me and it felt pretty good.</li>
            <li> I find these are great for persons who live alone</li>
            <li> It would be better if the handle was rubber for easy grip.</li>
            <li> While they are cheaply made from CHINA (which is why they are also cheap on Amazon) , mine have held together nicely.</li>
            <li> It can lay next to your bed or fit perfectly in your purse or suitcase</li>
            <li> What more can I say other than it works flawlessly.</li>
            <li> the best money i have spent in a long-time.</li>
            <li> the one I bought before had a more secure metal scratcher attached to the extendable.</li>
            <li> Ideal back scratcher.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely  the best back scratcher,sturdy,extends to a nice length. ...</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!! :)</li>
            <li> We are happy with the product itself at well and are thinking of purchasing more to have in other handy areas.</li>
            <li> Some other reviewers have said that theirs broke easily, but mine seems perfectly sturdy.</li>
            <li> Seems like an easy fix.  </li>
            <li> Being retractable makes it easy to store also.  </li>
            <li> Stores easily in the glove box of the car or a desk drawer.  </li>
            <li> It is still holding up strong for three months with nightly use.</li>
            <li> They seem fine, though I haven&#x27;t taken them out of the plastic sleeves yet.  </li>
            <li> Take advantage of this item because coming across a great back scratcher is not an easy task.</li>
            <li> this little backscratcher is perfect.</li>
            <li> Great back scratcher with retractable length</li>
            <li> All around fantastic.</li>
            <li> Enjoy all.</li>
            <li> Great back scratcher</li>
            <li> What a great back scratcher!  </li>
            <li> I see why it was soo cheap</li>
            <li> Cheap.  </li>
            <li> What a cheap design,</li>
            <li> but then again they were cheap</li>
            <li> Great back scratcher.  </li>
            <li> Great back scratcher</li>
            <li> All is out there is cheap junk.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old wanted one, good price.  </li>
            <li> i am of the opinion that a good back scratcher is a most for every household.  </li>
            <li> Good, but broke quite quickly in the hands of a 10 year old.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect gift since it telescopes out to a long size and can really put out the most intense itch, through clothes or sans - it works.  </li>
            <li> but it just wasn&#x27;t satisfying or effective enough.</li>
            <li> The best by far, back scratcher I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Get it great for back scratching and fun to use with pets</li>
            <li> So far this is the best back scratcher that I have purchased and believe me, I have purchased a lot!</li>
            <li> gets those hard to reach spots real good!!</li>
            <li> Really good back scratcher!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fast it arrived :)</li>
            <li> and when you need a quick scratch....perfect</li>
            <li> Excellent - wife loves it, uses regularly for last 8 months.</li>
            <li> Not too sharp (some back scratchers can be) and fits in the basket that you keep your remotes in--which is great when your having one of those binge on netflix kind of days.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those hard to reach itches!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s were the magic is, it&#x27;s in the sharp claws, gotta love it, had to replace the original one that I bought at the 7-11 , the ole lady broke it..</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the weight &amp; quality of it, especially for the price, and have it tucked away for Father&#x27;s Day so that this year there will be SOMETHING useful &amp; unexpected for him :)</li>
            <li> This is a great little scratcher.</li>
            <li> Nice back scratcher!</li>
            <li> nice and solid, not flimsy.  </li>
            <li> the shipping took forever but worth it</li>
            <li> Works good, it performed as expected and it does the job .</li>
            <li> THIS HANDY BACK SCRATCHER!</li>
            <li> For easily accessible areas this works well but for the back ( which is where most of us need it) it doesn’t work worth beans.  </li>
            <li> This feels solid, opens easy, and fits easy in bag.</li>
            <li> just right.  </li>
            <li> The rubber handle just slides right off of the product when you extend the scratcher.  </li>
            <li> If I ever lose it, I&#x27;ll go right out and get another one.</li>
            <li> Perfect back scratcher for those hard to reach places and who would have thought that it would be so cheap.</li>
            <li> Much larger than expected, very sturdy, does a wonderful job!</li>
            <li> I love it, and will probably order a few more as gifts because everyone should have this.  </li>
            <li> Then I would have to learn to do a lot more things with metal non-articulating hands and that just seems silly, so I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the handle grip has come off a few times when I&#x27;m pulling on the end to extend it, but it is otherwise perfect,</li>
            <li> The length is adjustable, which is nice, but the real reason I love this is simply that my back is not itching right now.</li>
            <li> I give them as gifts and the price is very reasonable and everyone I have given them to loves them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Nothing more to say it&#x27;s just a back scratcher</li>
            <li> It has rubberized grip that comes in favorite blue color.</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE back scratcher.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love the back scratcher!</li>
            <li> Wooden ones work much better.</li>
            <li> I wanted to, initially, buy him a more fancy one but after reading the reviews I went with this one.</li>
            <li> They work well and seem to be pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t cut you but they will sure scratch your back.</li>
            <li> They love this back scratcher.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Performs exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> The handle is grippy and it works very well!</li>
            <li> I love using this when I have itch on my back and my fianc&amp;eacute; is not around to save me.</li>
            <li> but you need a powerful and strong back scratcher to take care of itch.</li>
            <li> The back scratcher I received is extremely well made, and works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I use my back scratcher daily, and bear claw holds up pretty good with all the miles I use it.</li>
            <li> I will never regret buying this, in fact, I got two of different colors so that I have one and a present for someone in particular because they&#x27;re very handy at getting those spots you can&#x27;t quite reach yourself.</li>
            <li> This one fit the bill, except the &amp;#34;claws&amp;#34; set out barely 1/2&amp;#34;, which&lt;br /&gt;means</li>
            <li> that scratch are rounded off enough and smoothly finished enough not to do damage to skin, but provide a satisfyingly brisk scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the blue handle makes it easy to locate in a pile of stuff.</li>
            <li> Extension works well making a good, long back scratcher.</li>
            <li> Large??</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s fine, but not as pictures and NOT the same as the ones you can purchase here.</li>
            <li> Took forever to arrive but for the price it is a nice little item.</li>
            <li> so well I won&#x27;t have to push as hard to get a good scratch.</li>
            <li> When you really got the bear back scratch, you do not need a cheap toy</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> ready to scratch, when needed..</li>
            <li> very inexpensive</li>
            <li> It was delivered when promised and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Very durable, seems well made.</li>
            <li> This one swivels too much and when you need it to be on target</li>
            <li> He loves it and wants another one to take to work.</li>
            <li> Thanks, guys.</li>
            <li> REALLY</li>
            <li> It works and it&#x27;s very stable.  </li>
            <li> AND it is very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> It scratches really well.</li>
            <li> This one does the job though at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> really like this.</li>
            <li> With the telescoping handle I can keep it in the pencil cup on my desk and have it ready whenever I need it.  </li>
            <li> but I do have one problem with it my kids like it so much that they took it over</li>
            <li> but this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> This is the Real Deal.</li>
            <li> for some reason she REALLY liked the wood of that scratcher, not chewing anything else in the house but all but destroying it.  </li>
            <li> I only bought 6 of these - come in handy for back itches and reaching things ...great for Christmas stocking stuffers for adults as well</li>
            <li> WOW!!!  </li>
            <li> Most back scratchers do not have have a sharp enough edge to be effective.</li>
            <li> But other than that the product was ok and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Amazing little scratcher!</li>
            <li> im always needing my back scratched, found these little handy back scratchers online, ordered and glad i did.  </li>
            <li> They are great due to being able to extend out to get at the hard to reach back area.  </li>
            <li> I know the picture looks like a full size back scratcher but its not, it pulls out in to a full size back scratcher.</li>
            <li> This is reasonably priced and considering the fact that this is delivered from Asia, it arrived in few days and the product was intact: Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Scratching with my fingernails (which I&#x27;ve done plenty of) always just made my skin more irritated, and the wood and bamboo back scratchers that I&#x27;ve tried did the same.</li>
            <li> Works better than the standard wood back scratcher.</li>
            <li> This one telescopes which is the main reason I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> received this product a few weeks ago, and as of right now, I consider it some of the best few bucks I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
            <li> Would be better if there was a little curvature to it</li>
            <li> , the telescoping handle is study and has not collapsed in on itself, and this works much better than the old wooden spoon I was keeping in my desk drawer to help with my itchy back, which was creepy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for at least a month now and am as pleased today as the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> so I am sure I will use this heavily, and I will update this review with any new information gleamed.</li>
            <li> The claw is strong and reaches the entire back</li>
            <li> The price was right, so I purchased two of these back scratchers.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a stocking stuffer for a certain someone who always wants their back scratched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I lay in bed most nights and just drag this along my back.</li>
            <li> My other one has a BLUE handle and is a more flimsy material with NO logo on it.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as described and arrived weeks earlier than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and small enough to be easily transportable!  </li>
            <li> It was pretty much what I expected.  </li>
            <li> When it is extended there is considerable wobble and it is easy to see that it will break with any amount of heavy scratching.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these and then came back for two more - so we have these scattered around the house in the family room, office, bedroom, etc., Sturdy little tool</li>
            <li> hard to say much, when it works it works I have an order for cough drops, drops were cheap enough but shiping very high.</li>
            <li> This little hing is great and after a few months of daily use, it is still holding up.</li>
            <li> These were the clear winner.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who ALWAYS wants his back scratched.  </li>
            <li> Try one for yourself; you will not believe how much your back needs to be scratched.</li>
            <li> Far from.</li>
            <li> Love them I have at least seven all around the house &amp; car</li>
            <li> extends with soft handle.  </li>
            <li> use it frequently.  </li>
            <li> I also use it to get things far from reach</li>
            <li> I got the brown one because it was the cheapest and who really cares about the color of their back scratcher.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scratcher part is plastic but has held up well so far.</li>
            <li> Not too sharp and not too dull - good back scratcher for the price&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is large, strong, well built and it scratches so hard that you must be careful not to cut yourself!</li>
            <li> fantastic for those hard to reach spots.</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s actually small enough to fit in a purse.</li>
            <li> So far he&#x27;s had it for several months</li>
            <li> The claws are sturdy enough that it easily stands up to me going to town on those hard to pinpoint itchy areas.</li>
            <li> size is very portable (though mine stays in my desk drawer at work), and the telescoping extension if long enough to reach any part of my back.  </li>
            <li> The handle smells strongly of rubber though which is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> A little right, left etc!</li>
            <li> This is not sharp enough to scratch anything.</li>
            <li> cheap price and not a good design</li>
            <li> Just when I was ready to file the edges down I bought one of these from my daughter&#x27;s fund raiser.</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly and is easy to store due to the small size.</li>
            <li> so your arm doesn&#x27;t have to be stretched back so far.</li>
            <li> While the claw works well at scratching, the handle is not long enough!  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin on my back and it frequently itches.</li>
            <li> This back scratcher extends pretty far and the claw part isn&#x27;t sharp or anything, not sure what else to say as far as back scratcher praise.</li>
            <li> The handle telescopes, so it is small enough to carry in a pocket or purse and it really hits the spot.  </li>
            <li> Jury is still out on how long it will last.</li>
            <li> However, this is a nice item, albeit a little expensive for a backscratcher.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin and quite often my back gets itchy, in spite of applying skin lotion every day.</li>
            <li> He was always saying his back was dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li> Its wide enough that it doesn&#x27;t flip when you put enough pressure on it to scratch your itch.</li>
            <li> The claws aren’t long enough nor angled enough to actually scratch past the shoulder area so is your itch is in the middle of your back, forget it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about getting older, but my back itches all the time, and my arms are not flexible enough to reach behind my back.</li>
            <li> and so is my lonely back scratcher.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a back scratcher, as expected.  </li>
            <li> Does not really scratch your back well.</li>
            <li> It has a long reach</li>
            <li> Shipping takes a long time however.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> It alleviates itch, but isn&#x27;t extra sharp.</li>
            <li> Unlike other telescopic back scratchers, this one remains sturdy even when fully extended.</li>
            <li> The little fingers are sharp, but not sharp enough to do any damage.  </li>
            <li> It will save you money in testing other back scratchers.</li>
            <li> You need a solid metal and a sharp scratcher.</li>
            <li> Not high quality.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my neighbor who complained that the ususal back scratchers are too short to reach the itch.</li>
            <li> Will be careful.</li>
            <li> I got this expandable back scratcher for my hunny because his heavy wood one got chewed repeatedly when we got a puppy...</li>
            <li> I bought one a few years ago at a local Menards, and mine does have the logo on it.  </li>
            <li> I initially bought this for a christmas present (I&#x27;m so tired of watching my husband scratch his back on the corner of the wall)</li>
            <li> I have atopic dermatitus and have spent years of my life itching.</li>
            <li> I scratch harder and harder trying to get them to work but to no avail.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s only been a few weeks</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;prongs&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; are not sharp but dull either.</li>
            <li> Small enough to carry in my purse.</li>
            <li> He loves that it extends and that it has semi sharp claws.</li>
            <li> Not the one to get if you have issues with arthritis or other mobility conditions.</li>
            <li> I purchased it because my other backscratcher broke.</li>
            <li> other than that, it&#x27;s still usable.</li>
            <li> I had ill founded worries that the metal extension would retract under pressure when scratching my back, but it&#x27;s turn out to be sturdy and solidly built back scratcher.</li>
            <li> Thinly built large claw to scratch hard, heavy handle to last and</li>
            <li> Compact to take up the least amount of space - telescopes to reach those pesky itchy corners of my back.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.  </li>
            <li> I had to file down two of the paws.  </li>
            <li> A little too sharp to use.  </li>
            <li> Only problem is that the telescoping want has the bad habit of un-extending (shortening) when I use it at a certain angle.</li>
            <li> Regarding the handle material - One of mine has a BLACK handle which appears to be substantial and it has the &amp;#34;Bear Claw&amp;#34; logo written on it.</li>
            <li> Got for husband Christmas gift he loves it uses it all the time half to save so</li>
            <li> Does your back itch ALL THE TIME, especially during the dry and cold winter months?</li>
            <li> Does it almost seem as if some voodoo curse has made it so that the hardest area to reach of your entire body is the one most afflicted by this terrible itch?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they were all black.  </li>
            <li> I received 4 black handled scratchers, which by the way were non logo&#x27;d.</li>
            <li> The one they sent me has a black handle.</li>
            <li> It extends out to reach farther with less effort.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The little \\&quot;fingers\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is not your flimsy scope scratcher that breaks after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> Broke after a few uses.</li>
            <li> These did not have the Bear Claw name, nor were they as heavy.</li>
            <li> Bought for husband&#x27;s birthday  he uses it everyday .</li>
            <li> Handle broke after a few uses.</li>
            <li> During the winter it is really bad and right now, it is winter.</li>
            <li> I like a hard scratcher for serious bear back scratching!</li>
            <li> It just plain works.</li>
            <li> A little sharp, but I like that!!!</li>
            <li> wanted multi-colors and received all the same color - BLACK - disappointed that each one was not a different color</li>
            <li> In The Sun and this little scratchier does the job!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a separate piece that is attached, but I&#x27;m not sure how.  </li>
            <li> and he enjoys it everyday!</li>
            <li> I assumed &#x27;random colors&#x27; meant they would be different colors.  </li>
            <li> I have two of them and have not experienced any of the misfortunes some of the other purchasers have had.</li>
            <li> Got this as a present for my son-in-law, who has a terrible problem with dry skin on his back.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the measly $4.00 I spent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it this: dull or not,</li>
            <li> Of all available, we got brown - boring.</li>
            <li> The only thing I am disappointed with is that the Bear Claw logo is not imprinted on them.  </li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband who is really tough on anything, shoes, boots, backscrather, anything.</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 of these with the thought that as random colors with an order for 4 I would get one of each shown color or at least some variety.</li>
            <li> and I do mean EVERYTHING!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Warning, might cause excessive use!!!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll never find yourself unable to scratch a spot you need to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They will reach all those difficult areas.</li>
            <li> The back is the worst because I just can&#x27;t reach where it itches.</li>
            <li> Sadly, as soon as I extended the handle, the claw fell off the handle.  </li>
            <li> I was really disappointed as I took the bear claw out of the box to find the &amp;#34;claws&amp;#34; broken it had no use</li>
            <li> hits the spot, to bad</li>
            <li> Too bad we couldn&#x27;t pick out the color.  </li>
            <li> This scratcher is awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Great back scratcher with retractable length so you can reach any spot on your body that itches.  Sturdy wood handle and metal scratcher look like they will last.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the price for this and plan to buy many more for stocking stuffers this season.  Buy several, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> the best money i have spent in a long-time.</li>
            <li> Almost would give it 4 stars but they need to make the claw screw on and not crimped on.  Seems like an easy fix.  Maybe I should design one and sell this and I&#x27;m just an IT guy. LOL.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these and then came back for two more - so we have these scattered around the house in the family room, office, bedroom, etc., Sturdy little tool and it does the job. We use multiple times every day.</li>
            <li> Nice back scratcher! Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s were the magic is, it&#x27;s in the sharp claws, gotta love it, had to replace the original one that I bought at the 7-11 , the ole lady broke it..The adjustable settings is the icing on the cake..ready to scratch, when needed..hits the spot, to bad it wasn&#x27;t double claw, sometimes I use the back of it accidentally ..</li>
            <li> Bought for the husband, he loves it and so do the kids - plus it gets me out of having to do all the back-scratching!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using it when it was working it was great but mine fell apart. may have just got a lemon</li>
            <li> Not too sharp and not too dull - good back scratcher for the price&lt;br /&gt;Nothing more to say it&#x27;s just a back scratcher</li>
            <li> Took forever to arrive but for the price it is a nice little item. I have two of them and have not experienced any of the misfortunes some of the other purchasers have had. While they are cheaply made from CHINA (which is why they are also cheap on Amazon) , mine have held together nicely. Regarding the handle material - One of mine has a BLACK handle which appears to be substantial and it has the &amp;#34;Bear Claw&amp;#34; logo written on it. My other one has a BLUE handle and is a more flimsy material with NO logo on it.</li>
            <li> This is not sharp enough to scratch anything.</li>
            <li> fantastic for those hard to reach spots. nice and solid, not flimsy.  very inexpensive and you need it and will love it.</li>
            <li> It was delivered when promised and it works very well. Small enough to carry in my purse.</li>
            <li> This is a great little scratcher. Being retractable makes it easy to store also.  A Great value for the price and I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who ALWAYS wants his back scratched.  We both loved it!! Its wide enough that it doesn&#x27;t flip when you put enough pressure on it to scratch your itch. Its well made too.  Best one we&#x27;ve purchased by far.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and quite often my back gets itchy, in spite of applying skin lotion every day. I have three of these; one in my car, one in my office and another one in my living room. The claw size (L, H, W) is 1.64\\&quot;X1.75\\&quot;X0.5\\&quot; and this metal back scratcher elongates from 8 1/4\\&quot;L to 23\\&quot;L to relieve my itchy back. It has rubberized grip that comes in favorite blue color. This is reasonably priced and considering the fact that this is delivered from Asia, it arrived in few days and the product was intact: Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a back scratcher, as expected.  My 9 year old wanted one, good price.  Too bad we couldn&#x27;t pick out the color.  Of all available, we got brown - boring.</li>
            <li> My dogs can not get enough of these and I like them as well. Try one for yourself; you will not believe how much your back needs to be scratched.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, well made, and gets the job done.  I love it, and will probably order a few more as gifts because everyone should have this.  Personally, I can&#x27;t stand it if my back gets itchy during my work day.  Now I can carry an effective backscratcher with me in my purse, and never have to discretely rub up against a cubicle corner like a bear.  *whew*</li>
            <li> Very durable, seems well made. Bought it for my husband who is really tough on anything, shoes, boots, backscrather, anything. So far he&#x27;s had it for several months and it&#x27;s held up. Very cheap (as in price) but well made. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this back scratcher. He uses it all the time. He even throws it in his briefcase and uses it at work. He loves that it extends and that it has semi sharp claws.</li>
            <li> Absolutely  the best back scratcher,sturdy,extends to a nice length. ...the shipping took forever but worth it</li>
            <li> Bought these and some wooden ones. These were the clear winner. A little sharp, but I like that!!!</li>
            <li> Seems to work good. Read concerns about the telescoping arm breaking. Will be careful.</li>
            <li> My family loves the bear claw I have even got them in our cars. The size is perfect to even put in your bag.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Quality appears to be okay.  Wish the actual claw was screwed in.  It&#x27;s a separate piece that is attached, but I&#x27;m not sure how.  Not high quality.  Jury is still out on how long it will last.</li>
            <li> I can reach the unreachable point in the middle of my back with it. Would be better if there was a little curvature to it so your arm doesn&#x27;t have to be stretched back so far. Not the one to get if you have issues with arthritis or other mobility conditions.</li>
            <li> I will never regret buying this, in fact, I got two of different colors so that I have one and a present for someone in particular because they&#x27;re very handy at getting those spots you can&#x27;t quite reach yourself.</li>
            <li> Scratches those areas us not-so-flexible people can&#x27;t reach. I got this for my partner who always seems to get an itch on her back. Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Amazing little scratcher!</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE back scratcher. I lay in bed most nights and just drag this along my back. It alleviates itch, but isn&#x27;t extra sharp.</li>
            <li> the one I bought before had a more secure metal scratcher attached to the extendable.This one swivels too much and when you need it to be on target it moves on ya.. THE MAKER NEEDS TO FIX THIS FLAW</li>
            <li> Literally feels like fingernails on your back. Is by far the best backscratcher I&#x27;ve ever used. And it folds up neatly to go in a drawer. All around fantastic.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband.  It&#x27;s perfect!  It extends and can get to wherever he needs.  I see no problems.  Now I don&#x27;t have to scratch his back which always goes. ....  A little right, left etc!</li>
            <li> Love them best thing I ever got for friends</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about getting older, but my back itches all the time, and my arms are not flexible enough to reach behind my back. Because I did not want to resort to asking strangers to scratch my back for me, I bought this. I like it because I can keep it in my purse, the telescoping handle is study and has not collapsed in on itself, and this works much better than the old wooden spoon I was keeping in my desk drawer to help with my itchy back, which was creepy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this back scratcher.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s adjustable and works well. It arrived promptly and is easy to store due to the small size. A great product!</li>
            <li> Great! Unlike other telescopic back scratchers, this one remains sturdy even when fully extended. The tines are of the perfect roundness such that they relieve itching without literally scratching you to shreds. I&#x27;ve heard cats love them also--if you happen to have cats.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy! Came way quicker than estimated to St. Paul, MN. Thanks! It was a gift for my coworker/friend...He loves it! :)</li>
            <li> this little backscratcher is perfect. It can lay next to your bed or fit perfectly in your purse or suitcase</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as described and arrived weeks earlier than I thought it would. They shipped it out within days of getting the order. Love the back scratcher! it works great.</li>
            <li> I only gave this 4 stars because it took 2 weeks for the item to be delivered. But other than that the product was ok and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I know the picture looks like a full size back scratcher but its not, it pulls out in to a full size back scratcher. I found this handy for storage purposes, and I think u will to. Reilly nice product!</li>
            <li> I got this expandable back scratcher for my hunny because his heavy wood one got chewed repeatedly when we got a puppy...for some reason she REALLY liked the wood of that scratcher, not chewing anything else in the house but all but destroying it.  I am very pleased with the weight &amp; quality of it, especially for the price, and have it tucked away for Father&#x27;s Day so that this year there will be SOMETHING useful &amp; unexpected for him :)</li>
            <li> Got for husband Christmas gift he loves it uses it all the time half to save so can get another one</li>
            <li> I purchased it from Island In The Sun and this little scratchier does the job!  It is very lightweight and small enough to be easily transportable!  I can carry it in my purse when traveling.  The retracting extending handle is an added plus.  to reach &amp;#34;that spot&amp;#34;.  I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Love it i may get one more</li>
            <li> Perfect for those hard to reach itches! This is my second one. I have one in my night stand drawer and I needed one for my family room! Stop the itch with the claw!</li>
            <li> Light-weight and compact, this scratcher is just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as a gag gift because his back always itches. He loves it and wants another one to take to work. It is still holding up strong for three months with nightly use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my neighbor who complained that the ususal back scratchers are too short to reach the itch. He loves it!  He says it&#x27;s perfect for him and highly recommends the bear claw.</li>
            <li> What more can I say other than it works flawlessly. The claws are sturdy enough that it easily stands up to me going to town on those hard to pinpoint itchy areas. Best of all, I no longer look like a dog lying on the carpet wiggling its back around trying to get rid of the itch.</li>
            <li> Does your back itch ALL THE TIME, especially during the dry and cold winter months? Does it almost seem as if some voodoo curse has made it so that the hardest area to reach of your entire body is the one most afflicted by this terrible itch?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, me too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product a few weeks ago, and as of right now, I consider it some of the best few bucks I&#x27;ve ever spent. The length is adjustable, which is nice, but the real reason I love this is simply that my back is not itching right now. Scratching with my fingernails (which I&#x27;ve done plenty of) always just made my skin more irritated, and the wood and bamboo back scratchers that I&#x27;ve tried did the same. This is an item that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all - It just plain works. Some other reviewers have said that theirs broke easily, but mine seems perfectly sturdy. If you&#x27;re as fed up with your itchy back as I&#x27;ve been, buy it!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a long-lasting (metal) back scratcher.  This one fit the bill, except the &amp;#34;claws&amp;#34; set out barely 1/2&amp;#34;, which&lt;br /&gt;means as you hang the rod over your back, the angle prevents the claws fully getting to the back.  Maybe someone with longer arms might find it more efficient?  (I have a wooden one that extends its claws apx. 3/4&amp;#34; &amp; that works more efficiently on the angle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needs redesigning.</li>
            <li> Love this product as the claws and very smooth and does not hurt to use.  They are great due to being able to extend out to get at the hard to reach back area.  I give them as gifts and the price is very reasonable and everyone I have given them to loves them.  They make great stocking stuffers at Christmas regardless of the age of the person receiving it.</li>
            <li> The Bear Claw Back Scratcher is a wonderful solution to those itches in the unreachable spots.  The handle telescopes, so it is small enough to carry in a pocket or purse and it really hits the spot.  I bought two of these so I can always have one packed in my suitcase and also have one at home.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. It would be better if the handle was rubber for easy grip.</li>
            <li> Beats trying to rub away the itch on some doorway!  Handy item.  Stores easily in the glove box of the car or a desk drawer.  Blessed relief from the itch that can&#x27;t be reached with your fingers.  Almost forgot to mention how handy it is for retrieving dropped items from under the desk without a hands and knees  evolution.</li>
            <li> Works better than the standard wood back scratcher.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend. He was always saying his back was dry and itchy.  Sometimes I would catch him rubbing his back in doors ways to get relief.  Or he would ask for me to scratch for him.  A co-worker recommended this so I put it in the cart and awaited it arrival eagerly.  My boyfriend loved it.  Even takes it to work with him!</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed as I took the bear claw out of the box to find the &amp;#34;claws&amp;#34; broken it had no use</li>
            <li> I had a coworker get one of these things for christmas, I of course laughed until I had a scratch I just couldn&#x27;t itch...ha...well in all honesty I could but it just wasn&#x27;t satisfying or effective enough. So I ordered me up one and couldnt have been happier. It now resides in my pencil holder on my work desk and lives there, ever reminding me that I could with just another purchase replace my ineffective scratching hands with these wonder scratchers! Then I would have to learn to do a lot more things with metal non-articulating hands and that just seems silly, so I&#x27;m happy and so is my lonely back scratcher. Enjoy all.</li>
            <li> These scratchers are great and because of the extendable handle, you can easily scratch all of those hard-to-reach itchy spots!!!</li>
            <li> Large?? Far from. It&#x27;ll work, but not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Perfect back scratcher for those hard to reach places and who would have thought that it would be so cheap.</li>
            <li> Ever since I purchased this, my back hasnt itched once.  I scratched it anyway and it seemed to work well. Nice and sturdy. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my fatherNlaw and he enjoys it everyday!</li>
            <li> Claws need to be sharper.</li>
            <li> They seem fine, though I haven&#x27;t taken them out of the plastic sleeves yet.  The only thing I am disappointed with is that the Bear Claw logo is not imprinted on them.  I bought one a few years ago at a local Menards, and mine does have the logo on it.  It looks cool.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I had to order two more on 11/30.  Could you speed them along, so I get them to use as stocking stuffers for Christmas?  I think the thirteen boys/men who receive them in their stockings will get a kick out of them, don&#x27;t you?</li>
            <li> This item was a gift for my girlfriend. She LOVES it. If she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;M happy. Thanks, guys.</li>
            <li> The best back scratcher ever! Period.</li>
            <li> Great back scratcher the blue handle makes it easy to locate in a pile of stuff. The claw is strong and reaches the entire back</li>
            <li> When you have an itch, you have to scratch it.  This does the trick.  The little fingers are sharp, but not sharp enough to do any damage.  They aren&#x27;t robust enough to be felt through clothing.  You&#x27;re going to have to go under your clothes to get any relief.  However, this is a nice item, albeit a little expensive for a backscratcher.  If you don&#x27;t have access to those dirt-cheap bamboo things, these are really nice.</li>
            <li> This well designed device comes in handy in the car, in the briefcase and anywhere else you get that back-itch and need to cure it.</li>
            <li> Works good, it performed as expected and it does the job . Made of good construction and it extends to do the job</li>
            <li> For easily accessible areas this works well but for the back ( which is where most of us need it) it doesn’t work worth beans.  The claws aren’t long enough nor angled enough to actually scratch past the shoulder area so is your itch is in the middle of your back, forget it.</li>
            <li> These are great. Inexpensive and do a great job. The extension allows you to carry them/keep them anywhere and you&#x27;ll never find yourself unable to scratch a spot you need to.</li>
            <li> Does not really scratch your back well. Wooden ones work much better.</li>
            <li> Love them I have at least seven all around the house &amp; car</li>
            <li> my hubby loves this! I bought it for hubby for his birthday and he cant stop using it! He scratches everything with it and I do mean EVERYTHING!! He even scratched me and it felt pretty good.</li>
            <li> I assumed &#x27;random colors&#x27; meant they would be different colors.  I ordered 5 of them and they were all black.  Only a deal, as I was giving them to grandsons as gifts, and wanted them to each have a different color.</li>
            <li> I ordered two, fell in love with them and immediately ordered 3 more. They&#x27;re handy wherever I am in the house.</li>
            <li> LOVED THESE:  GAVE TO GRANDKIDS AS STOCKING STUFFERS.  THEY WORK REALLY WELL AND DO NOT GOUGE THE BACK AS YOU SCRATCH.</li>
            <li> I must have missed the section where I could choose my color. I would have liked to have chosen my own. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great item.</li>
            <li> Good, but broke quite quickly in the hands of a 10 year old.</li>
            <li> This is not your flimsy scope scratcher that breaks after a few uses.  This feels solid, opens easy, and fits easy in bag.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this for a christmas present (I&#x27;m so tired of watching my husband scratch his back on the corner of the wall) and I&#x27;m so glad I did!!!!!! I wanted to, initially, buy him a more fancy one but after reading the reviews I went with this one. IT IS AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li> Good sturdy telescoping mechanism.  Good claws that scratch just right.  Great price.  Keep one in the car, one in the briefcase, etc</li>
            <li> hard to say much, when it works it works I have an order for cough drops, drops were cheap enough but shiping very high.</li>
            <li> I use it almost daily. I purchased it because my other backscratcher broke. This one telescopes which is the main reason I purchased it. It is a great scratcher and I love it. I need another one for my purse but ....</li>
            <li> No way to keep head from moving around.  Another product designed by someone who doesn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 of these with the thought that as random colors with an order for 4 I would get one of each shown color or at least some variety. I received 4 black handled scratchers, which by the way were non logo&#x27;d. They work well and seem to be pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> Love It.  Purchased one a year ago in wood at Wal_Mart and of course the wood became disassembled.  This one made of steel is lifetime.  It feels so stable and hits the spot each time.</li>
            <li> It works and it&#x27;s very stable.  The handle smells strongly of rubber though which is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> For the price, it works great.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!  What a great back scratcher!  It has a long reach AND it is very sturdy.  It doesn&#x27;t twist around when you use it.  I love it and ordered three more for \\&quot;friends and family\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> im always needing my back scratched, found these little handy back scratchers online, ordered and glad i did.  keep it handy in my purse.</li>
            <li> Ideal back scratcher.  extends with soft handle.  use it frequently.  i am of the opinion that a good back scratcher is a most for every household.  fiance uses it more than i.  she loves it as well.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price.I especially like the telescoping feature. Shipping takes a long time however. Mine was shipped from China.</li>
            <li> I only bought 6 of these - come in handy for back itches and reaching things ...great for Christmas stocking stuffers for adults as well</li>
            <li> This scratcher is awful. The &amp;#34;claws&amp;#34; are rounded at the ends and I can&#x27;t feel anything when I use it. If you buy this thing you&#x27;ll always have an itchy back.</li>
            <li> The $1 dollar bamboo scratchers work way better.</li>
            <li> Can also be used as a bottle opener so this makes this the perfect tool for guys. I also use it to get things far from reach</li>
            <li> This is perfect. Compact to take up the least amount of space - telescopes to reach those pesky itchy corners of my back. The one they sent me has a black handle. I&#x27;ve used it for at least a month now and am as pleased today as the first time I used it. Great product!</li>
            <li> Great stocking stuffer - also for suitcase when traveling.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.  Mines broke within hour. I see why it was soo cheap</li>
            <li> Cheap.  Broke after a few uses.</li>
            <li> DO NOT be fooled.  This is not a &amp;#34;Bear Claw&amp;#34; product.  It is a generic back scratcher that is shaped like a bear claw.  No where on this product is the brand name &amp;#34;Bear Claw&amp;#34;.  The rubber handle just slides right off of the product when you extend the scratcher.  Not worth the measly $4.00 I spent.</li>
            <li> A must have.....we own 4 and when you need a quick scratch....perfect</li>
            <li> It was pretty much what I expected.  I like the way you can extend it &amp; it&#x27;s actually small enough to fit in a purse.</li>
            <li> cheap price and not a good design</li>
            <li> I find these are great for persons who live alone and you have an itch.&lt;br /&gt;They will reach all those difficult areas.</li>
            <li> I love the handle and the extendability of the scratcher.  I would change the shape a bit if I could but it is the best product under $4 I ever Bought.  It&#x27;s a great purchase!!</li>
            <li> A little too sharp to use.  I had to file down two of the paws.  other than that, it&#x27;s still usable.</li>
            <li> Got this as a present for my son-in-law, who has a terrible problem with dry skin on his back.  My husband has had one of these for years, and loves and uses it all the time.  I love the fact it is a telescoping tool! Thank you so much!!! :)</li>
            <li> I have dry skin on my back and it frequently itches. During the winter it is really bad and right now, it is winter. I was unsure about this but I thought, &amp;#34;well, I&#x27;ll give it a try&amp;#34; and am I ever glad I did. This telescopes out so you can reach your entire back. The &amp;#34;prongs&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; are not sharp but dull either. They won&#x27;t cut you but they will sure scratch your back. I got the brown one because it was the cheapest and who really cares about the color of their back scratcher.&lt;br /&gt;It is very well made and I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your back is itchy....get this. It will save you money in testing other back scratchers. Trust me, this is the ONLY ONE you will need.</li>
            <li> While the claw works well at scratching, the handle is not long enough!  I could not tell from the photo that the handle was so short.</li>
            <li> This backscratcher is great ... SO much better than the bamboo ones.  If you are thinking of buying bamboo ... don&#x27;t.  This one does the job much, much better.</li>
            <li> I have atopic dermatitus and have spent years of my life itching. The back is the worst because I just can&#x27;t reach where it itches. Most back scratchers do not have have a sharp enough edge to be effective. I scratch harder and harder trying to get them to work but to no avail. Just when I was ready to file the edges down I bought one of these from my daughter&#x27;s fund raiser. I then bought 4 more from Amazon. It scratches really well. the retractable handle makes it convenient to carry one around in my purse too!</li>
            <li> Gave these for Christmas gifts to family members.  They love this back scratcher.  My husband uses his on our Terrier.....gets those hard to reach spots real good!! :) Extension works well making a good, long back scratcher.</li>
            <li> Back scratcher, what else can you say?</li>
            <li> Not too sharp (some back scratchers can be) and fits in the basket that you keep your remotes in--which is great when your having one of those binge on netflix kind of days.</li>
            <li> Wow! Oversized! Much larger than expected, very sturdy, does a wonderful job!</li>
            <li> Worked like you would expect a back scratcher to work. Haven&#x27;t had any issues with it yet. If you have a need for a back scratcher i&#x27;d recomend this one.</li>
            <li> The price was right, so I purchased two of these back scratchers.  The handle telescopes, which is great for travel.  Sadly, as soon as I extended the handle, the claw fell off the handle.  The handle is not screwed into the craw.  Instead, the manufacturer crimps the claw to the handle.  What a cheap design, but then again they were cheap (I guess for a reason).  Love Amazon&#x27;s no-hassle return policy.  I wrote the seller a note a week ago; but they never wrote back.</li>
            <li> I had ill founded worries that the metal extension would retract under pressure when scratching my back, but it&#x27;s turn out to be sturdy and solidly built back scratcher. I bought this as a stocking stuffer for a certain someone who always wants their back scratched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning, might cause excessive use!!!</li>
            <li> The scratcher part is plastic but has held up well so far. I think if I purchased another though I would get one with a metal scratcher. This one does the job though at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Really good back scratcher! It works well and I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
            <li> This sturdy backscratcher collapses for ease of storage or portability without sacrificing useability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little \\&quot;fingers\\&quot; that scratch are rounded off enough and smoothly finished enough not to do damage to skin, but provide a satisfyingly brisk scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this. If I ever lose it, I&#x27;ll go right out and get another one.</li>
            <li> This is a great build in every way, except that the scratching edge is duller than a butter knife.  So, it&#x27;s not as satisfying a scratch as fingernails are.  I assume this is so people don&#x27;t scar themselves going to town under an itchy leg cast.  I keep thinking I&#x27;ll file it to a nice appropriate edge.  Note sure what that might do to the durability of the metal finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;ll give it this: dull or not, it&#x27;s way better than not being able to scratch a hard-to-reach itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is very portable (though mine stays in my desk drawer at work), and the telescoping extension if long enough to reach any part of my back.  And it&#x27;s solid. Should last years.</li>
            <li> Purchased this specifically because it had the Bear Claw name on the photo. The original Bear Claw scratchers sold here in the US are wonderful and heavier. These did not have the Bear Claw name, nor were they as heavy. For the price it&#x27;s fine, but not as pictures and NOT the same as the ones you can purchase here. Obviously these are knock-offs. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The item was a great price, arrived quickly, and works great! I can&#x27;t believe how fast it arrived :)We are happy with the product itself at well and are thinking of purchasing more to have in other handy areas.</li>
            <li> I got it. Thank you!! ;)</li>
            <li> My husband loves this as do I bc it keeps me from having to constantly scratch his back lol</li>
            <li> Excellent - wife loves it, uses regularly for last 8 months.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS HANDY BACK SCRATCHER!</li>
            <li> We should have bought them for Christmas gifts.  This little hing is great and after a few months of daily use, it is still holding up.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Performs exactly as advertised. I gave mine away to an elderly friend and now must order another. I plan to put them in Christmas stockings too.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Perfect! Love it!</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; good product</li>
            <li> Best back scratcher ever!  Rounded metal claws.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas - he loves it! The handle is grippy and it works very well!</li>
            <li> I love using this when I have itch on my back and my fianc&amp;eacute; is not around to save me. It extends out to reach farther with less effort.</li>
            <li> This is the best backscratcher I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> Bought for husband&#x27;s birthday  he uses it everyday . It&#x27;s not too big,easy to keep by the couch.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get, but it came from China. It has a telescoping handle so you can adjust it. Nice bear claw scratcher.</li>
            <li> The back scratcher I received is extremely well made, and works beautifully.  I know it looks like it would hurt, but it doesn&#x27;t at all.  I just love it.  Bought more so I can give some away (and also have one downstairs and one upstairs!)</li>
            <li> it works as intended.</li>
            <li> This is my second Bear Claw back scratcher.  The best by far, back scratcher I have ever used.  I use my back scratcher daily, and bear claw holds up pretty good with all the miles I use it.</li>
            <li> I love it!!  Quick delivery and superior quality!</li>
            <li> The claws are a nice smooth casting and I would recommend this for anyone who has an itch they can&#x27;t quite reach by hand.</li>
            <li> Great back scratcher.  With the telescoping handle I can keep it in the pencil cup on my desk and have it ready whenever I need it.  Only problem is that the telescoping want has the bad habit of un-extending (shortening) when I use it at a certain angle.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I always seem to have a scratch where I can&#x27;t reach it, and it works great but I do have one problem with it my kids like it so much that they took it over so I am going to have to buy another one for myself.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> This thing will dig really good when you need it. Great back scratcher and it can reach where you need it.</li>
            <li> Get it great for back scratching and fun to use with pets</li>
            <li> My father is one of those guys who has everything he needs.  I struggle to find something that he needs that doesn&#x27;t have.  This is a perfect gift since it telescopes out to a long size and can really put out the most intense itch, through clothes or sans - it works.  Plus you can stash this in your desk at work and use it yourself.</li>
            <li> So far this is the best back scratcher that I have purchased and believe me, I have purchased a lot! I have purchased a lot of garbage and some good ones but this is the real deal. It is large, strong, well built and it scratches so hard that you must be careful not to cut yourself! I like a hard scratcher for serious bear back scratching! When you really got the bear back scratch, you do not need a cheap toy but you need a powerful and strong back scratcher to take care of itch. You need a solid metal and a sharp scratcher. This is the one. Thinly built large claw to scratch hard, heavy handle to last and a well built design makes it all the best that I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a number of these and gave them to family and friends. Take advantage of this item because coming across a great back scratcher is not an easy task. All is out there is cheap junk. This is the Real Deal. Go for it baby, your back deserves it! Take care of that itch baby!</li>
            <li> I thought it would have Bear Claw written on the handle and would have liked it in another color.  However, it does the job.</li>
            <li> Well made item with a good extension in the handle.  All in all, seems made for its purpose.</li>
            <li> awesome product...I use it all the time!</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s only been a few weeks but this bear claw back scratcher hasn&#x27;t gone a day without being used.... Hold on a second I need to go grab it...👍</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> I am concerned about the longevity of this scratcher. When it is extended there is considerable wobble and it is easy to see that it will break with any amount of heavy scratching. The &amp;#34;claws&amp;#34; work great and it seems like because they work so well I won&#x27;t have to push as hard to get a good scratch. My back is constantly itchy so I am sure I will use this heavily, and I will update this review with any new information gleamed.</li>
            <li> Handle broke after a few uses.</li>
            <li> wanted multi-colors and received all the same color - BLACK - disappointed that each one was not a different color</li>
            <li> This back scratcher extends pretty far and the claw part isn&#x27;t sharp or anything, not sure what else to say as far as back scratcher praise. The only downside is that the handle grip has come off a few times when I&#x27;m pulling on the end to extend it, but it is otherwise perfect,</li>
