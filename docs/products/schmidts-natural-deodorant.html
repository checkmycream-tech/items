            <li>Which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Just got it and used s Couple times, seems to work really good for me....</li>
            <li>It smells good and it works.  </li>
            <li>Lasts about 9 to 10 hours but during those hours I smell good.</li>
            <li>Cruelty free and smells great!</li>
            <li>and it smells good --</li>
            <li>This product is that good.  </li>
            <li>However, that smell was gone after a good day&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>OR you don&#x27;t shave armpits, you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>just the best natural-the best overall.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this deodorant.</li>
            <li>but still I&#x27;m very pleased with how this stuff turned out.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>Anyways, it has a good smell to it kind of limey or somewhere along the lines of citrusy.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased to say that this works great (and smells even better!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective and smells lovely.  </li>
            <li>So glad I decided to try it out!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>A favorite discovery!</li>
            <li>Maybe my pits just like the toxic substances better?!?</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing...</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is amazing</li>
            <li>liked the scent</li>
            <li>I have tried all kind of deoderants and antipersperants.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also kind of nice to control the amount you use.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred it in a roll on, so I will just be making my own.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how effective it is because I couldn&#x27;t bear thought of using it.  </li>
            <li>She loves them and they smell nice.  </li>
            <li>I hope they are a s nice as this one.  </li>
            <li>nice packaging&lt;</li>
            <li>Smells really nice too.</li>
            <li>Smells nice (if you like earthy smells) and works as promised.</li>
            <li>You scoop out a pea-sized amount of the product, warm it with your fingers and spread it over the underarm area.</li>
            <li>This has to warm up a bit to be rubbed in</li>
            <li>so I prefer scraping the deodorant with the spatula then put it in my hand to warm up</li>
            <li>It is kinda a pain to put on as it doesn&#x27;t spread very easily.</li>
            <li>Best natural product ever!  </li>
            <li>The scent, the lasting power, and the very pleasant feel all make this product unbelievably good.  </li>
            <li>Today, I do not have any irritation, whatsoever- just nice smelling armpits :)  .  </li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive so this is perfect from my point of view.</li>
            <li>This is the best natural deodorant I have tried.</li>
            <li>Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Schmidt&#x27;s is the best natural deodorant I have used.</li>
            <li>This is the best natural deodorant I have used.</li>
            <li>I purchased the cedarwood and juniper, and I love love love the scent!</li>
            <li>If you used to love Aromacreme deodorant from Lush, this is an excellent substitute.</li>
            <li>Smells great and really works!</li>
            <li>First off, it smells great.  </li>
            <li>Also, warm the product between your fingers so that it applies easily.</li>
            <li>A nice fragrance but another one in the line that doesnt easily wash out of shirts.  </li>
            <li>This has a pleasant woodsy and sweet smell and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Well I am so glad I did,  </li>
            <li>Love the scent it is not manly smelling or overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I did not re-apply before my 2nd job, and it held up great!  </li>
            <li>two.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line...if you don&#x27;t mind having occasional sweaty armpits...this product is WONDERFUL!  </li>
            <li>so surely this won&#x27;t happen to me.  </li>
            <li>(however, I still Love Cedarwood&#x27;s scent).</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>This deodorant is magical.</li>
            <li>and it smells much better than most deodorants.</li>
            <li>And, the Cedarwood and Juniper scent is lovely.</li>
            <li>I love that this is balanced in a way that doesn&#x27;t remind me of the Brawny paper towel guy.  </li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products, and this anti-perspirant/deodorant is excellent!</li>
            <li>Love the smell and it works well when I can wear it.  </li>
            <li>Glad I had because they conveyed all the pertinent information about</li>
            <li>like the scent of this and am enjoying using it.</li>
            <li>My top three, in order, are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it comes in many colors</li>
            <li>stuff works even better</li>
            <li>This product is okay  </li>
            <li>but I had to use it more often than stated  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure she will be buying these again.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the product</li>
            <li>Well,  I smell better with no deodorant after a day than with this.  </li>
            <li>Love the fragrance too.  </li>
            <li>I feel more confident using this than</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I had applied this magical deodorant</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this deodorant for about 9 months now and could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>greater or longer wear is needed.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but I am in love with the smell.</li>
            <li>I like this, but don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>but the spatula does make me feel better about</li>
            <li>, I like the products with some coconut oil, they spread out better.</li>
            <li>: 4 stars, would be better if spatula were rubber.</li>
            <li>be 5 stars with a better spatula or in a stick form.</li>
            <li>The most pleasant to use and most effective of all the natural deodorants I have tried.  </li>
            <li>The scents are very pleasant but don&#x27;t really last (which I like).</li>
            <li>At first, I loved this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I loved this for the first couple weeks  </li>
            <li>It smells amazingly good and is gentle on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Kudos!</li>
            <li>like cedar or juniper, kind of earthy &amp; organic &amp; (mildly) fragrant, like a cedar chest that has just been opened.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Schmidt&#x27;s, for making a superior body product.</li>
            <li>i used them during pregnancy and was very happy with the mild and lasting scent.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t rub off that easily.</li>
            <li>I emailed the company and they responded very quickly saying that they had not changed their formula.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is not as easy to apply as stick deodorant, but that is forgiven because it WORKS.</li>
            <li>so I need a strong deodorant.</li>
            <li>This is also a great price, I have been using it for a month and barely made a dent in the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients</li>
            <li>This product kind of smells like weed, but I don&#x27;t stink and it&#x27;s HOT today.</li>
            <li>it works better than even my deodorants that are full of chemicals.</li>
            <li>This said, I like this deodorant because the ingredients are fine.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I had my trusty backup deodorant!</li>
            <li>but if you want to be chemical free and shower fresh all day it really works nicely!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong antiperspirant factor, so you will sweat more with it, but this is well worth it still because you don&#x27;t give off an odor even when sweaty.</li>
            <li>Works really well, easy to apply, amazing smell, zero irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update</li>
            <li>The paste certainly smells nice, but it made my underarms itch uncontrollably.</li>
            <li>The best advice that I can give is:  If you get a rash let your skin heal and than mix 1/2 tbs of apple vinegar with 1/2 C of distilled water and put in a little spray bottle.  </li>
            <li>By far the best all natural deoderant out there</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use all caps lightly, btw.</li>
            <li>The available smells</li>
            <li>Nice smell and really does work well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had such a great experience with Schmidt&#x27;s deodorant that I&#x27;ve tried all the scents.</li>
            <li>Unless I&#x27;m doing intense exercise, I&#x27;ve found that this product effectively deodorizes without reapplication over the course of a day.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s free.</li>
            <li>The formula also blends in smoothly into my skin.</li>
            <li>It totally works, everything was great until 3 weeks in it</li>
            <li>I am stink free.</li>
            <li>Smell was very earthy, which I liked.  </li>
            <li>(I currently use Cedarwood and Juniper, which is a great unisex scent) and I will be ordering some for family that I think will like it as well.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an all natural kinda gal and would rather not wear any deodorant than put some toxic chemical on my armpits to smell good.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good natural deodorant that will do what you hope it does, this is the one.</li>
            <li>I have been making my own deodorant for years (coconut oil, baking soda, arrowroot powder), but I wanted to try this one because it&#x27;s in solid form, and the one I make is effective, but a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li>I like that this is all natural, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be really effective without having to apply more throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Super easy.  </li>
            <li>Kind of high for the amount you get too.</li>
            <li>Even if this were to occur with a jar of Schmidt&#x27;s, the unique application technique would prevent messiness.</li>
            <li>Well worth trying!</li>
            <li>I love the smell so much!</li>
            <li>Original review</li>
            <li>I am clean, I consider myself anyways, and having just showered...</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m loving the smell and not missing those chemicals since my switch from anti perspirant.</li>
            <li>This product has been effective thus far.</li>
            <li>Nothing refreshing about the smell, just very tree-ey.</li>
            <li>The thick pliable spoon is the perfect applicator</li>
            <li>around 6am and found that by 7:30 I was still smelling fresh and odor free.  </li>
            <li>Naturally, the child in me burst into fits of laughter leaving me warm but still, not stinky.</li>
            <li>It works for a full 24 hours, through working out, etc.</li>
            <li>Good at eliminating odor throughout the day, however, I&#x27;m sensitive to the large amount of baking soda used in this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried all sorts of different types of natural deodorant and none have done a very good job.</li>
            <li>I quickly got used to the method of application.</li>
            <li>would say- not for the super hairy armpit</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply - not messy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps my joy is slightly premature</li>
            <li>I find it more of a unisex fragrance, neither super feminine nor super masculine.</li>
            <li>So I can rack up a pretty good BO when left unchecked</li>
            <li>Short lived odor protection, good for cooler weather but not for hot.</li>
            <li>The consistency and method of application are fine, and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Take a little getting used to, applying th eproduct with your fingers, but it works well and the cedar/juniper fragrance is great.</li>
            <li>It can also stay effective till next day if you don&#x27;t shower at night or something.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>It keeps me smelling fresh all day.</li>
            <li>I was fresh out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I believe it to be the most masculine of the bunch.</li>
            <li>I have never found a better natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>Still smelling fresh through my commute that involved 80 degree heat and some walking.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and not too obvious, it doesn&#x27;t interfere with perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a natural deodorant and most don&#x27;t work on you, then try this.</li>
            <li>They really should advertise so other will know how great this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it three stars because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right for me.</li>
            <li>But, he was right.</li>
            <li>But the smell (I got the Cedarwood &amp; Juniper) is just not quite right.</li>
            <li>right before I leave for work and have had no issues.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it right after shaving armpits, so I haven&#x27;t had rash issues.</li>
            <li>It works great, then after a few weeks sure enough I wake up one morning</li>
            <li>It smelled great while packed inside the small jar.</li>
            <li>Blow dry my armpits on warm until my skin is dry.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>Mineral salt deodorant works well for me, but you have to run it under water and then wait for you pits to dry (who has that kind of time?).</li>
            <li>I just shave armpits at night and do so very gently.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant but not strong, I don&#x27;t like to smell by deodorant all day.</li>
            <li>when I first switched, this wasn&#x27;t a baking soda irritation.  </li>
            <li>I DID experience an underarm rash for about a week when I first started using the Cedarwood + Juniper deodorant.  </li>
            <li>After sticking the discomfort out for about a week, I no longer had the irritation I did when I first started using Schmidt&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>AND this stuff really works!</li>
            <li>Make sure to rub a pea sized amount until its warmed and softened and then simply slather it on!</li>
            <li>be aware of this.</li>
            <li>The same stuff in a slightly larger container with a bit more filler would be &amp;#34;even&amp;#34; better.</li>
            <li>but sadly it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>It never fails that I finda product I like on Amazon and some creaton raises the price or no longer carries the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit new to using natural deodorants, but this one would be my favorite if not for the skin irritation is caused.</li>
            <li>I have been searching everywhere for an all natural product that keeps me dry, smells good, and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, overall, I would give it an A for effectiveness, and it has a pleasant smell, but the texture is enough of a problem that I will not re-buy</li>
            <li>Biggest plus for this product is that I get no less than 18 hours of stink free pits.</li>
            <li>The scent, cedar wood juniper, is pleasant and not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s effective from 8 hours on a hot active day, to almost 24 hours in cooler weather.  </li>
            <li>I love the little scoop, and it goes on smooth and never greasy, which is a bonus when you&#x27;re trying to get dressed in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>I did a good amount of research and read a bunch of the reviews, good and bad.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it really does keep me dry and fresh all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even worn it to high cardio gym classes and come out smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li>Through a whole normal day.&lt;br /&gt;Price is great; will likely last</li>
            <li>Once applied, it&#x27;s about equal in effectiveness to the other brand I use, plenty effective enough for an office job, it prevents odor very well, and I feel good about using it, no worry about blocking pores.  </li>
            <li>A LOT followed with some BO from the arm-pits; it&#x27;s natural right!?</li>
            <li>I emailed back letting them know I&#x27;ve been using baking soda based deodorants for years and experienced rashes due to that</li>
            <li>I consistently would have a really</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much unisex.</li>
            <li>Well I put it on after my morning shower and pretty much immediately the burning began.</li>
            <li>Schmidt offers are superior in my opinion to those offered by other brands that prize subtlety over fanfare 3)</li>
            <li>cool all natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>I had previously purchased this product and liked it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the consistency of a dry shea butter, with small spatula to scoop out and use, best to scoop into palm to warm and get all the dried pieces to stick together and then rub into under arms.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product through hot weather and really heavy workouts and it stood up quite nicely.   </li>
            <li>Will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li>It certainly takes care of the odor, which is why I gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li>The jar and miniature plastic trowel are very aesthetically pleasing 1) Application.</li>
            <li>I have tried many natural deodorants and  they left me very embarrassed before the end of the day.</li>
            <li>and i used it very sparingly.</li>
            <li>added some organic coconut oil to it and that really helped but I shouldn&#x27;t have to do that</li>
            <li>After about a month my armpits were very itching.</li>
            <li>I really wish they&#x27;d put it in a stick.</li>
            <li>The remaining two stars, it still doesn&#x27;t take care of sweaty armpits (very embarrassing for a girl) as I still need to keep wiping all day.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re ready to go and you never touched it at all or got it under your fingernails, no need to wash your hands, etc.</li>
            <li>I really like the cedar scent.</li>
            <li>: after a month or two I had to stop using it because it really irritated the skin and made some hairs ingrow severely; something I&#x27;ve never had happen before.  </li>
            <li>regular store bought deodorants filled with aluminum.</li>
            <li>have also tried the lavender and sage and that one is a very powerful&lt;br /&gt;antioxidant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a girl, and it&#x27;s neither too manly or too girly, it simply smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too much work for deodorant.</li>
            <li>I was REALLY hoping this would be the one for me</li>
            <li>Yes, the best way to use it is to get your hands dirty, but that&#x27;s part of the charm.</li>
            <li>It works really, really well.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>Some may poo poo this concept, but I honestly believe it was my body and armpits detoxing from the decades of aluminum, heavy chemical ridden antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to know that I am not putting harsh chemicals on my body.</li>
            <li>I press it between my fingers for a few seconds to warm it up and then spread.  </li>
            <li>Not bad, just odd, like crushing leaves with your hand.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona and this will be my first summer using it</li>
            <li>After a full day of work and walking and lifting and hoisting people all day, I still smell pretty decent 15 hours later.</li>
            <li>It worked great for the first few tries.</li>
            <li>Not only do my underarms stay fresh smelling, but so do my clothes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since bought all of the other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; of Schmidt&#x27;s and love them all</li>
            <li>and use the FLAT side of the spatula (not the sharpish edge) to smooth it under your pit the way you would frost a cake.</li>
            <li>It holds smelly armpits better than any other deodorant, EVER.</li>
            <li>subtle clean smell even after the end of a long warm day!</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and works all day long even in to the next day.</li>
            <li>For some reason after a month of steady use, this started to really irritate my pits.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think my skin would be so sensitive, but this product irritates my skin pretty severely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have no idea about the people who&#x27;ve had rash issues and my skin is pretty sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Keeps me odor free for the workday and relatively dry.</li>
            <li>It does have essential oils in the formula, so those with sensitive skin should try the fragrance free formula.</li>
            <li>desperately needs a bit more of some kind of emulsifier to help it out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I exercise I mainly do cardio:</li>
            <li>I am sure it&#x27;s just me, but I just don&#x27;t get why with such a simple and innocuous ingredient list I am having this problem.</li>
            <li>At first I noticed the tenderness only on particularly hot days</li>
            <li>Either I developed a sensitivity to the ingredients that coincidentally occurred with the exact time I started using the new jar or something has changed.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to everyone.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you have any concern about chemicals so close to breast tissue and lymph nodes.</li>
            <li>-- I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different scents by this company, and this one is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>I will try other scents now that I know this stuff isn&#x27;t an overwhelmingly strong scent.</li>
            <li>I do notice it keeps me much dryer than the aluminum filled commercial deodorants that I have used in recent years.</li>
            <li>I like to use natural deodorants, but they don&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>Once you get past the whole &amp;#34;rubbing cream into your armpits thing&amp;#34; you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>I received a jar of Schmidt&#x27;s as a gift a few weeks ago and I immediately noticed some aspects in which I consider this product to be better than Jungleman: 0)</li>
            <li>: My search for effective natural deodorant has been a long and extensive and all too frequently a smelly godawful journey.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t warm up enough to spread just sitting on my fingers, either, it sort of crumbles against my underarms and falls down.  </li>
            <li>I also wanted to switch something more natural to be true to myself and avoid all the chemicals, but the natural deodorants that I tried would only put in about a half a day&#x27;s job before calling it a day.  </li>
            <li>This was to be the new normal: aluminum-free, baking soda-based deodorant.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent, it blends into my underarms without leaving a white mess, it prevents order but allows my pores to breathe.</li>
            <li>This deodorant smells good and was fairly effective, however it left my skin red and unhappy.</li>
            <li>; - and I didn&#x27;t tell him it was my new deodorant.</li>
            <li>I might even try new scents someday.</li>
            <li>I forgot that I was trying a new product or that I needed to be worried about it working, if that gives you any idea.</li>
            <li>I am sure it&#x27;s not really that big a deal</li>
            <li>I used to use Old Spice Matterhorn, mainly because it smelled like Ice, Wind, and Freedom.</li>
            <li>You definitely don&#x27;t need very much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, so you still sweat, but if you have a problem with BO and nothing completely covers it up, this is the one for you!</li>
            <li>In the cons column, Schmidt&#x27;s is about 37% more expensive than my next favorite brand however this is negated by the shipping cost since Schmidt&#x27;s is conveniently offered on Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li>So I paid closer attention to the directions which calls for the amount of a pea (I barely use that much) and the itching has stopped.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>and I plan on ordering this exact product in the future.</li>
            <li>this is my second jar, the first one was lavander.</li>
            <li>Although I continue to use baby powder on light days, I now use the Schmidt&#x27;s Natural Deodorant on other occasions.  </li>
            <li>My pits stay fresh and mostly dry</li>
            <li>if I used &#x27;natural deodorants.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve thought for the longest time I had a personal issue, which is pretty embarrassing, but along came Schmidt&#x27;s</li>
            <li>This is the first natural deodorant I have found that actually works.</li>
            <li>In addition to being a cute gimmick, the little scraper allows you to carefully calibrate how much deodorant you use.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve had problems with sensitive underarm skin, then you might want to be cautious with this brand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe the company will come out with one for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve developed a rash and discoloration.</li>
            <li>I bought this during the winder and knew that summer brings on a whole different set of issues when it comes to perspiration.</li>
            <li>I frequently had to change brands because it seemed like my body would become immune after a month or</li>
            <li>I am looking for a natural deodorant that helps with perspiration and this does not.</li>
            <li>If your skin is at all sensitive, I would pass on this.</li>
            <li>Only con I think of about this is having to put it on with your finger which isn&#x27;t really much of a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I immediately discontinued use of this product, as this was really the only change I had made in my day-to-day life.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Often, woodsy scented products are too masculine for me.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s none of the chemical smell that has really bothered me with traditional anti-perspirants.</li>
            <li>I ordered this elsewhere and am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to baking soda deodorants, so I found a way to put it on that keeps my skin from getting irritated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything you want in a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>Totally natural.</li>
            <li>I bought three fragrances of Schmidt&#x27;s Natural Deodorant as gifts.  </li>
            <li>I also have fairly sensitive skin (and I wax under my arms), and Schmidt&#x27;s has never irritated me.  </li>
            <li>and so far no problems in the 110 degree heat.</li>
            <li>But so far he loves it.</li>
            <li>(I wanted to switch to natural deodorant</li>
            <li>I just think that I am particularly sensitive to it.</li>
            <li>have not had any irritation from this, and do have reasonably sensitive skin and depilate my underarms.  </li>
            <li>Something in it just doesn&#x27;t like my sensitive underarms.</li>
            <li>For reference, I don&#x27;t typically have sensitive skin, with the exception of minor reactions to cheap metals used in certain jewelry.</li>
            <li>This stuff keeps me dry and smelling good all day long even through some heavy sweating.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was really excited at the prospect of a deodorant that had so few ingredients and all natural.</li>
            <li>Scent: Strong, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>finally, a natural deodorant that actually works!!!&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve been using it for the past few (very warm) days</li>
            <li>I love the subtle fragrance, too.</li>
            <li>worth the money will last a long time</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only does this works but this particular one detoxes and you can&lt;br /&gt;see</li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for a deodorant that doesn&#x27;t include harmful ingredients, but still gets the job done.</li>
            <li>No sour armpit smell.</li>
            <li>Fast forward through some strange testing and getting to work at 11:45.</li>
            <li>Normally I just shower and use baby powder (not talc) for lighter activity days and reserve the use of antiperspirants when physical activity is</li>
            <li>This is a very hard task with most natural deodorant in my experience unless I get the stuff with aluminum in it to stop the odor causing sweat.</li>
            <li>I do not use it straight out of the shower while the skin is &amp;#34;open&amp;#34;, though, I wait until it&#x27;s dry and calm, and try to shave or epilate at night, not right before using the deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s so dry and crumbly that you really can&#x27;t even emulsify it in your hands.</li>
            <li>I like fresh smells rather than floral, but this one is just odd.</li>
            <li>One of the few aluminum free deodorants that actually works.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t care that the product is causing this apparently.  </li>
            <li>was the ONLY natural deodorant that didn&#x27;t make me smell like a farm animal.  </li>
            <li>Wow this stuff actually works.</li>
            <li>But i don&#x27;t recommend to use it before or after shaving your armpit it it might burn or give you a rash, use it the next day if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>You see, I&#x27;m a physician in a physical profession and a busy office.</li>
            <li>I have tried several natural deodorants (all reviewed elsewhere) including this one.  </li>
            <li>apparently my wife loves this stuff and keeps reordering it.</li>
            <li>So it lasts a long as normal deodorant.</li>
            <li>I wish it had worked for my body chemistry because I really liked the smell, but unfortunately its not something I can use.</li>
            <li>And unlike so many other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried in the past, it actually works.</li>
            <li>Second, if you have used other natural deodorants, the method of application is perfectly normal for a natural product.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly be buying this product again and am looking forward to trying the other scents.</li>
            <li>Loved the smell of it, but wasn&#x27;t ever able to use it because it was melted in the jar covering up the little spatula and so hard it was too hard a messy.</li>
            <li>Hope this review helps as I have shopped for quite some time to find a deodorant that really works but without the health risks associated with some of that other stuff to include clogged pores.</li>
            <li>Was a bit irritating to my skin, took care of any odors pretty good, but not great.  </li>
            <li>Also, it seemed to work quite well throughout the day which is a big deal, especially for a natural deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have initially tired it during the fall, when the weather wasn&#x27;t so hot, but I&#x27;ve been using it since then during hot days as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is unfortunate because my girlfriend loved the smell of the cedarwood, and as a deodorant, it performed its job as expected.</li>
            <li>To apply it, scrape off some of the deodorant using the spatula and you can either use your fingers to rub it into your armpits or rub it first in between your fingers till it spreads a little bit then use your fingers to apply.</li>
            <li>Small, ovular patches of dry skin started forming first in the armpit area, and quickly spread to other parts of my body.</li>
            <li>I am not overly sensitive to baking soda, as I regularly soak in it and it actually helps to improve my skin overall.</li>
            <li>I sweat pretty heavy</li>
            <li>Typically, I use a small sized amount each time, and I find that using this, on a daily basis, it has lasted for me more than 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have used Tom&#x27;s of Maine in the past, and I would dip the top of it in a little baking soda to help deodorize and it worked well.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this, despite reading many negative reviews about irritation and painful lumps, I thought I&#x27;ve been using natural baki g soda based deodorants for 9 years</li>
            <li>so I was pleasantly surprised that it kept me mostly dry.</li>
            <li>It seems to work, though, at least as well as more conventional commercial products!</li>
            <li>Love the smell, love the way it controls dampness and body odor, but unfortunately, it&#x27;s giving me a pretty bad rash in both armpits.</li>
            <li>I can work hard all day long and still smell clean at the end of the day, I will continue to use this for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>Strange little plastic applicator is pretty tiny.</li>
            <li>On a good note, the smell isn&#x27;t bad on my body nor do I stink of BO.</li>
            <li>Too bad, the listed ingredients are natural and I liked the minimalist packaging.</li>

            <li> The Cedar wood and Juniper scent smells great too, just like cedar.  </li>
            <li> *  Still happy with the product but</li>
            <li> I love it and will continue to use it!!</li>
            <li> and I love it!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works so well, and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing!  </li>
            <li> This works amazing!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly this deodorant worked great for me.</li>
            <li> Awesome deodorant, like better than Lavilin.  </li>
            <li> It works great for odor and surprisingly well for wetness</li>
            <li> Scent is wonderful, does a great job at keeping me feeling fresh all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to discontinue usage for good now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> Just got it and used s Couple times, seems to work really good for me....</li>
            <li> It smells good and it works.  </li>
            <li> Lasts about 9 to 10 hours but during those hours I smell good.</li>
            <li> Cruelty free and smells great!</li>
            <li> and it smells good --</li>
            <li> This product is that good.  </li>
            <li> However, that smell was gone after a good day&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> OR you don&#x27;t shave armpits, you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> just the best natural-the best overall.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this deodorant.</li>
            <li> but still I&#x27;m very pleased with how this stuff turned out.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> Anyways, it has a good smell to it kind of limey or somewhere along the lines of citrusy.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased to say that this works great (and smells even better!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very effective and smells lovely.  </li>
            <li> So glad I decided to try it out!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> A favorite discovery!</li>
            <li> Maybe my pits just like the toxic substances better?!?</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing...</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is amazing</li>
            <li> liked the scent</li>
            <li> I have tried all kind of deoderants and antipersperants.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also kind of nice to control the amount you use.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred it in a roll on, so I will just be making my own.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how effective it is because I couldn&#x27;t bear thought of using it.  </li>
            <li> She loves them and they smell nice.  </li>
            <li> I hope they are a s nice as this one.  </li>
            <li> nice packaging&lt;</li>
            <li> Smells really nice too.</li>
            <li> Smells nice (if you like earthy smells) and works as promised.</li>
            <li> You scoop out a pea-sized amount of the product, warm it with your fingers and spread it over the underarm area.</li>
            <li> This has to warm up a bit to be rubbed in</li>
            <li> so I prefer scraping the deodorant with the spatula then put it in my hand to warm up</li>
            <li> It is kinda a pain to put on as it doesn&#x27;t spread very easily.</li>
            <li> Best natural product ever!  </li>
            <li> The scent, the lasting power, and the very pleasant feel all make this product unbelievably good.  </li>
            <li> Today, I do not have any irritation, whatsoever- just nice smelling armpits :)  .  </li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive so this is perfect from my point of view.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural deodorant I have tried.</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Schmidt&#x27;s is the best natural deodorant I have used.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural deodorant I have used.</li>
            <li> I purchased the cedarwood and juniper, and I love love love the scent!</li>
            <li> If you used to love Aromacreme deodorant from Lush, this is an excellent substitute.</li>
            <li> Smells great and really works!</li>
            <li> First off, it smells great.  </li>
            <li> Also, warm the product between your fingers so that it applies easily.</li>
            <li> A nice fragrance but another one in the line that doesnt easily wash out of shirts.  </li>
            <li> This has a pleasant woodsy and sweet smell and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Well I am so glad I did,  </li>
            <li> Love the scent it is not manly smelling or overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I did not re-apply before my 2nd job, and it held up great!  </li>
            <li> two.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line...if you don&#x27;t mind having occasional sweaty armpits...this product is WONDERFUL!  </li>
            <li> so surely this won&#x27;t happen to me.  </li>
            <li> (however, I still Love Cedarwood&#x27;s scent).</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> This deodorant is magical.</li>
            <li> and it smells much better than most deodorants.</li>
            <li> And, the Cedarwood and Juniper scent is lovely.</li>
            <li> I love that this is balanced in a way that doesn&#x27;t remind me of the Brawny paper towel guy.  </li>
            <li> love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products, and this anti-perspirant/deodorant is excellent!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it works well when I can wear it.  </li>
            <li> Glad I had because they conveyed all the pertinent information about</li>
            <li> like the scent of this and am enjoying using it.</li>
            <li> My top three, in order, are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it comes in many colors</li>
            <li> stuff works even better</li>
            <li> This product is okay  </li>
            <li> but I had to use it more often than stated  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure she will be buying these again.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the product</li>
            <li> Well,  I smell better with no deodorant after a day than with this.  </li>
            <li> Love the fragrance too.  </li>
            <li> I feel more confident using this than</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I had applied this magical deodorant</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant for about 9 months now and could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> greater or longer wear is needed.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> but I am in love with the smell.</li>
            <li> I like this, but don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li> but the spatula does make me feel better about</li>
            <li> , I like the products with some coconut oil, they spread out better.</li>
            <li> : 4 stars, would be better if spatula were rubber.</li>
            <li> be 5 stars with a better spatula or in a stick form.</li>
            <li> The most pleasant to use and most effective of all the natural deodorants I have tried.  </li>
            <li> The scents are very pleasant but don&#x27;t really last (which I like).</li>
            <li> At first, I loved this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I loved this for the first couple weeks  </li>
            <li> It smells amazingly good and is gentle on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Kudos!</li>
            <li> like cedar or juniper, kind of earthy &amp; organic &amp; (mildly) fragrant, like a cedar chest that has just been opened.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Schmidt&#x27;s, for making a superior body product.</li>
            <li> i used them during pregnancy and was very happy with the mild and lasting scent.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t rub off that easily.</li>
            <li> I emailed the company and they responded very quickly saying that they had not changed their formula.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is not as easy to apply as stick deodorant, but that is forgiven because it WORKS.</li>
            <li> so I need a strong deodorant.</li>
            <li> This is also a great price, I have been using it for a month and barely made a dent in the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients</li>
            <li> This product kind of smells like weed, but I don&#x27;t stink and it&#x27;s HOT today.</li>
            <li> it works better than even my deodorants that are full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> This said, I like this deodorant because the ingredients are fine.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I had my trusty backup deodorant!</li>
            <li> but if you want to be chemical free and shower fresh all day it really works nicely!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong antiperspirant factor, so you will sweat more with it, but this is well worth it still because you don&#x27;t give off an odor even when sweaty.</li>
            <li> Works really well, easy to apply, amazing smell, zero irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update</li>
            <li> The paste certainly smells nice, but it made my underarms itch uncontrollably.</li>
            <li> The best advice that I can give is:  If you get a rash let your skin heal and than mix 1/2 tbs of apple vinegar with 1/2 C of distilled water and put in a little spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> By far the best all natural deoderant out there</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use all caps lightly, btw.</li>
            <li> The available smells</li>
            <li> Nice smell and really does work well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had such a great experience with Schmidt&#x27;s deodorant that I&#x27;ve tried all the scents.</li>
            <li> Unless I&#x27;m doing intense exercise, I&#x27;ve found that this product effectively deodorizes without reapplication over the course of a day.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s free.</li>
            <li> The formula also blends in smoothly into my skin.</li>
            <li> It totally works, everything was great until 3 weeks in it</li>
            <li> I am stink free.</li>
            <li> Smell was very earthy, which I liked.  </li>
            <li> (I currently use Cedarwood and Juniper, which is a great unisex scent) and I will be ordering some for family that I think will like it as well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an all natural kinda gal and would rather not wear any deodorant than put some toxic chemical on my armpits to smell good.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good natural deodorant that will do what you hope it does, this is the one.</li>
            <li> I have been making my own deodorant for years (coconut oil, baking soda, arrowroot powder), but I wanted to try this one because it&#x27;s in solid form, and the one I make is effective, but a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li> I like that this is all natural, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be really effective without having to apply more throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Super easy.  </li>
            <li> Kind of high for the amount you get too.</li>
            <li> Even if this were to occur with a jar of Schmidt&#x27;s, the unique application technique would prevent messiness.</li>
            <li> Well worth trying!</li>
            <li> I love the smell so much!</li>
            <li> Original review</li>
            <li> I am clean, I consider myself anyways, and having just showered...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m loving the smell and not missing those chemicals since my switch from anti perspirant.</li>
            <li> This product has been effective thus far.</li>
            <li> Nothing refreshing about the smell, just very tree-ey.</li>
            <li> The thick pliable spoon is the perfect applicator</li>
            <li> around 6am and found that by 7:30 I was still smelling fresh and odor free.  </li>
            <li> Naturally, the child in me burst into fits of laughter leaving me warm but still, not stinky.</li>
            <li> It works for a full 24 hours, through working out, etc.</li>
            <li> Good at eliminating odor throughout the day, however, I&#x27;m sensitive to the large amount of baking soda used in this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried all sorts of different types of natural deodorant and none have done a very good job.</li>
            <li> I quickly got used to the method of application.</li>
            <li> would say- not for the super hairy armpit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply - not messy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps my joy is slightly premature</li>
            <li> I find it more of a unisex fragrance, neither super feminine nor super masculine.</li>
            <li> So I can rack up a pretty good BO when left unchecked</li>
            <li> Short lived odor protection, good for cooler weather but not for hot.</li>
            <li> The consistency and method of application are fine, and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Take a little getting used to, applying th eproduct with your fingers, but it works well and the cedar/juniper fragrance is great.</li>
            <li> It can also stay effective till next day if you don&#x27;t shower at night or something.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> It keeps me smelling fresh all day.</li>
            <li> I was fresh out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I believe it to be the most masculine of the bunch.</li>
            <li> I have never found a better natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Still smelling fresh through my commute that involved 80 degree heat and some walking.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and not too obvious, it doesn&#x27;t interfere with perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a natural deodorant and most don&#x27;t work on you, then try this.</li>
            <li> They really should advertise so other will know how great this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it three stars because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right for me.</li>
            <li> But, he was right.</li>
            <li> But the smell (I got the Cedarwood &amp; Juniper) is just not quite right.</li>
            <li> right before I leave for work and have had no issues.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it right after shaving armpits, so I haven&#x27;t had rash issues.</li>
            <li> It works great, then after a few weeks sure enough I wake up one morning</li>
            <li> It smelled great while packed inside the small jar.</li>
            <li> Blow dry my armpits on warm until my skin is dry.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Mineral salt deodorant works well for me, but you have to run it under water and then wait for you pits to dry (who has that kind of time?).</li>
            <li> I just shave armpits at night and do so very gently.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant but not strong, I don&#x27;t like to smell by deodorant all day.</li>
            <li> when I first switched, this wasn&#x27;t a baking soda irritation.  </li>
            <li> I DID experience an underarm rash for about a week when I first started using the Cedarwood + Juniper deodorant.  </li>
            <li> After sticking the discomfort out for about a week, I no longer had the irritation I did when I first started using Schmidt&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> AND this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Make sure to rub a pea sized amount until its warmed and softened and then simply slather it on!</li>
            <li> be aware of this.</li>
            <li> The same stuff in a slightly larger container with a bit more filler would be &amp;#34;even&amp;#34; better.</li>
            <li> but sadly it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> It never fails that I finda product I like on Amazon and some creaton raises the price or no longer carries the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit new to using natural deodorants, but this one would be my favorite if not for the skin irritation is caused.</li>
            <li> I have been searching everywhere for an all natural product that keeps me dry, smells good, and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, overall, I would give it an A for effectiveness, and it has a pleasant smell, but the texture is enough of a problem that I will not re-buy</li>
            <li> Biggest plus for this product is that I get no less than 18 hours of stink free pits.</li>
            <li> The scent, cedar wood juniper, is pleasant and not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s effective from 8 hours on a hot active day, to almost 24 hours in cooler weather.  </li>
            <li> I love the little scoop, and it goes on smooth and never greasy, which is a bonus when you&#x27;re trying to get dressed in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> I did a good amount of research and read a bunch of the reviews, good and bad.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it really does keep me dry and fresh all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even worn it to high cardio gym classes and come out smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li> Through a whole normal day.&lt;br /&gt;Price is great; will likely last</li>
            <li> Once applied, it&#x27;s about equal in effectiveness to the other brand I use, plenty effective enough for an office job, it prevents odor very well, and I feel good about using it, no worry about blocking pores.  </li>
            <li> A LOT followed with some BO from the arm-pits; it&#x27;s natural right!?</li>
            <li> I emailed back letting them know I&#x27;ve been using baking soda based deodorants for years and experienced rashes due to that</li>
            <li> I consistently would have a really</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much unisex.</li>
            <li> Well I put it on after my morning shower and pretty much immediately the burning began.</li>
            <li> Schmidt offers are superior in my opinion to those offered by other brands that prize subtlety over fanfare 3)</li>
            <li> cool all natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased this product and liked it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the consistency of a dry shea butter, with small spatula to scoop out and use, best to scoop into palm to warm and get all the dried pieces to stick together and then rub into under arms.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product through hot weather and really heavy workouts and it stood up quite nicely.   </li>
            <li> Will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> It certainly takes care of the odor, which is why I gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> The jar and miniature plastic trowel are very aesthetically pleasing 1) Application.</li>
            <li> I have tried many natural deodorants and  they left me very embarrassed before the end of the day.</li>
            <li> and i used it very sparingly.</li>
            <li> added some organic coconut oil to it and that really helped but I shouldn&#x27;t have to do that</li>
            <li> After about a month my armpits were very itching.</li>
            <li> I really wish they&#x27;d put it in a stick.</li>
            <li> The remaining two stars, it still doesn&#x27;t take care of sweaty armpits (very embarrassing for a girl) as I still need to keep wiping all day.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re ready to go and you never touched it at all or got it under your fingernails, no need to wash your hands, etc.</li>
            <li> I really like the cedar scent.</li>
            <li> : after a month or two I had to stop using it because it really irritated the skin and made some hairs ingrow severely; something I&#x27;ve never had happen before.  </li>
            <li> regular store bought deodorants filled with aluminum.</li>
            <li> have also tried the lavender and sage and that one is a very powerful&lt;br /&gt;antioxidant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl, and it&#x27;s neither too manly or too girly, it simply smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too much work for deodorant.</li>
            <li> I was REALLY hoping this would be the one for me</li>
            <li> Yes, the best way to use it is to get your hands dirty, but that&#x27;s part of the charm.</li>
            <li> It works really, really well.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> Some may poo poo this concept, but I honestly believe it was my body and armpits detoxing from the decades of aluminum, heavy chemical ridden antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to know that I am not putting harsh chemicals on my body.</li>
            <li> I press it between my fingers for a few seconds to warm it up and then spread.  </li>
            <li> Not bad, just odd, like crushing leaves with your hand.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona and this will be my first summer using it</li>
            <li> After a full day of work and walking and lifting and hoisting people all day, I still smell pretty decent 15 hours later.</li>
            <li> It worked great for the first few tries.</li>
            <li> Not only do my underarms stay fresh smelling, but so do my clothes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since bought all of the other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; of Schmidt&#x27;s and love them all</li>
            <li> and use the FLAT side of the spatula (not the sharpish edge) to smooth it under your pit the way you would frost a cake.</li>
            <li> It holds smelly armpits better than any other deodorant, EVER.</li>
            <li> subtle clean smell even after the end of a long warm day!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and works all day long even in to the next day.</li>
            <li> For some reason after a month of steady use, this started to really irritate my pits.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think my skin would be so sensitive, but this product irritates my skin pretty severely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have no idea about the people who&#x27;ve had rash issues and my skin is pretty sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Keeps me odor free for the workday and relatively dry.</li>
            <li> It does have essential oils in the formula, so those with sensitive skin should try the fragrance free formula.</li>
            <li> desperately needs a bit more of some kind of emulsifier to help it out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I exercise I mainly do cardio:</li>
            <li> I am sure it&#x27;s just me, but I just don&#x27;t get why with such a simple and innocuous ingredient list I am having this problem.</li>
            <li> At first I noticed the tenderness only on particularly hot days</li>
            <li> Either I developed a sensitivity to the ingredients that coincidentally occurred with the exact time I started using the new jar or something has changed.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to everyone.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you have any concern about chemicals so close to breast tissue and lymph nodes.</li>
            <li> -- I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different scents by this company, and this one is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I will try other scents now that I know this stuff isn&#x27;t an overwhelmingly strong scent.</li>
            <li> I do notice it keeps me much dryer than the aluminum filled commercial deodorants that I have used in recent years.</li>
            <li> I like to use natural deodorants, but they don&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li> Once you get past the whole &amp;#34;rubbing cream into your armpits thing&amp;#34; you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> I received a jar of Schmidt&#x27;s as a gift a few weeks ago and I immediately noticed some aspects in which I consider this product to be better than Jungleman: 0)</li>
            <li> : My search for effective natural deodorant has been a long and extensive and all too frequently a smelly godawful journey.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t warm up enough to spread just sitting on my fingers, either, it sort of crumbles against my underarms and falls down.  </li>
            <li> I also wanted to switch something more natural to be true to myself and avoid all the chemicals, but the natural deodorants that I tried would only put in about a half a day&#x27;s job before calling it a day.  </li>
            <li> This was to be the new normal: aluminum-free, baking soda-based deodorant.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent, it blends into my underarms without leaving a white mess, it prevents order but allows my pores to breathe.</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells good and was fairly effective, however it left my skin red and unhappy.</li>
            <li> ; - and I didn&#x27;t tell him it was my new deodorant.</li>
            <li> I might even try new scents someday.</li>
            <li> I forgot that I was trying a new product or that I needed to be worried about it working, if that gives you any idea.</li>
            <li> I am sure it&#x27;s not really that big a deal</li>
            <li> I used to use Old Spice Matterhorn, mainly because it smelled like Ice, Wind, and Freedom.</li>
            <li> You definitely don&#x27;t need very much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, so you still sweat, but if you have a problem with BO and nothing completely covers it up, this is the one for you!</li>
            <li> In the cons column, Schmidt&#x27;s is about 37% more expensive than my next favorite brand however this is negated by the shipping cost since Schmidt&#x27;s is conveniently offered on Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> So I paid closer attention to the directions which calls for the amount of a pea (I barely use that much) and the itching has stopped.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> and I plan on ordering this exact product in the future.</li>
            <li> this is my second jar, the first one was lavander.</li>
            <li> Although I continue to use baby powder on light days, I now use the Schmidt&#x27;s Natural Deodorant on other occasions.  </li>
            <li> My pits stay fresh and mostly dry</li>
            <li> if I used &#x27;natural deodorants.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve thought for the longest time I had a personal issue, which is pretty embarrassing, but along came Schmidt&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This is the first natural deodorant I have found that actually works.</li>
            <li> In addition to being a cute gimmick, the little scraper allows you to carefully calibrate how much deodorant you use.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had problems with sensitive underarm skin, then you might want to be cautious with this brand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe the company will come out with one for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve developed a rash and discoloration.</li>
            <li> I bought this during the winder and knew that summer brings on a whole different set of issues when it comes to perspiration.</li>
            <li> I frequently had to change brands because it seemed like my body would become immune after a month or</li>
            <li> I am looking for a natural deodorant that helps with perspiration and this does not.</li>
            <li> If your skin is at all sensitive, I would pass on this.</li>
            <li> Only con I think of about this is having to put it on with your finger which isn&#x27;t really much of a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I immediately discontinued use of this product, as this was really the only change I had made in my day-to-day life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Often, woodsy scented products are too masculine for me.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s none of the chemical smell that has really bothered me with traditional anti-perspirants.</li>
            <li> I ordered this elsewhere and am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to baking soda deodorants, so I found a way to put it on that keeps my skin from getting irritated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything you want in a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Totally natural.</li>
            <li> I bought three fragrances of Schmidt&#x27;s Natural Deodorant as gifts.  </li>
            <li> I also have fairly sensitive skin (and I wax under my arms), and Schmidt&#x27;s has never irritated me.  </li>
            <li> and so far no problems in the 110 degree heat.</li>
            <li> But so far he loves it.</li>
            <li> (I wanted to switch to natural deodorant</li>
            <li> I just think that I am particularly sensitive to it.</li>
            <li> have not had any irritation from this, and do have reasonably sensitive skin and depilate my underarms.  </li>
            <li> Something in it just doesn&#x27;t like my sensitive underarms.</li>
            <li> For reference, I don&#x27;t typically have sensitive skin, with the exception of minor reactions to cheap metals used in certain jewelry.</li>
            <li> This stuff keeps me dry and smelling good all day long even through some heavy sweating.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was really excited at the prospect of a deodorant that had so few ingredients and all natural.</li>
            <li> Scent: Strong, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> finally, a natural deodorant that actually works!!!&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve been using it for the past few (very warm) days</li>
            <li> I love the subtle fragrance, too.</li>
            <li> worth the money will last a long time</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only does this works but this particular one detoxes and you can&lt;br /&gt;see</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for a deodorant that doesn&#x27;t include harmful ingredients, but still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> No sour armpit smell.</li>
            <li> Fast forward through some strange testing and getting to work at 11:45.</li>
            <li> Normally I just shower and use baby powder (not talc) for lighter activity days and reserve the use of antiperspirants when physical activity is</li>
            <li> This is a very hard task with most natural deodorant in my experience unless I get the stuff with aluminum in it to stop the odor causing sweat.</li>
            <li> I do not use it straight out of the shower while the skin is &amp;#34;open&amp;#34;, though, I wait until it&#x27;s dry and calm, and try to shave or epilate at night, not right before using the deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s so dry and crumbly that you really can&#x27;t even emulsify it in your hands.</li>
            <li> I like fresh smells rather than floral, but this one is just odd.</li>
            <li> One of the few aluminum free deodorants that actually works.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t care that the product is causing this apparently.  </li>
            <li> was the ONLY natural deodorant that didn&#x27;t make me smell like a farm animal.  </li>
            <li> Wow this stuff actually works.</li>
            <li> But i don&#x27;t recommend to use it before or after shaving your armpit it it might burn or give you a rash, use it the next day if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> You see, I&#x27;m a physician in a physical profession and a busy office.</li>
            <li> I have tried several natural deodorants (all reviewed elsewhere) including this one.  </li>
            <li> apparently my wife loves this stuff and keeps reordering it.</li>
            <li> So it lasts a long as normal deodorant.</li>
            <li> I wish it had worked for my body chemistry because I really liked the smell, but unfortunately its not something I can use.</li>
            <li> And unlike so many other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried in the past, it actually works.</li>
            <li> Second, if you have used other natural deodorants, the method of application is perfectly normal for a natural product.  </li>
            <li> I will certainly be buying this product again and am looking forward to trying the other scents.</li>
            <li> Loved the smell of it, but wasn&#x27;t ever able to use it because it was melted in the jar covering up the little spatula and so hard it was too hard a messy.</li>
            <li> Hope this review helps as I have shopped for quite some time to find a deodorant that really works but without the health risks associated with some of that other stuff to include clogged pores.</li>
            <li> Was a bit irritating to my skin, took care of any odors pretty good, but not great.  </li>
            <li> Also, it seemed to work quite well throughout the day which is a big deal, especially for a natural deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have initially tired it during the fall, when the weather wasn&#x27;t so hot, but I&#x27;ve been using it since then during hot days as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is unfortunate because my girlfriend loved the smell of the cedarwood, and as a deodorant, it performed its job as expected.</li>
            <li> To apply it, scrape off some of the deodorant using the spatula and you can either use your fingers to rub it into your armpits or rub it first in between your fingers till it spreads a little bit then use your fingers to apply.</li>
            <li> Small, ovular patches of dry skin started forming first in the armpit area, and quickly spread to other parts of my body.</li>
            <li> I am not overly sensitive to baking soda, as I regularly soak in it and it actually helps to improve my skin overall.</li>
            <li> I sweat pretty heavy</li>
            <li> Typically, I use a small sized amount each time, and I find that using this, on a daily basis, it has lasted for me more than 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used Tom&#x27;s of Maine in the past, and I would dip the top of it in a little baking soda to help deodorize and it worked well.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, despite reading many negative reviews about irritation and painful lumps, I thought I&#x27;ve been using natural baki g soda based deodorants for 9 years</li>
            <li> so I was pleasantly surprised that it kept me mostly dry.</li>
            <li> It seems to work, though, at least as well as more conventional commercial products!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love the way it controls dampness and body odor, but unfortunately, it&#x27;s giving me a pretty bad rash in both armpits.</li>
            <li> I can work hard all day long and still smell clean at the end of the day, I will continue to use this for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Strange little plastic applicator is pretty tiny.</li>
            <li> On a good note, the smell isn&#x27;t bad on my body nor do I stink of BO.</li>
            <li> Too bad, the listed ingredients are natural and I liked the minimalist packaging.</li>
            <li> It lasts throughout the day and while it does not block sweat (you still sweat like you normally do), no sweat odor was apparent until I get home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other natural brands and nothing has worked.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find an all natural deodorant other than the Crystal.  </li>
            <li> I stay fresh all day long, even after a hard gym workout.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several types of all natural deodorant ranging from the salt crystals on down to toms</li>
            <li> It is a little clumpy to put on, but it&#x27;s not hard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s not a bad product, but test it on a small patch of skin to make sure you won&#x27;t have a bad reaction to the ingredients.</li>
            <li> This works very well, but I can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> My husband can&#x27;t use traditional anti-persperant/deodorant because it irritates him and no natural deodorants worked.</li>
            <li> Putting it on is the only drawback, but once you&#x27;ve done that you&#x27;ll be dry all day.</li>
            <li> For a variety of reasons, I don&#x27;t like using regular deodorants everyday, so I was looking for a natural deodorant without harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I even switched to a different brand afterwards- a green, all natural brand.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t too strong and it doesn&#x27;t feel weird.</li>
            <li> It may irritate your underarms slightly for the first few days that you use it</li>
            <li> considering I&#x27;ve only been using this deodorant for a single day, but it&#x27;s been a long, trying day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not very strong, so once I applied it, I can still smell it, but after a couple of hours the odor sort settles down and you can&#x27;t smell it much.</li>
            <li> I really want to give this 5 stars but my skin has been progressively reacting negatively to it.  </li>
            <li> At first I think I was putting on too much because it was making my arm pits itch like crazy.  </li>
            <li> daily.&lt;br /&gt;- natural ingredients, no hormone disruptors or harsh synthetic chemicals</li>
            <li> I wonder if there is no natural ingredient that could be added to make it a bit softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few natural deodorants over the years</li>
            <li> a long time-</li>
            <li> He smelled pretty bad pretty often and people noticed.</li>
            <li> You spray this under your arms and let dry than apply deodorant.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t keep you dry</li>
            <li> This product is non-sticky, so you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to dry, in order to dress after applying.  </li>
            <li> Issue I had is that I felt it increased my sweat, not sure if that was possible, but I prefer other natural brands.</li>
            <li> I would over all highly recommend anyone at least try it</li>
            <li> but it was not too bad, I have tried MANY natural deodorants and none last longer than a few hours or just fail completely leaving me feeling self conscious.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little difficult at times to get an appropriate amount (but the little stick applicator helps obviously)</li>
            <li> The only &#x27;problem&#x27; is that my underarms appear slightly darker</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been sweating less, and I&#x27;ve only had one day where my pits were slightly stinky by the end of the day, but only to my nose.</li>
            <li> Another bonus since switching s that I actually sweat less than when I was using an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I first use the small applicator spoon to scrape a small amount to work with.</li>
            <li> After smudging it around in my palm, the texture changes and becomes a little bit gritty, but I don&#x27;t mind at all because it goes on like a dry cream.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve tried many commercial brands but they all smell too artificial and stringent</li>
            <li> Seriously, an hour into my normal workday and my armpits smelled of embarrassment and shame.</li>
            <li> I work long, long sweaty hours and for the first time in my life I could (if I really had to) re-wear the same shirt again the next day and not smell like horrible BO!</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that you have to scoop it out of the jar with this little spoon thing and rub it on by hand.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with it is that it is in a tub, and while the tub does have a little scoop you still have to rub it in.</li>
            <li> and so I tried a little store from etsy and while it did work it only did so for a day.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how small this jar is but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If you are someone who pushes really hard with a razor or who needs to shave daily, this isn&#x27;t your deodorant and it will likely leave a rash.</li>
            <li> Onto my qualms: I do not have sensitive skin, but for some reason, this deodorant caused me to start developing hard, painful nodules in my armpits (no swollen lymph nodes, even checked with a doctor to be sure), coupled with intense itching (which lead to broken skin).</li>
            <li> The texture is gritty and somewhat firm, not cream-like.</li>
            <li> Which I should have expected, from the name.</li>
            <li> I work construction and have recently worked a few 12-14 hour days.</li>
            <li> Performed as expected</li>
            <li> Now the minus...</li>
            <li> My husband likes the &#x27;woodsy&#x27; scent, but the paste is rather thick compared to the natural brand that I prefer.</li>
            <li> paste itself is not great, it&#x27;s difficult to spread and tends to crumble even in warm weather.  </li>
            <li> This product works every bit as good as dry solids, only without all the harsh and dangerous chemicals!!</li>
            <li> I had tried at least 5 other natural deodorants before I discovered this one.</li>
            <li> A while ago I settled on odorless Jungleman (which I still consider to be a solid choice) and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it bestowed a healthy neutral smell (something just shy of a very faint oatmeal aroma).</li>
            <li> I wanted to post this, as you like me might be too, so if you struggle with other deodorants, please be careful with</li>
            <li> Other brands I have dealt with tend to behave unpredictably in varying temperatures turning alternatively into rock when cold and thick paste when warm.</li>
            <li> Since the base is coconut oil, it also melts very easily.</li>
            <li> The texture is sort of whipped and without grit...and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this eczema for about 3 months now, and it seems to be slowing down, finally, although it is still not completely gone and has left behind scars.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s unclear whether the irritation came from the ingredients being too abrasive or my skin reacting to them, the result is a severe burning and feeling of extreme discomfort under my arms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to the other scents from now on</li>
            <li> however, my armpits turned darker since i started applying deodorant, and I never figured out if it was hormonal or due to some oils they use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order the other scents to try them</li>
            <li> He was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> I have had a bunch of problems with rashes under my armpits due to the chemicals in deodorants.</li>
            <li> First is the smell , it&#x27;s a bit weird</li>
            <li> However, it gradually caused one of my underarms to get irritated like other people have mentioned.   </li>
            <li> Place it in the center of each arm pit and then keep your arms down at your sides for about 30-45 seconds to let it melt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad because I really did like the scent and the idea that this was healthier and natural.</li>
            <li> As much as I would like to give this a 5 star, I am afraid it will only be a three.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re still using conventional aluminum loaded antiperspirants, you need to stop.  </li>
            <li> I really wish I could keep using it, but unfortunately I just can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;- a small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Update on 6/3/2015: We&#x27;ve got the rash and dark pits..total bummer.</li>
            <li> It smells good but it gave me a terrible rash.</li>
            <li> I was turned on to this product by a cancer survivor who is super careful about potentially dangerous chemicals in ordinary products.</li>
            <li> I imagine that the container will last at least a month and a half to two months so don&#x27;t let the $10 price tag scare you.</li>
            <li> I would give my skin a break and try again after it calmed down, and</li>
            <li> However, as other reviewers have noted, this product began to irritate and burn my underarm after using it for a few days.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve just made it to half the bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly less than it used to be though.</li>
            <li> , it smells slightly like the deodorant.</li>
            <li> This literally takes less than 90 seconds each morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not an obsessive armpit shaver, so I&#x27;m not fussed about a slight amount of re-growth,</li>
            <li> do not feel particularly inclined to think that there is anything wrong with the deodorant.</li>
            <li> Worse: they don&#x27;t really mask BO, they just merge with it to make various and sundry unholy alliances that invariably get embedded in expensive clothing.</li>
            <li> I tried two other natural deodorants and smelled worse than if I hadn&#x27;t used any deodorant at all!  </li>
            <li> and you do not have to use you fingers which I thought would turn me off, but someone mentioned to just scrape up the product with the little spatula, then just slide it on your underarm and put your arm down for a few seconds, then spread it around.  </li>
            <li> The texture is a little too dry and hard.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to</li>
            <li> After showering, scoop out a pea size portion using the little spatula.</li>
            <li> SO, then I would rub a little ACV on my pits before using the Toms of Maine/baking soda.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> rub some acv on my pits (I just pour a little in my hand, rub my two hands together then rub each hand under an armpit.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> (Update - apparently my little rant worked.</li>
            <li> Application is a little tricky.  </li>
            <li> Got this a little over a week ago</li>
            <li> some people have already commented on this, I don&#x27;t like that I have to scoop it out with the little stick and apply it with the tips of my fingers.</li>
            <li> I was tidying up a treatment room to discover that a patient had (unnecessarily) left her underwear behind.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the hunt for a natural deodorant is on again...</li>
            <li> I scoop, hold to armpit with spatula, wait few seconds, spread.&lt;br /&gt;Lasting</li>
            <li> The &#x27;little&#x27; (and I mean little) paddle in there for applying deod.</li>
            <li> rubbed my armpits raw.</li>
            <li> Within hours, my underarms felt raw and were stinging with pain.</li>
            <li> used it again last night and in addition to the above mentioned side effects, there were bumps under my skin that became quite painful</li>
            <li> I took it on a trip and it melted in my bag on the drive home, swallowing the little scooper!</li>
            <li> No smelliness, very little sweating.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a small jar with a small spatula for application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Burt&#x27;s Bees, various Tom&#x27;s of Maine, that weird crystal thing and others.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> but the price point of $10 is a bit pricey for a small container.  </li>
            <li> (also it may look small but it lasts you quite awhile.</li>
            <li> The company states that some people may be &amp;#34;sensitive to baking soda&amp;#34; and excessive use of this product could cause a reaction.</li>
            <li> Usually 3 or 4 at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what all the fuss is about using your fingers.</li>
            <li> I also appreciate that they supplied a small spatula to scoop the product out of the jar, so you don&#x27;t get the cream under your fingernails.  </li>
            <li> The paste smelled weird and it left a rash under my arms.</li>
            <li> This past week, I went on vacation and used a travel sized deodorant with no problems.</li>
            <li> but I thought heck if it works I will get past the smell.</li>
            <li> This seriously works on me for about a day and a half to two days, including going to the gym.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll give another scent a go or not.</li>
            <li> and I hate to say he&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, after only a couple of uses my skin was very unhappy, really red and irritated.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical needless to say, but I really wanted a deodorant without those pesky chemicals.  </li>
            <li> bought this scent because at the time it sounded the least &#x27;floral&#x27; and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed however, you will smell EXACTLY like a Christmas tree</li>
            <li> Fragrance is manly and less irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> At this point, my previous deodorant would have abandoned me to the wolves, but alas I was non-stinkified.  </li>
            <li> It keeps me odorless all day and I workout hard every day.</li>
            <li> The seller has changed the heading from \\&quot;organic\\&quot; to \\&quot;natural.\\&quot; That wasn&#x27;t so hard, was it?)</li>
            <li> Because it is hard</li>
            <li> With two children and w husband to manage, I was negligibly late by 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> So, I have to say I am extremely wary of how some of the other ingredients they use may affect the body because whatever it was that caused the eczema has yet to leave</li>
            <li> AND by pressure, I mean , God forbid you break a sweat while wearing this product.</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t think I smelled awful as I had in the past with other natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> After running low, I purchased another jar of the same variety and this time it immediately resulted a nasty rash that slowly abated after I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I have never had this happen before with any natural deodorants :(</li>
            <li> but i got a serious rash from it</li>
            <li> I seriously have a BO problem.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little weird having to rub it into your armpit with fingers</li>
            <li> I decided to try Schmidt&#x27;s again and the painful lumps under the skin came back with the itching.</li>
            <li> Also it was hard to apply and I was resigned to that fact until I switched to this stuff!)</li>
            <li> There is a stick applicator that was very hard to get used too.</li>
            <li> no more stained shirts!!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little inconvenient to use</li>
            <li> Alas-</li>
            <li> But alas, I think it may have come to an end.  </li>
            <li> Overall it has been a quite painful and unpleasant</li>
            <li> Unfortunately putting it on after shaving leaves me with an irritating rash.  </li>
            <li> it, I&#x27;m tired of buying useless deodorant.  </li>
            <li> This is blatant false advertising, which seems to be growing here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> then all of a sudden got a very bad rash under my arm.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the scary chemicals in it</li>
            <li> It was uncomfortable, I got disheartened, but I did not give up given this</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was dubious when my husband picked this one up and said it worked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also uncomfortable to apply since I have nails</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this deodorant, but it works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> I have weird body chemistry</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have not had any ill reactions.</li>
            <li> and the cap was broken!</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> this one too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry Schmidt&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave my pits, sorry</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s absurd, lost 2 stars for that.</li>
            <li> Hard, annoying and time consuming to apply.</li>
            <li> work all day (a/v TECH).&lt;br /&gt;Train at night (mma).&lt;br /&gt;Stuff lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;Only awkward part is applying with your hands that takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> The consistency is like cold butter.</li>
            <li> I have cold hands</li>
            <li> i dont know if its a bad batch or what</li>
            <li> It was bad.</li>
            <li> Heck it&#x27;s even almost painful to rub it in well.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> , I hate to say, horrid, underarm smell</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorant is worthless.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> w painful lumps under both armpits!!  </li>
            <li> I am a woman with a terrible underarm odor problem that&#x27;s disappeard since using this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise when it gave me the worst rash I have ever had.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it three stars because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right for me. The paste certainly smells nice, but it made my underarms itch uncontrollably. If you&#x27;ve had problems with sensitive underarm skin, then you might want to be cautious with this brand. I got it thinking it would be comparable to Primal Pit Paste, but it just isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> For a variety of reasons, I don&#x27;t like using regular deodorants everyday, so I was looking for a natural deodorant without harmful chemicals. Here&#x27;s my breakdown of this one:&lt;br /&gt;1) Odor: It&#x27;s got an aromatic fragrance, close to mastic or some spice. I find it more of a unisex fragrance, neither super feminine nor super masculine. It&#x27;s also not very strong, so once I applied it, I can still smell it, but after a couple of hours the odor sort settles down and you can&#x27;t smell it much. There&#x27;s NO sweat odor too, so don&#x27;t worry.&lt;br /&gt;2) Application: It comes in a small jar with a small spatula for application. The texture is gritty and somewhat firm, not cream-like. To apply it, scrape off some of the deodorant using the spatula and you can either use your fingers to rub it into your armpits or rub it first in between your fingers till it spreads a little bit then use your fingers to apply. I tend to use the latter method, since I have &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; underarms and it&#x27;s easier to apply it that way.&lt;br /&gt;3) Effectiveness: Surprisingly this deodorant worked great for me. I have initially tired it during the fall, when the weather wasn&#x27;t so hot, but I&#x27;ve been using it since then during hot days as well. It lasts throughout the day and while it does not block sweat (you still sweat like you normally do), no sweat odor was apparent until I get home. It can also stay effective till next day if you don&#x27;t shower at night or something.&lt;br /&gt;4) Consumption: Typically, I use a small sized amount each time, and I find that using this, on a daily basis, it has lasted for me more than 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit new to using natural deodorants, but this one would be my favorite if not for the skin irritation is caused. I did a good amount of research and read a bunch of the reviews, good and bad. I didn&#x27;t think my skin would be so sensitive, but this product irritates my skin pretty severely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the scent--it&#x27;s neutral--and I didn&#x27;t mind scooping the product out and applying with my fingers. Also, it seemed to work quite well throughout the day which is a big deal, especially for a natural deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after only a couple of uses my skin was very unhappy, really red and irritated. It was like a big red patch on each armpit. I would give my skin a break and try again after it calmed down, and the same thing kept happening--sometimes my skin seemed chapped as well. Overall it has been a quite painful and unpleasant experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it again last night and in addition to the above mentioned side effects, there were bumps under my skin that became quite painful and I had to remove the deodorant. I&#x27;m going to have to discontinue usage for good now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s not a bad product, but test it on a small patch of skin to make sure you won&#x27;t have a bad reaction to the ingredients. I really wish I could keep using it, but unfortunately I just can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the company will come out with one for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product works every bit as good as dry solids, only without all the harsh and dangerous chemicals!! I love it and will continue to use it!!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST deodorant I&#x27;ve ever had! No just the best natural-the best overall. The scent isn&#x27;t too strong and it doesn&#x27;t feel weird. It&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, so you still sweat, but if you have a problem with BO and nothing completely covers it up, this is the one for you! I&#x27;m never buying another deodorant again.</li>
            <li> A great gift for my father.</li>
            <li> Awesome deodorant, like better than Lavilin.  Husband agrees.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. So happy to have found it. Easy to apply. Takes a little getting used to but I&#x27;m loving the smell and not missing those chemicals since my switch from anti perspirant. Will never go back. Planning to use this product from here on out. After a month of use my body has adjusted and have no issues at all.</li>
            <li> I really want to give this 5 stars but my skin has been progressively reacting negatively to it.  It works great for odor and surprisingly well for wetness but I&#x27;ve developed a rash and discoloration.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!!  I sweat a lot, and can get stinky towards the end of the day.  I have tried all kind of deoderants and antipersperants.  And nothing worked for me.  I saw the ad on facebook so I said what the heck.  Well I am so glad I did,  it works great and you do not have to use you fingers which I thought would turn me off, but someone mentioned to just scrape up the product with the little spatula, then just slide it on your underarm and put your arm down for a few seconds, then spread it around.  Super easy.  Love the scent it is not manly smelling or overpowering.  I ordered the lavendar sage and I am waiting for it to arrive. worth the money will last a long time</li>
            <li> Hey! Person reading this review... this is the best deodorant in the WORLD.  I highly recommend it to everyone.  It doesn&#x27;t have the scary chemicals in it AND IT WORKS!  No smelliness, very little sweating.  I don&#x27;t use all caps lightly, btw.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this deodorant is that it gave me a non-irritating red rash in my armpits. Once I stopped using it, the rash immediately went away. It didn&#x27;t hurt or burn, but I don&#x27;t think I should be using something that causes that on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is unfortunate because my girlfriend loved the smell of the cedarwood, and as a deodorant, it performed its job as expected. I didn&#x27;t mind the application method either. It seems like a jar of this would last for several months. Oh well, on to the next one!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I stay fresh all day long, even after a hard gym workout. I also know that toxins are not flowing through my system. This has a pleasant woodsy and sweet smell and is easy to use. I&#x27;ve had it about 3 to 4 weeks and I&#x27;ve just made it to half the bottle. So it lasts a long as normal deodorant. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong antiperspirant factor, so you will sweat more with it, but this is well worth it still because you don&#x27;t give off an odor even when sweaty. I bought this during the winder and knew that summer brings on a whole different set of issues when it comes to perspiration. I knew that my gym time would be the best indicator of how well this product does and it definitely stood the test.</li>
            <li> Once you get past the whole &amp;#34;rubbing cream into your armpits thing&amp;#34; you&#x27;ll love this. Scent is wonderful, does a great job at keeping me feeling fresh all day.</li>
            <li> So I can rack up a pretty good BO when left unchecked so I need a strong deodorant. In the past I&#x27;ve tried many commercial brands but they all smell too artificial and stringent and I feel like I doused myself in windex. Worse: they don&#x27;t really mask BO, they just merge with it to make various and sundry unholy alliances that invariably get embedded in expensive clothing. A while ago I settled on odorless Jungleman (which I still consider to be a solid choice) and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it bestowed a healthy neutral smell (something just shy of a very faint oatmeal aroma). This was to be the new normal: aluminum-free, baking soda-based deodorant. I received a jar of Schmidt&#x27;s as a gift a few weeks ago and I immediately noticed some aspects in which I consider this product to be better than Jungleman: 0) The presentation. The jar and miniature plastic trowel are very aesthetically pleasing 1) Application. In addition to being a cute gimmick, the little scraper allows you to carefully calibrate how much deodorant you use. This has the dual advantages of parsimony and cleanliness as it reduces the likelihood of staining shirts with excess deodorant 2) Aroma. The available smells Schmidt offers are superior in my opinion to those offered by other brands that prize subtlety over fanfare 3) Temperature resistant. Other brands I have dealt with tend to behave unpredictably in varying temperatures turning alternatively into rock when cold and thick paste when warm. Even if this were to occur with a jar of Schmidt&#x27;s, the unique application technique would prevent messiness. In the cons column, Schmidt&#x27;s is about 37% more expensive than my next favorite brand however this is negated by the shipping cost since Schmidt&#x27;s is conveniently offered on Amazon Prime. I have tested this in both day-to-day (office, etc) and sports (running, team sports) and I have been very happy with results across the board</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks.  At first I think I was putting on too much because it was making my arm pits itch like crazy.  So I paid closer attention to the directions which calls for the amount of a pea (I barely use that much) and the itching has stopped.  You definitely don&#x27;t need very much.  I am a teacher and waitress and was worried about how it would hold up after an entire day with middle school students and then a 5 hr shift at the restaurant.  I did not re-apply before my 2nd job, and it held up great!  I had two people do the sniff test on me after I got home, and both approved.  Granted, I did sweat, because this is not an antiperspirant, but I did not smell.  When I was using regular antiperspirant, I always had the mid-day overused armpit smell (as if the antiperspirant had given up).  Re-applying seemed to only enhance the smell.  I frequently had to change brands because it seemed like my body would become immune after a month or two.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line...if you don&#x27;t mind having occasional sweaty armpits...this product is WONDERFUL!  So glad I decided to try it out!</li>
            <li> It may irritate your underarms slightly for the first few days that you use it but it was not too bad, I have tried MANY natural deodorants and none last longer than a few hours or just fail completely leaving me feeling self conscious. This actually works!! I can work hard all day long and still smell clean at the end of the day, I will continue to use this for the rest of my life. I was surprised at how small this jar is but a little goes a long way. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have tried many natural deodorants and  they left me very embarrassed before the end of the day. I tried the cedar wood and juniper for one week. I did still sweat but I did not stink. I do notice it keeps me much dryer than the aluminum filled commercial deodorants that I have used in recent years. It does have essential oils in the formula, so those with sensitive skin should try the fragrance free formula.</li>
            <li> WOW! I work long, long sweaty hours and for the first time in my life I could (if I really had to) re-wear the same shirt again the next day and not smell like horrible BO! Thats how good this stuff is!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this in several different scents.  The best advice that I can give is:  If you get a rash let your skin heal and than mix 1/2 tbs of apple vinegar with 1/2 C of distilled water and put in a little spray bottle.  You spray this under your arms and let dry than apply deodorant.  The reason that you might has a reaction is because baking soda is used in this product and it&#x27;s very basic, so you need to add an acid (apple vinegar).  Just basic chemistry!  Also, warm the product between your fingers so that it applies easily.</li>
            <li> This stuff works so well, and it smells amazing! I have tried several different scents by this company, and this one is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Smells great; works well.  no more stained shirts!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, despite reading many negative reviews about irritation and painful lumps, I thought I&#x27;ve been using natural baki g soda based deodorants for 9 years so surely this won&#x27;t happen to me.  I order the deodorant from the actual Schmidt&#x27;s site, get it and start using it.  It works great, then after a few weeks sure enough I wake up one morning w painful lumps under both armpits!!  I contacted the company via email and they showed no concern suggested it was the baking soda.  I emailed back letting them know I&#x27;ve been using baking soda based deodorants for years and experienced rashes due to that when I first switched, this wasn&#x27;t a baking soda irritation.  I also told them about the numerous amounts of reviews saying the same issues had occurred and Schmidt&#x27;s never ever responded!!!  They don&#x27;t care that the product is causing this apparently.  I would never ever recommend them, I have since switched to primal pit paste, amazing, works great, no lumps!!  Great customer service!!</li>
            <li> It is kinda a pain to put on as it doesn&#x27;t spread very easily. But I will finish it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing...&lt;br /&gt;I work all day (a/v TECH).&lt;br /&gt;Train at night (mma).&lt;br /&gt;Stuff lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;Only awkward part is applying with your hands that takes some getting used to. But my wife and I both use this stuff (different scents).&lt;br /&gt; try it... Works great!</li>
            <li> I am looking for a natural deodorant that helps with perspiration and this does not. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> works excellently.  Will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> Great smelling product, but... i dont know if its a bad batch or what but i got a serious rash from it and i used it very sparingly.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is manly and less irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other natural brands and nothing has worked. This product has been effective thus far. I would highly recommend it and I plan on ordering this exact product in the future.</li>
            <li> This is INCREDIBLE! I have tried all sorts of different types of natural deodorant and none have done a very good job. I am so pleased to say that this works great (and smells even better!)</li>
            <li> By far the best all natural deoderant out there and I&#x27;ve tried them all (it seems). Only con is you have to scoop it out of the jar and apply. But u can wipe ur hand on a towel and go. No need to wash and there won&#x27;t be any of that chemical residue on your hand like the mainstream stuff.</li>
            <li> All I can say is, FINALLY! YESSS! I&#x27;ve been battling with knowing the evils of aluminum based deodorant and bodily odor for 13years+!  I&#x27;ve tried Tom&#x27;s, the Crystal Deodorant, you name it and IT. DID. NOT. WORK.  I consistently would have a really, I hate to say, horrid, underarm smell if I used &#x27;natural deodorants.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve thought for the longest time I had a personal issue, which is pretty embarrassing, but along came Schmidt&#x27;s and I feel liberated!  Not only do my underarms stay fresh smelling, but so do my clothes! I DID experience an underarm rash for about a week when I first started using the Cedarwood + Juniper deodorant.  It was uncomfortable, I got disheartened, but I did not give up given this was the ONLY natural deodorant that didn&#x27;t make me smell like a farm animal.  After sticking the discomfort out for about a week, I no longer had the irritation I did when I first started using Schmidt&#x27;s.  Some may poo poo this concept, but I honestly believe it was my body and armpits detoxing from the decades of aluminum, heavy chemical ridden antiperspirants. Today, I do not have any irritation, whatsoever- just nice smelling armpits :)  .  I&#x27;ve since bought all of the other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; of Schmidt&#x27;s and love them all (however, I still Love Cedarwood&#x27;s scent). FYI- I did NOT get this product to curb sweating.  I was, am, and always will be a sweater, so there is no product that will halt this.... (plus, sweating has a purpose!) :)</li>
            <li> I seriously have a BO problem. I used a french clay deodorant for a couple of years and my body somehow got smellier. This deodorant is magical. Somehow, after I put it on, my pits don&#x27;t reek. Thanks, Schmidt&#x27;s, for making a superior body product.</li>
            <li> I gave this two stars because while it did it&#x27;s job as a deodorant it also did an additional job: rubbed my armpits raw. While it&#x27;s unclear whether the irritation came from the ingredients being too abrasive or my skin reacting to them, the result is a severe burning and feeling of extreme discomfort under my arms. If your skin is at all sensitive, I would pass on this.</li>
            <li> This product has lots of potential. The scent is very pleasant and the product does seem to work well but the big drawback is the usability or spreadability.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so dry and crumbly that you really can&#x27;t even emulsify it in your hands. It&#x27;s just like a gritty chalk and then it won&#x27;t spread well under your arms. Heck it&#x27;s even almost painful to rub it in well.&lt;br /&gt;It desperately needs a bit more of some kind of emulsifier to help it out.&lt;br /&gt;I added some organic coconut oil to it and that really helped but I shouldn&#x27;t have to do that so even though I like the scent and the performance of the product. I don&#x27;t think I will be likely to buy again.</li>
            <li> The scent, the lasting power, and the very pleasant feel all make this product unbelievably good.  I quickly got used to the method of application. After smudging it around in my palm, the texture changes and becomes a little bit gritty, but I don&#x27;t mind at all because it goes on like a dry cream.</li>
            <li> Smells great and really works! It&#x27;s nice to know that I am not putting harsh chemicals on my body. Will get it again.</li>
            <li> I love it, except that it seems to be dying my armpits brownish... which is weird...</li>
            <li> I used this product for about a month. There is a stick applicator that was very hard to get used too. After about a month my armpits were very itching. Final the last time I used it my armpits were burning for the entire day. The next day I used another product from another company and never had the itchy or burning feeling again. So this product made me have a rash and it was only about a month of using it. I will not buy it ever again. I would give it another shot but having that burning feeling is not something I want to have again so in the trash it goes.</li>
            <li> Take a little getting used to, applying th eproduct with your fingers, but it works well and the cedar/juniper fragrance is great.</li>
            <li> I like the way this works but it&#x27;s a little inconvenient to use and it smells much better than most deodorants.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for a deodorant that doesn&#x27;t include harmful ingredients, but still gets the job done. I&#x27;ve tried Burt&#x27;s Bees, various Tom&#x27;s of Maine, that weird crystal thing and others. None of them worked for me. Needless to say, I was dubious when my husband picked this one up and said it worked. But, he was right. It keeps me smelling fresh all day. And, the Cedarwood and Juniper scent is lovely. The only drawback is that you have to scoop it out of the jar with this little spoon thing and rub it on by hand. I really wish they&#x27;d put it in a stick. But, it&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> It certainly takes care of the odor, which is why I gave it 3 stars. The remaining two stars, it still doesn&#x27;t take care of sweaty armpits (very embarrassing for a girl) as I still need to keep wiping all day. It&#x27;s certainly less than it used to be though. It&#x27;s also uncomfortable to apply since I have nails and it doesn&#x27;t rub off that easily.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find an all natural deodorant other than the Crystal.  I found that this product works great on me and I would buy this again but the price point of $10 is a bit pricey for a small container.  I didn&#x27;t have a reaction to this product as I had with using Toms of Maine.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this deodorant. It took me the entire jar to get used to smearing it on with my fingers. I even switched to a different brand afterwards- a green, all natural brand. But I&#x27;ve returned to this one. It keeps me odorless all day and I workout hard every day. I fully recommend it to anyone trying to protect themselves from odor and harmful chemicals. This is a very good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 4 months ago, and started using it after one of my deodorants ran out. When I exercise I mainly do cardio: Running/Jogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I run, I sweat, A LOT followed with some BO from the arm-pits; it&#x27;s natural right!? Anyways, it has a good smell to it kind of limey or somewhere along the lines of citrusy. When I start sweating from my arm-pits I can feel the sweat but it doesn&#x27;t smell like BO, it smells slightly like the deodorant. Which is a good thing. My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive so this is perfect from my point of view. Only con I think of about this is having to put it on with your finger which isn&#x27;t really much of a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will order again once my current one runs out. (also it may look small but it lasts you quite awhile.</li>
            <li> Broke out my underarms after the second day.</li>
            <li> My husband likes the &#x27;woodsy&#x27; scent, but the paste is rather thick compared to the natural brand that I prefer.</li>
            <li> Nice smell and really does work well. Yes, it&#x27;s a little weird having to rub it into your armpit with fingers but it&#x27;s also kind of nice to control the amount you use. Store brand deodorants make me itch and get a rash, this one does not.</li>
            <li> At first, I loved this deodorant. However, after a month of using the directed amount once per day, my body started developing discoid eczema. I have never had discoid eczema before. Small, ovular patches of dry skin started forming first in the armpit area, and quickly spread to other parts of my body. I immediately discontinued use of this product, as this was really the only change I had made in my day-to-day life. I&#x27;ve had this eczema for about 3 months now, and it seems to be slowing down, finally, although it is still not completely gone and has left behind scars. The company states that some people may be &amp;#34;sensitive to baking soda&amp;#34; and excessive use of this product could cause a reaction. I am not overly sensitive to baking soda, as I regularly soak in it and it actually helps to improve my skin overall. So, I have to say I am extremely wary of how some of the other ingredients they use may affect the body because whatever it was that caused the eczema has yet to leave so it seems as though it is fat-soluble and can stay in the body for extended periods of time, even after use of this product is discontinued.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this deodorant.  I have been searching everywhere for an all natural product that keeps me dry, smells good, and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes.  THIS IS IT.  I have no idea about the people who&#x27;ve had rash issues and my skin is pretty sensitive.  I&#x27;m just head over heels for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Often, woodsy scented products are too masculine for me.  I love that this is balanced in a way that doesn&#x27;t remind me of the Brawny paper towel guy.  And it works so well.  I went for a hike midday with a temp in the 90s, came home, and demanded my husband smell my armpit to prove how well it worked...and he totally agrees.  I&#x27;ve had no clothes issues.  The texture is sort of whipped and without grit...and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A nice fragrance but another one in the line that doesnt easily wash out of shirts.  Short lived odor protection, good for cooler weather but not for hot.</li>
            <li> I will never use regular deody again. love this stuff. works great</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products, and this anti-perspirant/deodorant is excellent! Putting it on is the only drawback, but once you&#x27;ve done that you&#x27;ll be dry all day. The scents are very pleasant but don&#x27;t really last (which I like). There&#x27;s none of the chemical smell that has really bothered me with traditional anti-perspirants. Well worth trying!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it works well when I can wear it.  Unfortunately putting it on after shaving leaves me with an irritating rash.  Would recommend this product if you don&#x27;t feel you will have the same issue.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased this product and liked it. After running low, I purchased another jar of the same variety and this time it immediately resulted a nasty rash that slowly abated after I stopped using it. I emailed the company and they responded very quickly saying that they had not changed their formula. Either I developed a sensitivity to the ingredients that coincidentally occurred with the exact time I started using the new jar or something has changed. Too bad, the listed ingredients are natural and I liked the minimalist packaging. Still, I&#x27;m going to discard this as unusable.</li>
            <li> Great deodorant!  Hubby and I both use it.  The combination of ingredients makes for a perfect blend.  It&#x27;s very easy to apply - not messy or greasy.  Stays on all day and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Just got it and used s Couple times, seems to work really good for me.... subtle clean smell even after the end of a long warm day!</li>
            <li> PRO:&lt;br /&gt;- Cedarwood and Juniper scent is woodsy and manly without being too musky or strong&lt;br /&gt;- a small amount goes a long way.  The jar looks like it would last ~2 months if I kept using it daily.&lt;br /&gt;- natural ingredients, no hormone disruptors or harsh synthetic chemicals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;- Suspect it has a lot of baking soda compared to similar products.  Schmidt&#x27;s gave me a fierce puffy red rash and I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an all natural kinda gal and would rather not wear any deodorant than put some toxic chemical on my armpits to smell good. This said, I like this deodorant because the ingredients are fine. But the smell (I got the Cedarwood &amp; Juniper) is just not quite right. My husband said it smelled like an air freshener. I like fresh smells rather than floral, but this one is just odd. Not bad, just odd, like crushing leaves with your hand. Nothing refreshing about the smell, just very tree-ey. Which I should have expected, from the name.</li>
            <li> Loved the smell of it, but wasn&#x27;t ever able to use it because it was melted in the jar covering up the little spatula and so hard it was too hard a messy. I would have preferred it in a roll on, so I will just be making my own.</li>
            <li> I am a woman with a terrible underarm odor problem that&#x27;s disappeard since using this deodorant. I love the subtle fragrance, too. The only &#x27;problem&#x27; is that my underarms appear slightly darker but it&#x27;s not a rash and it doesn&#x27;t sting or hurt in any way so I&#x27;ll keep using this product and the same goes for their Juniper fragranced deodorant.</li>
            <li> The only deodorant that works for us! Will buy again and again. Usually 3 or 4 at a time.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on the Carol Alt show on Fox.  Glad I had because they conveyed all the pertinent information about its use.&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent of this and am enjoying using it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this elsewhere and am pleasantly surprised. Like others, mine had melted in transit and was sideways in the jar - who cares? This doesn&#x27;t seem to have affected the product. My boyfriend commented on the scent - &amp;#34;mmm, you smell good&amp;#34; - and I didn&#x27;t tell him it was my new deodorant. I was fresh out of the shower. I&#x27;m not sure what all the fuss is about using your fingers. You totally DON&#x27;T need to touch the product with your hands AT ALL. After showering, scoop out a pea size portion using the little spatula. Place it in the center of each arm pit and then keep your arms down at your sides for about 30-45 seconds to let it melt. Now raise your arm over your head (the product will be creamy and won&#x27;t fall off on the floor!) and use the FLAT side of the spatula (not the sharpish edge) to smooth it under your pit the way you would frost a cake. Voila! You&#x27;re ready to go and you never touched it at all or got it under your fingernails, no need to wash your hands, etc. This literally takes less than 90 seconds each morning. I noticed that my clothes smell fragrant under the armpit at the end of the day - like Cedarwood + Juniper. No sour armpit smell. It won&#x27;t keep you dry but if you want to be chemical free and shower fresh all day it really works nicely!</li>
            <li> This product kind of smells like weed, but I don&#x27;t stink and it&#x27;s HOT today.</li>
            <li> I tried two other natural deodorants and smelled worse than if I hadn&#x27;t used any deodorant at all!  It smells good and it works.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is I have to rub it in my hands and then on my skin.  I wish it came in a roll on or something easier.</li>
            <li> One of the few aluminum free deodorants that actually works. I&#x27;ve found it works well for the entire day in the winter but in the summer requires a second application after work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had such a great experience with Schmidt&#x27;s deodorant that I&#x27;ve tried all the scents. My top three, in order, are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Cedarwood&lt;br /&gt;2. Lime&lt;br /&gt;3. Lavender&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this one the best because of it&#x27;s scent. I believe it to be the most masculine of the bunch. AND this stuff really works! A lot of people don&#x27;t like the idea of applying deodorant with their hands, but you get used to it! Make sure to rub a pea sized amount until its warmed and softened and then simply slather it on! A little bit goes a long way. Unless I&#x27;m doing intense exercise, I&#x27;ve found that this product effectively deodorizes without reapplication over the course of a day.</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff actually works. Keeps me odor free for the workday and relatively dry.</li>
            <li> Use a frozen yogurt spoon- you know, the ones from Yogurtland to apply this deodorant. The thick pliable spoon is the perfect applicator and it comes in many colors and it&#x27;s free.</li>
            <li> I work construction and have recently worked a few 12-14 hour days. I put this on in the morning right before I leave for work and have had no issues. I plan to continue using this.</li>
            <li> I like to use natural deodorants, but they don&#x27;t work very well.  I have used Tom&#x27;s of Maine in the past, and I would dip the top of it in a little baking soda to help deodorize and it worked well. But then I would get a rash from the baking soda as it screws up the ph balance of your skin. SO, then I would rub a little ACV on my pits before using the Toms of Maine/baking soda.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works even better then my the TOM/Baking Soda and it smells great.  It absorbs some perspiration, I guess the arrowroot powder does that.  It is a little clumpy to put on, but it&#x27;s not hard. I just rub it on and then wash my hands.  I was getting a rash from this stuff as well (from the baking soda I think).  so I still do the acv on the pits before putting it on. I love it! I have tried to get my husband to try it, but he prefers the toxic/spray/smelly things.  oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 10/23/14. I still have this product and have an easy/new way to put it on.  it works better than even my deodorants that are full of chemicals. My skin is sensitive to baking soda deodorants, so I found a way to put it on that keeps my skin from getting irritated.&lt;br /&gt;1. rub some acv on my pits (I just pour a little in my hand, rub my two hands together then rub each hand under an armpit.&lt;br /&gt;2. Blow dry my armpits on warm until my skin is dry.&lt;br /&gt;3. rub some coconut oil on each armpit. this helps protect my skin from the baking soda, and it also makes it easier to apply the deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;4. rub deodorant on each armpit.</li>
            <li> A favorite discovery!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff EVER! Smells amazing and works all day long even in to the next day. I have never found a better natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product. It smelled great while packed inside the small jar. However, it doesn&#x27;t hold well under pressure. AND by pressure, I mean , God forbid you break a sweat while wearing this product. Seriously, an hour into my normal workday and my armpits smelled of embarrassment and shame. Luckily, I had my trusty backup deodorant!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this deodorant, but it works like a charm.  I&#x27;ve even worn it to high cardio gym classes and come out smelling fresh.  As others describe, you do have to rub the deodorant on with your fingers, but this isn&#x27;t a problem for me.  I press it between my fingers for a few seconds to warm it up and then spread.  It&#x27;s very effective and smells lovely.  I will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> It holds smelly armpits better than any other deodorant, EVER. But i don&#x27;t recommend to use it before or after shaving your armpit it it might burn or give you a rash, use it the next day if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Best natural product ever!  I can workout in morning and go all day and night without stinking.  Amazing!  And no cancer causing chemicals</li>
            <li> Everything you want in a natural deodorant. Lasts about 9 to 10 hours but during those hours I smell good.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural deodorant I have tried. It lasts the longest, and it does not sting after shaving. The formula also blends in smoothly into my skin. I really like the cedar scent. It&#x27;s woodsy and not manly. I personally do not like floral or powder scents which are marketed towards women.</li>
            <li> I had a time spreading it</li>
            <li> Great product. Totally natural.</li>
            <li> No offense to the company but this smelled like bug spray....I can&#x27;t say how effective it is because I couldn&#x27;t bear thought of using it.  I would probably try the lime next time, but had to return this one.</li>
            <li> This product is okay  but I had to use it more often than stated  It could just be me  I have weird body chemistry</li>
            <li> I bought three fragrances of Schmidt&#x27;s Natural Deodorant as gifts.  She loves them and they smell nice.  A little goes a long way.  I&#x27;m sure she will be buying these again.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Works all day.</li>
            <li> I bought this scent for my husband since I have used this deodorant for a while. I love the product but my husband won&#x27;t use it because he says this scent smells like a hamster&#x27;s cage.(the cedar shavings) and I hate to say he&#x27;s right. I&#x27;ll stick to the other scents from now on</li>
            <li> Works really well, easy to apply, amazing smell, zero irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: after a month or two I had to stop using it because it really irritated the skin and made some hairs ingrow severely; something I&#x27;ve never had happen before.  Alas- I used the rest of it as a foot deodorant/moisturizer- and for that, it&#x27;s brilliant!</li>
            <li> Cruelty free and smells great!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells GREAT! And unlike so many other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried in the past, it actually works. This stuff keeps me dry and smelling good all day long even through some heavy sweating. I will certainly be buying this product again and am looking forward to trying the other scents. I hope they are a s nice as this one.  Edit: For some reason after a month of steady use, this started to really irritate my pits. I am sure it&#x27;s just me, but I just don&#x27;t get why with such a simple and innocuous ingredient list I am having this problem. Maybe my pits just like the toxic substances better?!?</li>
            <li> this is my second jar, the first one was lavander. i like them both. i used them during pregnancy and was very happy with the mild and lasting scent. however, my armpits turned darker since i started applying deodorant, and I never figured out if it was hormonal or due to some oils they use. be aware of this.</li>
            <li> finally, a natural deodorant that actually works!!!&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve been using it for the past few (very warm) days and it&#x27;s terrific!</li>
            <li> This works amazing! I love the smell and it really does keep me dry and fresh all day. I would recommend this product to everyone. I sweat pretty heavy so I was pleasantly surprised that it kept me mostly dry.</li>
            <li> Well,  I smell better with no deodorant after a day than with this.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and works great.</li>
            <li> I love the smell so much! It totally works, everything was great until 3 weeks in it gave me a red bumpy itchy flakey rash. Bummer. I have never had this happen before with any natural deodorants :(</li>
            <li> This is a great deodorant! Keep in mind that it is a deodorant not an antiperspirant so you will still sweat. The smell is pleasant but not strong, I don&#x27;t like to smell by deodorant all day. Works all day and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes, I was worried about the oil in it.</li>
            <li> I was turned on to this product by a cancer survivor who is super careful about potentially dangerous chemicals in ordinary products. This one contains nothing that would alarm her and it smells good -- like cedar or juniper, kind of earthy &amp; organic &amp; (mildly) fragrant, like a cedar chest that has just been opened. The consistency is like cold butter. You dig it out with a fingernail, rub it between your fingers to soften it up, and rub it into your armpits for a deodorant. This would be a bit easier if the stuff were creamier to begin with... I wonder if there is no natural ingredient that could be added to make it a bit softer. The same stuff in a slightly larger container with a bit more filler would be &amp;#34;even&amp;#34; better. It seems to work, though, at least as well as more conventional commercial products! I like it, but probably will try something else next time because of the consistency.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. I am stink free. The only issue I have with it is that it is in a tub, and while the tub does have a little scoop you still have to rub it in. Since the base is coconut oil, it also melts very easily. I took it on a trip and it melted in my bag on the drive home, swallowing the little scooper!</li>
            <li> Not practical to use.</li>
            <li> The most pleasant to use and most effective of all the natural deodorants I have tried.  Love the fragrance too.  This product is non-sticky, so you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to dry, in order to dress after applying.  I also appreciate that they supplied a small spatula to scoop the product out of the jar, so you don&#x27;t get the cream under your fingernails.  Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Smell was very earthy, which I liked.  It&#x27;s the consistency of a dry shea butter, with small spatula to scoop out and use, best to scoop into palm to warm and get all the dried pieces to stick together and then rub into under arms.  Was a bit irritating to my skin, took care of any odors pretty good, but not great.  Issue I had is that I felt it increased my sweat, not sure if that was possible, but I prefer other natural brands.</li>
            <li> This is blatant false advertising, which seems to be growing here on Amazon. This is NOT an organic deodorant! It contains NO organic ingredients. \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; is NOT the same as organic. (Update - apparently my little rant worked. The seller has changed the heading from \\&quot;organic\\&quot; to \\&quot;natural.\\&quot; That wasn&#x27;t so hard, was it?)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few natural deodorants over the years and I&#x27;ve never had any work as well as this one. It has a nice scent, it blends into my underarms without leaving a white mess, it prevents order but allows my pores to breathe. I feel more confident using this than regular store bought deodorants filled with aluminum. If you&#x27;re looking for a good natural deodorant that will do what you hope it does, this is the one. I&#x27;m going to order the other scents to try them (I currently use Cedarwood and Juniper, which is a great unisex scent) and I will be ordering some for family that I think will like it as well.</li>
            <li> It smells good but it gave me a terrible rash.</li>
            <li> stains the clothes! cumbersome to apply</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. The paste smelled weird and it left a rash under my arms. Not to mention the wafting snell I got from my underarms.</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Hard, annoying and time consuming to apply. If it were only that, I would adjust, but the product irritates my skin. Unfortunately I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product</li>
            <li> nice packaging&lt;br /&gt;nice smell&lt;br /&gt;lasts a long time- 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;weird application but you get used to it&lt;br /&gt;I would say- not for the super hairy armpit</li>
            <li> This did not have the cedar sent I was looking for</li>
            <li> They really should advertise so other will know how great this is.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this works but this particular one detoxes and you can&lt;br /&gt;see the impurities come of on your wash cloth.&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried the lavender and sage and that one is a very powerful&lt;br /&gt;antioxidant.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. My husband can&#x27;t use traditional anti-persperant/deodorant because it irritates him and no natural deodorants worked. He smelled pretty bad pretty often and people noticed. It was bad. This deodorant is amazing and I cannot believe how great it works. I highly recommend this. I tried it too and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Update: I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant on a daily basis for over a week and it&#x27;s been fantastic. I&#x27;ve been sweating less, and I&#x27;ve only had one day where my pits were slightly stinky by the end of the day, but only to my nose. I had my husband and kids smell me and they didn&#x27;t think I smelled awful as I had in the past with other natural deodorants. I am so pleased with this product. I have not had any ill reactions. No itchiness, no red bumps, nothing amiss. I&#x27;ve used the product through hot weather and really heavy workouts and it stood up quite nicely.   Original review: My search for effective natural deodorant has been a long and extensive and all too frequently a smelly godawful journey. But alas, I think it may have come to an end.  Perhaps my joy is slightly premature considering I&#x27;ve only been using this deodorant for a single day, but it&#x27;s been a long, trying day.  I woke up at 5:30am with the intention of being on time for a 7:30am doctors appointment. With two children and w husband to manage, I was negligibly late by 5 minutes. I had applied this magical deodorant around 6am and found that by 7:30 I was still smelling fresh and odor free.  Fast forward through some strange testing and getting to work at 11:45. Still smelling fresh through my commute that involved 80 degree heat and some walking. At this point, my previous deodorant would have abandoned me to the wolves, but alas I was non-stinkified.  You see, I&#x27;m a physician in a physical profession and a busy office. I was tidying up a treatment room to discover that a patient had (unnecessarily) left her underwear behind. Naturally, the child in me burst into fits of laughter leaving me warm but still, not stinky. How does someone forget to put their underthings back on?!  After a full day of work and walking and lifting and hoisting people all day, I still smell pretty decent 15 hours later. I truly hope this trend lasts, cuz dang it, I&#x27;m tired of buying useless deodorant.  Just buy this stuff. Also, I went with the cedar wood scent. It&#x27;s pretty much unisex.</li>
            <li> I have been making my own deodorant for years (coconut oil, baking soda, arrowroot powder), but I wanted to try this one because it&#x27;s in solid form, and the one I make is effective, but a bit greasy.  I purchased the cedarwood and juniper, and I love love love the scent! I&#x27;m a girl, and it&#x27;s neither too manly or too girly, it simply smells fantastic.  I love the little scoop, and it goes on smooth and never greasy, which is a bonus when you&#x27;re trying to get dressed in a hurry.  For me, it&#x27;s effective from 8 hours on a hot active day, to almost 24 hours in cooler weather.  I love it. If you&#x27;re still using conventional aluminum loaded antiperspirants, you need to stop.  Schmidt&#x27;s is the best natural deodorant I have used. I also have fairly sensitive skin (and I wax under my arms), and Schmidt&#x27;s has never irritated me.  This is also a great price, I have been using it for a month and barely made a dent in the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Butyrospermum parkii (shea butter), Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), Maranta arundinacea (arrowroot) powder, Theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, Cedrus deodara (Himalayan cedar) essential oil, Tocopherol (vitamin E), Juniperus (juniper) essential oil, Humulus lupulus (hop) extract</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to. I find it best to apply to the palm of my hand and run it so it melts then place on underarms. Rubbing between fingers causing it to fall all over the floor. Smells really nice too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan. It is not practical, in my opinion. It has to be scooped out by either a tool or your fingers, then warmed up in your hand, then spread over your underarms. It&#x27;s too much work for deodorant. For the price, it should come in an easier to apply format. I&#x27;d not recommend or buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright.  Not life changing or earth shaking but my pits don&#x27;t smell so I feel swell. Performed as expected</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells good and was fairly effective, however it left my skin red and unhappy. At first I noticed the tenderness only on particularly hot days and I could mostly ignore it, but it became increasingly uncomfortable. This past week, I went on vacation and used a travel sized deodorant with no problems. When I got home, I showered and put this Schmidt&#x27;s deodorant on. Within hours, my underarms felt raw and were stinging with pain. I chucked my Schmidt&#x27;s in the trash. It&#x27;s too bad because I really did like the scent and the idea that this was healthier and natural. For reference, I don&#x27;t typically have sensitive skin, with the exception of minor reactions to cheap metals used in certain jewelry.</li>
            <li> I like that this is all natural, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be really effective without having to apply more throughout the day.  The &#x27;little&#x27; (and I mean little) paddle in there for applying deod. didn&#x27;t sit too well with me.  I just used my fingers after softening it up some.  It&#x27;s just o.k., but will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I loved this for the first couple weeks  then I started to get pimpLes,  break outs, and origin had to go back to the stone! !</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant for about 9 months now and could not be more pleased. I had tried at least 5 other natural deodorants before I discovered this one. I live in Arizona and this will be my first summer using it and so far no problems in the 110 degree heat. Another bonus since switching s that I actually sweat less than when I was using an antiperspirant. Go figure?! Got this one for the hubby and no complaints from him. Smells manly and my husband is never stinky.</li>
            <li> Great product with non-toxic ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a non-irritating deodorant and have found it. It smells amazingly good and is gentle on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Kudos!</li>
            <li> This is the best natural deodorant I have used. The consistency and method of application are fine, and it works very well. Onto my qualms: I do not have sensitive skin, but for some reason, this deodorant caused me to start developing hard, painful nodules in my armpits (no swollen lymph nodes, even checked with a doctor to be sure), coupled with intense itching (which lead to broken skin). This started after about 2 weeks of use. I stopped using it and switched back to the aluminum-gunk. Bumps went away within a week or so and my skin healed. I decided to try Schmidt&#x27;s again and the painful lumps under the skin came back with the itching. Unfortunately the hunt for a natural deodorant is on again...</li>
            <li> Product was delivered wrapped in bubble wrap and inside of a box - all of that and the cap was broken! Strange little plastic applicator is pretty tiny. Otherwise I like the actual product. Smells nice (if you like earthy smells) and works as promised.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of deodorant products that disrupt the body&#x27;s sweat response with aluminum chlorohydrate. However, I don&#x27;t want to offend others by smelling primitive! Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorant is worthless. &amp;#34;24 Hour Protection&amp;#34; should read, &amp;#34;24 Minute Protection&amp;#34; (after your armpits stop foaming up)! Mineral salt deodorant works well for me, but you have to run it under water and then wait for you pits to dry (who has that kind of time?). My wife sent me a link to Schmidt&#x27;s and I thought, &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34; I have to admit that when I saw the tiny spatula in one of the item pictures, I imagined buttering my armpits like a piece of toast or spreading an odor arresting frosting on a layer cake. I was wrong. You scoop out a pea-sized amount of the product, warm it with your fingers and spread it over the underarm area. While the process is not what one would consider glamorous, I have to testify that the stuff works and works well! Added bonus - I smell sawmill! Thank you Schmidt&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. He was skeptical at first. But so far he loves it. He says it works great and he still smell good at the end of the day!!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical needless to say, but I really wanted a deodorant without those pesky chemicals.  Normally I just shower and use baby powder (not talc) for lighter activity days and reserve the use of antiperspirants when physical activity is greater or longer wear is needed.  Although I continue to use baby powder on light days, I now use the Schmidt&#x27;s Natural Deodorant on other occasions.  I&#x27;m very happy with the odor control.  Application is a little tricky.  Scoop some, then rub between fingers to soften, then apply.  Highly recommended if you have any concern about chemicals so close to breast tissue and lymph nodes.</li>
            <li> Armpits are red and on FIRE!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. (I wanted to switch to natural deodorant and so I tried a little store from etsy and while it did work it only did so for a day. Also it was hard to apply and I was resigned to that fact until I switched to this stuff!) Because it is hard it&#x27;s a little difficult at times to get an appropriate amount (but the little stick applicator helps obviously) but I am in love with the smell. Not only that but it works for multiple days actually. I do admit I don&#x27;t go running or do anything athletic but still I&#x27;m very pleased with how this stuff turned out. I will definitely be buying this again! I might even try new scents someday.</li>
            <li> This is the first natural deodorant I have found that actually works. I don&#x27;t stink halfway through the day. Yes, it is not as easy to apply as stick deodorant, but that is forgiven because it WORKS. I am a lifetime customer.</li>
            <li> I know what you are thinking....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Oh cool all natural deodorant. Must be great for girls but cant work for guys.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I&#x27;m here to tell you I am a guy and this stuff is really great and I only have to use it one time a day. Once you figure out how to use the provided tiny spatula then use your hand to rub it into your pit you are there! This has to warm up a bit to be rubbed in so I prefer scraping the deodorant with the spatula then put it in my hand to warm up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this scent because at the time it sounded the least &#x27;floral&#x27; and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed however, you will smell EXACTLY like a Christmas tree no joke. I am still hoping for a Patchouli scent! I would over all highly recommend anyone at least try it and if it doesn&#x27;t work out for you try Primal Pit Paste as well. As for me I found what works and will stick too it!</li>
            <li> Got this a little over a week ago and I love it!! My pits stay fresh and mostly dry</li>
            <li> As much as I would like to give this a 5 star, I am afraid it will only be a three. I have had a bunch of problems with rashes under my armpits due to the chemicals in deodorants. Propylene glicol is my no 1 enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited at the prospect of a deodorant that had so few ingredients and all natural. Imagine my surprise when it gave me the worst rash I have ever had. It lasted for weeks. I had to take cortisone. Not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not feel particularly inclined to think that there is anything wrong with the deodorant. I just think that I am particularly sensitive to it. I wanted to post this, as you like me might be too, so if you struggle with other deodorants, please be careful with this one too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry Schmidt&#x27;s...I am only trying to tell my story and hope it is helpful to others.</li>
            <li> Used it for a while- then all of a sudden got a very bad rash under my arm. Can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this, but don&#x27;t love it.  The included spatula is genius; one thing that bothers me about the paste deodorants is the idea of sticking my fingers into the jar, over and over.  I am sure it&#x27;s not really that big a deal but the spatula does make me feel better about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paste itself is not great, it&#x27;s difficult to spread and tends to crumble even in warm weather.  The texture is a little too dry and hard.  When it crumbles, it gets everywhere, it&#x27;s fussy to use because of this - I have cold hands so it doesn&#x27;t warm up enough to spread just sitting on my fingers, either, it sort of crumbles against my underarms and falls down.  Once applied, it&#x27;s about equal in effectiveness to the other brand I use, plenty effective enough for an office job, it prevents odor very well, and I feel good about using it, no worry about blocking pores.  The smell is nice and not too obvious, it doesn&#x27;t interfere with perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any irritation from this, and do have reasonably sensitive skin and depilate my underarms.  I do not use it straight out of the shower while the skin is &amp;#34;open&amp;#34;, though, I wait until it&#x27;s dry and calm, and try to shave or epilate at night, not right before using the deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall, I would give it an A for effectiveness, and it has a pleasant smell, but the texture is enough of a problem that I will not re-buy, I like the products with some coconut oil, they spread out better.</li>
            <li> I was REALLY hoping this would be the one for me but sadly it&#x27;s not. First is the smell , it&#x27;s a bit weird but I thought heck if it works I will get past the smell. Well I put it on after my morning shower and pretty much immediately the burning began. It felt like a severe case of razor burn , but I trudged on hoping the sting would go away , it did not . After being at work for hours I am wishing I could go home to wash it off actually. It feels kinda sticky and there is still a constant burning sensation. On a good note, the smell isn&#x27;t bad on my body nor do I stink of BO. Something in it just doesn&#x27;t like my sensitive underarms.</li>
            <li> I have tried several natural deodorants (all reviewed elsewhere) including this one.  First off, it smells great.  Second, if you have used other natural deodorants, the method of application is perfectly normal for a natural product.  Third, it kept the stink away all for 24 hours.  However, as other reviewers have noted, this product began to irritate and burn my underarm after using it for a few days.  I wish it had worked for my body chemistry because I really liked the smell, but unfortunately its not something I can use.</li>
            <li> Update on 6/3/2015: We&#x27;ve got the rash and dark pits..total bummer. Updating the review to 2 stars. It worked great for the first few tries. However, it gradually caused one of my underarms to get irritated like other people have mentioned.   This product is that good.  I used to use Old Spice Matterhorn, mainly because it smelled like Ice, Wind, and Freedom. However, that smell was gone after a good day&#x27;s use. I also wanted to switch something more natural to be true to myself and avoid all the chemicals, but the natural deodorants that I tried would only put in about a half a day&#x27;s job before calling it a day.  Now, my wife has been using Schmidt&#x27;s for months and always swore by them. She likes the Bergamont Lime scent. I didn&#x27;t think they would work on me until one day I tried it. Yes, the best way to use it is to get your hands dirty, but that&#x27;s part of the charm. I first use the small applicator spoon to scrape a small amount to work with. Then, I use my fingers to work that amount into a pea sized ball. Finally, I rub it on my armpits with my fingers and thumb.  This seriously works on me for about a day and a half to two days, including going to the gym. The Cedar wood and Juniper scent smells great too, just like cedar.  If you&#x27;re looking for a natural deodorant and most don&#x27;t work on you, then try this. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you used to love Aromacreme deodorant from Lush, this is an excellent substitute. This is the deodorant I have been looking for since I stopped using a similar one from an organic bath/body place several years ago when they discontinued the product. It works really, really well. I forgot that I was trying a new product or that I needed to be worried about it working, if that gives you any idea. It&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, so you will sweat as nature intended -- but you will not stink. It works for a full 24 hours, through working out, etc. Excellent stuff -- I highly recommend it. Re: RASHES: I don&#x27;t use it right after shaving armpits, so I haven&#x27;t had rash issues. I just shave armpits at night and do so very gently. I&#x27;m also not an obsessive armpit shaver, so I&#x27;m not fussed about a slight amount of re-growth, a stray hair I didn&#x27;t catch, etc. If you are someone who pushes really hard with a razor or who needs to shave daily, this isn&#x27;t your deodorant and it will likely leave a rash. If you&#x27;re a relaxed armpit shaver OR you don&#x27;t shave armpits, you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> apparently my wife loves this stuff and keeps reordering it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now and I feel compelled to write a review on it. I&#x27;ve used several types of all natural deodorant ranging from the salt crystals on down to toms and I must say this product beats them all. This is of course my experience with the product.    Biggest plus for this product is that I get no less than 18 hours of stink free pits. (I do shift work) No b o smell whatsoever! This is a very hard task with most natural deodorant in my experience unless I get the stuff with aluminum in it to stop the odor causing sweat. I still sweat with this product but I don&#x27;t stink. I don&#x27;t know how it works but I&#x27;ll take it!    Now the minus...some people have already commented on this, I don&#x27;t like that I have to scoop it out with the little stick and apply it with the tips of my fingers. I am clean, I consider myself anyways, and having just showered...I don&#x27;t like having to rub this into my armpit. I don&#x27;t shave my pits, sorry...just won&#x27;t do that...so rubbing this in requires a technique. I smear it in pulling it in front of my finger as I wipe in a downward stroke. Afterwards, I massage it in so that I don&#x27;t have any visible afterwards.    The scent, cedar wood juniper, is pleasant and not overwhelming at all. Definitely could be worn by either male or female. I imagine that the container will last at least a month and a half to two months so don&#x27;t let the $10 price tag scare you. I will try other scents now that I know this stuff isn&#x27;t an overwhelmingly strong scent. Hope this review helps as I have shopped for quite some time to find a deodorant that really works but without the health risks associated with some of that other stuff to include clogged pores. Very satisfied with this product and I highly recommend it!  ******Update******  Still happy with the product but the seller just raised the price by 10%! That&#x27;s absurd, lost 2 stars for that. I will be changing to a different seller or brand altogether. It never fails that I finda product I like on Amazon and some creaton raises the price or no longer carries the product.</li>
            <li> Good at eliminating odor throughout the day, however, I&#x27;m sensitive to the large amount of baking soda used in this product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love the way it controls dampness and body odor, but unfortunately, it&#x27;s giving me a pretty bad rash in both armpits.</li>
            <li> This works very well, but I can&#x27;t get past the smell. It reminds me of wasp spray, I wish I had bought unscented instead. Kind of high for the amount you get too. Not sure if I&#x27;ll give another scent a go or not.</li>
            <li> Scent: Strong, not overwhelming. Unisex.&lt;br /&gt;Spreadability: 4 stars, would be better if spatula were rubber. I scoop, hold to armpit with spatula, wait few seconds, spread.&lt;br /&gt;Lasting power: through a Crossfit class. Through a whole normal day.&lt;br /&gt;Price is great; will likely last 8-10 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be 5 stars with a better spatula or in a stick form.</li>
