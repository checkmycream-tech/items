            <li> Hello everyone, I&#x27;m 40 and my age started to show a year ago so I desperately started trying all these creams.  Nothing worked, some made me break out, some made me look OLDER!  I started to think that it was because I was Hispanic (olive/tan skin) and these \\&quot;magazine\\&quot; creams were just not for my kind.  But I gave this cream a shot and wow!  My age is reversing I feel.  It&#x27;s amazing.  The wrinkles around my mouth are almost gone, and it&#x27;s been like 3 weeks.  It&#x27;s light, not heavy.  Doesn&#x27;t leave residue.  Smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do it, you won&#x27;t regret it.  Money well worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this product; I use it twice a day to keep my skin at it&#x27;s best. The fact that it is a protectorate from the sun  is very important to me. Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s famous cosmetic in the world. It&#x27;s great! I&#x27;m sure i want to buy the same item again. Thank you for chance to buy the item.</li>
            <li> It is so nice to find a skin cream with SPF in it so I don&#x27;t have to use those icky drug store sun screens.  I am a sailor and I am exposed to major sun. Love to wear the product all day long!</li>
            <li> I am using this product, and it is simply perfect&lt;br /&gt;not too oily like a lot of creams and lotions)&lt;br /&gt;perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li> I ran out 3 months ago and started using another product that had been given as a gift. Sorry to say this product does make a difference if you are fighting time. The good thing is that it takes such a small amount to do the job that a jar lasts me 5 months. The other product was one that is highly recommended but slathering on 2-3 layers to get skin that feels dry 10 minutes later?</li>
            <li> I really love this moisturizer.  It goes on well, and is not greasy.  It makes my face feel really soft.  I keep going back to Walmart thinking I can buy something comparable but not quite so expensive, but as of yet I haven&#x27;t found anything to compare to this moisturizer.  I guess I will just pay the extra money and be happy.  It is true that you get what you pay for.  I have tried the Oil of Olay Regenerate and the Loreal moisturizers that are $20 and up, and they cannot compare to the Estee Lauder Time Zone Moisturizer.  It just has a really good feel and goes on well under my Estee Lauder Daywear.</li>
            <li> Great,  as promised !</li>
            <li> I am Neil&#x27;s wife Dorothy, I really do love the cream,   I just found the 4th jar and it is equal to the 1.7 size that I was use to buying.  I am so Sorry for the information saying that I was disapointed in the size of the jar.  I am very happy now.</li>
            <li> A wonderful face cream! Thank you very much for the result justified! The skin is very delicate smooth, wide pores, and reduces fine lines are smoothed. The transaction is successful, I recommend the seller!</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I use this. It really works! My skin feels so soft! I am only 30 so I don&#x27;t really have many wrinkles to begin with but my fine lines laugh have pretty much gone away and I have seen a noticeable difference with my 40 yr old husbands forehead wrinkles. I am now a lifetime buyer of this product!</li>
            <li> My wife likes it and it beats going to the mall and fighting the crowds plus the price is a bit better. We&#x27;ll be ordering it again when she wants it.</li>
            <li> I love this face creme.  It moisturizes but it is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I am on my third jar of this moisturizer. I love it. I have never stuck with one product before, but this one is a keeper. Maybe my more youthful skin just didn&#x27;t notice amazing results since there wasn&#x27;t much to correct. But I&#x27;m 39 now, I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year. I feel smoother and softer. I don&#x27;t really have lines to speak of at this point, but I was getting rougher and skin&#x27;s color had been blah. I&#x27;m definitely perked up! In the heat of the summer I used just a SMIDGE so the jar lasted a lot longer, but still it goes a long way even in winter.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily over the CP+R serum.  My skin is mature and I need good moisturizing products. to fight fine lines.</li>
            <li> Great preventive cream.</li>
            <li> The product I teceived looks like a knock off. It wad oily and it did not have the regular color as the one I buy from stee lauder&#x27;s website</li>
            <li> the best cream in the market together with the night repair from estee l . my skin is uper good for my age. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The product was not advanced time zone age reversing  cream. It was an older version of product. I wanted to return it. The seller decided he/she did not want it returned. I had to keep it unwillingly.</li>
            <li> As a big Fans of Estee lauder, I actually recommended this product to apply it after shower. You could see the effect after 1 week. The skin is getting softer as well as less acnes and the lines started reduced. It&#x27;s also tighter up our skin to make our skin looks younger than our age.</li>
            <li> This jar contained rancid cream that had a ton of oil sitting on top of the cream. It also smelled funny.  I did not open the jar when I received it since I still had some face cream left in my old jar.  A month or so later I open the jar I received from this company and it was disgusting! It smelled funny plus all the oil sitting on top of the face cream.  I will never buy from this seller again. I wish I had inspected it when I first received it so it could be returned for a full refund.  I trashed the jar and then placed an order directly from Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li> Stop the search ladies!!  This product does everything, plus more.  I am 50+ and have been searching for that &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; cream for my face, eyes, and neck.  I am here to tell you I have found it for my face and if you give this a try for a month I believe you will be saying the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the price is steep but use very very little or you will notice it on your face near your ears.  Try to get 2 or 3 samples (enough to last a month) then try it.  Be honest with yourself and the product.  Cleanse your face morning and night - then apply.</li>
            <li> This creme is a wonderful day creme with SPF 15 in it. You do not need much of the creme to spread it over your skin for full coverage. It does not burn, it does not get too creasy, and I love the spleasant, barely there scent.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product! My mother has used this product for years and LOVES it!</li>
            <li> I have been an Oil of Olay user for over 25 years, and I will be going back to Olay. Although this product is good, I can tell no difference after using this product for 3 weeks now. So why pay for over-priced moisturizer,  when I can get the same effects with Olay, which is half the price.</li>
            <li> Good for controlling effects of aging. Like the texture and and scent. Vendor&#x27;s price is much less than at local retailers.</li>
            <li> Estupendo articulo los compre para mi Mama y les encanto, el envi&amp;oacute; llego a tiempo y el articulo cumple con las especificaciones requeridas</li>
