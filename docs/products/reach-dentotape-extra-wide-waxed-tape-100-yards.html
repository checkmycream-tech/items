            <li>they are always out of the product so buying it at Amazon works best.</li>
            <li>Great job, as always!!!</li>
            <li>An excellent deal on dental floss.</li>
            <li>the variance in the width of the tape is wonderful</li>

            <li>so I am completely happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Works great for those that break their Floss when Flossing.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>This is a great floss.  </li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that Amazon carries this because I will continue to use this &amp;#34;dentist-recommended&amp;#34; product</li>
            <li>And I believe that this deal is a great buy on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It does a great job.</li>
            <li>I would prefer a mint flavored tape but this works great</li>
            <li>Good price and great service.</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>Everything else, even Glide or good imitations of this product, can&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li>I suppose this would work good if you have 1cm gaps between each of your teeth.</li>
            <li>This is the best floss available.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s a good deal any way I look at it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just not as good as Reach Dento Tape.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good dental floss.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend this product to anyone wanting a really good floss.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>but I was glad to find it on-line and happily paid shipping cost for four 100 yd.</li>
            <li>and I have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>No one around here carries this any more (Walmart and CVS included)!  </li>
            <li>I simply LOVE this dental floss!</li>
            <li>Been using for years ... much better for tighter teeth then floss!</li>
            <li>It cleans the plaque much better than the thread type floss!</li>
            <li>This floss works great for me and it does not tear easily.  </li>
            <li>nice that I don&#x27;t have to try and find this in the store now</li>
            <li>Now CVS &amp; Target have their own house brands, which they sell for a marginally cheaper price.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Wegman&#x27;s brand and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>I have gap between my teeth and therefore was looking for dental tape that can slide between my teeth effectively.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;resorted to carrying their own House brands of dental tape and generics</li>
            <li>This tape breaks during usage very easily.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted to find this Dento Tape available online.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to buy it quantity.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me by my dentist, and it is by far the best on the market.</li>
            <li>Got samples from my dentist and loved how clean my teeth felt after using it.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t find a tape in the super market that was any good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always preferred this floss and this was a good deal and shipped quickly</li>
            <li>I have used this tape before and am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>love this stuff - wish you could find it in store -</li>
            <li>Glad to have found it here.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this floss and love it.</li>
            <li>Any dentist worth their salt will know that tape is needed for good dental health.</li>
            <li>I love the way this stuff doesn&#x27;t shred between my teeth.</li>
            <li>What more do you need to know?</li>
            <li>Ths is the real stuff at a great price.</li>
            <li>Because of its strength&lt;br /&gt;one can use more pressure and get a better job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>i am sure there are others who may be ok with it.</li>
            <li>so buying it online is the most convenient way of getting it.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years.</li>
            <li>my favorite brand/style.</li>
            <li>is the floss I&#x27;ve had my patients (including patients with gum disease) use, and that I and my family have used for more than 30 years.  </li>
            <li>I always trust the brand names much more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>I have found this floss to be the best  - much better than regular dental floss</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li>and I am just glad to get it in a four-pack.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>This is simply the best floss available.</li>
            <li>Really cleans the teeth good.</li>
            <li>Excellent purchase, came super fast and was exactly as specified.  </li>
            <li>This is the best dental floss there is, I will not use any other.  </li>
            <li>The dental floss won&#x27;t come out of the container easily.  </li>
            <li>It seems to clean off the plaque better than the Teflon coated flosses.</li>
            <li>My teeth are food magnets and tear through floss too easily.  </li>
            <li>Their response time was very quick, and the order came well packed.</li>
            <li>That means it is easy to use; it won&#x27;t slide off my fingers when using it.  </li>
            <li>So easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It glides easily between the teeth and removes plaque.</li>
            <li>The reason I purchased this brand is that it doesn&#x27;t break as easily as Glide dental tape.</li>
            <li>The wax coating makes it just as easy to use as thread-like floss.</li>
            <li>I have resorted to buying Reach Dentape on line because it is by far the best product of its kind on the market but is now no longer available in my local stores</li>
            <li>Seems fine to me.</li>
            <li>The product is fine</li>
            <li>I used Johnson &amp; Johnson &amp;#34;Denotape&amp;#34; for many years; this seems a worthy successor.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize this stuff is like rope, won&#x27;t fit with 1/2 my teeth.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable on the fingers, fits between my closely-spaced teeth, and never shreds.</li>
            <li>I think I might have preferred even a wider dental tape if it were available.  </li>
            <li>does not even fit between any of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;AND</li>
            <li>NIce since I could not find it locally really like this brand</li>
            <li>I always get top marks from my dentist on my hygiene, and I think using a good floss is key.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t open start to use yet, but I knew it&#x27;s real and good!!!</li>
            <li>Not as wide as I would have liked, but better than most tapes.</li>
            <li>I have tried several types and brands, but this it the best as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, most of the large chains have</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is as shown, and the price is right!</li>
            <li>and he was right!</li>
            <li>Amazon found this hard to find product at the best price!  </li>
            <li>Many retailers have discontinued carrying this item and those that still do are asking way too much.</li>
            <li>Good product overall.</li>
            <li>The floss is well made, the container stays together and the metal prongs cut the floss efficiently, so, this would be five stars if they also offered the thicker floss in mint and cinnamon, since plain is not the ideal floss for me.</li>
            <li>Is pretty strong.</li>
            <li>It works better than most floss but still occasionally does not get everything.</li>
            <li>And it came quickly.</li>
            <li>A repeat order for my favorite dental floss, highly recommended by my periodontist.  </li>
            <li>Price was right and delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great if you have a little space between your teeth.</li>
            <li>This brand, on the other hand, remains effective and easy to use.</li>
            <li>My dental hygenist confirmed that this tape is the real deal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy enough to thread through on its own.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it gets a bit frayed, but it rarely breaks.  </li>
            <li>Only their own brands.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing too exciting to say aobut Reach Dentotape</li>
            <li>I found this awesome deal because I could not consistently find it at the local stores.</li>
            <li>Originally the product was unwaxed, and I was very reluctant to order this product.  </li>
            <li>be just good for someone with wide spaced teeth though!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d searched for just the right floss and think this is it.</li>
            <li>The pricing was fair, the delivery was speedy, and the product was first class and not some unknown brand.  </li>
            <li>This is the only dental floss that doesn&#x27;t shred or break very easily between some of my teeth that have fillings.</li>
            <li>Tape works better than floss and this tape is just barely waxed so it shreds and removes food  junk as it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>It used to be labeled simply &amp;#34;Dentotape&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s still the same great product.</li>
            <li>The store brand is available but I prefer Reach--it just seems better than other brands.</li>
            <li>Great way to floss the hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>Works great for flossing and getting to those hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li>I am really quite upset about this!  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be without it for several more years</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll be back to buy more when they run out.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted, Johnson Reach unflavored dental tape.   </li>
            <li>I will use this until it is gone but not likely buy more of it.</li>
            <li>There are so many variations of dental products in the US, but, for people like me who likes a thicker floss, Reach is the only option?  </li>
            <li>so you feel like you&#x27;re actually getting something for your money and not wasting so many resources on packaging.&lt;br</li>
            <li>DentoTape cleans better than regular dental floss for me.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is having to buy so many at once.</li>
            <li>So much better than the regular thickness of dental floss.</li>
            <li>Exactly as ordered &amp; expeditious handling.</li>
            <li>This is the first tiem I used waxed version of this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I can purchase this online as most drugstores try to push their own brand which shreds like crazy...</li>
            <li>Prefer tape to string (regular floss) because it seens to do a better job.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this if you want first class dental floss.</li>
            <li>Purchased as a general emergency/DIY strong tying medium.</li>
            <li>Recent drugstore purchases of the Johnson&amp;Johnson brand of &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34; dental floss have been thin, very strong (never breaking) and do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had the misfortune once of using a different type of floss (a more \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; non-tape variety) in between my biannual dentist visit, and the results did not look promising.  </li>
            <li>Reach DentoTape waxed ribbon Dental Floss is easy to hold in my fingers and it is strong and does not shred when two teeth are tight together.</li>
            <li>Thanks much for filling the gap!  A+++</li>
            <li>Tight teeth love this!</li>
            <li>Purchasing it as we did made it easy to buy, and stopped the frustration of searching locally.</li>
            <li>This set of dental tape was a good buy for the money, but the wax (along with the thickness of the floss), makes it hard to floss with.  </li>
            <li>Timely and very affordable.</li>
            <li>glide etc., cleans really well.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It really gets the crud out.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the savings.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>Johnson &amp; Johnson DentoTape used to be the only dental tape available in the stores.  </li>
            <li>like this floss because it&#x27;s comfortable, but also each unit is on quite a big roll</li>
            <li>Purchasing online in bulk is very convenient.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I expected this to be at least as good and probably better.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve been 100% satisfied and have noticed no significant difference between this \\&quot;new\\&quot; version and the old original one.  </li>
            <li>it works much better than any other floss I&#x27;ve tried,</li>
            <li>I like this better than another other floss.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fray in tight spots and has enough body to it to do some good.</li>
            <li>Could not find this product locally but since my periodontist recommended it and gave me a tiny sample, I was glad to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>all arrived as new product - I buy multiple packages each time anticipating you wont be able to get in the future</li>
            <li>I hope it does not mean that they are no longer manufacturing it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, very thick floss, but it&#x27;s not in a ribbon shape.</li>
            <li>I also have wires behind my top and bottom front teeth and with this floss I don&#x27;t need special threaders to get it through.</li>
            <li>Way too wide to fit between my teeth.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist recommended this floss because it is has a thicker diameter than what I normally use.  </li>
            <li>and well worth the extra charge.</li>
            <li>If you use Deno tape, which you should, because it is a lot better than just regular floss, it doesn&#x27;t break when trying to get in tight close together teeth, and does a much better job of cleaning!----Get it, and you will never go back to regular floss</li>
            <li>I live in a country where ONE 100-yard dental floss dispenser costs what I pay for a package of four 100-yard dispensers on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Last for ever, very large volume of floss, strong and wont beak and cleans very well not for small gapped teeth, will get stuck</li>
            <li>it takes a really strong floss not to shred in my tight teeth.</li>
            <li>After wasteing money on many other brands, I finally found this floss that will not shred or break during use.</li>
            <li>old Johnson&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>I prefer waxed dental tape because it is not slick like the unwaxed Glide versions.  </li>
            <li>My first research was in the field of periodontics (gum disease) back in 1976, and I&#x27;m still involved in that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s wide enough to really clean out large gaps.  </li>
            <li>Dentotape has become almost impossible to find in my local area stores, so I was very happy to find this source online.</li>
            <li>I have some very tightly packed teeth that seem to cause other brands of Dental Tape and Dental Floss to break easily.&lt;br /&gt;Other tapes not only break, they get stuck between the spaces in my teeth and cause me great pain.</li>
            <li>I can buy large amount instead of the smaller ones.</li>
            <li>They are very close and this is the only type floss that will stand up to the close tolerances between them.</li>
            <li>I am a dentist and this is the only floss on the market that I like, very convenient to order it here.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say i was surprised about that either.</li>
            <li>only way to get it no problem but very expansive</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t break easily like other flat dento tape brands.</li>
            <li>But the generic stuff has steadily declined in quality at all the major drugstore chains in New York City.   </li>
            <li>I thought this floss would be a LITTLE thicker to clean between my teeth</li>
            <li>His teeth are very tight and he&#x27;s never been able to use the regular dental floss since it would tear.  </li>
            <li>It was real tape like, and flat........</li>
            <li>I have really liked it over previous plain floss that used.</li>
            <li>The ribbon is stiff enough to fit through my teeth under my permanent metal retainer.</li>
            <li>Much thicker than expected and not like a tape at all.  </li>
            <li>This floss is way to thick to get between my teeth comfortably.</li>
            <li>With something like the small Glide containers, there is a lot of container wasted with a relatively small amount of floss, and with the breakage I experienced, that didn&#x27;t go far.</li>
            <li>Far better than that useless waxed micro-thin stuff (you know what I mean) that does nothing to clean out the gunk between your pearly whites.  </li>
            <li>The local drugstores--CVS, Duane Reade--carried only their own lousy brand of dental floss and no dental tape.</li>
            <li>I use tape instead of regular floss because floss tends to break more easily than tape (at least for me) and there is nothing more annoying than having floss stuck between your teeth!  </li>
            <li>I work around this by being careful to move frequently to new flossing locations on the tape.</li>
            <li>This is not flat Ribbon Floss.</li>
            <li>Since it is thicker than normal floss, you will need to move it down each side of the tooth instead of straight down to the gums, which is the proper way to floss.</li>
            <li>This tape is a bit thick for my tight contacts, but it works OK.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This is the BEST floss.</li>
            <li> The price for all 4 of them is a great deal!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been very happy since purchased it.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> So does my awesome dentist.</li>
            <li> This is the best dental floss on planet earth .....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product and the supplier.</li>
            <li> The Reach DentoTAPE waxed ribbon dental floss is excellent.  </li>
            <li> This floss works great!</li>
            <li> Perfect purchase.  </li>
            <li> Excellent dental floss; have used this brand for years.</li>
            <li> The tape is perfect and gets all food particles I have even the ones that I have parcials with.  </li>
            <li> Great to stock up with and never think of floss again!</li>
            <li> Best buy.  </li>
            <li> This is the best floss for me.  </li>
            <li> Best of all, we will not run out again.</li>
            <li> J&amp;J Dentotape is the best floss on the planet.  </li>
            <li> they are always out of the product so buying it at Amazon works best.</li>
            <li> Great job, as always!!!</li>
            <li> An excellent deal on dental floss.</li>
            <li> the variance in the width of the tape is wonderful</li>
            <li> Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Brilliant.</li>
            <li> This offering was at a particularly good price!</li>
            <li> Fair price, speedy shipping, Thank you!</li>
            <li> and it was great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> so I am completely happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Works great for those that break their Floss when Flossing.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> This is a great floss.  </li>
            <li> Great price.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that Amazon carries this because I will continue to use this &amp;#34;dentist-recommended&amp;#34; product</li>
            <li> And I believe that this deal is a great buy on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It does a great job.</li>
            <li> I would prefer a mint flavored tape but this works great</li>
            <li> Good price and great service.</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> Everything else, even Glide or good imitations of this product, can&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li> I suppose this would work good if you have 1cm gaps between each of your teeth.</li>
            <li> This is the best floss available.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a good deal any way I look at it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just not as good as Reach Dento Tape.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good dental floss.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to anyone wanting a really good floss.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> but I was glad to find it on-line and happily paid shipping cost for four 100 yd.</li>
            <li> and I have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li> No one around here carries this any more (Walmart and CVS included)!  </li>
            <li> I simply LOVE this dental floss!</li>
            <li> Been using for years ... much better for tighter teeth then floss!</li>
            <li> It cleans the plaque much better than the thread type floss!</li>
            <li> This floss works great for me and it does not tear easily.  </li>
            <li> nice that I don&#x27;t have to try and find this in the store now</li>
            <li> Now CVS &amp; Target have their own house brands, which they sell for a marginally cheaper price.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Wegman&#x27;s brand and really liked it.  </li>
            <li> I have gap between my teeth and therefore was looking for dental tape that can slide between my teeth effectively.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;resorted to carrying their own House brands of dental tape and generics</li>
            <li> This tape breaks during usage very easily.  </li>
            <li> I was delighted to find this Dento Tape available online.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to buy it quantity.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my dentist, and it is by far the best on the market.</li>
            <li> Got samples from my dentist and loved how clean my teeth felt after using it.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t find a tape in the super market that was any good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always preferred this floss and this was a good deal and shipped quickly</li>
            <li> I have used this tape before and am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> love this stuff - wish you could find it in store -</li>
            <li> Glad to have found it here.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this floss and love it.</li>
            <li> Any dentist worth their salt will know that tape is needed for good dental health.</li>
            <li> I love the way this stuff doesn&#x27;t shred between my teeth.</li>
            <li> What more do you need to know?</li>
            <li> Ths is the real stuff at a great price.</li>
            <li> Because of its strength&lt;br /&gt;one can use more pressure and get a better job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> i am sure there are others who may be ok with it.</li>
            <li> so buying it online is the most convenient way of getting it.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years.</li>
            <li> my favorite brand/style.</li>
            <li> is the floss I&#x27;ve had my patients (including patients with gum disease) use, and that I and my family have used for more than 30 years.  </li>
            <li> I always trust the brand names much more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li> I have found this floss to be the best  - much better than regular dental floss</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> and I am just glad to get it in a four-pack.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best floss available.</li>
            <li> Really cleans the teeth good.</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase, came super fast and was exactly as specified.  </li>
            <li> This is the best dental floss there is, I will not use any other.  </li>
            <li> The dental floss won&#x27;t come out of the container easily.  </li>
            <li> It seems to clean off the plaque better than the Teflon coated flosses.</li>
            <li> My teeth are food magnets and tear through floss too easily.  </li>
            <li> Their response time was very quick, and the order came well packed.</li>
            <li> That means it is easy to use; it won&#x27;t slide off my fingers when using it.  </li>
            <li> So easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It glides easily between the teeth and removes plaque.</li>
            <li> The reason I purchased this brand is that it doesn&#x27;t break as easily as Glide dental tape.</li>
            <li> The wax coating makes it just as easy to use as thread-like floss.</li>
            <li> I have resorted to buying Reach Dentape on line because it is by far the best product of its kind on the market but is now no longer available in my local stores</li>
            <li> Seems fine to me.</li>
            <li> The product is fine</li>
            <li> I used Johnson &amp; Johnson &amp;#34;Denotape&amp;#34; for many years; this seems a worthy successor.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize this stuff is like rope, won&#x27;t fit with 1/2 my teeth.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable on the fingers, fits between my closely-spaced teeth, and never shreds.</li>
            <li> I think I might have preferred even a wider dental tape if it were available.  </li>
            <li> does not even fit between any of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;AND</li>
            <li> NIce since I could not find it locally really like this brand</li>
            <li> I always get top marks from my dentist on my hygiene, and I think using a good floss is key.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t open start to use yet, but I knew it&#x27;s real and good!!!</li>
            <li> Not as wide as I would have liked, but better than most tapes.</li>
            <li> I have tried several types and brands, but this it the best as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, most of the large chains have</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is as shown, and the price is right!</li>
            <li> and he was right!</li>
            <li> Amazon found this hard to find product at the best price!  </li>
            <li> Many retailers have discontinued carrying this item and those that still do are asking way too much.</li>
            <li> Good product overall.</li>
            <li> The floss is well made, the container stays together and the metal prongs cut the floss efficiently, so, this would be five stars if they also offered the thicker floss in mint and cinnamon, since plain is not the ideal floss for me.</li>
            <li> Is pretty strong.</li>
            <li> It works better than most floss but still occasionally does not get everything.</li>
            <li> And it came quickly.</li>
            <li> A repeat order for my favorite dental floss, highly recommended by my periodontist.  </li>
            <li> Price was right and delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great if you have a little space between your teeth.</li>
            <li> This brand, on the other hand, remains effective and easy to use.</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist confirmed that this tape is the real deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy enough to thread through on its own.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it gets a bit frayed, but it rarely breaks.  </li>
            <li> Only their own brands.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing too exciting to say aobut Reach Dentotape</li>
            <li> I found this awesome deal because I could not consistently find it at the local stores.</li>
            <li> Originally the product was unwaxed, and I was very reluctant to order this product.  </li>
            <li> be just good for someone with wide spaced teeth though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d searched for just the right floss and think this is it.</li>
            <li> The pricing was fair, the delivery was speedy, and the product was first class and not some unknown brand.  </li>
            <li> This is the only dental floss that doesn&#x27;t shred or break very easily between some of my teeth that have fillings.</li>
            <li> Tape works better than floss and this tape is just barely waxed so it shreds and removes food  junk as it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> It used to be labeled simply &amp;#34;Dentotape&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s still the same great product.</li>
            <li> The store brand is available but I prefer Reach--it just seems better than other brands.</li>
            <li> Great way to floss the hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> Works great for flossing and getting to those hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> I am really quite upset about this!  </li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be without it for several more years</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll be back to buy more when they run out.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, Johnson Reach unflavored dental tape.   </li>
            <li> I will use this until it is gone but not likely buy more of it.</li>
            <li> There are so many variations of dental products in the US, but, for people like me who likes a thicker floss, Reach is the only option?  </li>
            <li> so you feel like you&#x27;re actually getting something for your money and not wasting so many resources on packaging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> DentoTape cleans better than regular dental floss for me.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is having to buy so many at once.</li>
            <li> So much better than the regular thickness of dental floss.</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered &amp; expeditious handling.</li>
            <li> This is the first tiem I used waxed version of this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I can purchase this online as most drugstores try to push their own brand which shreds like crazy...</li>
            <li> Prefer tape to string (regular floss) because it seens to do a better job.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you want first class dental floss.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a general emergency/DIY strong tying medium.</li>
            <li> Recent drugstore purchases of the Johnson&amp;Johnson brand of &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34; dental floss have been thin, very strong (never breaking) and do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had the misfortune once of using a different type of floss (a more \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; non-tape variety) in between my biannual dentist visit, and the results did not look promising.  </li>
            <li> Reach DentoTape waxed ribbon Dental Floss is easy to hold in my fingers and it is strong and does not shred when two teeth are tight together.</li>
            <li> Thanks much for filling the gap!  A+++</li>
            <li> Tight teeth love this!</li>
            <li> Purchasing it as we did made it easy to buy, and stopped the frustration of searching locally.</li>
            <li> This set of dental tape was a good buy for the money, but the wax (along with the thickness of the floss), makes it hard to floss with.  </li>
            <li> Timely and very affordable.</li>
            <li> glide etc., cleans really well.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It really gets the crud out.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the savings.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li> Johnson &amp; Johnson DentoTape used to be the only dental tape available in the stores.  </li>
            <li> like this floss because it&#x27;s comfortable, but also each unit is on quite a big roll</li>
            <li> Purchasing online in bulk is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I expected this to be at least as good and probably better.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve been 100% satisfied and have noticed no significant difference between this \\&quot;new\\&quot; version and the old original one.  </li>
            <li> it works much better than any other floss I&#x27;ve tried,</li>
            <li> I like this better than another other floss.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fray in tight spots and has enough body to it to do some good.</li>
            <li> Could not find this product locally but since my periodontist recommended it and gave me a tiny sample, I was glad to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> all arrived as new product - I buy multiple packages each time anticipating you wont be able to get in the future</li>
            <li> I hope it does not mean that they are no longer manufacturing it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, very thick floss, but it&#x27;s not in a ribbon shape.</li>
            <li> I also have wires behind my top and bottom front teeth and with this floss I don&#x27;t need special threaders to get it through.</li>
            <li> Way too wide to fit between my teeth.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended this floss because it is has a thicker diameter than what I normally use.  </li>
            <li> and well worth the extra charge.</li>
            <li> If you use Deno tape, which you should, because it is a lot better than just regular floss, it doesn&#x27;t break when trying to get in tight close together teeth, and does a much better job of cleaning!----Get it, and you will never go back to regular floss</li>
            <li> I live in a country where ONE 100-yard dental floss dispenser costs what I pay for a package of four 100-yard dispensers on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Last for ever, very large volume of floss, strong and wont beak and cleans very well not for small gapped teeth, will get stuck</li>
            <li> it takes a really strong floss not to shred in my tight teeth.</li>
            <li> After wasteing money on many other brands, I finally found this floss that will not shred or break during use.</li>
            <li> old Johnson&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I prefer waxed dental tape because it is not slick like the unwaxed Glide versions.  </li>
            <li> My first research was in the field of periodontics (gum disease) back in 1976, and I&#x27;m still involved in that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s wide enough to really clean out large gaps.  </li>
            <li> Dentotape has become almost impossible to find in my local area stores, so I was very happy to find this source online.</li>
            <li> I have some very tightly packed teeth that seem to cause other brands of Dental Tape and Dental Floss to break easily.&lt;br /&gt;Other tapes not only break, they get stuck between the spaces in my teeth and cause me great pain.</li>
            <li> I can buy large amount instead of the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> They are very close and this is the only type floss that will stand up to the close tolerances between them.</li>
            <li> I am a dentist and this is the only floss on the market that I like, very convenient to order it here.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say i was surprised about that either.</li>
            <li> only way to get it no problem but very expansive</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t break easily like other flat dento tape brands.</li>
            <li> But the generic stuff has steadily declined in quality at all the major drugstore chains in New York City.   </li>
            <li> I thought this floss would be a LITTLE thicker to clean between my teeth</li>
            <li> His teeth are very tight and he&#x27;s never been able to use the regular dental floss since it would tear.  </li>
            <li> It was real tape like, and flat........</li>
            <li> I have really liked it over previous plain floss that used.</li>
            <li> The ribbon is stiff enough to fit through my teeth under my permanent metal retainer.</li>
            <li> Much thicker than expected and not like a tape at all.  </li>
            <li> This floss is way to thick to get between my teeth comfortably.</li>
            <li> With something like the small Glide containers, there is a lot of container wasted with a relatively small amount of floss, and with the breakage I experienced, that didn&#x27;t go far.</li>
            <li> Far better than that useless waxed micro-thin stuff (you know what I mean) that does nothing to clean out the gunk between your pearly whites.  </li>
            <li> The local drugstores--CVS, Duane Reade--carried only their own lousy brand of dental floss and no dental tape.</li>
            <li> I use tape instead of regular floss because floss tends to break more easily than tape (at least for me) and there is nothing more annoying than having floss stuck between your teeth!  </li>
            <li> I work around this by being careful to move frequently to new flossing locations on the tape.</li>
            <li> This is not flat Ribbon Floss.</li>
            <li> Since it is thicker than normal floss, you will need to move it down each side of the tooth instead of straight down to the gums, which is the proper way to floss.</li>
            <li> This tape is a bit thick for my tight contacts, but it works OK.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, which is not a bad thing.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> this tape doesn&#x27;t shred and also is wide enough for my liking.</li>
            <li> This floss is wide enough that its a bit of a struggle getting it between my teeth, which is what i was after...</li>
            <li> My dentist told me the proper way to floss was to scrape up one tooth and down the next.</li>
            <li> Skip forward about six months later, and after I corrected my ways and went back to using this type of floss, my teeth improved dramatically compared to the previous visit.     </li>
            <li> The only Floss that&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t break and that I use to remove the other ones in JJ Dental Tape.</li>
            <li> I have very tight spaces, especially around the back molars, and this stuff works.  </li>
            <li> Even when I add the shipping costs, the total price for four dispensers is considerably less than what I would pay for four dispensers here in this country.</li>
            <li> DentoTape is a heavier, stronger type of floss that is less likely to break and get stuck between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Quality Dental Tape is hard to find, Waxed Tape is even more difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> Is is too wide.</li>
            <li> It is not readily found in stores.</li>
            <li> Wide band Dento Tape.</li>
            <li> Reading the description - the packaging says it is for widely spaced teeth -</li>
            <li> Lots of packaging, not much string.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You do not need wide spaced teeth, you just need two teeth side by side.</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding the dentoTape in my local stores</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding this in local stores.  </li>
            <li> When all local sources dried up, someone suggested trying Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Works well for wide spaced teeth</li>
            <li> I received everything as expected.</li>
            <li> Works as expected I like that</li>
            <li> If you have tightly spaced teeth, I don&#x27;t know what to tell you; other varieties of floss might be easier to manipulate in your cramped spaces, but they will not do the job well enough.  </li>
            <li> If you have widely spaced teeth, this may be the floss for you, but it certainly is not for me.</li>
            <li> It is not strong enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> Thick enough to do the job, but not too thick to get through those tough spots, durable, dispenses well, and about as comfortable as floss can be for use.</li>
            <li> Now that Costco only stocks Glide, I had to find a source for something that didn&#x27;t break, and actually had at least a little abrasive quality to it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fray and isn&#x27;t sharp.</li>
            <li> J &amp; J brand always stays together and does not fray and get stuck in my teeth like other brands do.  </li>
            <li> It lacks the minty flavor that i prefer with some of the other floss..  </li>
            <li> I did try it as floos, and if you don&#x27;t have large gaps in your teeth, it is uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> but I prefer to use it over dental floss and have a hard time finding it supplied in local drug stores or superstores.</li>
            <li> It is common Reach Dentotape which is just really big tooth floss.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find Dental Tape in the usual drug stores.</li>
            <li> There was no mention that this is extra thick and for people with wide-spread teeth.  </li>
            <li> This tape is thick enough to remove the food particles without being shredded.  </li>
            <li> This is a slightly thicker, string-like floss.</li>
            <li> Not in my mouth anyway!!&lt;br /&gt;It actually hurt me when I try to use it so not a good purchase for me.&lt;br /&gt;Might</li>
            <li> However, if you have crowns, you should be careful not to just use it in the usual way.</li>
            <li> This product is virtually impossible to find in stores, and I live in an urban area.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in the usual big stores, as they push their house brands.  </li>
            <li> I do not like the new slippery type it is difficult to get a hold of</li>
            <li> It does not fit in between some teeth, as did the previous product by Johnson &amp; Johnson.  </li>
            <li> I used to try to save a little money by buying store-brand dental tape.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t break, but getting it in between tight teeth is not easy considering its width.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting Ribbon Floss, and just wasted my money.</li>
            <li> but is still basically a round floss.</li>
            <li> I believe is left over from outdated stock.  </li>
            <li> My endodontist told me the trick: the usual way going down between the teeth, but then pull it out like you&#x27;re unthreading a needle, so you don&#x27;t snag the crown and pull it up off the tooth.</li>
            <li> The floss is thick, heavily encased in wax and it has no mint flavor as the other &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34; does.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s tried other brands of dental tape and not liked any of them, so this is what I stick with ordering for him.</li>
            <li> The floss may not work for some people with very tightly packed teeth though.</li>
            <li> I have very tight teeth</li>
            <li> Difficult to find in my local stores.  </li>
            <li> It is heavy duty, reaches all the hard-to-get places, and give your teeth a shine!</li>
            <li> It usually takes 2 to 4 quantities to do my mouth.</li>
            <li> Dental floss breaks and rips apart and store brands of DentoTape are not much better.  </li>
            <li> I like waxed dentotape because it doesn&#x27;t fray and leave shreds behind if it hits a sharp edge</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work well for my husband because it&#x27;s too thick for the very tight spaces between his teeth.</li>
            <li> But it is hard to find at the drug store, so I&#x27;ve been ordering it online.</li>
            <li> No matter how hard you pull it, it stays stuck inside.  </li>
            <li> This is hard to find</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> It is sturdy and thick, so it holds up under vigorous flossing.</li>
            <li> It is not as thick as the Wegman&#x27;s brand.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so thick that I can&#x27;t even use it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the reviewer that said that it is actually thick floss.</li>
            <li> floss is thick which is what i like.  </li>
            <li> thick floss.</li>
            <li> This is a bit thick, but (1) it&#x27;s tape, and (2) no flavoring.  </li>
            <li> My teeth shred all other flosses which include flosses as expensive as J&amp;J.  </li>
            <li> Slightly less expensive than per item at Walmart.</li>
            <li> This item is impossible to find locally at retail.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it has become impossible to find in the stores for the past several years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find in stores these days.</li>
            <li> One of the four dispensers had a broken seal, and teh vendor issued credit, including the pro-rated shipping cost.</li>
            <li> It is a shame because those thin flosses don&#x27;t grab any plaque and cut up my gums.</li>
            <li> ill probably always buy these and recommend them to anyone who likes thick floss.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find Dentotape at discount stores.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Johnson and Johnson has decided to phase this out</li>
            <li> the ubiquitous store brands of ribbon floss ALL just shred and fall apart when I try to use them, but this does not - so saying it works for me isn&#x27;t faint praise.  </li>
            <li> Why is dental floss so expensive now?</li>
            <li> Not for the faint of heat flosser</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and have never been unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> Bad breath is not what turns anybody on.</li>
            <li> so I know the difference and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is not Tape, it&#x27;s just Floss. :(</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t convinced because I like my Glide and hate when floss shreds.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s is as shown, and the price is right! If you use Deno tape, which you should, because it is a lot better than just regular floss, it doesn&#x27;t break when trying to get in tight close together teeth, and does a much better job of cleaning!----Get it, and you will never go back to regular floss again!!---Rod</li>
            <li> Have used this for years.</li>
            <li> Good value. Like the thicker tape.</li>
            <li> This is what my husband prefers.  It works well on his teeth.</li>
            <li> I have used this tape before and am totally satisfied. Not meant for closely spaced teeth.</li>
            <li> This is not flat Ribbon Floss. It is common Reach Dentotape which is just really big tooth floss. I was expecting Ribbon Floss, and just wasted my money. Don&#x27;t be fooled. Reach does not call this Ribbon Floss. I bought this product on Amazon as a pack of 4.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find Dentotape at discount stores. At target, it is overpriced, not to mention that I have stopped shopping there since I found out that they support right-wing politicians. This product was sent promptly. One of the four dispensers had a broken seal, and teh vendor issued credit, including the pro-rated shipping cost. I will buy it again when I run out. I have used DentoTape for years, and it works well.</li>
            <li> Could not find this product locally but since my periodontist recommended it and gave me a tiny sample, I was glad to find it on Amazon.  It works better than most floss but still occasionally does not get everything.</li>
            <li> love this stuff - wish you could find it in store - all arrived as new product - I buy multiple packages each time anticipating you wont be able to get in the future</li>
            <li> Timely and very affordable.</li>
            <li> I have not recieved my dental tape yet and it has been 3 or 4 weeks since I ordered my tape!  I am really quite upset about this!  I don&#x27;t like paying for something and then NOT GETTING IT!</li>
            <li> I used to try to save a little money by buying store-brand dental tape.  But the generic stuff has steadily declined in quality at all the major drugstore chains in New York City.   This brand, on the other hand, remains effective and easy to use. But it is hard to find at the drug store, so I&#x27;ve been ordering it online.</li>
            <li> After wasteing money on many other brands, I finally found this floss that will not shred or break during use.</li>
            <li> No one around here carries this any more (Walmart and CVS included)!  This is the only floss that works for me- it takes a really strong floss not to shred in my tight teeth. It&#x27;s easy to hold and very comfortable. I just hope Amazon doesn&#x27;t run out!</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase, came super fast and was exactly as specified.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I can never find this floss where I shop. The store brand is available but I prefer Reach--it just seems better than other brands. Glad to have found it here. Very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I have resorted to buying Reach Dentape on line because it is by far the best product of its kind on the market but is now no longer available in my local stores</li>
            <li> The DentoTape works well. The only issue I have with this product is that it does have a tendency to break. I work around this by being careful to move frequently to new flossing locations on the tape.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST floss. My dentist recommended this floss and love it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize this stuff is like rope, won&#x27;t fit with 1/2 my teeth.</li>
            <li> I had the misfortune once of using a different type of floss (a more \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; non-tape variety) in between my biannual dentist visit, and the results did not look promising.  Skip forward about six months later, and after I corrected my ways and went back to using this type of floss, my teeth improved dramatically compared to the previous visit.     If you have tightly spaced teeth, I don&#x27;t know what to tell you; other varieties of floss might be easier to manipulate in your cramped spaces, but they will not do the job well enough.  You need the friction provided by this thicker brand in order to remove the plaque from your teeth.  I am no dentist or certified specialist, but ditch the freebies your dental hygienist gives you and buy this floss.  Any dentist worth their salt will know that tape is needed for good dental health.</li>
            <li> A repeat order for my favorite dental floss, highly recommended by my periodontist.  This offering was at a particularly good price!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001E96P6O Reach DentoTAPE Waxed Ribbon Dental Floss, 100-Yard Dispensers (Pack of 4)]]  The tape I received was not waxed, as advertised on Amazon.com.   I can use it, but it is not what I ordered.  I&#x27;ve used both so I know the difference and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I can not use it.  Is is too wide.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY floss I can use on my teeth without shredding, breaking, or getting fibers stuck in between.  I have very tight spaces, especially around the back molars, and this stuff works.  Everything else, even Glide or good imitations of this product, can&#x27;t do the job.  I&#x27;ll always use it!</li>
            <li> Amazon found this hard to find product at the best price!  Thank you, again!</li>
            <li> I tried this floss while staying at a friend&#x27;s place and it was great. his dentist recommended it him and I can recommend it too. it works much better than any other floss I&#x27;ve tried, glide etc., cleans really well. when walgreens stopped carrying it I switched to amazon.</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing that works on my teeth. They are very close and this is the only type floss that will stand up to the close tolerances between them. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I switched from dental floss to DentoTape several years ago.  Originally the product was unwaxed, and I was very reluctant to order this product.  However, I&#x27;ve been 100% satisfied and have noticed no significant difference between this \\&quot;new\\&quot; version and the old original one.  It is comfortable on the fingers, fits between my closely-spaced teeth, and never shreds.</li>
            <li> I always get top marks from my dentist on my hygiene, and I think using a good floss is key.  Now that Costco only stocks Glide, I had to find a source for something that didn&#x27;t break, and actually had at least a little abrasive quality to it.  Reach DentoTAPE Waxed Ribbon Dental Floss fills the bill.  I think I might have preferred even a wider dental tape if it were available.  The larger container is also something I appreciate.  With something like the small Glide containers, there is a lot of container wasted with a relatively small amount of floss, and with the breakage I experienced, that didn&#x27;t go far.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great if you have a little space between your teeth. It doesn&#x27;t fray and isn&#x27;t sharp. It really gets the crud out. Since it is thicker than normal floss, you will need to move it down each side of the tooth instead of straight down to the gums, which is the proper way to floss. ;-)</li>
            <li> I use tape instead of regular floss because floss tends to break more easily than tape (at least for me) and there is nothing more annoying than having floss stuck between your teeth!  So I exclusively use this brand as it works every time with no breakage.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered promptly.  This was a purchase of a product I have used before, and met all expectations.</li>
            <li> Many retailers have discontinued carrying this item and those that still do are asking way too much. This is a great product at a great price. Thanks for the savings. I&#x27;ll be back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d searched for just the right floss and think this is it.</li>
            <li> Way too wide to fit between my teeth. I suppose this would work good if you have 1cm gaps between each of your teeth.</li>
            <li> Got samples from my dentist and loved how clean my teeth felt after using it. I appreciate the thickness of the floss and feel like its getting into every nook and cranny. I also have wires behind my top and bottom front teeth and with this floss I don&#x27;t need special threaders to get it through. It&#x27;s sturdy enough to thread through on its own. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My order was for 4 of the same item.  When they arrived (promptly), one of the packages had been opened.  I sent three e-mails to the provider and never heard back on any of them.  BOO!</li>
            <li> Difficult to find in my local stores.  I prefer it to the thinner offerings.</li>
            <li> The dental floss won&#x27;t come out of the container easily.  No matter how hard you pull it, it stays stuck inside.  I would like the dental floss if I could get it out.</li>
            <li> I am a dentist and this is the only floss on the market that I like, very convenient to order it here.</li>
            <li> The dental tape is one I have used for 20 years so I am completely happy with the product. It is not readily found in stores.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3N7M898YGE7VW]]I was misled by one of the reviews saying that it could go into tiny corners but it can&#x27;t! Not in my mouth anyway!!&lt;br /&gt;It actually hurt me when I try to use it so not a good purchase for me.&lt;br /&gt;Might be just good for someone with wide spaced teeth though!</li>
            <li> I simply LOVE this dental floss! It is sturdy and thick, so it holds up under vigorous flossing. The price for all 4 of them is a great deal!</li>
            <li> And we can never find it in the store. Tight teeth love this! It comes in. Four pack so it lasts a long time. We use it in flossing tools too.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best floss available. I have used it for years. Unfortunately it has become impossible to find in the stores for the past several years. It used to be labeled simply &amp;#34;Dentotape&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s still the same great product. I don&#x27;t know why Walgreens, CVS, and others choose not to carry it.... Thanks to Amazon I won&#x27;t be without it for several more years</li>
            <li> nice that I don&#x27;t have to try and find this in the store now</li>
            <li> I got the dental floss because I was in very short supply.  Reach dental floss was avaialble and it was the same as I had, same type of floss and I&#x27;ve been very happy since purchased it. GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended this floss because it is has a thicker diameter than what I normally use.  I wasn&#x27;t convinced because I like my Glide and hate when floss shreds.  I finally switched, and the hygienist said she could tell a difference from my last cleaning.  The floss may not work for some people with very tightly packed teeth though.</li>
            <li> This is the best floss available. I have almost no space between my teeth and I use this floss religiously. So does my awesome dentist. Unfortunately Johnson and Johnson has decided to phase this out and so I am stock piling. It is a shame because those thin flosses don&#x27;t grab any plaque and cut up my gums. Please keep making this product J&amp;J!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I was looking for. Dentotape has become almost impossible to find in my local area stores, so I was very happy to find this source online.</li>
            <li> Once I started using dento tape instead of floss, I can&#x27;t switch back. I love the way this stuff doesn&#x27;t shred between my teeth. The only problem I have is that when we get close to the end of the roll, the tape gets stuck in the box and we have to open it and roll it off the spindle inside.</li>
            <li> This tape is a bit thick for my tight contacts, but it works OK.  It can be a bit of a struggle to get it through some of the tightest contacts, as compared to Glide.  Sometimes it gets a bit frayed, but it rarely breaks.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> This floss is no joke.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find this Dento Tape available online. It&#x27;s very hard to find in stores these days. Fair price, speedy shipping, Thank you! Four dispensers will last me awhile but I&#x27;ll be back to buy more when they run out.</li>
            <li> I use to double up my floss.  Don&#x27;t need to with this one.  It does the job well.  The only floss I get.</li>
            <li> I have been using this floss for number of years. I have really liked it over previous plain floss that used. It&#x27;s nice to be able to buy it quantity. Slightly less expensive than per item at Walmart.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find so I think I have enough for about 10 years now.  Seems fine to me.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand of dental floss my husband will use.  His teeth are very tight and he&#x27;s never been able to use the regular dental floss since it would tear.  He&#x27;s tried other brands of dental tape and not liked any of them, so this is what I stick with ordering for him.</li>
            <li> I live in a country where ONE 100-yard dental floss dispenser costs what I pay for a package of four 100-yard dispensers on Amazon. I have the product shipped to an American address, and then sent on to me here. Even when I add the shipping costs, the total price for four dispensers is considerably less than what I would pay for four dispensers here in this country. So it&#x27;s a good deal any way I look at it. I will continue to shop this way, since I am unwilling to pay the exorbitant prices demanded by pharmacies in non-American countries.</li>
            <li> I prefer the tape over the floss!</li>
            <li> This is the best dental floss on planet earth ..... that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to locate on the retail shelf. I have looked at every store I go into with no results.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have 400 yards ! Woo Hoo!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon..........</li>
            <li> There was no mention that this is extra thick and for people with wide-spread teeth.  I can&#x27;t use it at all!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this and it&#x27;s made a big difference in cleaning my teeth. It seems to clean off the plaque better than the Teflon coated flosses. It doesn&#x27;t work well for my husband because it&#x27;s too thick for the very tight spaces between his teeth.</li>
            <li> Local drugstores don&#x27;t stock it. Only their own brands. Hateful. But from big A,&lt;br /&gt;Good old Johnson&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Wide band Dento Tape. Works great for those that break their Floss when Flossing.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to hold on too and use.</li>
            <li> My teeth are food magnets and tear through floss too easily.  This tape is thick enough to remove the food particles without being shredded.  A pack of 4 will last me 2 years, but I don&#x27;t have to shop again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, Johnson Reach unflavored dental tape.   Hard to find in the usual big stores, as they push their house brands.  Price was right and delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this product at local stores anymore.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s been taken off the market but I was glad to find it on-line and happily paid shipping cost for four 100 yd. dispensers.  My teeth shred all other flosses which include flosses as expensive as J&amp;J.  Can&#x27;t beat if for strength.</li>
            <li> Johnson &amp; Johnson DentoTape used to be the only dental tape available in the stores.  Now CVS &amp; Target have their own house brands, which they sell for a marginally cheaper price.  However, their products invariably shred as you draw them through your teeth!  They&#x27;re just not as good as Reach Dento Tape.    When I saw the discount with this vendor, I took the opportunity to stock up!  Their response time was very quick, and the order came well packed.</li>
            <li> Works for me.  Note - the ubiquitous store brands of ribbon floss ALL just shred and fall apart when I try to use them, but this does not - so saying it works for me isn&#x27;t faint praise.  I used Johnson &amp; Johnson &amp;#34;Denotape&amp;#34; for many years; this seems a worthy successor.</li>
            <li> I prefer waxed dental tape because it is not slick like the unwaxed Glide versions.  That means it is easy to use; it won&#x27;t slide off my fingers when using it.  I bought the Wegman&#x27;s brand and really liked it.  Reading the description - the packaging says it is for widely spaced teeth - I expected this to be at least as good and probably better.  It is not as thick as the Wegman&#x27;s brand.  I will use this until it is gone but not likely buy more of it.</li>
            <li> Johnson and Johnson is the only brand of dental tape I will use.  J &amp; J brand always stays together and does not fray and get stuck in my teeth like other brands do.  My order came in the time I was promised.  I&#x27;m very happy with the product and the supplier.</li>
            <li> I can no longer find this product on the shelf anywhere. I hope it does not mean that they are no longer manufacturing it. Nothing else I&#x27;ve used compares to the &amp;#34;Reach Dento Tape&amp;#34; waxed ribbon floss. Please keep it in production. I can&#x27;t be the only one hooked on the stuff!!!???</li>
            <li> Brilliant. Far better than that useless waxed micro-thin stuff (you know what I mean) that does nothing to clean out the gunk between your pearly whites.  My dental hygenist confirmed that this tape is the real deal.</li>
            <li> This is the only floss I like to use. I have tried several types and brands, but this it the best as far as I am concerned. It doesn&#x27;t fray in tight spots and has enough body to it to do some good.</li>
            <li> This is a great floss.  Hard to find in stores.  Really cleans the teeth good.</li>
            <li> The Reach DentoTAPE waxed ribbon dental floss is excellent.  It is heavy duty, reaches all the hard-to-get places, and give your teeth a shine!</li>
            <li> This is the best dental floss there is, I will not use any other.  I bought 4 to last a while as I can not find it in the stores here.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a general emergency/DIY strong tying medium. Is pretty strong. I did try it as floos, and if you don&#x27;t have large gaps in your teeth, it is uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> There are so many variations of dental products in the US, but, for people like me who likes a thicker floss, Reach is the only option?  The floss is well made, the container stays together and the metal prongs cut the floss efficiently, so, this would be five stars if they also offered the thicker floss in mint and cinnamon, since plain is not the ideal floss for me.</li>
            <li> It arrived as per the order.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, which is not a bad thing. However, if you have crowns, you should be careful not to just use it in the usual way. My endodontist told me the trick: the usual way going down between the teeth, but then pull it out like you&#x27;re unthreading a needle, so you don&#x27;t snag the crown and pull it up off the tooth.</li>
            <li> I found this awesome deal because I could not consistently find it at the local stores.</li>
            <li> Why is dental floss so expensive now? It&#x27;s essentially string in shiny packaging. Lots of packaging, not much string.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this floss because it&#x27;s comfortable, but also each unit is on quite a big roll so you feel like you&#x27;re actually getting something for your money and not wasting so many resources on packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish someone would just sell me a mammoth roll of the string by itself, a decade&#x27;s supply. I can cut it with scissors for pete&#x27;s sake.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dental floss. By a name brand. And it came quickly. What more do you need to know?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find Dental Tape in the usual drug stores.</li>
            <li> This floss works great!</li>
            <li> Ths is the real stuff at a great price.</li>
            <li> DentoTape cleans better than regular dental floss for me. It is also gentler on gums. Good price and great service.</li>
            <li> Bad breath is not what turns anybody on. Hygiene is required to present oneself conscientiously in any situation requiring any degree of intimacy. Buying this stuff bulk only makes sense.</li>
            <li> This floss is way to thick to get between my teeth comfortably. If you have widely spaced teeth, this may be the floss for you, but it certainly is not for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good dental floss. This is a slightly thicker, string-like floss.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my dentist, and it is by far the best on the market. Purchasing online in bulk is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Reach DentoTape waxed ribbon Dental Floss is easy to hold in my fingers and it is strong and does not shred when two teeth are tight together. Because of its strength&lt;br /&gt;one can use more pressure and get a better job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> Perfect purchase.  This item is impossible to find locally at retail.  Floss can be found, but not tape.  Thanks much for filling the gap!  A+++</li>
            <li> Been using this type of dental tape for years, helping to minimize dental costs.  Having several backups on the shelf means I will hopefully never run out of dental floss.</li>
            <li> I like this better than another other floss. I&#x27;ve used it for years and have never been unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> The local drugstores--CVS, Duane Reade--carried only their own lousy brand of dental floss and no dental tape. I didn&#x27;t have the energy to travel around the city looking for dental tape! So I ordered top-of- the line Johnson and Johnson over Amazon and presto!! It arrived in my mailbox in three days. And since I bought four at once, they were  relatively inexpensive. Hallelujah.</li>
            <li> Not as wide as I would have liked, but better than most tapes.</li>
            <li> The pricing was fair, the delivery was speedy, and the product was first class and not some unknown brand.  The only drawback is having to buy so many at once.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t find a tape in the super market that was any good. this tape doesn&#x27;t shred and also is wide enough for my liking. would buy it again in a minute.</li>
            <li> So much better than the regular thickness of dental floss. Great price.</li>
            <li> I have used DentoTAPE for over 30 years. My dentist told me the proper way to floss was to scrape up one tooth and down the next. He also said NOBODY does that. He said to use tape because when you scrape, you are actually scraping the sides of two teeth at once. You do not need wide spaced teeth, you just need two teeth side by side.</li>
            <li> Excellent dental floss; have used this brand for years.</li>
            <li> Much thicker than expected and not like a tape at all.  Not for closely spaced teeth, despite what some others have said.  Now I&#x27;m stuck with a lifetime supply.</li>
            <li> I had been searching the stores for this but could not find.  The tape is perfect and gets all food particles I have even the ones that I have parcials with.  So easy to use.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Great way to floss the hard to reach areas. It cleans the gum line well.</li>
            <li> I thought this floss would be a LITTLE thicker to clean between my teeth really well.&lt;br /&gt;It is so thick that I can&#x27;t even use it!&lt;br /&gt;It does not even fit between any of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;AND I bought a 4 pack!&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, you can&#x27;t tell until you try.&lt;br /&gt;Bummer.</li>
            <li> Misleading name. This is not Tape, it&#x27;s just Floss. :(</li>
            <li> I have gap between my teeth and therefore was looking for dental tape that can slide between my teeth effectively. This floss is wide enough that its a bit of a struggle getting it between my teeth, which is what i was after... so no problem there. It lacks the minty flavor that i prefer with some of the other floss..  it was a compromise i made but i knew about it before i ordered so can&#x27;t say i was surprised about that either. The thing i don&#x27;t like is the plasticy material of this floss. Its just a personal preference.. i am sure there are others who may be ok with it. I am probably going to go back to my regular minty floss.</li>
            <li> This tape breaks during usage very easily.  It usually takes 2 to 4 quantities to do my mouth.I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Great to stock up with and never think of floss again!</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding the dentoTape in my local stores so buying it online is the most convenient way of getting it.  This floss works great for me and it does not tear easily.  It glides easily between the teeth and removes plaque.</li>
            <li> If I can&#x27;t find something after looking at two stores I just check Amazon and get what I need.  This is one of those items.</li>
            <li> Been using for years ... much better for tighter teeth then floss!</li>
            <li> My local WalMart stopped carrying it. Tape works better than floss and this tape is just barely waxed so it shreds and removes food  junk as it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Best buy.  I have trouble finding this in local stores.  For me, Glide just shreds or snaps, this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a ribbon type floss like &amp;#34;Glide&amp;#34; which this is not, I think the word &amp;#34;Tape&amp;#34; is misleading, it is a lot thicker than regular floss but is still basically a round floss.</li>
            <li> Quality Dental Tape is hard to find, Waxed Tape is even more difficult to find.  Met all my need.</li>
            <li> This set of dental tape was a good buy for the money, but the wax (along with the thickness of the floss), makes it hard to floss with.  I should have purchased unwaxed dental tape.  The reason I purchased this brand is that it doesn&#x27;t break as easily as Glide dental tape.</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered &amp; expeditious handling. What else can I say? Would reorder when needed. I have used this product for many years.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the reviewer that said that it is actually thick floss. If you want to pull your crowns off this product will do the trick. Threw it away.</li>
            <li> I have used dentotape for years, regular floss gets nicked on my teeth and breaks when I floss. This is the first tiem I used waxed version of this. It does the job.</li>
            <li> Store stopped carrying this but not Amazon.  I have very tight teeth and this is the only floss that holds up.</li>
            <li> This is the best floss for me.  Thick enough to do the job, but not too thick to get through those tough spots, durable, dispenses well, and about as comfortable as floss can be for use.</li>
            <li> DentoTape is a heavier, stronger type of floss that is less likely to break and get stuck between your teeth.  The wax coating makes it just as easy to use as thread-like floss. Once you use it, you won&#x27;t go back to orinary floss. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a ribbon-type floss that I used years ago, and I stumbled across this. It&#x27;s good, very thick floss, but it&#x27;s not in a ribbon shape.</li>
            <li> When all local sources dried up, someone suggested trying Amazon.  This product has been our choice for some time, but local suppliers did not stock it.  Purchasing it as we did made it easy to buy, and stopped the frustration of searching locally. Best of all, we will not run out again.</li>
            <li> floss is thick which is what i like.  it cleans well. sometimes floss gets stuck as it comes out of the hole it comes out from the white casing</li>
            <li> This product is virtually impossible to find in stores, and I live in an urban area.  I am so happy that Amazon carries this because I will continue to use this &amp;#34;dentist-recommended&amp;#34; product</li>
            <li> Did like it at all. It does not fit in between some teeth, as did the previous product by Johnson &amp; Johnson.  It was real tape like, and flat........</li>
            <li> couldnt find in any store nearby. thick floss. my favorite brand/style. ill probably always buy these and recommend them to anyone who likes thick floss.</li>
            <li> Works well for wide spaced teeth</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  It does what it is supposed to do without splitting.  I don&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like waxed dentotape because it doesn&#x27;t fray and leave shreds behind if it hits a sharp edge and it&#x27;s wide enough to really clean out large gaps.  Good product overall.</li>
            <li> J&amp;J Dentotape is the best floss on the planet.  I&#x27;m a dentist -- practicing for 34 years.  I&#x27;m also a dental researcher and developer, author and lecturer.  My first research was in the field of periodontics (gum disease) back in 1976, and I&#x27;m still involved in that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the floss I&#x27;ve had my patients (including patients with gum disease) use, and that I and my family have used for more than 30 years.  And I believe that this deal is a great buy on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Works great for flossing and getting to those hard to reach places.  Would recommend this product to anyone wanting a really good floss.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t break easily like other flat dento tape brands.</li>
            <li> It does a great job. My dentist recommended it and I have been very pleased.  Only thing is I can&#x27;t find it in the stores.</li>
            <li> This is the only dental floss that doesn&#x27;t shred or break very easily between some of my teeth that have fillings.</li>
            <li> Good product. Fast delivery. I will recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I have some very tightly packed teeth that seem to cause other brands of Dental Tape and Dental Floss to break easily.&lt;br /&gt;Other tapes not only break, they get stuck between the spaces in my teeth and cause me great pain. The only Floss that&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t break and that I use to remove the other ones in JJ Dental Tape. Unfortunately, most of the large chains have&lt;br /&gt;resorted to carrying their own House brands of dental tape and generics making it more difficult to find this brand.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t open start to use yet, but I knew it&#x27;s real and good!!!</li>
            <li> This DentoTape is the only product I use for flossing.  Dental floss breaks and rips apart and store brands of DentoTape are not much better.  Also, I find that when I try to buy the Johnson &amp; Johnson Reach product at Rite Aid, CVS, etc. they are always out of the product so buying it at Amazon works best.</li>
            <li> It is not strong enough to do the job.Gets caught between the teeth.</li>
            <li> Great job, as always!!!</li>
            <li> only way to get it no problem but very expansive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I can purchase this online as most drugstores try to push their own brand which shreds like crazy...I always trust the brand names much more.</li>
            <li> Dental tape, as opposed to dental floss, is disappearing from store shelves.  This is a bit thick, but (1) it&#x27;s tape, and (2) no flavoring.  Prefer tape to string (regular floss) because it seens to do a better job.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was called &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34;.  Recent drugstore purchases of the Johnson&amp;Johnson brand of &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34; dental floss have been thin, very strong (never breaking) and do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This version of reach I believe is left over from outdated stock.  The floss is thick, heavily encased in wax and it has no mint flavor as the other &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34; does.  It&#x27;s OK.  It doesn&#x27;t break, but getting it in between tight teeth is not easy considering its width.  Don&#x27;t buy this if you want first class dental floss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always preferred this floss and this was a good deal and shipped quickly</li>
            <li> I received everything as expected. An excellent deal on dental floss. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Last for ever, very large volume of floss, strong and wont beak and cleans very well not for small gapped teeth, will get stuck</li>
            <li> Not for the faint of heat flosser this is extra think and none of that whimpy glide like waxy finish.</li>
            <li> the variance in the width of the tape is wonderful</li>
            <li> The product is fine but I had let my supply run low and it took 3 weeks for this product to arrive. I found it cheaper in the process at Walmart</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seem to find DentoTape anywhere.  My Dentist recommended I try Amazon and he was right!</li>
            <li> NIce since I could not find it locally really like this brand</li>
            <li> I have found this floss to be the best  - much better than regular dental floss and well worth the extra charge.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> The ribbon is stiff enough to fit through my teeth under my permanent metal retainer.</li>
            <li> Recommended by our dentist.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Works as expected I like that I can buy large amount instead of the smaller ones. I do not like the new slippery type it is difficult to get a hold of&lt;br /&gt;to floss. Just my preference.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY 2ND ORDER SINCE LAST YEAR.</li>
            <li> It cleans the plaque much better than the thread type floss!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing too exciting to say aobut Reach Dentotape but I prefer to use it over dental floss and have a hard time finding it supplied in local drug stores or superstores. I would prefer a mint flavored tape but this works great and I am just glad to get it in a four-pack.</li>
