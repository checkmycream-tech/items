            <li>The variety of lotions are good and conveinent to use and open.</li>
            <li>Good way to try different brands.</li>
            <li>4- be bold by swdish beauty,</li>
            <li>Some pretty cheap offbrand lotions..</li>
            <li>Not really worth the money if you&#x27;re an experienced tanner.</li>
            <li>To many of the same kind, I expected more diffrent ones.</li>
            <li>As far as the timely fashion that it arrived, I was satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Order came in only 2 days, which really made me happy, because I was really exited to see what the mix would be like.</li>
            <li>Nano Fresh by Fiji Blend&lt;br</li>
            <li>They come quickly and I love always getting to try different lotions!</li>
            <li>Other reviews seemed pretty good, so I went with this one.</li>
            <li>3- be desired by Swedish beauty, 3- hot legs by protan, and 3- opal by essence.</li>
            <li>Mostly Supre Tan, several Tan Azu, Devoted Creations, and Tan inc.  </li>
            <li>with many different varieties and smells.</li>
            <li>First  of all you cannot buy with confidence because you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re getting.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure why they put so many accelerators or step on tanning lotions because nobody I know including myself will use that many accelerators was that on i&#x27;m not really sure why they put so many accelerators or steps one tanning lotions because nobody I know including myself will use that many accelerators when tanning.</li>
            <li>Great product and arrived earlier than expected!</li>
            <li>I received my order in a week due to bad weather, but I was super happy with the lotions it contained, I have only used a weeks worth of lotion but every packet so far works well and smells great!</li>
            <li>got my 30 count order in today was fast delivery</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.  </li>
            <li>but it really wasn&#x27;t the sellers fault.</li>
            <li>Tanning lotion has a shelf life, and I would really like to know when their end date is.</li>
            <li>they all work very well for enhancing your tan.</li>
            <li>But I have used California Tan and Australian Gold in the past and was happy with the result of those brands.</li>
            <li>I gave the two star review only because it&#x27;s true</li>
            <li>I love the variety that is included and each packet lasts about a tan and a half.</li>
            <li>Too many to list individually but 3 by Australian Gold, 8 from Devoted Creations,  13 Supre Tans, 2 Designer Skins and 1 each from Level 3, California Tan, Tan Asz U and Swedish Beauty.</li>
            <li>I am glad they change the variety, so hopefully I get some different kinds next time! :</li>
            <li>A few were ok, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li>Most of the tanning lotions were either a level one or a step one which does absolutely nothing for somebody that already has a beas most of the tanning lotions were either a level one or a step one which does absolutely nothing for somebody that already has a base tan.  </li>
            <li>Coming from a devoted 4 to 5 day a week indoor tanner for the past 24 years,these are very legit!!!!</li>
            <li>I did get a variety of different packets and the shipping was super fast other than that I will never order this package again.  </li>
            <li>Some lotions may turn you a weird color after several sessions and some lotions seem to make you whiter than you were to begin with lol.</li>
            <li>4 of each packet, all of them are really old, would not buy again.</li>
            <li>This shipped in a few days was so excited to use for my indoor tanning.</li>
            <li>However, I do feel that there was not a good variety, too many doubles.  </li>
            <li>I would have to really consider buying again, the price was comparable with other sellers.</li>

            <li> Every single packet was different!</li>
            <li> was from the picture, the other ones were different.</li>
            <li> Like the wide variety of lotions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That doesn&#x27;t mean that those are the ones you will receive, but hopefully it gives you a general idea</li>

            <li> I truly wish I would have read the description a little more, I prefer &amp;#34;no bronzer&amp;#34; in my lotion and all of these had it, so I was a little disappointed</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous to order.</li>
            <li> Occasionally, I left bottles in my car for several days after tanning and the heat or cold ruined it</li>
            <li> This mix did have a lot of bronzers and a few tinglers as well, Which I like.</li>
            <li> I received my package in a decent time, but was disappointed with the variety.</li>

            <li> I think I&#x27;ll stick to buying bottles of lotion from now instead of useless randomness</li>
            <li> and I do get bored with one lotion after a while.</li>
            <li> Half of them smelled awful.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the packets I got.</li>

It is definitely not for somebody was an experience indoor tanner. I&#x27;m not really sure why they put so many accelerators or step on tanning lotions because nobody I know including myself will use that many accelerators was that on i&#x27;m not really sure why they put so many accelerators or steps one tanning lotions because nobody I know including myself will use that many accelerators when tanning. I got one brand (3 packs) of lotion that had bronzer in it ... Thank goodness at least 3 packs out of 30 I could be satisfied with. I took a risk and I&#x27;m glad it wasn&#x27;t a $50 risk because honestly, I haven&#x27;t even noticed a change in my tan since using any of the packets from this bundle. I think I&#x27;ll stick to buying bottles of lotion from now instead of useless randomness</li>
            <li> I like the variety in the packets, my only drawback is that I cannot find the expiration date on the packets. Tanning lotion has a shelf life, and I would really like to know when their end date is. Other than that they work great! A good mix between more popular brands and lesser known ones.</li>
            <li> Love the samples! They worked great!</li>
            <li> Great product and arrived earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> Like the wide variety of lotions. This shipped in a few days was so excited to use for my indoor tanning. they all work very well for enhancing your tan.</li>
            <li> Received mine today. I wanted to point out again that the description says: &amp;#34;We constantly update so you may or may not receive pictured items.&amp;#34; --- I got 10 different kinds and 3 of each.&lt;br /&gt;One was from the picture, the other ones were different. Here is what I got:&lt;br /&gt;- Purity by devoted creations&lt;br /&gt;- Dark Thrill by Californa Tan&lt;br /&gt;- Secret Crush by Supre&lt;br /&gt;- Nano Fresh by Fiji Blend&lt;br /&gt;- Spectrum by Fiji Blend&lt;br /&gt;- Passion by Australian Gold&lt;br /&gt;- Coco Beach Ultra Dark Bronzer with Hemp by Supre Tan&lt;br /&gt;- Coco Beach Hemp Ultra Dark Tanning Accelerator by Supre&lt;br /&gt; - Psychic by Zeda&lt;br /&gt;- Flirt tini by Fiesta Sun&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That doesn&#x27;t mean that those are the ones you will receive, but hopefully it gives you a general idea what you might get.&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I am very happy with what I got for this price. At my local tanning salon I paid between $7 and $9 for ONE sample pack. Here i get 30 for $19.99 +SH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use different lotions and I do get bored with one lotion after a while. Or some lotions smell good before tanning, but get a funky smell after tanning. Some lotions may turn you a weird color after several sessions and some lotions seem to make you whiter than you were to begin with lol. Occasionally, I left bottles in my car for several days after tanning and the heat or cold ruined it and I flushed $30 - $60 down the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advise --- if you are picky with your lotions, buy them at your local salon. If you like to experiment and try different things and get a ton of different sample packs for a great price, then go ahead and get these! :)&lt;br /&gt;I like surprises so this is perfect for me and I am 100% sure that I will order this again after using all mine. I am glad they change the variety, so hopefully I get some different kinds next time! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**PS: I didn&#x27;t review any of the individual lotions, cause the variety changes. But I have used California Tan and Australian Gold in the past and was happy with the result of those brands.</li>
