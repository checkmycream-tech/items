            <li>Purchased as a gift for my grand-daughter so am not too sure</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron, not just for its barrel circumference, but also because of the handle design.  </li>
            <li>great product, fast shipping</li>
            <li>Love the diameter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad it didn&#x27;t land on my cat or my child.  </li>
            <li>Love that I can select my temp.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love the built in stand.</li>
            <li>not to mention the spring on the top that you are to hold your hair to make a curl does not work</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>What more can I say except thanks for a great product.  </li>
            <li>However I do enjoy the compact size, easy to store, has its own storage bag</li>
            <li>Good shipping ... Works very well on hair</li>
            <li>SUPER FAST SHIPPING, GREAT PRODUCT,</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, has the variable heat settings for my fragile hair  One of the best clip irons I have used.</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>Cleans easily and heats as should.</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast and nicely packaged</li>
            <li>I have short, relaxed hair and it looks great.</li>
            <li>Works great for short hair.</li>
            <li>I like the barrel size and the available temperature variance.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly and can be easily stored using the complementary pouch.</li>
            <li>I bought this originally from W</li>
            <li>I went to the beauty supply and purchased a fabulous $48.00 unit which is superior to this above mentioned unit.</li>
            <li>Just the right size!</li>
            <li>This is a good curling iron, and it is tiny at 1/2 inch.</li>
            <li>This product heats quickly and has a stand to keep it from scorching the furniture.  </li>
            <li>Heated up relatively quickly, and the auto power-cut is a useful feature.</li>
            <li>This one gets really hot!</li>
            <li>It also comes with a special heat protected pouch so that when you are done you can immediately put the curling iron into it and put it away while still hot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Gets hot quickly.</li>
            <li>Works great so long as you clamp near the tip of the iron.  </li>
            <li>However, I discovered that the clamp can be tightened, using a small squarish head screw driver (I have a screw driver with interchangeable heads that works great).</li>
            <li>Settings are in the right place no problem with turning off iron or setting higher heat by error while curling.</li>
            <li>Beautiful curls and they lasting for long periods.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I have a different iron in another size, and because of where the buttons on it are located, just gripping the handle to turn the iron, often depresses the button that shuts it off.  </li>
            <li>- I spray my hair first with hairspray so that the hairspray won&#x27;t get onto the curling iron which makes it yucky and gunky...</li>
            <li>the sleeve to put it in when I put it away (even when it&#x27;s hot) is another plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>I loveeeeee this soooo much!</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, gets hot, hot.</li>
            <li>Since my hair is very straight itdoesn&#x27;t hold a curl very well.  </li>
            <li>nice curls that are tight and stay all day</li>
            <li>As other reviews said your hair easily gets stuck and you end up pulling lots of strands of hair with every pull!</li>
            <li>The part that closes over the barrel does not close tightly enough for recient&#x27;s fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have a larger one that worked fine.</li>
            <li>I use a thermal heat protector spray and maybe that helps, plus I do not have the heat up very high.</li>
            <li>I worked better than she expected and is very durable.</li>
            <li>It began heating up so high it was burning my hair off!</li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>Curls hair really well.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>This one heats up fast, holds curls and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair.</li>
            <li>Better than other brands we have tried.</li>
            <li>Worked well right out of the box (pack, which was unfortunately not the easiest to open).</li>
            <li>I do like ceramic curling irons (if touching up a previous style where some product, like finishing spray, has been used, this type doesn&#x27;t stick to the hair like chrome).  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this curling iron.</li>
            <li>even if it means charging a little more for this iron.</li>
            <li>I needed a curling iron that would get hot enough to give my gray hair a lasting curl quickly because I have no patience to wait.</li>
            <li>I  highly recommend this for anyone who wants a small curl from a great curling iron for a small price.</li>
            <li>The heat only lasted about one week now it does not get as hot.  </li>
            <li>I have thin hair and so a ceramic curler works best (and a small thinner iron)</li>
            <li>like I said, I fixed it with a piece of tape.  </li>
            <li>Hair is soft with no frizz at all.</li>
            <li>The clamp is not tight to the heated barrel of the iron</li>
            <li>The clamp is not tight, but this iron works for me regardless.</li>
            <li>does not get hot enough and cord too short.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re located right where your thumb should go, causing the tool to be either inadvertently turned down or off.  </li>
            <li>Clamp not tight enough to hold hair.</li>
            <li>I started on No. 3 (just for a warm touch-up), and wondered why it was getting so hot until I noticed the dial was up to &amp;#34;20&amp;#34; -- as your moving the rod to roll each curl, the dial rotates :(.  </li>
            <li>and I was pleased with the results (as long as I kept turning the dial back down), but I do believe the manufacturer should make a few improvements...</li>
            <li>I do not return things, I believe that it is too much of a hassle due to the long hours I work.</li>
            <li>I have thin fine hair</li>
            <li>the other curling iron I purchased it did not even get delivered very un professional.</li>

            <li> I have thin fine hair</li>
            <li> the other curling iron I purchased it did not even get delivered very un professional.</li>
            <li> I like this, it creates tight curls in my hair, which has a lot of natural curl anyway, so this helps gives it some structure instead of just frizzing.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only one small problem with it &amp; tape quickly fixed that.  </li>
            <li> I will have to replace it before long....</li>
            <li> The only fault I find is that the grip on my hair is very loose.  </li>
            <li> Then, randomly this morning while halfway into curling my hair, the spring mechanism just completely collapsed and a HOT screw came flying out.  </li>
            <li> The problem with this curling iron is that it does not clamp the hair tight enough to get enough of a result.</li>
            <li> Would definitely suggest looking at other curling irons and not buying this one.</li>
            <li> but I wish it had a bigger spot to hold with other hand.  </li>
            <li> It is too loose.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is short I only curl a small section at a time.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the user has to be vigilant about the temperature setting, as the dial is in a place where it is constantly touched during use, and the slightest touch will move the dial.</li>
            <li> I expected it make curls like my cheaper curling iron from conair.  </li>
            <li> I bent it back a few times over about 6 months, and it held up.  </li>
            <li> I found the clamp to be too loose, as other reviewers stated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed, however, that the control dial for the temperature moves so easily, and unless you have a thick grasp of hair, the cover over the rod is not very tight.  </li>
            <li> There, it&#x27;s tighter than closer farther down the barrel.  </li>
            <li> Just tighten each slightly, don&#x27;t over-tighten.</li>
            <li> But a pain in the butt when you have long thick hair</li>
            <li> I finally received my curling iron after a long await when they put the wrong address, I went to use this product this morning...</li>
            <li> The clip is a little touchy, but I took that into consideration before I bought it.</li>
            <li> I wish the spring on the iron was a little tighter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a shame they don&#x27;t sell curling irons with longer barrels :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to work the heat temps</li>
            <li> Not a very good grip.</li>
            <li> so my hair slips out unless I work very slowly.  </li>
            <li> Hate that the clamp is so half... uh... hearted.  </li>
            <li> Useless</li>
            <li> Sorry I bought it, should have stuck with the conair</li>
            <li> Unable to find the Revlon model she had before, but this did not work for her.</li>
            <li> It heats well but is almost impossible to use with thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Very irritating and disappointing.  </li>
            <li> ; buttom are in a bad spot.  </li>
            <li> If you buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate that part, but</li>

            <li> It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This only worked properly for 1 month. It began heating up so high it was burning my hair off! I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> I bought this originally from W******, about 9 months ago. I found the clamp to be too loose, as other reviewers stated. However, I discovered that the clamp can be tightened, using a small squarish head screw driver (I have a screw driver with interchangeable heads that works great). There are two screws, one on each side of the clamp. Just tighten each slightly, don&#x27;t over-tighten. The curling iron works great after tightening the clamp. I have to tighten the clamp periodically to keep it working properly. I love the 1/2 inch size, adjustable heat setting and auto shut off.  I&#x27;m stocking up since it is difficult to find all the features that I need, plus the price is better on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Returned! As other reviews said your hair easily gets stuck and you end up pulling lots of strands of hair with every pull! It wasn&#x27;t for me</li>
            <li> As described and packaged well. Purchased as a gift for my grand-daughter so am not too sure how well it works.</li>
            <li> nice curls that are tight and stay all day</li>
            <li> Very pleased. Works perfectly, heats up quickly, too.</li>
            <li> Worked well right out of the box (pack, which was unfortunately not the easiest to open). Heated up relatively quickly, and the auto power-cut is a useful feature.</li>
            <li> did not meet up to my standards.  I expected it make curls like my cheaper curling iron from conair.  It quit after 9 years.</li>
            <li> Heats up very fast, and the curls are perfect. The clip is a little touchy, but I took that into consideration before I bought it. It&#x27;s well worth the money. It&#x27;s just a shame they don&#x27;t sell curling irons with longer barrels :/</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron, not just for its barrel circumference, but also because of the handle design.  I do not accidentally turn this iron off while I&#x27;m using it.  I have a different iron in another size, and because of where the buttons on it are located, just gripping the handle to turn the iron, often depresses the button that shuts it off.  This Remington iron, though, has the controls out of the way.  I like it so much, I bought the 1 1/2&amp;#34; model also!</li>
            <li> The clamp is not tight to the heated barrel of the iron so my hair slips out unless I work very slowly.  Very irritating and disappointing.  It heats well but is almost impossible to use with thin hair.  I will have to replace it before long....it is probably a defective unit rather than a design issue or at leat I would hope so.</li>
            <li> Works well. Would like it to get hotter.</li>
            <li> Curls stay in all day and don&#x27;t come out until you wash your hair. No need to turn it up all the way--I use it at about halfway, and I get Shirley Temple ringlets that I have to actually pull out a bit so I don&#x27;t look like ...well, Shirley Temple. Heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> great product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is a good curling iron, and it is tiny at 1/2 inch. It does not feel like it burns my hair or over dries it. I  highly recommend this for anyone who wants a small curl from a great curling iron for a small price.</li>
            <li> This curling works really good. I have thin hair and so a ceramic curler works best (and a small thinner iron) - I spray my hair first with hairspray so that the hairspray won&#x27;t get onto the curling iron which makes it yucky and gunky... It also comes with a special heat protected pouch so that when you are done you can immediately put the curling iron into it and put it away while still hot.</li>
            <li> I do like ceramic curling irons (if touching up a previous style where some product, like finishing spray, has been used, this type doesn&#x27;t stick to the hair like chrome).  I&#x27;m disappointed, however, that the control dial for the temperature moves so easily, and unless you have a thick grasp of hair, the cover over the rod is not very tight.  I started on No. 3 (just for a warm touch-up), and wondered why it was getting so hot until I noticed the dial was up to &amp;#34;20&amp;#34; -- as your moving the rod to roll each curl, the dial rotates :(.  It curling iron did work and I was pleased with the results (as long as I kept turning the dial back down), but I do believe the manufacturer should make a few improvements... even if it means charging a little more for this iron.</li>
            <li> 1/2 incher ceramics are a challenge to find. Love the diameter.  Hate that the clamp is so half... uh... hearted.  Works great so long as you clamp near the tip of the iron.  Otherwise, expect to have grab a big ol chunk to get any grip on the strands.</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks of operating it, the heat started to bend the clamp, so the hair would not actually hold between the clamp and the barrel.  I bent it back a few times over about 6 months, and it held up.  Then, randomly this morning while halfway into curling my hair, the spring mechanism just completely collapsed and a HOT screw came flying out.  I&#x27;m so glad it didn&#x27;t land on my cat or my child.  This curling iron is a hazard.</li>
            <li> This curling iron does great, and you can&#x27;t beat the price! I bought it for my wife for Christmas and she loves it!</li>
            <li> The problem with this curling iron is that it does not clamp the hair tight enough to get enough of a result. Would definitely suggest looking at other curling irons and not buying this one. Was torn between a 2-star and/or a 3-star rating. Actually it is about a 2-1/2 star.</li>
            <li> Good iron, but I wish it had a bigger spot to hold with other hand.  I still burn myself every so often.</li>
            <li> Beautiful curls and they lasting for long periods. Would encourage you to purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron!  There&#x27;s only one small problem with it &amp; tape quickly fixed that.  The temperature control knob &amp; the &amp;#34;on &amp; off&amp;#34; buttom are in a bad spot.  They&#x27;re located right where your thumb should go, causing the tool to be either inadvertently turned down or off.  I hate that part, but like I said, I fixed it with a piece of tape.  No worries!</li>
            <li> Not a very good grip.</li>
            <li> I will keep it. I bought it because I went very short with my hair and a 3/4&amp;#34; iron was just too big.  This product heats quickly and has a stand to keep it from scorching the furniture.  The only fault I find is that the grip on my hair is very loose.  It actually depends on how close to the out er edge you wrap it.  There, it&#x27;s tighter than closer farther down the barrel.  I like it but don&#x27;t think I will re[lace it with the same brand when the time comes.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is very straight itdoesn&#x27;t hold a curl very well.  However, with this curling iron it gives a tighter, longer lasting curl.  Good quality product that heats up quickly.  I&#x27;m not sure how to work the heat temps but if you need that type of thing then... it&#x27;s there.  I use it almost every day.</li>
            <li> I like this, it creates tight curls in my hair, which has a lot of natural curl anyway, so this helps gives it some structure instead of just frizzing.  Heats up fast, gets hot, hot. You can control the heat though from 0 - 30.</li>
            <li> The heat only lasted about one week now it does not get as hot.  The clamp loosened up and my hair slips through it.  I went to the beauty supply and purchased a fabulous $48.00 unit which is superior to this above mentioned unit.</li>
            <li> Excellent curling iron! Grabs hair and curls in such a smoooooth fashion, that hair doesn&#x27;t stick to iron while curling . Settings are in the right place no problem with turning off iron or setting higher heat by error while curling. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> But a pain in the butt when you have long thick hair</li>
            <li> Works great! Love that I can select my temp.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, love the settings and the ceramic barrel.  Would highly recommend this curling iron. Shipment was fast and nicely packaged</li>
            <li> Good shipping ... Works very well on hair I love it</li>
            <li> This curling iron is great. Hair is soft with no frizz at all. I have short, relaxed hair and it looks great. I use a thermal heat protector spray and maybe that helps, plus I do not have the heat up very high. I set it between 10 and 5. Because my hair is short I only curl a small section at a time. The clamp is not tight, but this iron works for me regardless. I absolutely love it. Plus you get a 2 year warranty. Best iron I have ever had. I love the built in stand. No flipping that silver thing in an out. I believe you will be happy with this purchase..</li>
            <li> Works great for short hair. My only complaint is that the user has to be vigilant about the temperature setting, as the dial is in a place where it is constantly touched during use, and the slightest touch will move the dial.</li>
            <li> Curls hair really well. Gets hot quickly.</li>
            <li> Cleans easily and heats as should. Better than other brands we have tried.</li>
            <li> has met all my expectations. I needed a curling iron that would get hot enough to give my gray hair a lasting curl quickly because I have no patience to wait. My last curling iron needed a lot of time to heat up - this one is instant.</li>
            <li> I finally received my curling iron after a long await when they put the wrong address, I went to use this product this morning... this Remington is not Ceramic, it is actually metal, it shut off on me with in 5 min of doing my hair this morning. not to mention the spring on the top that you are to hold your hair to make a curl does not work I do not recommend this product or the shop I purchased it from. Mind you I do not return things, I believe that it is too much of a hassle due to the long hours I work., so buyer beware of what electronics you purchase on Amazon.com or its people that sell it to you. the other curling iron I purchased it did not even get delivered very un professional. never again. Amazon stick to your books and cds</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clamp onto the hair! Useless</li>
            <li> I have not used yet. However I do enjoy the compact size, easy to store, has its own storage bag</li>
            <li> SUPER FAST SHIPPING, GREAT PRODUCT, NO COMPLAINTS!</li>
            <li> for those of us who are flying in the am, having it turn off even when I forget to is great.  the sleeve to put it in when I put it away (even when it&#x27;s hot) is another plus.&lt;br /&gt;works great.&lt;br /&gt;reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Love it. Just the right size!</li>
            <li> This does not heat up.  I plan to return it.</li>
            <li> hair slips out and it dosen&#x27;t hold it so you can curl. I don&#x27;t like it at all. Sorry I bought it, should have stuck with the conair</li>
            <li> Heats instantly.  Well made.  Nice stand.  Its sturdy.  Reasonably priced and gets the job done.  What more can I say except thanks for a great product.  If you buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered a 3/4&amp;#34;, and received a 1/2&amp;#34;. Smaller than I&#x27;d like, but works well enough.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a B-Day Gift (On her List). She loves it. I worked better than she expected and is very durable.</li>
            <li> Its exactly as shown. Heats quickly and can be easily stored using the complementary pouch. The iron is also lightweight and gives a nice desired finish in the curls.</li>
            <li> I loveeeeee this soooo much! I use it every time I want to create a curly look. My curls even last 3 days! Incredible!</li>
            <li> does not get hot enough and cord too short.</li>
            <li> I like the barrel size and the available temperature variance. What I do not like is the spring clasp. It is too loose. Often lose the hair that is being curled causing to repeat the process.</li>
            <li> The part that closes over the barrel does not close tightly enough for recient&#x27;s fine hair.  Unable to find the Revlon model she had before, but this did not work for her.</li>
            <li> I wish the spring on the iron was a little tighter.</li>
            <li> Clamp not tight enough to hold hair. I have a larger one that worked fine.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with quality of the product....</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, has the variable heat settings for my fragile hair  One of the best clip irons I have used.</li>
            <li> Should have gotten one with a control to control the tempature.  This one gets really hot!</li>
            <li> Great got it on timen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been happy with Remington curling irons. This one heats up fast, holds curls and doesn&#x27;t pull my hair. I have thin fine hair so the smoothness and ease of using this works well. Especially can&#x27;t beat the price as well!!</li>
