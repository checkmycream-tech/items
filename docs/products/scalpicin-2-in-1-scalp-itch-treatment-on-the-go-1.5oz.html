    <ol>
            <li>Perfect for an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>best purchase ever</li>
            <li>It must be me because others are very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>Awesome product!</li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>the itch is gone or greatly reduced.  </li>
            <li>This works great for controlling sebbhorheic dermatitis, but you have to keep using it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for scalp fungus or psoriasis.</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I have found that this product is as good as any I have used and comes without a prescription.</li>
            <li>It feels so good to my scalp.</li>
            <li>Both good products - they work and they don&#x27;t affect your hair styling in any way.</li>
            <li>Very effective for itchy scalp and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>packaged well, arrived on time, works so well its amazing.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, is not greasy, and does not smell.  </li>
            <li>this medication is soothing and cooling when applied and the fragrance is clean and pleasant, but, most important it&#x27;s working for me!&lt;br</li>
            <li>But once the wounds are healed, the salacylic acid works way better than the hydrocortisone.</li>
            <li>Better than nothing.</li>
            <li>I  really do like this product for a  itchy scalp,it works great.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you do as it says.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Glad I found this when I did.  </li>
            <li>I take pretty good with taking care of  my hair and treating my scalp.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s the best review I can give other than adding that it arrived on time and well packaged.</li>
            <li>The drive to scratch was pretty strong, so I sat in front of a fan and let it blow on my scalp.</li>
            <li>Scalpicin is also sold with Hydrocortisone as the active ingredient but for me the&lt;br /&gt;Salicylic acid product is more effective.</li>
            <li>This is worth the buy.</li>
            <li>In the long run, this product is not cost effective for me.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered from psoriasis for over a year and have tried many products, both prescription and OTC, most of which have had little or no effect .</li>
            <li>She gave me two different kinds of prescription shampoo (Ketoconazole and Selenium sulfide) but neither works very well on its own;</li>
            <li>The Scalpicin in the yellow box costs more than the hydrocortisone-based Scalpicin in the blue box, but this one is a more effective treatment using salicylic acid that actually treats the condition by treating and eliminating the bacteria that cause it (unlike hydrocortisone which just temporarily numbs the itchiness).</li>
            <li>The first time I put this stuff on my scalp, I felt like my brain was being cooked.</li>
            <li>I have since turned to using organic neem oil diluted in carrier oils and doing a hot oil treatment with it once a week.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it states.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more when my bottles run out.</li>
            <li>This certainly lives up to the description.  </li>
            <li>these ointments really help ease the itching and flaky scalps.</li>
            <li>This product really helps reduce itching and flaking.</li>
            <li>Thanks  </li>
            <li>you so much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>If you have allergies then the hydrocortisone one (Max strength) really stops the problem from even happening or recurring.</li>
            <li>This scalpacin has salability acid, it helps, but the other scalpacin product works much better</li>
            <li>Well satisfied, at least with my mild psoriasis.</li>
            <li>Though I have used previous bottles for about a year after expiry and product has still worked so it is probably ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok because it works for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I have tried many things and if I shampoo daily with a shampoo that has the same main ingredient that is in the 2in1 and apply the 2in1 three times daily, the problems stays under control.</li>
            <li>For less severe cases, this will work fine.</li>
            <li>I have had an itchy scalp most of my life due to having outrageously wild, dry curly hair.</li>
            <li>While this 2-in-1 helps clear stuff up.</li>
            <li>could not take it at first, but I talked myself into calming down and just waiting for the burn to subside.  </li>
            <li>Works as good or not better than drugstore brand ------------- with about HALF the cost!!!</li>

            <li> Even dry winter itch can be maddening but this product helps reduce if not eliminate that problem.  </li>
            <li> Helps to soften dry areas on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Be careful when applying - use latex gloves to protect hands.</li>
            <li> Be careful using it after scratching your scalp, though, it does burn a bit.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it does as advertised.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the expiry date.</li>
            <li> But time the shorter expiration date let me down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scalp itching was driving me crazy, this medication started relieving the itching right</li>
            <li> And if you just scratched your scalp like crazy please wait awhile for your scalp to calm down because this stuff will burn if you apply it to that raw skin.</li>
            <li> I was desperately looking for a solution to the intense itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered a few and Sept 2015 expiry is too soon.</li>
            <li> It works for a few minutes after I apply the product to my scalp.</li>
            <li> One bottle usually lasts me a while.</li>
            <li> But I had been suffering with this crazy itch for months in the middle of my head.</li>
            <li> The burn was slow in coming too, like about a 15 minute delay.</li>
            <li> helps if you have raw patches -the salacylic acid will burn like crazy on raw wounds.</li>
            <li> Tired of the flakey scalp.  </li>
            <li> try it you will not be disappointed!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect for an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. Good product.</li>
            <li> The container leaked out so I could not use it</li>
            <li> I have suffered from psoriasis for over a year and have tried many products, both prescription and OTC, most of which have had little or no effect . Scalpicin works!  And that&#x27;s the best review I can give other than adding that it arrived on time and well packaged.</li>
            <li> this medication is soothing and cooling when applied and the fragrance is clean and pleasant, but, most important it&#x27;s working for me!&lt;br /&gt;Scalp itching was driving me crazy, this medication started relieving the itching right away.&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness I found it.</li>
            <li> This scalpacin has salability acid, it helps, but the other scalpacin product works much better</li>
            <li> Works as good or not better than drugstore brand ------------- with about HALF the cost!!!</li>
            <li> Great Product. I will reorder.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Apply and within several minutes the itch is gone or greatly reduced.  If you&#x27;re like me, when you walk outside bugs attack leaving others around me alone.  Even dry winter itch can be maddening but this product helps reduce if not eliminate that problem.  A little goes a long way and it does as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that works for my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for years. Very effective for itchy scalp and easy to apply. My only complaint is the expiry date. I ordered a few and Sept 2015 expiry is too soon. One bottle usually lasts me a while. Though I have used previous bottles for about a year after expiry and product has still worked so it is probably ok.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> This works great for controlling sebbhorheic dermatitis, but you have to keep using it. My doctor says the condition is permanent and will never go away, but can be managed. She gave me two different kinds of prescription shampoo (Ketoconazole and Selenium sulfide) but neither works very well on its own; only the salacylic acid, used twice a day, keeps the problem under control. The blue Scalpicin -which contains hydrocortisone- helps if you have raw patches -the salacylic acid will burn like crazy on raw wounds. But once the wounds are healed, the salacylic acid works way better than the hydrocortisone.</li>
            <li> packaged well, arrived on time, works so well its amazing.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me but still usable as like a disinfectant.</li>
            <li> This certainly lives up to the description.  I used it and immediately my itchy scalp was eased.  I will recommend with no hesitation.</li>
            <li> The only thing that works for me for a chronic scalp itch problem. I have tried many things and if I shampoo daily with a shampoo that has the same main ingredient that is in the 2in1 and apply the 2in1 three times daily, the problems stays under control.</li>
            <li> It works for a few minutes after I apply the product to my scalp. But then the itching comes back shortly thereafter. It&#x27;s ok because it works for a few minutes. Better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Help me a lot.  Recommend.  Be careful when applying - use latex gloves to protect hands.</li>
            <li> The reason I am ordering on line for this product is because the expiration date should be longer, but to my surprise the expiration date is Sep. 2015.  It is already end of April, almost May.  I bought two packs.  I used to order this before but with longer expiration date.  But time the shorter expiration date let me down.</li>
            <li> seems to work in some way...the alcohol probably doesnt help in the drying part, but the product seems to work to some degree.</li>
            <li> I suffer from itchy scalp and have used several prescription medications.  I have found that this product is as good as any I have used and comes without a prescription.</li>
            <li> It feels so good to my scalp. The itching stops! And I can sleep at night. This is worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I seen this on TV but could not find it locally. It does the job .</li>
            <li> these ointments really help ease the itching and flaky scalps. try it you will not be disappointed!!! best purchase ever</li>
            <li> my head is still itchy.  It must be me because others are very happy with the product.  It is very easy to use, is not greasy, and does not smell.  It must be me.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked for a about a day but I had a severe case of dermatitis.  The only thing that worked was a prescription steroid foam.  That cleared it up in a day or two.  For less severe cases, this will work fine.</li>
            <li> the product does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> This product really helps reduce itching and flaking. Scalpicin is also sold with Hydrocortisone as the active ingredient but for me the&lt;br /&gt;Salicylic acid product is more effective.</li>
            <li> IT SEEMS TO HELP RELEIVE ITCHY SCALP.</li>
            <li> Work for me. Helps to soften dry areas on my scalp.</li>
            <li> The Scalpicin in the yellow box costs more than the hydrocortisone-based Scalpicin in the blue box, but this one is a more effective treatment using salicylic acid that actually treats the condition by treating and eliminating the bacteria that cause it (unlike hydrocortisone which just temporarily numbs the itchiness).</li>
            <li> I  really do like this product for a  itchy scalp,it works great.I would buy this product again.Thanks  you so much.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for scalp fungus or psoriasis. Just make sure you do as it says. And if you just scratched your scalp like crazy please wait awhile for your scalp to calm down because this stuff will burn if you apply it to that raw skin. LOL</li>
            <li> I take pretty good with taking care of  my hair and treating my scalp. But I had been suffering with this crazy itch for months in the middle of my head. The itch covers about a 5&amp;#34; radius. The first time I put this stuff on my scalp, I felt like my brain was being cooked. The burn was slow in coming too, like about a 15 minute delay. I put it on and waited for the burning sensation that everyone was talking about, and it it did not come...until 15 minutes later, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not take it at first, but I talked myself into calming down and just waiting for the burn to subside.  The drive to scratch was pretty strong, so I sat in front of a fan and let it blow on my scalp. I was desperately looking for a solution to the intense itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does what it says it is supposed to do, which is why I gave it four stars. One start knocked off for the price. The burning does go away and so does the itch...for a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emptied out a bottle in 3 days. In the long run, this product is not cost effective for me.  I have since turned to using organic neem oil diluted in carrier oils and doing a hot oil treatment with it once a week. That has kept the itch at bay and I no longer had to endure the burn of Scalpicin.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Does exactly what it states. I use it in-between washes. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have had an itchy scalp most of my life due to having outrageously wild, dry curly hair. Sometimes I can&#x27;t sleep because it is so itchy. Now, I just put this on and it instantly relieves the itch. Be careful using it after scratching your scalp, though, it does burn a bit. I will definitely buy more when my bottles run out.</li>
            <li> Sometimes when my scalp starts to act up, this Scalpicin does relieve the itching until I get it back under control with the proper shampoos.</li>
            <li> Glad I found this when I did.  It works.  Builds confidence.  Tired of the flakey scalp.  Thank you Scalpicin.</li>
            <li> Repeat buyer and reviewer.  Well satisfied, at least with my mild psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I have found that this works well if used before shampooing. Then use the Scalpicin Max strength after you wash your hair. If you have allergies then the hydrocortisone one (Max strength) really stops the problem from even happening or recurring. While this 2-in-1 helps clear stuff up. Both good products - they work and they don&#x27;t affect your hair styling in any way.</li>
            <li> On time delivery and product as described thank you</li>
    </ol>
