            <li>This is a great aromatic oil.</li>
            <li>This is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to use when struggling to sleep, in your hair, as perfume, dropped into a water bottle and sprayed for a pick-me-up.</li>
            <li>it works great for me</li>
            <li>Very happy customer right here :D</li>

            <li>I get compliments on how good my hair smells and even better, the dropper works as it should; you don&#x27;t have to fight with it at all!</li>
            <li>Very happy with the purchase and will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>Much more cost effective here than at the stores</li>
            <li>Just mix a few drops with a spray bottle of water and welcome to beautiful hair!</li>
            <li>Very cheap compared to store prices.</li>
            <li>The bottle is well designed so you can pour just a drop at a time, letting you use the oil more efficiently and preventing unwanted spills.  </li>
            <li>Lavender essential oil is a wonderful choice for relaxation.  </li>
            <li>Firstly I love the smell of lavender.</li>
            <li>Maybe lavender cost more to produce?</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Great site to buy quality essential oils at good prices.</li>
            <li>Really helps to keep hair hydrated as well as smell great.</li>
            <li>need to over pay for pre-shave oil when you can easily and cheaply make your own that stands up</li>
            <li>I found this oil to be too strong to use in an oil warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because I like the aroma, but I can&#x27;t really speak of the effectiveness or quality because this is my very first time using this product, and because I just started using it, I can&#x27;t give a honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I plan to order more in the spring thanks!</li>
            <li>I ordered this and the sweet orange.</li>
            <li>This is a good choice for lavender essential oil.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, this oil was shipped very fast</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The price is right for 100% pure lavendar oil.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite essential oils, I use lavender for home made creams and for my homemade cleaning products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually going to buy some more.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I decided to purchase from Garden of green.</li>
            <li>pure lavender oil</li>
            <li>in your own little bottle with a cork</li>
            <li>The Garden of Green Lavender oil smelled good, just not as strong as other brands that I have used.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would get the whole essential oil thing, but I really enjoy my lavender oil.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this not really knowoing what I might get - it was fabulous!  </li>
            <li>Due to the potency I will be able to make lots of use of it.</li>
            <li>but it seems like I get more bang for my buck from other oils.</li>
            <li>I wish I had a little more added to this bottle, but I like it.</li>
            <li>I find that putting a FEW drops of the oil on my bed sheet every 3 nights helps me sleep a lot faster and much better.</li>
            <li>Price was right and I am just currently using it for my baths.  </li>
            <li>It included a very useful short guide on essential oils.</li>
            <li>Lavender Essential Oil 100% pure  and natural</li>
            <li>This item completely met my expectations.</li>
            <li>have natural 4c texture; love the scent and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I had purchased various natural oils over the years and did not expect this to be a watery liquid instead of an oil.</li>
            <li>to my lack of experience with other pure lavender oils I cannot say whether it is specifically this brand.</li>
            <li>its low grade, little scent, wont last long, used to higher grade oils, do terra or young living</li>
    </ol>

            <li> its low grade, little scent, wont last long, used to higher grade oils, do terra or young living</li>
            <li> It is a small bottle, but essential oils are very concentrated anyway.  </li>
            <li> It seems to have the same benefits, but does not go as far and the bottle is much smaller than any I have purcased in the past.</li>
            <li> and I recieved it several days before I expected it.</li>
            <li> the extremely over-priced pre-shave oil sold by &#x27;Art of Shaving&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Two and a half tblspns of Castor Oil ( I use Jamaica Black)&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> They both got my house in less than 5 days, bubbled wrapped and all in an envelope.</li>
            <li> ; CAN FIND OUT HOW ON &amp;#34;JUST A LITTLE NUTTY.COM&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I keep this little bottle by my bed for aromatherapy, in case</li>
            <li> not sure</li>
            <li> Carefully packed and covering all my expectations, this company seems very serious about the products they are selling.</li>
            <li> I capitalized the word &amp;#34;few&amp;#34; because the first time I used the oil i put about 3drops on my pillow and got a terrible headache.</li>
            <li> seriously its the worst experience i have ever had</li>

    <ol>
            <li> its low grade, little scent, wont last long, used to higher grade oils, do terra or young living but i guess you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I ordered this and the sweet orange. They both got my house in less than 5 days, bubbled wrapped and all in an envelope. I&#x27;ve been using the Lavender as aromatherapy for my dog. She falls asleep instantly. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I wish I had a little more added to this bottle, but I like it.</li>
            <li> used on edges to grow/thicken hair&lt;br /&gt;I have natural 4c texture; love the scent and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I find that putting a FEW drops of the oil on my bed sheet every 3 nights helps me sleep a lot faster and much better. I capitalized the word &amp;#34;few&amp;#34; because the first time I used the oil i put about 3drops on my pillow and got a terrible headache. I&#x27;ve learned to only put one drop on each corner of the bed and it works wonders!</li>
            <li> I used this product in water and spritz my hair and also on my clothing. Excellent smell. will buy again.</li>
            <li> REALLY IS A GOOD PRODUCT...I PUT IT IN SOME &amp;#34;HOMEMADE LAUNDRY SOAP I MADE&amp;#34; CAN FIND OUT HOW ON &amp;#34;JUST A LITTLE NUTTY.COM&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would get the whole essential oil thing, but I really enjoy my lavender oil.  It helps me sleep.</li>
            <li> This is a great aromatic oil. Due to the potency I will be able to make lots of use of it.</li>

The bottle is well designed so you can pour just a drop at a time, letting you use the oil more efficiently and preventing unwanted spills.  I use this product to \\&quot;refresh\\&quot; a lavender-scented eye mask.</li>

            <li> Product is perfect! I am very glad I decided to purchase from Garden of green. Very happy customer right here :D</li>
            <li> I ordered this not really knowoing what I might get - it was fabulous!  I used it to make a body butter and it is just what I needed to scent my product.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I like the aroma, but I can&#x27;t really speak of the effectiveness or quality because this is my very first time using this product, and because I just started using it, I can&#x27;t give a honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This item completely met my expectations. The price is right for 100% pure lavendar oil. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I use lavender oil almost daily. I keep this little bottle by my bed for aromatherapy, in case I can&#x27;t sleep. Also reccomend putting a couple drops on a cotton ball to keep under a pillow if you can&#x27;t sleep, works wonders. Anyway, this oil was shipped very fast and I recieved it several days before I expected it. Very happy with the purchase and will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite essential oils, I use lavender for home made creams and for my homemade cleaning products. Great product!</li>
            <li> I found this oil to be too strong to use in an oil warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to my lack of experience with other pure lavender oils I cannot say whether it is specifically this brand. However, I&#x27;d recommend mixing this oil with another scent if burning.</li>
            <li> Lavender essential oil is a wonderful choice for relaxation.  The Garden of Green Lavender oil smelled good, just not as strong as other brands that I have used.</li>
            <li> This is great. Firstly I love the smell of lavender. It&#x27;s great to use when struggling to sleep, in your hair, as perfume, dropped into a water bottle and sprayed for a pick-me-up. I have been using this oil as a mix for my hair as lavender is also a cleanser and it&#x27;s so wonderful. I get compliments on how good my hair smells and even better, the dropper works as it should; you don&#x27;t have to fight with it at all! I&#x27;m actually going to buy some more.</li>

            <li> Great site to buy quality essential oils at good prices.</li>
            <li> One or two drops of Lavender Essential Oil is used in the making of Pre-shave oil.&lt;br /&gt;No need to over pay for pre-shave oil when you can easily and cheaply make your own that stands up&lt;br /&gt;against the extremely over-priced pre-shave oil sold by &#x27;Art of Shaving&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Two and a half tblspns of Castor Oil ( I use Jamaica Black)&lt;br /&gt;One tablespoon of Olive Oil&lt;br /&gt;One or two drops Laveneder Essential Oil&lt;br /&gt;Put in your own little bottle with a cork and you have a terrific pre-shave oil that prepares your skin&lt;br /&gt;for the shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;Try it once and you will never shave without it again.</li>
            <li> Price was right and I am just currently using it for my baths.  Much more cost effective here than at the stores</li>
            <li> I had purchased various natural oils over the years and did not expect this to be a watery liquid instead of an oil. It seems to have the same benefits, but does not go as far and the bottle is much smaller than any I have purcased in the past.</li>
