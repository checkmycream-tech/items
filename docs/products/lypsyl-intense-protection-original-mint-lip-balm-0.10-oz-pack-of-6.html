            <li>Great, thanks.</li>
            <li>LypSyl is one of many lip moisturizers I&#x27;ve used over the years</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is better than in the stores.</li>
            <li>I love this brand of lip balm, for the shape, size and formula.  </li>
            <li>They soften my lips and work magic.</li>
            <li>Love LypSyl</li>
            <li>No sunscreen taste, I apply it at the most 3 times a day.  </li>
            <li>I was faithful to a competitor&#x27;s product for MANY years</li>
            <li>I tried many brands and was about to give up when I stumbled across LypSyl in a Walmart 3 hours from home.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to the SPF in most lip products.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is his favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li>This one moisturizes very well and the tubes are good size,</li>
            <li>I am allergic to lanolin and it isn&#x27;t easy to find lip balm without it.</li>
            <li>Love how it feels on my lips; love how it smells; love how the container is NOT round but oval -- won&#x27;t roll of the table!</li>
            <li>one of the best lip moisturizers that I have used, pleasant mild flavor, long lasting results, like that it has beeswax and shea butter in it</li>
            <li>Readily available in stores</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find it in my home town and happily have ordered them several times from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It was CHEAP</li>
            <li>The item description for this product says it is 6 of the original formula stucks.</li>
            <li>It stays on, tastes good (a slight minty bite), and leaves my lips ready for good morning kisses.</li>
            <li>rose which will work I guess however I don&#x27;t like them near a much as the original formula.</li>
            <li>This is the best lip balm I have ever used, it works instantly and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>He is quite sure that the new packaging also means a new recipe and that it is not as good as the ones in the old package.</li>
            <li>It is like a tingly party on my lips - kind of similar to burt&#x27;s bees.</li>
            <li>I have lived in several climates since I started using this product and it has an especially useful quality</li>
            <li>I use it daily, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to contribute to the problem like many cheap lip balms do.</li>
            <li>I used to be a big Carmex fan, since I like the kind that is a little heavier and seems to protect my lips, but it seemed like I had to use it more and more often.  </li>
            <li>I had to get this shipped to a friend in the US because Canada apparently doesn&#x27;t carry it any more.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert &amp; I&#x27;ve tried many products on my dry lips &amp; this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I tried it on for the first time just now.</li>
            <li>We still love it years later.  </li>
            <li>Best chapstick you&#x27;ll ever find, Durant leave the weird coating or end up in the corners of your mouth.</li>
            <li>I bought this for the first time when we were visiting Tucson.</li>
            <li>it is a roll up tube (similar to many deodorants and chapsticks).</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing</li>
            <li>really works\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It is long lasting and smells nice but not cloying.  </li>
            <li>Deserves high rating.</li>
            <li>This is a high rated product with patients in AZ.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, but I really liked the way it made my lips smooth and soft with a slight tingle; and it didn&#x27;t have to be reapplied every 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>The pack was in a new look and I order this product for my spouse.  </li>
            <li>When I first used it, I got instant relief.</li>
            <li>You really have to try it to believe how different, how much better it is that the usual lip balms.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to apply it nearly as often, and the stick lasts over a month</li>
            <li>Keeps your lips Soft and Kissable, Need I say anymore??</li>
            <li>I frequent here in Nashville but couldn&#x27;t find it.  </li>
            <li>It is larger than most, in an oval shape, and goes on smooth and quickly, not too slick and not sticky or waxy</li>
            <li>It glides smoothly on my lips,  doesn&#x27;t feel thick when on, has very little taste (a little minty), and leaves my lips feeling healthy and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I bought a tube of this with a $1 off coupon at a local drug store, it&#x27;s normally $3.99.  </li>
            <li>It is very good but very expensive and doesn&#x27;t last long</li>

            <li> and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product as long as they keep making it and selling it.</li>
            <li> I have tried all other brands - and lypsyl was the only brand worked with my lips-</li>
            <li> We started buying it for my husband when he was on Accutane because his lips would get SO dry</li>
            <li> I can use LypSyl 1 or 2 times a day and not have dry lips anymore.  </li>
            <li> It is so dry there</li>
            <li> Guess I should have bought a single tube before going for the 6 pack.</li>
            <li> I have very dry lips</li>
            <li> One day a few years ago, I got so fed up with chapsticks not working, I went and bought a dozen different chapsticks at once.</li>
            <li> Then I tried some others a few months ago when I needed some extra healing, and LypSyl was among them.</li>
            <li> As expected!</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use any other.</li>
            <li> I used LypSyl before and have dropped all other lip moisturizers.</li>
            <li> so I grabbed one to try and was THRILLED with my purchase!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not gummy, doesn&#x27;t smell or taste bad and it LASTS on my lips and in the tube!  </li>
            <li> Get it at Walmart.com for nearly half the price.</li>
            <li> I say this because I purchased a bottle that I had to use my finger to apply and did not like the mess it caused.</li>
            <li> I used to carry around chapstick and applied on every few hours, yet still would have chapped lips.</li>
            <li> In the desert it doesn&#x27;t melt in your pocket or purse and in the cold it doesn&#x27;t freeze or break down.</li>
            <li> I hate it when my lips are dry.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with bee wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw 2 reviews saying that the wrong flavor was sent.</li>
            <li> I recieved my package and was disgusted to find I was sent 6 sticks of the honey</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I live in the desert &amp; I&#x27;ve tried many products on my dry lips &amp; this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Best chapstick ever!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had chapped lips. I used to carry around chapstick and applied on every few hours, yet still would have chapped lips. One day a few years ago, I got so fed up with chapsticks not working, I went and bought a dozen different chapsticks at once. None of them was working until I got to LypSyl. When I first used it, I got instant relief. It works so well, I only use it once or twice a day or sometimes skips days. I&#x27;ve used nothing but Lypsyl, so this case of 6 will last me almost another year.</li>
            <li> I tried it on for the first time just now. It is like a tingly party on my lips - kind of similar to burt&#x27;s bees. We will see how this lasts throughout the night!</li>
            <li> Great product delivered by seller with no problems.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm.  I am allergic to lanolin and it isn&#x27;t easy to find lip balm without it. I love the taste as well.</li>
            <li> I love this chapstick!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried SO many chapsticks that don&#x27;t really work but this one is awesome. We started buying it for my husband when he was on Accutane because his lips would get SO dry and this was all that helped.  We still love it years later.  Very moisturizing and it lasts a long time. I also love the packaging for this chapstick.  We also love EOS balm.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip moisturizer - recommended by my dermatologist.  Works really great for use at night to prevent up with chapped lips.  Jean</li>
            <li> LipSyl is great for use at night. It stays on, tastes good (a slight minty bite), and leaves my lips ready for good morning kisses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;chap stick&amp;#34; addict. I hate it when my lips are dry. Over the years I settled on Blistex Mint as my favorite. Then I tried some others a few months ago when I needed some extra healing, and LypSyl was among them. Wow. It is great. It lasts a lot longer than anything else. I don&#x27;t have to apply it nearly as often, and the stick lasts over a month (I have it in my pocket at all times!).  It also feels better than anything else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> The best product EVER!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s the only brand that keeps my lips hydrated. I can&#x27;t find it in stores so it&#x27;s great to be able to buy it here. I&#x27;ve been using this brand for two years. It&#x27;s better than Chapstick or anything else I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> Keeps your lips Soft and Kissable, Need I say anymore??</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used, it works instantly and lasts a long time. I have lived in several climates since I started using this product and it has an especially useful quality, it&#x27;s stable. In the desert it doesn&#x27;t melt in your pocket or purse and in the cold it doesn&#x27;t freeze or break down. You really have to try it to believe how different, how much better it is that the usual lip balms. Readily available in stores but the best value is here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product - what&#x27;s not to like.</li>
            <li> It is very good but very expensive and doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I can never use enough of it !  It was suggested to me and chapped lips are gone forever !</li>
            <li> Not what I had hoped.  Guess I should have bought a single tube before going for the 6 pack.</li>
            <li> Great, thanks. As expected!</li>
            <li> one of the best lip moisturizers that I have used, pleasant mild flavor, long lasting results, like that it has beeswax and shea butter in it</li>
            <li> LypSyl is one of many lip moisturizers I&#x27;ve used over the years but I think it&#x27;s the best.  I bought a tube of it last year but I couldn&#x27;t remember where...we did a lot of traveling in 2013.  I looked for it in every grocery and drug-store I frequent here in Nashville but couldn&#x27;t find it.  So I went to Amazon!  Hooray.</li>
            <li> I have tried all other brands - and lypsyl was the only brand worked with my lips- I have very dry lips</li>
            <li> I had to get this shipped to a friend in the US because Canada apparently doesn&#x27;t carry it any more. This is the best lip moisturiser around.</li>
            <li> This is the very best lip moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve found.  I used to be a big Carmex fan, since I like the kind that is a little heavier and seems to protect my lips, but it seemed like I had to use it more and more often.  I can use LypSyl 1 or 2 times a day and not have dry lips anymore.  It provides an instant soothing effect and lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product that goes on smoothly, smells great, stays on, and protects your lips. Won&#x27;t use any other.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I won&#x27;t use anything else anymore and always have a tube with me or nearby. Amazon&#x27;s price is better than in the stores.</li>
            <li> The pack was in a new look and I order this product for my spouse.  He is quite sure that the new packaging also means a new recipe and that it is not as good as the ones in the old package.</li>
            <li> Best lip balm ever!  Love how it feels on my lips; love how it smells; love how the container is NOT round but oval -- won&#x27;t roll of the table! I will continue to buy this product as long as they keep making it and selling it.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of lip balm, for the shape, size and formula.  It is larger than most, in an oval shape, and goes on smooth and quickly, not too slick and not sticky or waxy feeling.  I keep it in the cars, purse, bathroom, bedside and in the media room, which is why I buy it by the case.  It is long lasting and smells nice but not cloying.  It has a sliding bar on the side to adjust the height, which I find easier than the ones you twist from the bottom.</li>
            <li> Good Product. Deserves high rating.</li>
            <li> Heals my chapped lips nicely.</li>
            <li> I use these every day and can&#x27;t manage without them.  They soften my lips and work magic.</li>
            <li> Love LypSyl this the best winter time lip balm.  No sunscreen taste, I apply it at the most 3 times a day.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> This is good for chapped lips and to help prevent chapped lips.  I use it daily, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to contribute to the problem like many cheap lip balms do.</li>
            <li> This is a high rated product with patients in AZ. Including the guys.  The product works well for those who spend lots of time outdoors.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I have found that also helps with the pain associated with the burning pain in my mouth and lip from having trigeminal neuropathy.</li>
            <li> Best chapstick you&#x27;ll ever find, Durant leave the weird coating or end up in the corners of your mouth.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that worked for me while deployed in Afghanistan, I will never change to another product.</li>
            <li> Great product but WAY overpriced on Amazon.com. Get it at Walmart.com for nearly half the price.</li>
            <li> I bought a tube of this with a $1 off coupon at a local drug store, it&#x27;s normally $3.99.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but I really liked the way it made my lips smooth and soft with a slight tingle; and it didn&#x27;t have to be reapplied every 15 minutes.  \\&quot;This stuff really works\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the first time when we were visiting Tucson. It is so dry there I figured they would sell good moisturizers.  I am picky about lip moisturizers...really liked this one. It glides smoothly on my lips,  doesn&#x27;t feel thick when on, has very little taste (a little minty), and leaves my lips feeling healthy and comfortable. Couldn&#x27;t find it in my home town and happily have ordered them several times from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I used LypSyl before and have dropped all other lip moisturizers. I saw that they had a great deal for this case and choose to buy it from Amazon. The outside of the tube looks completely different than before but the actual lip balm is the same. You can&#x27;t go wrong with bee wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it is a roll up tube (similar to many deodorants and chapsticks). I say this because I purchased a bottle that I had to use my finger to apply and did not like the mess it caused.</li>
            <li> I was faithful to a competitor&#x27;s product for MANY years then they discontinued it and my search began for lip balm that wasn&#x27;t loaded with scent and flavor that make me nauseous.  I tried many brands and was about to give up when I stumbled across LypSyl in a Walmart 3 hours from home.  It was CHEAP so I grabbed one to try and was THRILLED with my purchase!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not gummy, doesn&#x27;t smell or taste bad and it LASTS on my lips and in the tube!  The hint of mint is perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to the SPF in most lip products.  This one moisturizes very well and the tubes are good size,</li>
            <li> Love it. This is the best for your lips.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I saw 2 reviews saying that the wrong flavor was sent. Figured it was a fluke but maybe it wasn&#x27;t. I am sending the mint ones back.</li>
            <li> My husband asked me to get him several of these as he can&#x27;t find them at CVS anymore.  This is his favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li> No mention that it was mint.</li>
            <li> The item description for this product says it is 6 of the original formula stucks. I recieved my package and was disgusted to find I was sent 6 sticks of the honey rose which will work I guess however I don&#x27;t like them near a much as the original formula.</li>
            <li> I buy this in 6 packs so I can have in my purse, office and all over my house.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> My daughter always ask for this lip product! I always order this in a case of six because she uses it constantly!</li>
