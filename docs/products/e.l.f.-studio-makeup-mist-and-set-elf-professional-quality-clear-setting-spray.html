            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>so I ordered it and it works AMAZING!</li>
            <li>This is a good product to see if you like a spray.</li>
            <li>but i have worn it for 10 hours and this keeps the makeup looking good.</li>
            <li>Definitely as good as anything from saphora.</li>
            <li>looks almost as good at the end of the day as it did at the beginning.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s about all I have good to say about the product.</li>
            <li>it feels really good on and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll repurchase this for sure - soon!</li>
            <li>but it looks sooo AMAZING on my skin.</li>
            <li>Together they give an amazing looking.</li>
            <li>It goes on light, feels great and keeps my makeup in place.</li>
            <li>I used it to help keep my make up look smooth for Halloween and it was great.</li>
            <li>This setting spray is $3 at Target and it is amazing</li>
            <li>I must say, it will help your eye shadow stay better for a good 5 hours, but it doesn&#x27;t help with pencil liners at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved E.L.F., now even more so.</li>
            <li>I chose to try this because it had so many good reviews</li>
            <li>but it sets it so nice and makeup</li>
            <li>My skin looked flawless and luminous--as though I was professionally made up.</li>
            <li>IT could be better</li>
            <li>It makes my makeup look sooo much better and makes my face glow.</li>
            <li>I also use it instead of a fix plus witch is to put eye shadow on your eyes to make the shadow stay in place and to bring out the color of the shadow more.</li>
            <li>i just like to make it look more glowy again.</li>
            <li>I will be repurchasing this!! :)</li>
            <li>But over all it was okay.</li>
            <li>I love this most.</li>
            <li>this was just ok.</li>
            <li>, I get more on my hand than I do on my face.</li>
            <li>but with this...it&#x27;s definitely much better and stays on for longer hours.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>and then i sprayed more on after i completed all my make up.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This feels so refreshing when applying.  </li>
            <li>It sets &#x27;ok&#x27; but I&#x27;m not blown away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed by this product and will definitely be stocking up on it!!!</li>
            <li>Now I love using it whenever I use mineral foundation to set it and to avoid that powdery look.</li>
            <li>It has a bit of a scent that I would not describe as enjoyable, but it vanishes within seconds from spraying.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get any better than that. :)</li>
            <li>I keep running out of this stuff and keep buying more...</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s refreshing and stays in place .</li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;s just my skin, but for the most part it doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s suppose to.(for me)</li>
            <li>The product was okay.</li>
            <li>glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>This is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>I must say that this product has been a pretty good job of accomplishing my goal.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve tried a setting spray and I love it!</li>
            <li>what can I say about the price other than awesome!</li>
            <li>It makes you look younger and it has some really great natural ingredients that is great for your skin.</li>
            <li>i went on a date that night with my bf and spent the night and woke up the next morning STILL with a flawless face lol</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel silky smooth after it dries.</li>
            <li>But over all, worth more than the (I think)</li>
            <li>Nothing a light touch of a tissue couldn&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li>It makes your finished makeup look just that much better a couple of spritzes and your golden</li>
            <li>It goes on well, very easy and it really does work.  </li>
            <li>It locks your makeup in all day long and feels great on your face.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyoone that wants a good touch after their makeup.</li>
            <li>instead..havent been able to tell if it really does anything though..</li>
            <li>I will use it just for a spritz to keep cool or to seal my makeup.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about this.</li>
            <li>works good at setting makeup on my face to last.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>Never used any other make-up setter before to make a comparison, but I DID NOTICE a great improvement in how my make-up stays put throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Someone took a super closeup picture of me today.</li>
            <li>Sure some other makeup products like this do too, but for this refreshing price &amp; feeling!</li>
            <li>Sets my make-up like an absolute dream!!</li>
            <li>I have to say, this is my first time trying a setting spray, and now I can&#x27;t picture going out without using it!</li>
            <li>I always get super shiny and my makeup slides right off.</li>
            <li>It did arrive a little leaky which I wasn&#x27;t too happy about.</li>
            <li>but I will deal with it if it means I get to have a fresh face all day.</li>
            <li>I got this item because I was on UTube and the women were using this item to keep your makeup looking fresh all day</li>
            <li>It worked perfectly and it arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>Got here earlier then I expected and it works great!!!!!!</li>
            <li>and I feel so fresh.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works, I love it and will definitely buy this again, quick shipment</li>
            <li>Spraying something wet into my own freshly painted face took some getting used to but it really does do what it says.</li>
            <li>Mac has a pretty scent, but this has no scent</li>
            <li>I sometimes like to spray my face one more time later in my day</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not pricy and helps keep make up on for long lasting wear, great for all day.</li>
            <li>I tested this out on myself first before using it on a wedding party that I did makeup on.</li>
            <li>It looked exactly like it did</li>
            <li>when I first did my makeup that morning.</li>
            <li>This is the first makeup setting spray I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I only paid $3 for this.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really affordable too!</li>
            <li>Well....  first...  </li>
            <li>If you want your makeup to stay all day and night you must absolutely get this!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time I have used a setting spray</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>All you need is a few sprays and your good for the day.</li>
            <li>on time and for the price it&#x27;s not bad since it does the trick, i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;ve only tried this and Mac as far as finishing sprays.</li>
            <li>I personally think that this is just as good as Urban Decay&#x27;s setting spray.</li>
            <li>While it is a safe ingredient, long term use of alcohol on the skin results in drying and aging; who wants that?!?</li>
            <li>This will come in handy during the hot summer months, when my make up tends to melt off a little bit and my face starts looking oily.  </li>
            <li>Wish the bottle was big tho looks like a sample size but other then that love it!!</li>
            <li>Starting up my own business - I don&#x27;t really have the funds to spend a lot of money on high end professional products.</li>
            <li>Makes your face FEEL very sticky</li>
            <li>I really like this setting spray.  </li>
            <li>But this doesn&#x27;t keep your make up from wearing or smearing for the whole day.</li>
            <li>But I imagine if you don&#x27;t have oily skin, it&#x27;d probably work really well.</li>
            <li>I went through a one hour sweaty intense barre class &amp; my makeup</li>
            <li>I really like this brand.</li>
            <li>and I have really oily skin.  </li>
            <li>and then too much shoots out on just one spot of your face when that happens.</li>
            <li>It really sets your makeup.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see how it worked, but when I looked in the mirror a few hours later, it had caused my makeup to look kind of scaly and discolored.</li>
            <li>As long as you apply it correctly, it works fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to keep your makeup on during a new York summer!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but I really like what I have seen so far from this product.</li>
            <li>I use it after putting on foundation and then spray a little more after I put blush on.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally review products on amazon</li>
            <li>I normally sweat a lot, and by the end of the day my makeup looks like its not even on anymore.</li>
            <li>THAT IS AMAZING for someone whose nose used to turn the entire tissue brown ( I am black, so my make up is brown).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who is new to setting sprays and makeup.</li>
            <li>I live in the tropics</li>
            <li>How did I ever live without it?</li>
            <li>I live in a hot area and thought it may be the weather, but even when I am indoors the entire day, this does not set my make up.</li>
            <li>It truly is a miracle for my oily skin, especially because I&#x27;ve already tried just about everything else to contain the oiliness and nothing has really helped!</li>
            <li>I have started using this product only in the last two weeks, but I&#x27;ve realized that my face looks just as fresh at 6pm as it did at 7am when I applied my make up!  </li>
            <li>Because when you get a eye shadow wet it brings the colors out more and this product helps that &amp; helps lock in the eye shadow color in it&#x27;s place, and stay all day long.</li>
            <li>In fact, that&#x27;s about the only positive thing I can say about this</li>
            <li>Better off using hairspray than pay that kind of money for something as worthless as that.</li>
            <li>Not everyday but often.</li>
            <li>and it left me very oily.</li>
            <li>This stuff completely ruined my makeup.</li>
            <li>So I ended up having to completely redo my makeup.</li>
            <li>and I must say how surprised I was that this worked so well..</li>
            <li>Your makeup stays on for more than 8 hrs at least for me.</li>
            <li>I tried it for several days but it did not seem to make much difference in my makeup staying power.  </li>
            <li>I had to choose between this and the NYX spray, but after reading that the other spray looked wet, I&#x27;m glad I got this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact same as urban decays all nighter.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would work, as I have a combination of oily and dry skin, but it doesn&#x27;t do as much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I do not wear makeup everyday or all day, so I cant really say much on that.</li>
            <li>I am daily new to the makeup world and ordered this product because I was looking for something to help my daily make up looks last longer and to decrease the amount of transference I normally have when I wear makeup.</li>
            <li>Only the slightest hint of oil at the end of the day - barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>When I got it, it was leaking a little out of the top as expected from other reviews</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to looking in the mirror after a few hours and asking myself, &amp;#34;What happened to the makeup I just applied 3 hours ago?&amp;#34; but with this product, I find myself checking the mirror and seeing my makeup looking almost exactly the same as when I applied it.</li>

            <li> I will use it just for a spritz to keep cool or to seal my makeup.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about this.</li>
            <li> works good at setting makeup on my face to last.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Never used any other make-up setter before to make a comparison, but I DID NOTICE a great improvement in how my make-up stays put throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Someone took a super closeup picture of me today.</li>
            <li> Sure some other makeup products like this do too, but for this refreshing price &amp; feeling!</li>
            <li> Sets my make-up like an absolute dream!!</li>
            <li> I have to say, this is my first time trying a setting spray, and now I can&#x27;t picture going out without using it!</li>
            <li> I always get super shiny and my makeup slides right off.</li>
            <li> It did arrive a little leaky which I wasn&#x27;t too happy about.</li>
            <li> but I will deal with it if it means I get to have a fresh face all day.</li>
            <li> I got this item because I was on UTube and the women were using this item to keep your makeup looking fresh all day</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly and it arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Got here earlier then I expected and it works great!!!!!!</li>
            <li> and I feel so fresh.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, I love it and will definitely buy this again, quick shipment</li>
            <li> Spraying something wet into my own freshly painted face took some getting used to but it really does do what it says.</li>
            <li> Mac has a pretty scent, but this has no scent</li>
            <li> I sometimes like to spray my face one more time later in my day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pricy and helps keep make up on for long lasting wear, great for all day.</li>
            <li> I tested this out on myself first before using it on a wedding party that I did makeup on.</li>
            <li> It looked exactly like it did</li>
            <li> when I first did my makeup that morning.</li>
            <li> This is the first makeup setting spray I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I only paid $3 for this.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really affordable too!</li>
            <li> Well....  first...  </li>
            <li> If you want your makeup to stay all day and night you must absolutely get this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time I have used a setting spray</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> All you need is a few sprays and your good for the day.</li>
            <li> on time and for the price it&#x27;s not bad since it does the trick, i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;ve only tried this and Mac as far as finishing sprays.</li>
            <li> I personally think that this is just as good as Urban Decay&#x27;s setting spray.</li>
            <li> While it is a safe ingredient, long term use of alcohol on the skin results in drying and aging; who wants that?!?</li>
            <li> This will come in handy during the hot summer months, when my make up tends to melt off a little bit and my face starts looking oily.  </li>
            <li> Wish the bottle was big tho looks like a sample size but other then that love it!!</li>
            <li> Starting up my own business - I don&#x27;t really have the funds to spend a lot of money on high end professional products.</li>
            <li> Makes your face FEEL very sticky</li>
            <li> I really like this setting spray.  </li>
            <li> But this doesn&#x27;t keep your make up from wearing or smearing for the whole day.</li>
            <li> But I imagine if you don&#x27;t have oily skin, it&#x27;d probably work really well.</li>
            <li> I went through a one hour sweaty intense barre class &amp; my makeup</li>
            <li> I really like this brand.</li>
            <li> and I have really oily skin.  </li>
            <li> and then too much shoots out on just one spot of your face when that happens.</li>
            <li> It really sets your makeup.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see how it worked, but when I looked in the mirror a few hours later, it had caused my makeup to look kind of scaly and discolored.</li>
            <li> As long as you apply it correctly, it works fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to keep your makeup on during a new York summer!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but I really like what I have seen so far from this product.</li>
            <li> I use it after putting on foundation and then spray a little more after I put blush on.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally review products on amazon</li>
            <li> I normally sweat a lot, and by the end of the day my makeup looks like its not even on anymore.</li>
            <li> THAT IS AMAZING for someone whose nose used to turn the entire tissue brown ( I am black, so my make up is brown).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who is new to setting sprays and makeup.</li>
            <li> I live in the tropics</li>
            <li> How did I ever live without it?</li>
            <li> I live in a hot area and thought it may be the weather, but even when I am indoors the entire day, this does not set my make up.</li>
            <li> It truly is a miracle for my oily skin, especially because I&#x27;ve already tried just about everything else to contain the oiliness and nothing has really helped!</li>
            <li> I have started using this product only in the last two weeks, but I&#x27;ve realized that my face looks just as fresh at 6pm as it did at 7am when I applied my make up!  </li>
            <li> Because when you get a eye shadow wet it brings the colors out more and this product helps that &amp; helps lock in the eye shadow color in it&#x27;s place, and stay all day long.</li>
            <li> In fact, that&#x27;s about the only positive thing I can say about this</li>
            <li> Better off using hairspray than pay that kind of money for something as worthless as that.</li>
            <li> Not everyday but often.</li>
            <li> and it left me very oily.</li>
            <li> This stuff completely ruined my makeup.</li>
            <li> So I ended up having to completely redo my makeup.</li>
            <li> and I must say how surprised I was that this worked so well..</li>
            <li> Your makeup stays on for more than 8 hrs at least for me.</li>
            <li> I tried it for several days but it did not seem to make much difference in my makeup staying power.  </li>
            <li> I had to choose between this and the NYX spray, but after reading that the other spray looked wet, I&#x27;m glad I got this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the exact same as urban decays all nighter.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would work, as I have a combination of oily and dry skin, but it doesn&#x27;t do as much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I do not wear makeup everyday or all day, so I cant really say much on that.</li>
            <li> I am daily new to the makeup world and ordered this product because I was looking for something to help my daily make up looks last longer and to decrease the amount of transference I normally have when I wear makeup.</li>
            <li> Only the slightest hint of oil at the end of the day - barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> When I got it, it was leaking a little out of the top as expected from other reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to looking in the mirror after a few hours and asking myself, &amp;#34;What happened to the makeup I just applied 3 hours ago?&amp;#34; but with this product, I find myself checking the mirror and seeing my makeup looking almost exactly the same as when I applied it.</li>
            <li> This beats Urban Decay&#x27;s makeup setting sprays by a long shot, if not only for the simple fact that it does NOT contain alcohol.</li>
            <li> so if you want to try something new and hip to the makeup game you should really try this product you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li> The only thing is I wish they would make a second one that is moisturizing because I have dry skin</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed but may work great for other types of make up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does seem to make my makeup last a bit long through out the day</li>
            <li> Also the smell is not great but goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using make-up primer for a long time, but even with that, the foundation (liquid foundation) would still transfer or fade some.....</li>
            <li> I did 2 sprays and let it dry.</li>
            <li> A huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I wear liquid makeup everyday and by the middle of the day my nose is so shiny and my makeup tranfers everywhere onto papers and clothes with the slightest rub.</li>
            <li> I am not very fond of the smell of the product</li>
            <li> My make up used to slide off my face after only a few hours after application.  </li>
            <li> Kept my makeup in place all night without giving me that oily, sweaty, wet look.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, this stuff went right into the garbage.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and used to have to reapply makeup every couple hours, with this</li>
            <li> Even though it is a small bottle it will last you a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;First after i put on my tinted moisturizer  i sprayed a little on and let it dry</li>
            <li> I actually can go a little over half the day without worrying about my makeup coming off!</li>
            <li> It caused both my mascara and foundation to run down my face.</li>
            <li> It does smell slightly gnarly, though.</li>
            <li> This product makes my makeup run a little more, it makes it worst, but it may not be the same for everybody</li>
            <li> I use this, and it helps a little.</li>
            <li> I did notice it keeps my makeup in place a little longer</li>
            <li> There are a few things I still buy from MAC, but a lot of the little stuff I buy from elf.</li>
            <li> I wear this on my face EVERYDAY..</li>
            <li> I use it a few times throughout putting on all of my make up and once at the end.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to dab my nose 2 or 3 times a day and there is usually alot of make up on the tissue.</li>
            <li> No more creasing either.</li>
            <li> I was wearing my usual makeup in the usual way so, it must be the elf.</li>
            <li> When I sprayed it, it smell horrible like throw up, but that only last a second then the smell goes away.</li>
            <li> Never mind that the e.l.f. product costs a mere fraction of what similar products in the marketplace do!</li>
            <li> and when I did hardly any make up was on the tissue.</li>
            <li> It was hard to get the bottle to spray.</li>
            <li> I give it at least 2 stars just because I use this as a makeup primer</li>
            <li> I have been going to a ton of events lately</li>
            <li> I mean stop your makeup from melting off your face</li>
            <li> The nozzle doesn&#x27;t get clogged like other kinds I have used which drives me crazy because it won&#x27;t come out</li>
            <li> im tired of powdering my face all through the day cus</li>
            <li> so maybe it just reacts weird with powder or something..</li>
            <li> I was using one of those nasty white cream makeup and with this product it managed to not look clumpy at all.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed anything really wrong.  </li>
            <li> so of course, I was sweating like crazy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the outcome.</li>
            <li> but it smells awful.....</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Not everyday but often. Spraying something wet into my own freshly painted face took some getting used to but it really does do what it says.</li>
            <li> I wear liquid makeup everyday and by the middle of the day my nose is so shiny and my makeup tranfers everywhere onto papers and clothes with the slightest rub. I usually have to dab my nose 2 or 3 times a day and there is usually alot of make up on the tissue. I tried this setting spray this whole week and my shine has decreased so much I only had to give myself a dab on the nose once and when I did hardly any make up was on the tissue. THAT IS AMAZING for someone whose nose used to turn the entire tissue brown ( I am black, so my make up is brown). I have had almost no tranference onto papers or my clothes. I am not very fond of the smell of the product but I will deal with it if it means I get to have a fresh face all day.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;ve only tried this and Mac as far as finishing sprays. Mac has a pretty scent, but this has no scent and I feel like keeps my makeup on just as well. The Mac comes out in a finer mist, but just fan your face a couple times and this is set to go! I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who is new to setting sprays and makeup. This is a good product to see if you like a spray.</li>
            <li> Makes your face FEEL very sticky I don&#x27;t recommend this product IT could be better but if you like sticky skin go for it</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve tried a setting spray and I love it! My makeup doesn&#x27;t look cakey and it makes it last longer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is basically water. It ruined my makeup when I tried to apply it.. I use setting powder so maybe it just reacts weird with powder or something.. I give it at least 2 stars just because I use this as a makeup primer instead..havent been able to tell if it really does anything though..</li>
            <li> This product is the BEST!!! It locks your makeup in all day long and feels great on your face. It makes my makeup look sooo much better and makes my face glow. I dont know what it does to my face but it looks sooo AMAZING on my skin. I cant explain it but it kinda looks dewy &amp; glowy but not making it look oily or none of that. It makes you look younger and it has some really great natural ingredients that is great for your skin. I wear it sometimes when i dont even have makup on because it just gives my skin that beautiful glow. I also use it instead of a fix plus witch is to put eye shadow on your eyes to make the shadow stay in place and to bring out the color of the shadow more. Because when you get a eye shadow wet it brings the colors out more and this product helps that &amp; helps lock in the eye shadow color in it&#x27;s place, and stay all day long. All you need is a few sprays and your good for the day. I sometimes like to spray my face one more time later in my day but you dont need to i just like to make it look more glowy again. I will be repurchasing this!! :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pricy and helps keep make up on for long lasting wear, great for all day. I spray it on once an go all day!</li>
            <li> This is pretty good. I use it after putting on foundation and then spray a little more after I put blush on.  DO NOT spray after you put eye makeup on or you will look like Ke$ha.  I would recommend it.  It&#x27;s not going to keep your makeup on during a new York summer!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally review products on amazon but I felt the need to review this. Let me just say, it works amazing! I have extremely oily skin and used to have to reapply makeup every couple hours, with this I actually can go a little over half the day without worrying about my makeup coming off! It truly is a miracle for my oily skin, especially because I&#x27;ve already tried just about everything else to contain the oiliness and nothing has really helped!</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me.  I&#x27;ve given this several attempts.  I live in a hot area and thought it may be the weather, but even when I am indoors the entire day, this does not set my make up.</li>
            <li> Its not what I though it would be like. But over all it was okay. Im going to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I love this most. It&#x27;s the exact same as urban decays all nighter. It lasted me all night. I have gone swimming and it&#x27;s kept my makeup on! I recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> Pretty good. It makes my skin feel silky smooth after it dries. It does smell slightly gnarly, though. But over all, worth more than the (I think) $3 I paid for it at Target.</li>
            <li> I got this item because I was on UTube and the women were using this item to keep your makeup looking fresh all day I mean stop your makeup from melting off your face so if you want to try something new and hip to the makeup game you should really try this product you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li> Oily skin is a blessing and a curse. I&#x27;ve had it all my life. It runs in my family. No oil control product has ever worked on my face. I always get super shiny and my makeup slides right off. This stuff works. Make up stays on all day. No more creasing either. Only the slightest hint of oil at the end of the day - barely noticeable. Nothing a light touch of a tissue couldn&#x27;t handle. It&#x27;s such a relief to not have to worry about this anymore. I also used the elf mineral primer. Together they give an amazing looking. Someone took a super closeup picture of me today. I was shocked at the outcome. My skin looked flawless and luminous--as though I was professionally made up. I was wearing my usual makeup in the usual way so, it must be the elf.</li>
            <li> I really like this setting spray.  It goes on well, very easy and it really does work.  It sets my makeup for all day wear.  It feels great on your skin.  The price is great.</li>
            <li> Starting up my own business - I don&#x27;t really have the funds to spend a lot of money on high end professional products. I tested this out on myself first before using it on a wedding party that I did makeup on. It was great! I did 2 sprays and let it dry. I normally sweat a lot, and by the end of the day my makeup looks like its not even on anymore. The day I tested out this setting spray it was like 87 degrees and I ended up being outside all day, so of course, I was sweating like crazy. But that didn&#x27;t matter for my makeup! It looked exactly like it did when I first did my makeup that morning. This spray works - I will definitely be using this product from now on. Amazing!</li>
            <li> This is a great mist it works so well . Even though it is a small bottle it will last you a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this</li>
            <li> I use this, and it helps a little. But this doesn&#x27;t keep your make up from wearing or smearing for the whole day. I must say, it will help your eye shadow stay better for a good 5 hours, but it doesn&#x27;t help with pencil liners at all. I was hoping this would work, as I have a combination of oily and dry skin, but it doesn&#x27;t do as much as I had hoped. But I imagine if you don&#x27;t have oily skin, it&#x27;d probably work really well.</li>
            <li> this was just ok. I did notice it keeps my makeup in place a little longer but I did have to apply multiple touch ups often and it left me very oily.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim at Target. This is the first makeup setting spray I&#x27;ve tried. All I can is that I I&#x27;m glad I only paid $3 for this. In fact, that&#x27;s about the only positive thing I can say about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this to my face after applying the rest of my makeup. It was hard to get the bottle to spray. When it did finally spray, it sprayed a ton. My face was soaked and felt sticky. When I looked in the mirror, I was horrified. This stuff completely ruined my makeup. It caused both my mascara and foundation to run down my face. So I ended up having to completely redo my makeup. Needless to say, this stuff went right into the garbage. Will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> e.l.f. needs to work on their packaging; when I spray the product, it leaks from the bottle, I get more on my hand than I do on my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, I love it and will definitely buy this again, quick shipment and I must say how surprised I was that this worked so well..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Urban Decay makeup setting spray &amp; in my opinion, this ELF spray works just as well. I went through a one hour sweaty intense barre class &amp; my makeup didn&#x27;t move one bit. I think they could improve the smell of it, but it&#x27;s tolerable. For $3 at Target, you can&#x27;t beat it. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really like this brand. The products are great quality items, but they are affordable. There are a few things I still buy from MAC, but a lot of the little stuff I buy from elf. I recommend.</li>
            <li> I am daily new to the makeup world and ordered this product because I was looking for something to help my daily make up looks last longer and to decrease the amount of transference I normally have when I wear makeup. I must say that this product has been a pretty good job of accomplishing my goal. I have never used a setting spray prior to now so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but I really like what I have seen so far from this product. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I loved this product!! It worked perfectly and it arrived earlier than expected. Sets my make-up like an absolute dream!!</li>
            <li> This is the truth! I have been going to a ton of events lately and I have needed my makeup to stay flawless all day! This does the trick. Sure some other makeup products like this do too, but for this refreshing price &amp; feeling! I, think not! I&#x27;ve always loved E.L.F., now even more so.</li>
            <li> this works well but it smells awful.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;came on time and for the price it&#x27;s not bad since it does the trick, i have very sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t bother it at all.</li>
            <li> Never used any other make-up setter before to make a comparison, but I DID NOTICE a great improvement in how my make-up stays put throughout the day. I&#x27;ve been using make-up primer for a long time, but even with that, the foundation (liquid foundation) would still transfer or fade some.....but with this...it&#x27;s definitely much better and stays on for longer hours. No need to reapply any until I go to bed at night.&lt;br /&gt;And what can I say about the price other than awesome! I&#x27;ll definitely buy another one before this bottle gets empty.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a must have and I&#x27;d totally recommend.</li>
            <li> I am happy I bought this. I recently got into doing makeup and did not know a lot about it. Finding out about setting spray was a great discovery. It goes on light, feels great and keeps my makeup in place.</li>
            <li> I live in the tropics and I have really oily skin.  My make up used to slide off my face after only a few hours after application.  I have started using this product only in the last two weeks, but I&#x27;ve realized that my face looks just as fresh at 6pm as it did at 7am when I applied my make up!  I love this product and it&#x27;s really affordable too!</li>
            <li> Well....  first...  the seller sent this product within 2days  after i ordered it.  Annnd she hand written a thank you note.  I like things like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now....i bought this cus im tired of powdering my face all through the day cus my make up starts to look oily,  like i was out jogging all day or something.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something to stretch my make up lasting power and this was it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First after i put on my tinted moisturizer  i sprayed a little on and let it dry and then i sprayed more on after i completed all my make up.  Let me tell you...  i went on a date that night with my bf and spent the night and woke up the next morning STILL with a flawless face lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#good stuff</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! I used it to help keep my make up look smooth for Halloween and it was great. I was using one of those nasty white cream makeup and with this product it managed to not look clumpy at all. Everything looked flawless.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. I will use it just for a spritz to keep cool or to seal my makeup. Haven&#x27;t noticed anything really wrong.  It did arrive a little leaky which I wasn&#x27;t too happy about.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about this. It makes your finished makeup look just that much better a couple of spritzes and your golden it feels really good on and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to seal in my makeup and keep my face from being so oily. I followed the instructions about applying it. I was so excited to see how it worked, but when I looked in the mirror a few hours later, it had caused my makeup to look kind of scaly and discolored. A huge disappointment. I don&#x27;t know if it just didn&#x27;t work with my covergirl brand foundation and powder or what.</li>
            <li> I bought mine from Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This feels so refreshing when applying.  This will come in handy during the hot summer months, when my make up tends to melt off a little bit and my face starts looking oily.  I&#x27;ll just reapply this spray to freshen up my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to make my makeup last a bit long through out the day so I would recomend this product.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to for make up sealer. The nozzle doesn&#x27;t get clogged like other kinds I have used which drives me crazy because it won&#x27;t come out and then too much shoots out on just one spot of your face when that happens.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t dewey and works for the majority of the day. I had to choose between this and the NYX spray, but after reading that the other spray looked wet, I&#x27;m glad I got this one. As long as you apply it correctly, it works fine.</li>
            <li> Meh. No earth shattering results. It sets &#x27;ok&#x27; but I&#x27;m not blown away. For the price, it&#x27;s not bad. This is one of those things I would say you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Every time I go to Target the e.l.f studio makeup mist is always sold out so I ordered it and it works AMAZING! I wear foundation/powder all day so I spray on this mist after and my makeup doesn&#x27;t even seem to have been on for hours, it looks like I JUST put on makeup. It really sets your makeup.So happy with this purchase!!!</li>
            <li> works good at setting makeup on my face to last. I do not wear makeup everyday or all day, so I cant really say much on that. but i have worn it for 10 hours and this keeps the makeup looking good.</li>
            <li> I chose to try this because it had so many good reviews so I thought it would work. When I got it, it was leaking a little out of the top as expected from other reviews so I changed the bottle. When I sprayed it, it smell horrible like throw up, but that only last a second then the smell goes away. But the one thing as to why I don&#x27;t like it is because it does NOT set my make up. my make up was still coming off. I don&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li> If you want your makeup to stay all day and night you must absolutely get this! Definitely as good as anything from saphora.</li>
            <li> I have to say, this is my first time trying a setting spray, and now I can&#x27;t picture going out without using it! What a GREAT product to invest in. $3 dollars at your local Target is a steal. This spray sets your makeup like a dream. I&#x27;m used to looking in the mirror after a few hours and asking myself, &amp;#34;What happened to the makeup I just applied 3 hours ago?&amp;#34; but with this product, I find myself checking the mirror and seeing my makeup looking almost exactly the same as when I applied it. I&#x27;m very impressed by this product and will definitely be stocking up on it!!!</li>
            <li> I had this for a while before I started using it and now I wonder why I ever waited. I&#x27;ve started using it when I was on vacation, traveling through the desert and it kept all my makeup in place through the scorching heat! Now I love using it whenever I use mineral foundation to set it and to avoid that powdery look. I just spray it 3 to 4 times from an arm length away after I&#x27;ve done all my makeup and it works wonders. How did I ever live without it? It has a bit of a scent that I would not describe as enjoyable, but it vanishes within seconds from spraying. I&#x27;ll repurchase this for sure - soon!</li>
            <li> Got here earlier then I expected and it works great!!!!!! Wish the bottle was big tho looks like a sample size but other then that love it!! Works great. Make up last longer then before (:</li>
            <li> Kept my makeup in place all night without giving me that oily, sweaty, wet look. Quality product for an affordable price. Can&#x27;t get any better than that. :)</li>
            <li> This is the best product to set your makeup... I wear this on my face EVERYDAY.. Your makeup stays on for more than 8 hrs at least for me. I have not used any setting spray like I use this one... I keep running out of this stuff and keep buying more... I believe this is my third bottle. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time I have used a setting spray and I really love it. I recommend it to everyone that is a makeup fan</li>
            <li> Very refreshing! I sprintz on after my makeup is on and it&#x27;s refreshing and stays in place . I can&#x27;t say anything bad.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyoone that wants a good touch after their makeup. I put this on after im done with my makeup and I feel so fresh. Its a product that i&#x27;ll buy again and again. It makes my makeup stay on and not get all oily.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go without this product.  I use it a few times throughout putting on all of my make up and once at the end.  It&#x27;s not glue and of course your make up could still come off but it sets it so nice and makeup looks almost as good at the end of the day as it did at the beginning.  I say &amp;#34;It&#x27;s like hairspray for your face&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very good product will use this from now on and I will purchase again. Will also recommend this to others</li>
            <li> This product makes my makeup run a little more, it makes it worst, but it may not be the same for everybody maybe it&#x27;s just my skin, but for the most part it doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s suppose to.(for me)</li>
            <li> The package was shipped properly and in a timely fashion. But that&#x27;s about all I have good to say about the product. I feel like I might as well be misting water on my face. I thought it was supposed to help set the makeup in as to make it last longer. It does not do that. Better off using hairspray than pay that kind of money for something as worthless as that.</li>
            <li> This setting spray is $3 at Target and it is amazing I personally think that this is just as good as Urban Decay&#x27;s setting spray. The only thing is I wish they would make a second one that is moisturizing because I have dry skin and I feel like this dries it out. Also the smell is not great but goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> The product was okay. It did set my makeup, but made my face too shiny and oily looking. Also there was a tad odor, I wouldnt buy this again, but glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t seem to get the results I was looking for.  I tried it for several days but it did not seem to make much difference in my makeup staying power.  I used mineral foundation.  A bit disappointed but may work great for other types of make up.</li>
            <li> This beats Urban Decay&#x27;s makeup setting sprays by a long shot, if not only for the simple fact that it does NOT contain alcohol. The same can&#x27;t be said about the Urban Decay (alcohol is the 2nd ingredient). While it is a safe ingredient, long term use of alcohol on the skin results in drying and aging; who wants that?!? Never mind that the e.l.f. product costs a mere fraction of what similar products in the marketplace do! This does what it says and also leaves the skin feeling refreshed and supple. I&#x27;m pleased with it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
