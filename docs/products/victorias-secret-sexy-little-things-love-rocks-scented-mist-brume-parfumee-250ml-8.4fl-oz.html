            <li>The order was shipped quickly, it was just what I wanted</li>
            <li>I had no idea it was still available out there, thanks OS !</li>
            <li>Victoria&#x27;s Secret has discontinued this fragrance and I&#x27;m so happy I can get it on amazon!!</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume by far, this smells so amazing and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Came in a timely manner, and the price was right.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t spray right.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased to see my favorite Victorias Secret fragrance spray,\\&quot;Love</li>
            <li>If I need other gift, I will think in you!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and Happy New Year.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this seller, I&#x27;ve had trade mark&#x27;s EDT and can tell you with no doubts that it is an original one.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I would only purchase this to wear year round if it was more readily available.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I wanted with in a week.</li>
            <li>and I wanted more than what I currently have.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d describe it as deep, spicy, and sexy.</li>
            <li>This is the first time my wife has used this</li>
            <li>I am definitely buying from them more often if I was to ever buy from them again.</li>
            <li>My first vs scent.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was wanting</li>
            <li>Thank you Guys soooo much for putting me back into stock with my Favorite perfume...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really describe how Love Rocks smells, other than saying it&#x27;s girly and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I went with the standard shipping and it got to me fast and securely packages.</li>
            <li>Im very please with the product.</li>
            <li>Very Musky and sultry but doesn&#x27;t overpower.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>thanks so much for it.</li>
            <li>I was really bummed to learn that VS discontinued this item.  </li>
            <li>Luv it!  Light &amp; romantic!  </li>
            <li>so thanks amazon for having this product</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li>and I only bought it because the reviews were really good, plus I love buying her Victoria Secret perfume.</li>
            <li>Sad that this was discontinued, because by far this is one of Victoria&#x27;s best scent.  </li>
            <li>The actual perfume is very strong and you only needed one squirt.</li>
            <li>Nice scent but doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like.</li>
            <li>I personally was blown away of how quickly the package got here.</li>
            <li>This particular one they don&#x27;t sell in the store or online, so I got it here.</li>
            <li>classic fragrance ...</li>
            <li>something an older person would wear.</li>
            <li>The only word that I can think of for this spray it HOT!</li>
            <li>that I don&#x27;t like,\\&quot;Sexy Little Things\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I love this smell, its a little musky but has a girly scent too.</li>
            <li>This perfume has such a distinct smell that I could identify it anywhere.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and girly.</li>
            <li>I originally fell in love with this scent in Victoria&#x27;s Secret about 4 years ago but they only had the mini size at the time.</li>
            <li>its unique and last on me for a long time.</li>
            <li>was glad to find this...very hard to get at the mall.</li>
            <li>I hope VS offers it again, I cannot find it their anymore.</li>
            <li>The body spray last much longer</li>
            <li>Old and sticky and musky.</li>
            <li>LIKE SOFT SCENT.</li>
            <li>I had to go somewhere a few days later and sprayed it on expecting the sexy, flirty fragrance</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted and expected.  </li>
            <li>Very large bottle, will last for a very long time.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Victoria&#x27;s Secret scent.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite Victoria&#x27;s Secret fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love Victoria&#x27;s Secret fragrances and when I saw this one I had to have it.</li>
            <li>My absolutely favorite scent made by Victoria&#x27;s Secret.</li>
            <li>but maybe the new B&amp;BWorks scent forever red is similar!?</li>
            <li>Cap had broken but the fragrance was fine and the spray bottle worked.</li>
            <li>BUT thats not fair to the other women who share the same love for LoveRocks Perfume as I do.</li>

            <li> I was so excited when I was able to locate this fragrance, I was upset when VS stopped selling this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this particular spray and more from this seller!</li>
            <li> A tremendous addition to any woman&#x27;s fragrance collection!  </li>

            <li> Very romantic scent to it, great for the evening hours.</li>
            <li> Smells just like the perfume except it is way more economical than buying the perfume</li>
            <li> She was thrilled to receive it, as much as I was to have her spritz it on immediately.</li>
            <li> awesome and authentic :) I am so excited to have found this online as I was devastated when Victoria Secret  discontinued it</li>

            <li> I had no idea it was still available out there, thanks OS !</li>
            <li> Victoria&#x27;s Secret has discontinued this fragrance and I&#x27;m so happy I can get it on amazon!!</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume by far, this smells so amazing and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Came in a timely manner, and the price was right.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t spray right.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased to see my favorite Victorias Secret fragrance spray,\\&quot;Love</li>
            <li> If I need other gift, I will think in you!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and Happy New Year.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this seller, I&#x27;ve had trade mark&#x27;s EDT and can tell you with no doubts that it is an original one.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I would only purchase this to wear year round if it was more readily available.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I wanted with in a week.</li>
            <li> and I wanted more than what I currently have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d describe it as deep, spicy, and sexy.</li>
            <li> This is the first time my wife has used this</li>
            <li> I am definitely buying from them more often if I was to ever buy from them again.</li>
            <li> My first vs scent.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was wanting</li>
            <li> Thank you Guys soooo much for putting me back into stock with my Favorite perfume...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really describe how Love Rocks smells, other than saying it&#x27;s girly and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I went with the standard shipping and it got to me fast and securely packages.</li>
            <li> Im very please with the product.</li>
            <li> Very Musky and sultry but doesn&#x27;t overpower.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> thanks so much for it.</li>
            <li> I was really bummed to learn that VS discontinued this item.  </li>
            <li> Luv it!  Light &amp; romantic!  </li>
            <li> so thanks amazon for having this product</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li> and I only bought it because the reviews were really good, plus I love buying her Victoria Secret perfume.</li>
            <li> Sad that this was discontinued, because by far this is one of Victoria&#x27;s best scent.  </li>
            <li> The actual perfume is very strong and you only needed one squirt.</li>
            <li> Nice scent but doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like.</li>
            <li> I personally was blown away of how quickly the package got here.</li>
            <li> This particular one they don&#x27;t sell in the store or online, so I got it here.</li>
            <li> classic fragrance ...</li>
            <li> something an older person would wear.</li>
            <li> The only word that I can think of for this spray it HOT!</li>
            <li> that I don&#x27;t like,\\&quot;Sexy Little Things\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I love this smell, its a little musky but has a girly scent too.</li>
            <li> This perfume has such a distinct smell that I could identify it anywhere.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and girly.</li>
            <li> I originally fell in love with this scent in Victoria&#x27;s Secret about 4 years ago but they only had the mini size at the time.</li>
            <li> its unique and last on me for a long time.</li>
            <li> was glad to find this...very hard to get at the mall.</li>
            <li> I hope VS offers it again, I cannot find it their anymore.</li>
            <li> The body spray last much longer</li>
            <li> Old and sticky and musky.</li>
            <li> LIKE SOFT SCENT.</li>
            <li> I had to go somewhere a few days later and sprayed it on expecting the sexy, flirty fragrance</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted and expected.  </li>
            <li> Very large bottle, will last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Victoria&#x27;s Secret scent.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite Victoria&#x27;s Secret fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love Victoria&#x27;s Secret fragrances and when I saw this one I had to have it.</li>
            <li> My absolutely favorite scent made by Victoria&#x27;s Secret.</li>
            <li> but maybe the new B&amp;BWorks scent forever red is similar!?</li>
            <li> Cap had broken but the fragrance was fine and the spray bottle worked.</li>
            <li> BUT thats not fair to the other women who share the same love for LoveRocks Perfume as I do.</li>
            <li> I love this scent it smells a lot like Hynotic Poison perfume but is far less expensive.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> The scent does not last very long.</li>
            <li> I did not have to wait long to receive it</li>
            <li> I bought a few to hopefully last as long as I ca possibly make them!!!</li>
            <li> The company that mailed it to me definitely mailed me a watered down version.</li>
            <li> This is good on days when I don&#x27;t feel like wearing a thick perfume that can be overpowering, like on lazy weekends at home or casually at night.</li>
            <li> Ever since then I&#x27;ve been trying to conserve my little one and finally decided to look online to see if I could find it.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and get compliments on my perfume constantly.</li>
            <li> Showed up before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> but it is a mist not a pure perfume.</li>
            <li> Same scent of what I remember when I bought it last time at Victoria Secret store.</li>
            <li> Thought VS didnt sell it anymore and was sad but thanks to Amazon I can rock this scent again.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it was a little pricey</li>
            <li> too bad they dint sell at victoria secret stores any more.</li>
            <li> Tgis was the only place tgat had my perfume not even vuctorias secret had it.</li>
            <li> I was so heartbroken when I went back to Victoria&#x27;s Secret and found that the scent had been discontinued.</li>
            <li> and I wear it everyday now.</li>
            <li> I smelled a few years before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had some issues in the past with paypal</li>
            <li> It smelled like cologne, and not very good cologne.</li>
            <li> This arrived late.</li>
            <li> And not really a good one,</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve ever smelled from Victorias Secret.</li>
            <li> So sad that this scent was discontinued by Victoria Secret...</li>
            <li> Sorry VS stopped making it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they have discontinued it</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this perfume/body spray.</li>
            <li> They are weird.</li>
            <li> something is wrong with the spray part.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed when VS quit carrying it.  </li>
            <li> I am beyond disappointed that this perfume is no longer offered through VS.</li>
            <li> , i&#x27;m so dissapointed its discontinued :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was so disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have no idea why someone said it smells terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was delighted to see that I could get this here.  It is exactly what I wanted and expected.  Yay!</li>
            <li> A tremendous addition to any woman&#x27;s fragrance collection!  Very nice!  Packaging is cheap, and the fragrance is cheap compared to the more established fragrance houses; but it&#x27;s a beautiful and attractive fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. Sorry VS stopped making it.</li>
            <li> Love this product! So glad I found it on here because the stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore. I&#x27;ll definitely be back for more!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for a present but it smells wonderful, thinking about buying it for myself now.</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the best scents VS has made. I am not into many perfumes and sprays. But, this one has changed my mind. Many of my friends went out and purchased it. My co-workers always compliment me on it. I hope VS offers it again, I cannot find it their anymore. This is one of the reasons I would visit the store was to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> its a shame its discountinued</li>
            <li> Im very please with the product.</li>
            <li> The cap was cracked, when I received the product. Otherwise was happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this body spray. I use it everyday and get compliments on my perfume constantly. Victoria&#x27;s Secret has discontinued this fragrance and I&#x27;m so happy I can get it on amazon!!</li>
            <li> And honestly I would love to say DON&#x27;T buy this its bla bla bla.. so that I could buy it all. BUT thats not fair to the other women who share the same love for LoveRocks Perfume as I do. I got exactly what I wanted with in a week. Thank you Guys soooo much for putting me back into stock with my Favorite perfume... oh and My Husband says thanks to :)</li>
            <li> I love this scent it smells a lot like Hynotic Poison perfume but is far less expensive. I have love rocks perfume and body spray. The body spray last much longer but I love them both. They are one of my favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Victoria&#x27;s Secret scent.  Unfortunately, they have discontinued it so I have been looking everywhere to find it and order it.  It is a very soft and feminine scent that is great for any time of the day.  You cannot go wrong with this perfume/body spray.</li>
            <li> I love this smell. Very Musky and sultry but doesn&#x27;t overpower. Its affordable too! Thought VS didnt sell it anymore and was sad but thanks to Amazon I can rock this scent again.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes EVER. I ran out of it finally (it&#x27;s a huge bottle) so since it&#x27;s discontinued I came to Amazon. I&#x27;ve never reviewed anything on here before but I&#x27;m so disappointed. This perfume has such a distinct smell that I could identify it anywhere. Upon spraying it on me today, I noticed it smelled like literally nothing. The actual perfume is very strong and you only needed one squirt. I sprayed an entire t-shirt to see if I was just imagining. I still smelled nothing. I had my entire family smell it, and they know this perfume, and we all still smell nothing. The company that mailed it to me definitely mailed me a watered down version. Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent by VS. I was very happy and excited to find it online. I had to get two bottles so i knew i would always have it. Item arrived on time before the estimated delivery date. Very Happy!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I originally fell in love with this scent in Victoria&#x27;s Secret about 4 years ago but they only had the mini size at the time. When I went back a couple of months later, they did not stock it anymore and I was devastated. Ever since then I&#x27;ve been trying to conserve my little one and finally decided to look online to see if I could find it. Yeah, it was a little pricey but I get that it&#x27;s a discontinued item and I wanted more than what I currently have.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Victoria&#x27;s Secret fragrance. Thank God for Amazon. If you want to smell like a sexy rockstar, buy it lol. It smells like vanilla, amber &amp; awesomeness.</li>
            <li> This is a prefect scent for fall, winter, our a date night. It&#x27;d describe it as deep, spicy, and sexy. its unique and last on me for a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter but each time she wears it I am reminded how nice it smells. .</li>
            <li> My favorite scent from VS!</li>
            <li> awesome and authentic :) I am so excited to have found this online as I was devastated when Victoria Secret  discontinued it</li>
            <li> I like this scented mist a lot.  It reminds me of a light hairspray that smells REALLY good more than a body mist, just because it&#x27;s so light.  This is good on days when I don&#x27;t feel like wearing a thick perfume that can be overpowering, like on lazy weekends at home or casually at night. I can&#x27;t really describe how Love Rocks smells, other than saying it&#x27;s girly and fresh.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a sensitive nose. PLUS at the time that I purchased this on Amazon, I got an 8.4 oz. bottle for only $15!!! Great deal!</li>
            <li> This arrived late. Cap had broken but the fragrance was fine and the spray bottle worked.</li>
            <li> I feel that the bottle of this perfume smells a bit different than the bottle I bought at Victoria Secrets and it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> This is great smelling stuff. This is the first time my wife has used this and I only bought it because the reviews were really good, plus I love buying her Victoria Secret perfume. She loves it and she fits the name on the bottle !!</li>
            <li> It came when it said it would. Tgis was the only place tgat had my perfume not even vuctorias secret had it.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume ! Was disappointed when VS quit carrying it.  I had no idea it was still available out there, thanks OS !</li>
            <li> Oh man....you cannot even believe just how good this stuff smells unless you have smelled it before! The only word that I can think of for this spray it HOT! I went with the standard shipping and it got to me fast and securely packages. Very pleased with my order. I will be buying more of this particular spray and more from this seller!</li>
            <li> I have no idea why someone said it smells terrible. They are weird. I get compliments on this all the time. I cannot believe VS discontinued it. I keep stocking up on it whenever I can find it. I love it and it is my signature scent (as nobody else seems to wear it - I smell unique). I will be heartbroken when I can no longer find it. Even though it is a mist and not a perfume, the scent lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The order was shipped quickly, it was just what I wanted, It was a qift for the Christmas holidays. thanks</li>
            <li> I was so pleased to see my favorite Victorias Secret fragrance spray,\\&quot;Love Rocks\\&quot;, online,since it has been discontinued. So of course I purchased 2. I waited a month, and when I finally received the shipment, there was only one fragrance,and it was a very different scent,that I don&#x27;t like,\\&quot;Sexy Little Things\\&quot;. Another month,no refund nor apology.&lt;br /&gt;Awful and I will never purchase through them again!</li>
            <li> I send it to my daughter in law for mother&#x27;s day and she simple loved it...she was very happy so am I...the price was great and the smell really great...thanks so much for it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t not smell like I was expecting. I was very excited to receive this- it came on time, but I gave it away.</li>
            <li> I personally was blown away of how quickly the package got here. Despite the holidays, it came in 2 days ahead of time. I am definitely buying from them more often if I was to ever buy from them again. Same scent of what I remember when I bought it last time at Victoria Secret store. Very large bottle, will last for a very long time. You have to buy this!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for! Amazing sexy smell</li>
            <li> Fast delivery very good price.</li>
            <li> I was really bummed to learn that VS discontinued this item.  The product smells as delicious and sexy as I remember.  I do wish the smell lasted a bit longer but it is a mist not a pure perfume.</li>
            <li> I love Victoria&#x27;s Secret fragrances and when I saw this one I had to have it. This particular one they don&#x27;t sell in the store or online, so I got it here. OMG it smells so amazing, when you put it on it makes you feel sexy and luxurious. Its been added to my collection and is one of my faves.</li>
            <li> Love it.. too bad they dint sell at victoria secret stores any more.</li>
            <li> Excellent product from an excellent seller! I highly recommend this seller, I&#x27;ve had trade mark&#x27;s EDT and can tell you with no doubts that it is an original one. Best regards from Vzla!!</li>
            <li> Ughhh I love it ! The last time I had this perfume was my freshmen year which was 5 years ago. Having it again &amp; smelling it brings nostalgia. Thank you for selling this. I did not have to wait long to receive it and it came in a good package .</li>
            <li> I love this smell, its a little musky but has a girly scent too. It lingers throughout the day. Had many compliments on the smell. Its perfect for day and night, but would normally use it for a date.&lt;br /&gt;Its the perfect smell for me, not too manly but not too girly.&lt;br /&gt;I think if you enjoy muskier scents and scents that stay on your body throughout the day then this is the scent for you!</li>
            <li> I ordered Love Rocks for a good price and it arrived before expected and in great condition.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier to have found this discontinued (don&#x27;t know why, it smells so good!) perfume!</li>
            <li> my package never came and another gift was purchased in its place. great time on return thankyou and hopefully the usps gets it toghter as well</li>
            <li> Luv it!  Light &amp; romantic!  So sad that this scent was discontinued by Victoria Secret...scent is truly classic...very phenomenal!  My hubby loves it!</li>
            <li> Love this scent! Came in a timely manner, and the price was right.</li>
            <li> arrived as promised and was in great condition.</li>
            <li> classic fragrance ...i love it</li>
            <li> Wish they hadn&#x27;t discontinued this scent. Truly a favorite- warm and spicy I bought a few to hopefully last as long as I ca possibly make them!!!</li>
            <li> It smells like cologne.. And not really a good one, something an older person would wear. The kind that makes you gag.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I was able to locate this fragrance, I was upset when VS stopped selling this fragrance. Will be ordering more when I run out!!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance, will keep buying more as long as it is available. Very romantic scent to it, great for the evening hours.</li>
            <li> Buy!  My wife loves this stuff...</li>
            <li> something is wrong with the spray part. i have tried fixing it. but it doesn&#x27;t spray right. i am still working on how to fix it</li>
            <li> I love this scent. I was so heartbroken when I went back to Victoria&#x27;s Secret and found that the scent had been discontinued. I am very pleased to have found it and I wear it everyday now.</li>
            <li> This perfume seemed perfect for me. I tried it when it came out and thought, \\&quot;Oh, how sexy! And what a cute bottle! I can&#x27;t wait to get a bottle of this for myself.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up not going back to VS for a while. About a year ago my cousin and I were browsing the mall and VS had a bottle for 75% off. How could I pass that up? I had to go somewhere a few days later and sprayed it on expecting the sexy, flirty fragrance I smelled a few years before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so disappointed! It smelled like cologne, and not very good cologne. Old and sticky and musky. What happened to the fragrance I had adored? My best guess would be a formula change. I don&#x27;t know for sure, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying it again anytime soon.</li>
            <li> VS stopped making this one WHY?</li>
            <li> Awesome I bought one for me an one for my daughter for christmas I hadnt been able to find this anywhere but ebay an ebay only uses paypal an I had some issues in the past with paypal so thanks amazon for having this product</li>
            <li> Everytime I fall in love with a fragrance it disappears. I&#x27;m thrilled that I was able to find it on Amazon. One of the most sensual fragrances ever made. I also love it for after the gym its easy to spray and light</li>
            <li> I am beyond disappointed that this perfume is no longer offered through VS. Honestly, I would only purchase this to wear year round if it was more readily available.</li>
            <li> My SIL loves this scentnandni was so happy to find it on amazon when she thought it wa discontinued! We wish VS would bring it back but maybe the new B&amp;BWorks scent forever red is similar!?</li>
            <li> was glad to find this...very hard to get at the mall. it was a great gift idea</li>
            <li> Nice scent but doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like.</li>
            <li> My first vs scent. I got it because the reviews were very good. The scent does not last very long. And it smells a tad musky.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Works great!!  Smells just like the perfume except it is way more economical than buying the perfume and it lasts longer!</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume by far, this smells so amazing and lasts a long time. It came super fast and in nice packaging.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend, as it is one of my favorite from the VS fragrance line. She was thrilled to receive it, as much as I was to have her spritz it on immediately. I will be buying more.</li>

            <li> Sad that this was discontinued, because by far this is one of Victoria&#x27;s best scent.  It&#x27;s very soft and girly.</li>

            <li> SMELL VERY SOFT AND GOOD. I RECOMEND THIS FOR EVERY ONE&lt;br /&gt;THAT LIKE SOFT SCENT.</li>
            <li> I got this product because the reviews on it were really great &amp; considering people complaining about it not being sold in stores anymore...now I kno why it was TERRIBLE I don&#x27;t like the smell at all not my choice or preference of perfume never ordering off of what people say about smells again. This is a horrible smell. THE WORST PERFUME I HAVE EVER PURCHASED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
