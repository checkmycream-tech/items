            <li>It works by healing sun damage, helps skin repair itself by increasing collagen production ( which gives skin its elasticity), and reduces free radicals by neutralizing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;ve used a whole bottle and haven&#x27;t seen any results yet.</li>
            <li>its a great pick me up in the morning adds enough moisture but doesnt make me oily.</li>
            <li>, it keeps my skin fresh and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Has helped to smooth the appearance of the aging look of my hands and fingers also.</li>
            <li>It is important that you use the serum before moisturizing and not after.</li>
            <li>I use this at night followed by whatever cream I have available.  </li>
            <li>The serum DOES have a light scent.</li>
            <li>I applied this serum for few days and It showed awesome results.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It feels good going on - it doesn&#x27;t really feel like anything - more like water really.  </li>
            <li>I have used it twice today and so far my very sensitive skin has had no reaction which is great for me and means this is a pretty good quality product.</li>
            <li>I have seen a significant reduction of fine lines and skin redness since I have been using this vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>This is why it’s very important for me to use exceptional quality products for my facial care.</li>
            <li>This claims to help with fine lines and wrinkles which are not a major problem for me but anything I can add to my beauty routine to prevent those is an added benefit for me as well this acts as a great moisturizer under my makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li>I was excited to be able to get this as a promotional offer and trying this product was such a good thing for me.</li>
            <li>I was able to apply my makeup right after with no problems.</li>
            <li>I love that they don&#x27;t test on animals and it is made right here in the US.</li>
            <li>It make my face feel smooth, clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>This serum goes a long way and makes my skin feel great.  </li>
            <li>and I was excited to try out anything that might help.  </li>
            <li>worth a try!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it consistently and have noticed brighter, better looking skin.</li>
            <li>So, I was excited to try this serum.</li>
            <li>After the first couple of applications your skin will feel softer and look better.</li>
            <li>If you use the moisturizer first, your skin will not be able to absorb the vitamin c serum.  </li>
            <li>It goes on the skin light and non-greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling nice and smooth and so far it hasnt made me break out</li>
            <li>So far, I really think its gonna be great.</li>
            <li>I have to use a good cleanser twice a day, tone at least twice, exfoliate two or three times a week, and use a mask weekly to keep my skin in good shape.  </li>
            <li>Well I was offered this Vitamin C Serum from Majestic Pure for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a bottle because I like the products from Majestic Pure.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t notice much difference yet, but it does leave a soothing and refreshing feeling which is plenty worth it!</li>
            <li>got this serum at special price to review</li>
            <li>Majestic Pure has always provided a top quality product, and this one did not disappoint .I</li>
            <li>I have very good skin for age 67, but ladies the deeper lines (around the mouth) and a few age spots I couldn&#x27;t get rid of...now I am.  </li>
            <li>Even though I do use moisturizers and eye creams, I&#x27;ve been researching on vitamin c and hyaluronic acid, after careful reading of reviews and a special offer to buy this serum at a great deal to share my opinion I chose to do it.</li>
            <li>Most skin care products either irritate my skin or do absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>So far, it feels nice and soothing, not greasy like I was expecting.</li>
            <li>The serum is packaged in a glass container which helps keep the serum fresh and toxin free.</li>
            <li>After that I didn&#x27;t put much on and it worked better no redness or reaction.</li>
            <li>(I have full lips that are showing lines since they&#x27;re losing their elasticity - something you can see after a full day of wearing lipcolor).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than satisfied with the results only after six days - something NO expensive creams have ever been able to provide.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than satisfied with the results only after six days - something NO expensive creams have ever been able to provide.</li>
            <li>i had almost a full jar.</li>
            <li>Loving it so far.</li>
            <li>I love this serum so much.</li>
            <li>No feeling of irritation and the smell is not bad.</li>
            <li>Every woman should have vitamin C in her beauty regimen and the Vitamin C Serum from Majestic Pure is a quality product that you can be sure will help you look younger and more healthy.  </li>
            <li>I’m 31, so I’m becoming more and more concerned with my skin as my first wrinkles are starting to appear.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this Vitamin C Serum from Majestic Pure for anyone who is looking for a great C Serum.</li>
            <li>There products are seriously the best I have tried in years.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different kinds of vitamin c serums and they all did ok with my skin.</li>
            <li>The smell was mild .</li>
            <li>This vitamin C serum has helped my skin so far to look really healthy, smooth and even toned.  </li>
            <li>but I more so notice how refreshed and healthy I look overall.</li>
            <li>IT SOAKS IN QUICKLY</li>
            <li>For the best results you need to use the serum twice daily for about a month, we have been using it only for a couple of days, but we can already see it working.</li>
            <li>This arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>arrived quickly and well packaged.  </li>
            <li>This vitamin C serum has a very light fragrance, is fast absorbing and literally leaves my skin feeling silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>My skin absorbes this serum very nicely and my face looks and feels younger and much</li>
            <li>I admit I enjoy having pretty jars of lotions and potions and tinctures lined up on my vanity table.</li>
            <li>I already noticed a difference on the very first</li>
            <li>I have bought some other Vitamin C brands that had cost a lot more, and I can honestly say this one works just as well.</li>
            <li>My skin has not felt this good in a long time.  </li>
            <li>I love to try new beauty products</li>
            <li>I applied it after washing my face in place of both my moisturizer and toner at night and it absorbed quickly and my skin didn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good but definitely not a serum</li>
            <li>What I personally find most appealing about this particular serum is how light it is.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this Majestic Purse Vitamin C Serum is natural and organic and that it is made in the USA!</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30’s and have started to notice some fine lines and wrinkles to add to my under eye circles!</li>
            <li>Brighter complexion, fine lines are gone and an overall healthy look.</li>
            <li>The best part is if you are not satisfied with the product then you can return it for a refund!!  </li>
            <li>It is light and absorb fast.</li>
            <li>It went on smooth and didn&#x27;t take much to cover my face.</li>
            <li>The serum does not irritate my skin like others and great to use everyday.</li>
            <li>The serum does not irritate my skin like others and great to use everyday.</li>
            <li>i love how the skin feels after i apply it, leves ur skin so soft and fresh  like baby</li>
            <li>i was given this item at a low cost to give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>It was so worth it</li>
            <li>i was given this item at a low cost to give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural and contains vitamin e and aloe.</li>
            <li>definetlyneither useful</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>This is because the serum is easily absorbed into the skin, while moisturizers work on the surface.</li>
            <li>Pleased so far.</li>
            <li>but since there are so many phony reviews out there I decided to leave this company (that is really trying to get unbiased real reviews ) one .</li>
            <li>Not only do I love this, it came so fast in the mail!!!</li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t associate a topical Vitamin C product with good health, but if you want to look good on the outside, get rid of blemishes and wrinkles daily use of this high quality product is recommended.  </li>
            <li>The high-quality dropper is not only perfect for their other oils, but for this serum it is a must have.</li>
            <li>I noticed right away a bit of tingling and then a tightening feeling.</li>
            <li>trauma  &amp; drama right now, which in fact was the reason I ordered this to try.</li>
            <li>put it on the right side of my face for a week.  </li>
            <li>it may take a week or so to get results so I&#x27;ll update my review after using it for longer like giving my review right away but</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>and I struggle to achieve that look right now</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased and I really like using this.</li>
            <li>My face is breaking out less and just feels so much better and looks better</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, and leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>We have what I consider normal, age appropriate signs of growing older.</li>
            <li>A few drops is all I need to cover a large area and my skin feels great all day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Majestic Pure!</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feels fair soft and instantly brighten my complexion.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product consistently for a few weeks and my skin looks amazing!  </li>
            <li>In fact, the smell is mild and very neutral.</li>
            <li>It easily spreads onto your skin but dries completely matte, which as an oily girl</li>
            <li>So far, not much change, but I just read that its great for under-eye bags, so I am going to try that.</li>
            <li>I like it that it is mostly natural ingredients and the serum is really easy to absorb.</li>
            <li>and they started to lighten up which excited me as I do not want to look old!!</li>
            <li>It has a very light smell (which I personally do not like).</li>
            <li>I am on my mid 40&#x27;s sliding into 50, so my skin regimen is very important to me.</li>
            <li>So far it has help remove and reduce the appearance of fine lines and age spots.</li>
            <li>Majestic Pure has an entire line of trustworthy products that I have tried and love just as much as this one!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another huge perk for me was the fact that along with the quick absorption, your skin is left feeling quite a bit softer right upon application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the best way to get oil in the skin is to add a little to my bath water and take a long soak.</li>
            <li>- Imhave become a huge fan of all natural skin care.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C helps reproduce healthy looking skin whichout the need for unnatural facial treatments.</li>
            <li>It took me 6 weeks to see results when I first started, and I recommend using it twice a day.  </li>
            <li>putting it on for the first time.</li>
            <li>Really like this!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I wanted it to do</li>
            <li>it absorbed fairly fast, i also have noticed my frown brow lines have diminished.</li>
            <li>Interested to see the results over time.</li>
            <li>After first couple days, my skin feels firmer and tighter.</li>
            <li>first tried this serum wondering how it works , worried about its price.</li>
            <li>My skin felt smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Better value overall.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more of this product once it has run out.</li>
            <li>JUST WASHED MY FACE AND APPLIED THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying a vitamin c serum</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m preserving my pretty before it starts to age.</li>
            <li>The first product I used was an eye serum.</li>
            <li>With this double defense, I feel as though my skin is well protected and it has never looked better.     </li>
            <li>I will comment on this review after using the product for 30 days to tell you how we look and what effect it has had on our skin with longer, consistent use.</li>
            <li>The Vitamin C serum absorbed in my skin very rapidly and evenly.</li>
            <li>It is my first vitamin C product</li>
            <li>So far so good, I haven&#x27;t had a long time to test this out</li>
            <li>So, yeah that&#x27;s a huge plus especially if you are using this as a full face or large area serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Majestic Pure essential oils</li>
            <li>Other than that I liked the product.</li>
            <li>I have targeted different problem areas on my skin for the different products to get a fair assessment of each formula.</li>
            <li>The smell was neither unpleasant nor offending in any way and the best thing my face had no bad reactions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;FACE: After washing my face and applying Majestic Pure Vit. C Serum that first night, my skin tightened up and is already smoother.</li>
            <li>Absorbs into skin quickly and does not irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The bottle itself is good and thick and, while I certainly don&#x27;t recommend trying this, I don&#x27;t think it would break easily if it were dropped as easily as some other bottles might.</li>
            <li>I have suffered from under eye circles for pretty much my whole life.</li>
            <li>My wife has been using this serum for a few weeks now and I am very pleased with the results as of now.  </li>
            <li>It has several great ingredients other than Vitamin C.  </li>
            <li>At first I could not tell it was doing much</li>
            <li>the ferulic acid is one of the effective ingredients that fades dark spots.  </li>
            <li>She uses the serum every day and it makesher skin feel so good and also feels very firm.</li>
            <li>This product is great helped with brightening my face as well as lightening up dark spots I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and the serum absorbs completely and quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not odor less but has a nice natural&lt;br /&gt;Scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, dries within seconds, and there is no sticky feeling left.</li>
            <li>Majestic Pure Vitamin C Serum -</li>
            <li>This is a review of Majestic Pure Vitamin C Serum&lt;br</li>
            <li>have been using Majestic Pure Vitamin C Serum and Hyaluronic Acid for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>This serum not only diminished those pesky fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have been noticing that my skin has been starting to have fine lines.</li>
            <li>The other day I went out with makeup and realized my bare skin was looking almost as good as it does when I wear BB cream.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this out as I have enough Fine Lines that you can use them to draw a picture on my face with.</li>
            <li>A very good natural alternative to the harsh chemicals on the market with actual results you will notice.</li>
            <li>I use it daily on my hands and nails and have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I have used vitamin c oil for several years and it is a huge help.</li>
            <li>This is clearly high quality stuff!</li>
            <li>You have absolutely nothing to lose by giving this serum a try and everything to gain.</li>
            <li>I was applying straight vitamin C to my burn areas, any type of mark I want to heal with no/less scaring.</li>
            <li>My face is really seeing the reults.</li>
            <li>and it made my foundation apply really</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but I think I put too much on cause</li>
            <li>Some were really greasy</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a scent, it&#x27;s not oily, absorbs very well into the skin, and hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I always apply night cream (Aveeno) and do it now *after* gently massaging in the Majestic serum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m skeptic when in comes to using something on my face but this one really stands out.</li>
            <li>She has some sun damage that she&#x27;s been really concerned about and had been wanting to add a Vitamin C Serum to her skin care routine.</li>
            <li>thank you so much for opportunity</li>
            <li>It soaks in fast.</li>
            <li>How ironic 😊</li>
            <li>This serum is light enough to wear without feeling oily or too moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t break out this much in high school at one time!  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really have too much of scent so after you rub it in you can forget about it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor and it has not caused any irritation.</li>
            <li>This way I don&#x27;t have to do so much massaging.</li>
            <li>I notice my skin is much softer when I add the oil to my bath water.</li>
            <li>Nothing really noticeable happened when using it.</li>
            <li>Bringing Back Your Youthful Glow By Neutralizing Free Radicals</li>
            <li>and I have no doubt that after a couple weeks my skin will have a very noticeable and smoother look to it.</li>
            <li>It applies and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>appreciated the email follow up by the company as to how the Serum was working for me.  </li>
            <li>So the quality of the bottle itself is very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really see much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>The bottle comes with a dropper so you don&#x27;t really use a lot</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Only a smooth silky serum that get&#x27;s absorbed  completely when it is well accepted and needed.</li>
            <li>I love using products as natural as possible on my skin.</li>
            <li>As I always say t men , don&#x27;t be ashamed to use products like this, looking young and healthy can give you a competitive edge in business and in your personal life.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be using this product on a regular basis and buying a bottle of my own when the time comes.</li>
            <li>If you want to know more about why, visit my other reviews on any of the Majestic Pure products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We are always interested in finding a product to slow the signs of aging on our face and it is even better when we can find a product that helps to reverse those signs!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a month since I have used this product, during that time I have experienced dry and tightness, slight burning on my face.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to share some of that here since the Majestic Pure brand is now the only one I will buy at full price.</li>
            <li>The smell is better than other Vitamin C items out there.</li>
            <li>which is make the dark circles under my eyes go away and reduce fine lines and wrinkles!</li>
            <li>It left my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to use by placing a few drops on your finger tip and rub it where you want on you rub in a circle.</li>
            <li>The dropper makes it easy to dispense what you need and get it every single time.</li>
            <li>I am new to the Majestic Pure product line</li>
            <li>I have only used it a few times but so far product seems to be great quality.</li>
            <li>I love to put a couple of drops of this into my moisturizer, mix it in, and smooth it on to give my everyday skin care regimen that extra boost.</li>
            <li>I use a natural soap first, then I use this in place of my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I rarely wear makeup, but if I was going to, I wouldn&#x27;t use any kind of liquid base or concealer with this since it adds moisture to the skin on its own.</li>
            <li>This product is watery and sinks in easily.</li>
            <li>but the more I used it the lines started to be less noticeable.</li>
            <li>His coworkers are surprised to see a change to his face wanting his secret lol.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product and after initial use my skin feels and look much better after only couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get this with a coupon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting this particular one for my mother.</li>
            <li>This bottle is a lot bigger than what I expected and it was packaged nice when I received it in the mail.</li>
            <li>I know I am getting older and to do something about it, so I thought to try this Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>The serum is ok, absorb easily still waiting for dramatic result after a month....</li>
            <li>Very light, little to no scent and does not feel oily.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face very pretty and gives it an instant glow.</li>
            <li>It is overall more smooth and appears brighter than in the past.  </li>
            <li>Another good thing is that this bottle will last you a couple of months, long enough to tell that it works before you commit to another bottle.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to others.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this Vitamin C product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product for testing and reviewing purposes and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product based on quality and performance.</li>
            <li>I ordered this item based on high ratings with Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I tried to hit specifically under my eyes with a little more since I tend to have bags.  </li>
            <li>but I like putting a little bit more on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>The directions clearly states that you need to use it for 30 days to really see the results.  </li>
            <li>Not only is this professional grade serum chock full of Vitamin C, but it also has Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin E, and Ferulic Acid.</li>
            <li>Skin looks much younger and fresh.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had no negative side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I swear my skin healed days faster than normal.</li>
            <li>After just a few days I felt the texture of my skin was better.  </li>
            <li>It is the perfect light, cooling Vitamin C serum for hot muggy days and definitely won&#x27;t bog you down.</li>
            <li>My skin is more elastic, smoother and even old acne scars are less visable.</li>
            <li>Kind of has a slight smell of a aloe type but not noticeable at all until I actually smelled from the bottle.</li>
            <li>I have purchased other Majestic Pure oils and they have always provided very high quality and very pure products.</li>
            <li>The dropper makes using the right amount simple.</li>
            <li>The dropper gives just the right amount of serum for my entire face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Vitamin C oxidizes easily so this comes in a dark amber bottle.</li>
            <li>My suspicion is that this, like any other product in this type of category, will work for some and others might not see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>The serum has a light herbal smell due to the organic herbal infusion in the serum.</li>
            <li>I live in the south where it&#x27;s humid</li>
            <li>After having used this particular Vitamin C serum I have noticed a considerable difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely will buy more once this bottle goes almost empty.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this serum for its natural and guaranteed results.</li>
            <li>My husband has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This has helped clear up some acme spots that would not go away!</li>
            <li>I feel that applying it daily, especially in connection with your favorite cream, helps the elasticity and overall health and glow of your skin.</li>
            <li>I assume from concealer and such that moves around with the hot outdoors</li>
            <li>I have tried a small amount on my cheek to make sure of no break outs.</li>
            <li>C - Fights Age Spots, Sun Damage and Dark Circles Under the Eyes, improves Skin Tone and Texture, and also has an Neutralizing Free Radicals</li>
            <li>when the seller is willing to take that risk by giving you 60 day money back guarantee than why not..right!</li>
            <li>Ive used his for 3 days and my skin feels so much tighter and my pores look more shallow immediately.  </li>
            <li>It feels a lot softer and she really just looks healthier in general, like she&#x27;s got a natural glow that wasn&#x27;t there before.</li>
            <li>Majestic Pure promotes this product as an anti-aging wrinkle serum and even though I can easily pass as a late teen/</li>
            <li>This may be because of how sensitive his skin is, so people with very sensitive skin may notice this too.</li>
            <li>I actually (accidentally) hit it pretty hard on a doorway and thought for sure it would break, but it didn&#x27;t even crack.</li>
            <li>I have mild Rosacea, and while it is certainly not cured I do not feel like Raggedy Ann, either.  </li>
            <li>My pores seem less noticeable, my skin color seems more even, and some smaller wrinkles seem to have disappeared!</li>
            <li>I am very particular about my skin so initially I was hesitant about this product.</li>
            <li>I have purchased several products from MAJESTIC PURE</li>
            <li>Those little lines are almost gone, the skin on my face is so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended this Serum and within few days of use, I can see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Seems to have brighten up my tone and clear up my face.</li>
            <li>By the way, is the color of the solution suppose to be clear like water?</li>
            <li>The ingredients of the serum are 98% natural and 70% organic.</li>
            <li>but so far this has made my skin softer and</li>
            <li>It makes me feel like an old world movie star, surrounded by pampering and glitter.</li>
            <li>so now I don&#x27;t go anywhere near the eye area at all</li>
            <li>Once this hits your skin, you are a frequent user for life.</li>
            <li>Comes with a dropper so there is no waste here.</li>
            <li>I do feel like it brightens my face and it keeps my face feeling soft all day (not oily at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just 2 drops will really cover the entire face and no sticky feeling, no foul smell.</li>
            <li>So far my wife loves it.</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li>young (preventive) and old (renewed).</li>
            <li>Vitamin C is touted as a natural anti-aging solution.</li>
            <li>I used it too often &amp; it irritated my sensitive skin a bit.</li>
            <li>I have recommended the serum to my friends it leaves your skin soft like renewed skin.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I like it so far.</li>
            <li>So you are getting what you pay for instead of paying for a bunch of plastic housing that isn&#x27;t marked as BPA-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have had no reactions to it.</li>
            <li>It is not obnoxious but it may be noticeable to you if you are sensitive to odors.</li>
            <li>So far my skin looks revived.</li>
            <li>I like it so far</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a professional grade of 20%, where you will see some on the market with no disclosure of %, or a lower concentrate.</li>
            <li>It makes it so soft.</li>
            <li>It makes it glow and that glow look natural.</li>
            <li>and I would definitely recommend trying this before you go and spend huge amounts of money on other items or procedures.</li>
            <li>It’s easy to use you take a small amount of it and apply it to your face.  </li>
            <li>It is not uncomfortable to him, and he says it only last momentarily.</li>
            <li>and I see major improvements!</li>
            <li>Gives my skin a major boost!</li>
            <li>Here are some before and after photos of my skin while I was using this (and a few other new products) on my skin :)</li>
            <li>Small note that it comes with a plastic seal that it is important to me.</li>
            <li>The serum dried rather quickly.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and this appears that it will last for MANY uses.</li>
            <li>The serum is very natural made with ingredients such as aloe, jojoba oil, hyaluronic acid and 20% vitamin C.</li>
            <li>I did not have any negative effects from this serum, and I am very much in favor of using healthy natural ingredients in anything my skin absorbs (especially since I have so much trouble with it)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand the pumps because you spend half the time just trying to get the right amount out of the pump and not air or bubbles.</li>
            <li>However, after using it daily for the past two weeks, I have been pleasantly surprised to see a huge improvement in the overall look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li>and I can clearly see a difference in my skin in only a couple of days.</li>
            <li>Now, six days later, my complexion is glowing as it&#x27;s never glowed before; age/sun spots are rapidly fading, pores are shrinking considerably, and skin keeps on tightening.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happily surprised at how youthful my skin has become when I took a picture of my face with my iphone - and this is only after six days of use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happily surprised at how youthful my skin has become when I took a picture of my face with my iphone - and this is only after six days of use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>early twenty-something I just turned 29, so wrinkles and signs of aging are definitely on my radar.</li>
            <li>I noticed immediately after starting to use it that my forehead is no where near as dry and scaly looking as it normally is.</li>
            <li>I have used several different brands but this is going to be one of my new favorites</li>
            <li>My skin has dry patches that take some heavy duty moisturizing to smooth out.  </li>
            <li>Use this for a few weeks twice a day and watch the age spots (hands and face) start to fade and plump the lines right up on the face and neck to the point where they are almost not noticeable.  </li>
            <li>This is much nicer than other Vitamin C serums out there.</li>
            <li>I have kind of been delving into trying a few Vitamin C serums as of late.</li>
            <li>and it does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li>When I first tried this I did get a little redness to my face</li>
            <li>This product smells a little funny to me even though it&#x27;s within</li>
            <li>In the beginning I was skeptical and was not really convinced that these products work as they claim but after using it just for about a month I noticed a change and me and my wife now use it because the product really woks and makes your skin very smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Vitamin C serum twice daily for the past few weeks, and I can honestly say that I am starting to see a difference!</li>
            <li>I really hoped this would give positive results, given the other reviews- it smelled so bad, however, that I could not force myself to use it for more than a week.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and although I have not been using this for very long yet (about a week)</li>
            <li>On a clean and dry face, I apply in a circular motion, all over my face and neck, no more than a tune full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could tell a small difference on the right side of my face especially around my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I have fine lines on my face that I do not want to get any worse</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend for anyone else dealing with dark circles or wrinkles.</li>
            <li>noticed no discernable effects good or bad - like using nothing wont buy again</li>

            <li> We don&#x27;t notice much difference yet, but it does leave a soothing and refreshing feeling which is plenty worth it!</li>
            <li> got this serum at special price to review</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure has always provided a top quality product, and this one did not disappoint .I</li>
            <li> I have very good skin for age 67, but ladies the deeper lines (around the mouth) and a few age spots I couldn&#x27;t get rid of...now I am.  </li>
            <li> Even though I do use moisturizers and eye creams, I&#x27;ve been researching on vitamin c and hyaluronic acid, after careful reading of reviews and a special offer to buy this serum at a great deal to share my opinion I chose to do it.</li>
            <li> Most skin care products either irritate my skin or do absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> So far, it feels nice and soothing, not greasy like I was expecting.</li>
            <li> The serum is packaged in a glass container which helps keep the serum fresh and toxin free.</li>
            <li> After that I didn&#x27;t put much on and it worked better no redness or reaction.</li>
            <li> (I have full lips that are showing lines since they&#x27;re losing their elasticity - something you can see after a full day of wearing lipcolor).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than satisfied with the results only after six days - something NO expensive creams have ever been able to provide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than satisfied with the results only after six days - something NO expensive creams have ever been able to provide.</li>

            <li> I’m 31, so I’m becoming more and more concerned with my skin as my first wrinkles are starting to appear.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this Vitamin C Serum from Majestic Pure for anyone who is looking for a great C Serum.</li>
            <li> There products are seriously the best I have tried in years.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different kinds of vitamin c serums and they all did ok with my skin.</li>

            <li> This vitamin C serum has helped my skin so far to look really healthy, smooth and even toned.  </li>
            <li> but I more so notice how refreshed and healthy I look overall.</li>
            <li> IT SOAKS IN QUICKLY</li>
            <li> For the best results you need to use the serum twice daily for about a month, we have been using it only for a couple of days, but we can already see it working.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly and well packaged.  </li>
            <li> This vitamin C serum has a very light fragrance, is fast absorbing and literally leaves my skin feeling silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> My skin absorbes this serum very nicely and my face looks and feels younger and much</li>
            <li> I admit I enjoy having pretty jars of lotions and potions and tinctures lined up on my vanity table.</li>
            <li> I already noticed a difference on the very first</li>
            <li> I have bought some other Vitamin C brands that had cost a lot more, and I can honestly say this one works just as well.</li>
            <li> My skin has not felt this good in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I love to try new beauty products</li>
            <li> I applied it after washing my face in place of both my moisturizer and toner at night and it absorbed quickly and my skin didn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good but definitely not a serum</li>
            <li> What I personally find most appealing about this particular serum is how light it is.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this Majestic Purse Vitamin C Serum is natural and organic and that it is made in the USA!</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30’s and have started to notice some fine lines and wrinkles to add to my under eye circles!</li>
            <li> Brighter complexion, fine lines are gone and an overall healthy look.</li>
            <li> The best part is if you are not satisfied with the product then you can return it for a refund!!  </li>
            <li> It is light and absorb fast.</li>
            <li> It went on smooth and didn&#x27;t take much to cover my face.</li>
            <li> The serum does not irritate my skin like others and great to use everyday.</li>
            <li> The serum does not irritate my skin like others and great to use everyday.</li>
            <li> i love how the skin feels after i apply it, leves ur skin so soft and fresh  like baby</li>
            <li> i was given this item at a low cost to give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> It was so worth it</li>
            <li> i was given this item at a low cost to give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural and contains vitamin e and aloe.</li>
            <li> definetlyneither useful</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This is because the serum is easily absorbed into the skin, while moisturizers work on the surface.</li>
            <li> Pleased so far.</li>
            <li> but since there are so many phony reviews out there I decided to leave this company (that is really trying to get unbiased real reviews ) one .</li>
            <li> Not only do I love this, it came so fast in the mail!!!</li>
            <li> Most people don&#x27;t associate a topical Vitamin C product with good health, but if you want to look good on the outside, get rid of blemishes and wrinkles daily use of this high quality product is recommended.  </li>
            <li> The high-quality dropper is not only perfect for their other oils, but for this serum it is a must have.</li>
            <li> I noticed right away a bit of tingling and then a tightening feeling.</li>
            <li> trauma  &amp; drama right now, which in fact was the reason I ordered this to try.</li>
            <li> put it on the right side of my face for a week.  </li>
            <li> it may take a week or so to get results so I&#x27;ll update my review after using it for longer like giving my review right away but</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> and I struggle to achieve that look right now</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased and I really like using this.</li>
            <li> My face is breaking out less and just feels so much better and looks better</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, and leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> We have what I consider normal, age appropriate signs of growing older.</li>
            <li> A few drops is all I need to cover a large area and my skin feels great all day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Majestic Pure!</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feels fair soft and instantly brighten my complexion.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product consistently for a few weeks and my skin looks amazing!  </li>
            <li> In fact, the smell is mild and very neutral.</li>
            <li> It easily spreads onto your skin but dries completely matte, which as an oily girl</li>
            <li> So far, not much change, but I just read that its great for under-eye bags, so I am going to try that.</li>
            <li> I like it that it is mostly natural ingredients and the serum is really easy to absorb.</li>
            <li> and they started to lighten up which excited me as I do not want to look old!!</li>
            <li> It has a very light smell (which I personally do not like).</li>
            <li> I am on my mid 40&#x27;s sliding into 50, so my skin regimen is very important to me.</li>
            <li> So far it has help remove and reduce the appearance of fine lines and age spots.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure has an entire line of trustworthy products that I have tried and love just as much as this one!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another huge perk for me was the fact that along with the quick absorption, your skin is left feeling quite a bit softer right upon application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the best way to get oil in the skin is to add a little to my bath water and take a long soak.</li>
            <li> - Imhave become a huge fan of all natural skin care.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C helps reproduce healthy looking skin whichout the need for unnatural facial treatments.</li>
            <li> It took me 6 weeks to see results when I first started, and I recommend using it twice a day.  </li>
            <li> putting it on for the first time.</li>
            <li> Really like this!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I wanted it to do</li>
            <li> it absorbed fairly fast, i also have noticed my frown brow lines have diminished.</li>
            <li> Interested to see the results over time.</li>
            <li> After first couple days, my skin feels firmer and tighter.</li>
            <li> first tried this serum wondering how it works , worried about its price.</li>
            <li> My skin felt smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Better value overall.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more of this product once it has run out.</li>
            <li> JUST WASHED MY FACE AND APPLIED THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a vitamin c serum</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m preserving my pretty before it starts to age.</li>
            <li> The first product I used was an eye serum.</li>
            <li> With this double defense, I feel as though my skin is well protected and it has never looked better.     </li>
            <li> I will comment on this review after using the product for 30 days to tell you how we look and what effect it has had on our skin with longer, consistent use.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C serum absorbed in my skin very rapidly and evenly.</li>
            <li> It is my first vitamin C product</li>
            <li> So far so good, I haven&#x27;t had a long time to test this out</li>
            <li> So, yeah that&#x27;s a huge plus especially if you are using this as a full face or large area serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love Majestic Pure essential oils</li>
            <li> Other than that I liked the product.</li>
            <li> I have targeted different problem areas on my skin for the different products to get a fair assessment of each formula.</li>
            <li> The smell was neither unpleasant nor offending in any way and the best thing my face had no bad reactions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;FACE: After washing my face and applying Majestic Pure Vit. C Serum that first night, my skin tightened up and is already smoother.</li>
            <li> Absorbs into skin quickly and does not irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle itself is good and thick and, while I certainly don&#x27;t recommend trying this, I don&#x27;t think it would break easily if it were dropped as easily as some other bottles might.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from under eye circles for pretty much my whole life.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this serum for a few weeks now and I am very pleased with the results as of now.  </li>
            <li> It has several great ingredients other than Vitamin C.  </li>
            <li> At first I could not tell it was doing much</li>
            <li> the ferulic acid is one of the effective ingredients that fades dark spots.  </li>
            <li> She uses the serum every day and it makesher skin feel so good and also feels very firm.</li>
            <li> This product is great helped with brightening my face as well as lightening up dark spots I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and the serum absorbs completely and quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not odor less but has a nice natural&lt;br /&gt;Scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, dries within seconds, and there is no sticky feeling left.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure Vitamin C Serum -</li>
            <li> This is a review of Majestic Pure Vitamin C Serum&lt;br</li>
            <li> have been using Majestic Pure Vitamin C Serum and Hyaluronic Acid for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This serum not only diminished those pesky fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been noticing that my skin has been starting to have fine lines.</li>
            <li> The other day I went out with makeup and realized my bare skin was looking almost as good as it does when I wear BB cream.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this out as I have enough Fine Lines that you can use them to draw a picture on my face with.</li>
            <li> A very good natural alternative to the harsh chemicals on the market with actual results you will notice.</li>
            <li> I use it daily on my hands and nails and have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I have used vitamin c oil for several years and it is a huge help.</li>
            <li> This is clearly high quality stuff!</li>
            <li> You have absolutely nothing to lose by giving this serum a try and everything to gain.</li>
            <li> I was applying straight vitamin C to my burn areas, any type of mark I want to heal with no/less scaring.</li>
            <li> My face is really seeing the reults.</li>
            <li> and it made my foundation apply really</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but I think I put too much on cause</li>
            <li> Some were really greasy</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a scent, it&#x27;s not oily, absorbs very well into the skin, and hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I always apply night cream (Aveeno) and do it now *after* gently massaging in the Majestic serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptic when in comes to using something on my face but this one really stands out.</li>
            <li> She has some sun damage that she&#x27;s been really concerned about and had been wanting to add a Vitamin C Serum to her skin care routine.</li>
            <li> thank you so much for opportunity</li>
            <li> It soaks in fast.</li>
            <li> How ironic 😊</li>
            <li> This serum is light enough to wear without feeling oily or too moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t break out this much in high school at one time!  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really have too much of scent so after you rub it in you can forget about it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor and it has not caused any irritation.</li>
            <li> This way I don&#x27;t have to do so much massaging.</li>
            <li> I notice my skin is much softer when I add the oil to my bath water.</li>
            <li> Nothing really noticeable happened when using it.</li>
            <li> Bringing Back Your Youthful Glow By Neutralizing Free Radicals</li>
            <li> and I have no doubt that after a couple weeks my skin will have a very noticeable and smoother look to it.</li>
            <li> It applies and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> appreciated the email follow up by the company as to how the Serum was working for me.  </li>
            <li> So the quality of the bottle itself is very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really see much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> The bottle comes with a dropper so you don&#x27;t really use a lot</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Only a smooth silky serum that get&#x27;s absorbed  completely when it is well accepted and needed.</li>
            <li> I love using products as natural as possible on my skin.</li>
            <li> As I always say t men , don&#x27;t be ashamed to use products like this, looking young and healthy can give you a competitive edge in business and in your personal life.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be using this product on a regular basis and buying a bottle of my own when the time comes.</li>
            <li> If you want to know more about why, visit my other reviews on any of the Majestic Pure products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We are always interested in finding a product to slow the signs of aging on our face and it is even better when we can find a product that helps to reverse those signs!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month since I have used this product, during that time I have experienced dry and tightness, slight burning on my face.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to share some of that here since the Majestic Pure brand is now the only one I will buy at full price.</li>
            <li> The smell is better than other Vitamin C items out there.</li>
            <li> which is make the dark circles under my eyes go away and reduce fine lines and wrinkles!</li>
            <li> It left my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to use by placing a few drops on your finger tip and rub it where you want on you rub in a circle.</li>
            <li> The dropper makes it easy to dispense what you need and get it every single time.</li>
            <li> I am new to the Majestic Pure product line</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times but so far product seems to be great quality.</li>
            <li> I love to put a couple of drops of this into my moisturizer, mix it in, and smooth it on to give my everyday skin care regimen that extra boost.</li>
            <li> I use a natural soap first, then I use this in place of my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I rarely wear makeup, but if I was going to, I wouldn&#x27;t use any kind of liquid base or concealer with this since it adds moisture to the skin on its own.</li>
            <li> This product is watery and sinks in easily.</li>
            <li> but the more I used it the lines started to be less noticeable.</li>
            <li> His coworkers are surprised to see a change to his face wanting his secret lol.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product and after initial use my skin feels and look much better after only couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get this with a coupon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting this particular one for my mother.</li>
            <li> This bottle is a lot bigger than what I expected and it was packaged nice when I received it in the mail.</li>
            <li> I know I am getting older and to do something about it, so I thought to try this Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> The serum is ok, absorb easily still waiting for dramatic result after a month....</li>
            <li> Very light, little to no scent and does not feel oily.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face very pretty and gives it an instant glow.</li>
            <li> It is overall more smooth and appears brighter than in the past.  </li>
            <li> Another good thing is that this bottle will last you a couple of months, long enough to tell that it works before you commit to another bottle.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this Vitamin C product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product for testing and reviewing purposes and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product based on quality and performance.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item based on high ratings with Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tried to hit specifically under my eyes with a little more since I tend to have bags.  </li>
            <li> but I like putting a little bit more on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> The directions clearly states that you need to use it for 30 days to really see the results.  </li>
            <li> Not only is this professional grade serum chock full of Vitamin C, but it also has Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin E, and Ferulic Acid.</li>
            <li> Skin looks much younger and fresh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no negative side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I swear my skin healed days faster than normal.</li>
            <li> After just a few days I felt the texture of my skin was better.  </li>
            <li> It is the perfect light, cooling Vitamin C serum for hot muggy days and definitely won&#x27;t bog you down.</li>
            <li> My skin is more elastic, smoother and even old acne scars are less visable.</li>
            <li> Kind of has a slight smell of a aloe type but not noticeable at all until I actually smelled from the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other Majestic Pure oils and they have always provided very high quality and very pure products.</li>
            <li> The dropper makes using the right amount simple.</li>
            <li> The dropper gives just the right amount of serum for my entire face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Vitamin C oxidizes easily so this comes in a dark amber bottle.</li>
            <li> My suspicion is that this, like any other product in this type of category, will work for some and others might not see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> The serum has a light herbal smell due to the organic herbal infusion in the serum.</li>
            <li> I live in the south where it&#x27;s humid</li>
            <li> After having used this particular Vitamin C serum I have noticed a considerable difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely will buy more once this bottle goes almost empty.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this serum for its natural and guaranteed results.</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This has helped clear up some acme spots that would not go away!</li>
            <li> I feel that applying it daily, especially in connection with your favorite cream, helps the elasticity and overall health and glow of your skin.</li>
            <li> I assume from concealer and such that moves around with the hot outdoors</li>
            <li> I have tried a small amount on my cheek to make sure of no break outs.</li>
            <li> C - Fights Age Spots, Sun Damage and Dark Circles Under the Eyes, improves Skin Tone and Texture, and also has an Neutralizing Free Radicals</li>
            <li> when the seller is willing to take that risk by giving you 60 day money back guarantee than why not..right!</li>
            <li> Ive used his for 3 days and my skin feels so much tighter and my pores look more shallow immediately.  </li>
            <li> It feels a lot softer and she really just looks healthier in general, like she&#x27;s got a natural glow that wasn&#x27;t there before.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure promotes this product as an anti-aging wrinkle serum and even though I can easily pass as a late teen/</li>
            <li> This may be because of how sensitive his skin is, so people with very sensitive skin may notice this too.</li>
            <li> I actually (accidentally) hit it pretty hard on a doorway and thought for sure it would break, but it didn&#x27;t even crack.</li>
            <li> I have mild Rosacea, and while it is certainly not cured I do not feel like Raggedy Ann, either.  </li>
            <li> My pores seem less noticeable, my skin color seems more even, and some smaller wrinkles seem to have disappeared!</li>
            <li> I am very particular about my skin so initially I was hesitant about this product.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several products from MAJESTIC PURE</li>
            <li> Those little lines are almost gone, the skin on my face is so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this Serum and within few days of use, I can see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Seems to have brighten up my tone and clear up my face.</li>
            <li> By the way, is the color of the solution suppose to be clear like water?</li>
            <li> The ingredients of the serum are 98% natural and 70% organic.</li>
            <li> but so far this has made my skin softer and</li>
            <li> It makes me feel like an old world movie star, surrounded by pampering and glitter.</li>
            <li> so now I don&#x27;t go anywhere near the eye area at all</li>
            <li> Once this hits your skin, you are a frequent user for life.</li>
            <li> Comes with a dropper so there is no waste here.</li>
            <li> I do feel like it brightens my face and it keeps my face feeling soft all day (not oily at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just 2 drops will really cover the entire face and no sticky feeling, no foul smell.</li>
            <li> So far my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li> young (preventive) and old (renewed).</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is touted as a natural anti-aging solution.</li>
            <li> I used it too often &amp; it irritated my sensitive skin a bit.</li>
            <li> I have recommended the serum to my friends it leaves your skin soft like renewed skin.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I like it so far.</li>
            <li> So you are getting what you pay for instead of paying for a bunch of plastic housing that isn&#x27;t marked as BPA-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have had no reactions to it.</li>
            <li> It is not obnoxious but it may be noticeable to you if you are sensitive to odors.</li>
            <li> So far my skin looks revived.</li>
            <li> I like it so far</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a professional grade of 20%, where you will see some on the market with no disclosure of %, or a lower concentrate.</li>
            <li> It makes it so soft.</li>
            <li> It makes it glow and that glow look natural.</li>
            <li> and I would definitely recommend trying this before you go and spend huge amounts of money on other items or procedures.</li>
            <li> It’s easy to use you take a small amount of it and apply it to your face.  </li>
            <li> It is not uncomfortable to him, and he says it only last momentarily.</li>
            <li> and I see major improvements!</li>
            <li> Gives my skin a major boost!</li>
            <li> Here are some before and after photos of my skin while I was using this (and a few other new products) on my skin :)</li>
            <li> Small note that it comes with a plastic seal that it is important to me.</li>
            <li> The serum dried rather quickly.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and this appears that it will last for MANY uses.</li>
            <li> The serum is very natural made with ingredients such as aloe, jojoba oil, hyaluronic acid and 20% vitamin C.</li>
            <li> I did not have any negative effects from this serum, and I am very much in favor of using healthy natural ingredients in anything my skin absorbs (especially since I have so much trouble with it)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the pumps because you spend half the time just trying to get the right amount out of the pump and not air or bubbles.</li>
            <li> However, after using it daily for the past two weeks, I have been pleasantly surprised to see a huge improvement in the overall look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> and I can clearly see a difference in my skin in only a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Now, six days later, my complexion is glowing as it&#x27;s never glowed before; age/sun spots are rapidly fading, pores are shrinking considerably, and skin keeps on tightening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happily surprised at how youthful my skin has become when I took a picture of my face with my iphone - and this is only after six days of use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happily surprised at how youthful my skin has become when I took a picture of my face with my iphone - and this is only after six days of use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> early twenty-something I just turned 29, so wrinkles and signs of aging are definitely on my radar.</li>
            <li> I noticed immediately after starting to use it that my forehead is no where near as dry and scaly looking as it normally is.</li>
            <li> I have used several different brands but this is going to be one of my new favorites</li>
            <li> My skin has dry patches that take some heavy duty moisturizing to smooth out.  </li>
            <li> Use this for a few weeks twice a day and watch the age spots (hands and face) start to fade and plump the lines right up on the face and neck to the point where they are almost not noticeable.  </li>
            <li> This is much nicer than other Vitamin C serums out there.</li>
            <li> I have kind of been delving into trying a few Vitamin C serums as of late.</li>
            <li> and it does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this I did get a little redness to my face</li>
            <li> This product smells a little funny to me even though it&#x27;s within</li>
            <li> In the beginning I was skeptical and was not really convinced that these products work as they claim but after using it just for about a month I noticed a change and me and my wife now use it because the product really woks and makes your skin very smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Vitamin C serum twice daily for the past few weeks, and I can honestly say that I am starting to see a difference!</li>
            <li> I really hoped this would give positive results, given the other reviews- it smelled so bad, however, that I could not force myself to use it for more than a week.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft and although I have not been using this for very long yet (about a week)</li>
            <li> On a clean and dry face, I apply in a circular motion, all over my face and neck, no more than a tune full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could tell a small difference on the right side of my face especially around my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I have fine lines on my face that I do not want to get any worse</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend for anyone else dealing with dark circles or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> noticed no discernable effects good or bad - like using nothing wont buy again</li>
            <li> The bottle isn&#x27;t large but just a little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> with any new serum I only use it one half of my face in order to see how it works.  </li>
            <li> so far compared to other products it is smoother and makes your face glow</li>
            <li> It also has a high content of aloe that has helped heal little blemishes on my skin.</li>
            <li> Other than the moisturizing qualities of jojoba that the other version had, I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way which is another plus for such a high quality serum.</li>
            <li> I mean, what little fine lines I&#x27;ve had (and can only be seen when wearing foundation)</li>
            <li> i have less bags or darkness under my eyes, it helps me to keep that youthful glow to my skin and keep me looking fresh and it helps from getting over dried out from all the makeup and cleaners i use on my face.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell if it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> This serum helped a lot to take away the dry skin especially in my face.</li>
            <li> it dry for some time and then apply a moisturizer, if possible use one with a sunscreen in it as Vitamin C Serum exfoliates.</li>
            <li> You only need a little oil for your entire face so this product will last you forever!</li>
            <li> a nice size bottle and not too bad on skin</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t seen in a long time, came over and said &amp;</li>
            <li> It actually arrived before the expected date.</li>
            <li> I could not wait to get home and look in the mirror!&lt;br /&gt;Imagine my surprise when that happened; I looked almost TEN years younger less than 2hrs</li>
            <li> My skin feels dry after not sure that is normal.</li>
            <li> I know it’ll happen, but I would like to postpone it for as long as I can!</li>
            <li> I will not go to any other essential oil after using theirs.</li>
            <li> I found that this one left my skin feeling a bit dry compared to other brands that I have used.</li>
            <li> I stopped using the the hyaluronic acid and my skin still feels a bit dry</li>
            <li> Known to reduce the significance of scarring, stretch-marks and dry</li>
            <li> When I take a shower before I dry off I just use the oil like lotion on my body.</li>
            <li> Then I dry off.</li>
            <li> I have an oily nose and really dry forehead.</li>
            <li> I have been putting a few drops in my palm with a few drops of my olay moisturizer because using it straight was a bit drying for my skin.</li>
            <li> reviews of this product took place within a single month?  </li>
            <li> The serum is a bit watery, it’s clear, and I detected a small smell</li>
            <li> The consistency of the serum feels like a water down milky white liquid.</li>
            <li> I have tried several Vitamin C Serums in the last few weeks due to some review for product options I&#x27;ve been given.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my big wrinkles on my forehead are slightly less defined.</li>
            <li> I already notice a slight difference and its only been a week.</li>
            <li> The product seems adequate just not quite as thick as some other serums I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I have stubborn sensitive skin and sensitive smell which in the case of beauty products is always a scary thing.</li>
            <li> serum is a white/orange and is thicker than what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C serum I notices was thicker than expected</li>
            <li> Dark circles are something which has stayed with me for a long time.</li>
            <li> There really is no scent to it (which I like)</li>
            <li> The skin lightening promised never really materialized, but I do see a hydrated glow that wasn&#x27;t there before.</li>
            <li> I use this as my moisturizer, although it&#x27;s not really a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is officially done and my skin has a rough feel and texture to it.</li>
            <li> I was so upset and worried at the same time due to the little lines underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> I usually have really bad bags and dull looking skin, but I think that the Vitamin C has really boosted my skin giving me a more glowing appearance.</li>
            <li> but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little drop goes a long way</li>
            <li> I stopped using other products.  </li>
            <li> I like to use this product after my toner and before other serums.</li>
            <li> But regular use of this serum has reduced my uneven tone!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Vitamin C also helps revive other antioxidants like vitamin E, which helps skin retain its moisture.</li>
            <li> Be careful though!</li>
            <li> Works extremely well and is compatible with Lemon.</li>
            <li> I even applied just a little before applying my foundation because I have dry skin</li>
            <li> However, it does seem to do less moisturizing than other products I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> , I was a little skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days, I&#x27;m not sure what long-term effects or improvements it might have.</li>
            <li> I also used the serum around my eyes and noticed the dark circles under my eyes lightening up.</li>
            <li> This product helped with the dark circles under my eyes and sunspots on my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m showing signs of &amp;#34;loose skin&amp;#34; on the backs of my hands and fingers, and tiny age spots have been appearing lately.</li>
            <li> My skin feels moisturized and its removing my dark spots</li>
            <li> I have a problem with dark circles</li>
            <li> I feel like my circles are not quite as dark and that my skin is moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed the dark circles under my eyes getting lighter.</li>
            <li> Probably because I put it on my face neck and chest to try to get rid of dark spots.</li>
            <li> The serum also boosts of fighting sun damage and dark circles under eyes while benefiting skin tone and texture.    </li>
            <li> I am using it for my under eye dark ..uneven skin ..</li>
            <li> This vitamin c serum drop really works for those people with the scary dark circles around their eyes.</li>
            <li> and I notices those dark circle around my eyes was fading away</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dark spots---praying that it works.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a gift from a friend after hearing me complain about the dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum has helped my dark circles under my eyes..</li>
            <li> Until I received the opportunity to field-test this item for review purposes, I honestly never even knew that it had any benefits when it could be used externally.</li>
            <li> It helps with the production of collagen, over all tightens your skin and the dark sun spots.</li>
            <li> After using this just 4 times I noticed my dark circles under my eyes started to fade.</li>
            <li> before ordering how old and tired I looked.</li>
            <li> Does anyone else find it odd that all 100</li>
            <li> I had previously used a vitamin c cream</li>
            <li> then a typical serum</li>
            <li> my acne scars are less..</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is seriously the ultimate in skin care.</li>
            <li> What I found is that it&#x27;s not as oily as I previous thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Half</li>
            <li> but I am about half done</li>
            <li> My dark circles have started to look less noticeable and a couple Sun spots have lightened a little.  </li>
            <li> I saw a little improvement with my dark spots in my forehead portion and under my eye.</li>
            <li> Within a few days I could see my skin tone evening out and dark spots were noticeably lighter.</li>
            <li> You do feel a slight tingle upon application, which makes you feel like it is working, but I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> wrinkle areas like 11&#x27;s and crow&#x27;s feet - just put a little on your fingers and tap it on those wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I kept it away from my eyes but as the day went on, my eyes stung a little.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because the picture with 3 bottles was a little misleading.</li>
            <li> a little thicker on the side but with</li>
            <li> Little goes a long!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was a little thinner</li>
            <li> Once you apply of course it feels a little oily/wet.  </li>
            <li> I do see a difference in my skin a little lighter and the glow and refreshed looked is noticeable.</li>
            <li> that look dry and sad after wearing lipcolor for an entire day!</li>
            <li> The first bottle I received had an unpleasant odor to it (like an ashtray?)</li>
            <li> and I have not had any harsh side effects from this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few products that promise &amp;#34;anti</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few weeks and do notice improvement in both the texture and tone of my skin</li>
            <li> Stayed using this product a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel like it is heavy on my face.  </li>
            <li> I just put a few drops in my hands and rub it in</li>
            <li> I am a tester for Amazon products and have been given the opportunity by a product testing club to try quite a few vit C face serums and creams.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the dead of winter</li>
            <li> I have been using Vitamin C Serum for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I do see visible results after a few uses and the vitamin C brightens up my</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few day</li>
            <li> and he says that he feels a warmth for a few moments when he puts it around his eyes.</li>
            <li> Plus I had a few age spots I wanted to try it out on</li>
            <li> Just take few drops on your fingertips and apply on your face.</li>
            <li> My fingers were chapped because of the cold and now they are looking normal!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little to thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure if the serum is making a difference or not.</li>
            <li> It may work well, but I couldn&#x27;t get past the&lt;br /&gt;smell.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs almost instantaneously and you aren&#x27;t left with any residue or weird sticky feeling almost immediately after application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure I will order it again.  </li>
            <li> it out!!I&#x27;m 25 and its making the texture less bumpy taking away the wrinkles!!</li>

            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had a bad reaction</li>
            <li> it has the least strength</li>
            <li> but without the negative side affect of building up oil on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep trying for at least a month and see if there&#x27;s any difference</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;ll be forced to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it along with a derma roller for the past week and my skin is radiant!</li>
            <li> I have uneven skin tone!!</li>

            <li> i have oily skin so adding oil to it seems dumb</li>
            <li> Leaves no evidence behind.</li>
            <li> it spilled all in my travel bag, not happy at all with this.</li>
            <li> I do feel like it&#x27;s lightening some darker age spots, but I&#x27;ve broken out with cystic type acne in my cheek area.  </li>
            <li> This does not leave a greasy feeling behind when you use it.</li>

            <li> Very sad.</li>
            <li> It does have a bad smell for about a minute and then goes away.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have a difficult time with skin care products and my complexion. I have acne that acts up in phases, with no discernible triggers. Most skin care products either irritate my skin or do absolutely nothing. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this serum, as I had never tried one like it. Since I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days, I&#x27;m not sure what long-term effects or improvements it might have. So far, it feels nice and soothing, not greasy like I was expecting. I rarely wear makeup, but if I was going to, I wouldn&#x27;t use any kind of liquid base or concealer with this since it adds moisture to the skin on its own. That said, it isn&#x27;t sticky, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As part of a promotion, I was asked to give my honest opinion of this product. I did not have any negative effects from this serum, and I am very much in favor of using healthy natural ingredients in anything my skin absorbs (especially since I have so much trouble with it), so I expect this is healthy for my skin. I don&#x27;t see any noticeable difference externally; however, I will update if I do see changes over a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> Love this serum. It is light and absorb fast. My face looks soft and bright after using it. Great deal. Will recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this serum. I like the consistency. It went on smooth and didn&#x27;t take much to cover my face. I noticed right away a bit of tingling and then a tightening feeling. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to tell if it&#x27;s working but it has all the right ingredients to create good results. The bottle isn&#x27;t large but just a little seems to go a long way. I would recommend this to anyone looking for anti-aging.</li>
            <li> The serum itself is great, but the dropper leaks too much!!</li>
            <li> Vitamin c is great for the skin helps reduce aging and spots smells ok a nice size bottle and not too bad on skin</li>
            <li> I am noticing improvements in my complextion! I will buy this product again!</li>
            <li> This serum is simply amazing! I have been using it along with a derma roller for the past week and my skin is radiant! I have seen a significant reduction of fine lines and skin redness since I have been using this vitamin C serum. Vitamin C is a great alternative for looking young and reducing wrinkles without the need for cosmetic surgery. Vitamin C helps reproduce healthy looking skin whichout the need for unnatural facial treatments. I purchased this item using a one time promotional code, this review is written in my own words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is a white/orange and is thicker than what I expected it to be. It has a very light smell (which I personally do not like). The serum is packaged in a glass container which helps keep the serum fresh and toxin free. The ingredients of the serum are 98% natural and 70% organic. I apply the serum after washing my face in the morning and after using my derma roller for optimal results. The serum is very natural made with ingredients such as aloe, jojoba oil, hyaluronic acid and 20% vitamin C. My skin absorbes this serum very nicely and my face looks and feels younger and much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this serum for its natural and guaranteed results. I have only been using it for a week and I can already see the difference in my skin. My skin is more elastic, smoother and even old acne scars are less visable. I have purchased other Majestic Pure oils and they have always provided very high quality and very pure products. This serum is definitely a must buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure if the serum is making a difference or not. I&#x27;ll keep using it to find out.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. I love the way it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li> This vitamin C serum contains ferulic acid and some things I&#x27;ve noticed about serums that have ferulic acid are that they tend to be more watery than those without it and they smell kinda like bacon or hotdogs.  The good news is the smell doesn&#x27;t stick around after you apply it and the ferulic acid is one of the effective ingredients that fades dark spots.  But you have to be faithful in using it.  It took me 6 weeks to see results when I first started, and I recommend using it twice a day.  Another good thing is that this bottle will last you a couple of months, long enough to tell that it works before you commit to another bottle.  Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> The day it came I suddenly remembered I had a pedicure appt. and did not have time to get&lt;br /&gt;my &amp;#34;face on&amp;#34;. I just washed my face and put on the vitamin C serum and went... I noticed a&lt;br /&gt;faint tingle as I was driving the 15 mins there.About 20 minutes into the pedi, another nail tech&lt;br /&gt;that I hadn&#x27;t seen in a long time, came over and said &amp;#34;you have the prettiest skin&amp;#34;.I have NEVER&lt;br /&gt;had anyone compliment my complexion in my life. I am WAY OVER 40 and going through a lot&lt;br /&gt;of trauma  &amp; drama right now, which in fact was the reason I ordered this to try. I had noticed&lt;br /&gt;just before ordering how old and tired I looked. I could not wait to get home and look in the mirror!&lt;br /&gt;Imagine my surprise when that happened; I looked almost TEN years younger less than 2hrs&lt;br /&gt;of putting it on for the first time. I read the customer ratings,thinking not possible for me,but I&#x27;ll try it.&lt;br /&gt;OMG I&#x27;m SOOO glad I did. I,like the others said,will never be without it.</li>
            <li> Really like this! Absorbs into skin quickly and does not irritate my very sensitive skin. The short amount of time I have used it I notice a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the fountain of youth you found it in this bottle! I love the vitamin C serum and this is one of the best ones on the market. I love how it comes in a surenge drop form, making it easy to apply to my skin. I have noticed my skin looking brighter, younger and softer. The serum does not irritate my skin like others and great to use everyday. I have also applied this to my husband&#x27;s skin, he never took care of his skin and worked outside exposed the deep south sun. I have noticed a change in his skin, he looks more restful and softer. His coworkers are surprised to see a change to his face wanting his secret lol. I would recommend anyone and everyone looking to have that youthful skin again.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C has always been one of my go-to vitamins to take orally because of the many benefits including protection against immune system deficiencies, cardiovascular disease, eye disease, and even skin wrinkling. Now that I&#x27;ve tried Vitamin C as liquid serum (not be ingested) I have found that it works great at fighting premature aging and UV damage. Something I&#x27;m guilty of in my youth. After having used this particular Vitamin C serum I have noticed a considerable difference in the appearance of my skin. It look healthier &amp; more radiant and it feels like silk on a freshly washed face. I love it, I just massage into my skin and let the serum do the rest!</li>
            <li> Good...my wife said &amp;#34; it&#x27;s so good!!thank you&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;she felt comportable and good.</li>
            <li> This is clearly high quality stuff! Not only is this professional grade serum chock full of Vitamin C, but it also has Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin E, and Ferulic Acid. Talk about a nutritious snack for your skin! I love to put a couple of drops of this into my moisturizer, mix it in, and smooth it on to give my everyday skin care regimen that extra boost. It&#x27;s also great for problem wrinkle areas like 11&#x27;s and crow&#x27;s feet - just put a little on your fingers and tap it on those wrinkles. Your skin will perk up and feel hydrated, your tone will brighten, and your wrinkles will diminish. You have absolutely nothing to lose by giving this serum a try and everything to gain. I am so glad that I got an opportunity to try this serum and share my opinion on it!</li>
            <li> Does anyone else find it odd that all 100+ reviews of this product took place within a single month?  Just sayin&#x27;.....</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C serum I notices was thicker than expected but I noticed a difference of reduced lines and skin redness in my face when I applied it every night for a week. I also used the serum around my eyes and noticed the dark circles under my eyes lightening up.</li>
            <li> I love Majestic Pure essential oils so when I was given the opportunity to try this Vitamin C Serum for free in order to give my honest opinion&lt;br /&gt;I jumped at the chance.  I love using Vitamin c on my face. It helps with the fine lines and wrinkles around my mouth and eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any new serum I only use it one half of my face in order to see how it works.  I am afraid if I used it on all of my face I would  not be able to tell a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on the right side of my face for a week.  I stopped using other products.  Just cleaned it and applied the vitamin c.  I could tell a small difference on the right side of my face especially around my mouth.  The lines around my mouth that make me look like I am sad all the time seemed to be better.  I know I now need to put some one the left side so I look the same again.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I haven&#x27;t had a long time to test this out but so far this has made my skin softer and I was worried that I would break out around my nose because I have an oily T zone but nothing which make me really happy. So I will give another review after I have finished product Stay tuned</li>
            <li> I have suffered from under eye circles for pretty much my whole life. I am in my early 30’s and have started to notice some fine lines and wrinkles to add to my under eye circles! I was super excited to be able to try this product complimentary for testing purposes and  to share my honest and unbiased opinion with this product with you!. I love the fact that this Majestic Purse Vitamin C Serum is natural and organic and that it is made in the USA! The feel of this product is amazing when it hits your skin! It has no odor and I have not had any harsh side effects from this product. It does exactly what I wanted it to do which is make the dark circles under my eyes go away and reduce fine lines and wrinkles! This product comes with a 100% product satisfaction guarantee so go ahead and try it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Dark circles are something which has stayed with me for a long time. A friend recommended this Serum and within few days of use, I can see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> This is very nice. It came in a very cute box. Well packaged. The smell is better than other Vitamin C items out there. This is much nicer than other Vitamin C serums out there. I was applying straight vitamin C to my burn areas, any type of mark I want to heal with no/less scaring. This is perfect. It is more runny than a gel therefore covering without me having to touch the wound. I can also apply this nicely to my face and it rubs in smooth and dries quickly to help with wrinkles and fine lines. This feels very nice on. Kind of has a slight smell of a aloe type but not noticeable at all until I actually smelled from the bottle. Well done with this product. I highly recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product and after initial use my skin feels and look much better after only couple of weeks. My wife also tried it and she has the same experience. Skin looks much younger and fresh. I&#x27;ll definitely order it to use for future.</li>
            <li> Majestic Pure Vitamin C Serum - I bought this on a promo to tryout and review - Imhave become a huge fan of all natural skin care. I swear my skin is the best it&#x27;s ever been since I stopped using drug store products full of chemicals and who knows what. I wanted to try this 20% formula and I do see a brightening of my skin and Imhave find when I start thinking my skin looks dull this Vitamin C serum is the answer.</li>
            <li> This product helped with the dark circles under my eyes and sunspots on my face.  The anti wrinkle benefit is a bonus since I am started to get fine lines by my eyes.  The serum is lightweight, lightly scented, and absorbs well on my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few products that promise &amp;#34;anti aging&amp;#34; or anti wrinkle, and for the most part I&#x27;m not impressed by them.  This one is no exception. However, it does seem to do less moisturizing than other products I&#x27;ve tried.... conclusion: unimpressed.  I will keep trying the remainder of the bottle, and will update if I change my mind.</li>
            <li> love this on my skin!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of these vitamin c serums.  They all have had some quirks, some feel greasy, some have an odor.  This one is perfect!  No issues at all.  My face feels so smooth after using it.  I was lucky enough to get this with a coupon.  My face is breaking out less and just feels so much better and looks better</li>
            <li> I loved the serum. My face is really seeing the reults. I will be re purchasing more of this product. I did recieve this product as a review and I am so glad that I did. i love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few weeks and do notice improvement in both the texture and tone of my skin</li>
            <li> Very good oil for dry skin. Within a few days I could see my skin tone evening out and dark spots were noticeably lighter. You only need a little oil for your entire face so this product will last you forever! I applied it after washing my face in place of both my moisturizer and toner at night and it absorbed quickly and my skin didn&#x27;t feel greasy. I even applied just a little before applying my foundation because I have dry skin and it made my foundation apply really smootg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW. MY OPINIONS OF THIS PRODUCT ARE BASED ON MY OWN HONEST AND UNBIASED EXPERIENCE USING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I admit I enjoy having pretty jars of lotions and potions and tinctures lined up on my vanity table. It makes me feel like an old world movie star, surrounded by pampering and glitter. However, I only like to KEEP the products that actually work or show some benefit and I feel this Vitamin C Serum fits the bill perfectly. It goes on the skin light and non-greasy and absorbs quickly. It has a fragrance but it isn&#x27;t overpowering or unpleasant. I feel that applying it daily, especially in connection with your favorite cream, helps the elasticity and overall health and glow of your skin. They key, as with any beauty routine, is consistency!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received free products to help facilitate my review but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This has improved my skin tone, so I don&#x27;t have to powder  my face every day. it absorbed fairly fast, i also have noticed my frown brow lines have diminished. I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I love how this serum comes with a dropper form, making it easy to apply. This serum not only diminished those pesky fine lines around my eyes. I have noticed my skin looking brighter, younger and softer. The serum does not irritate my skin like others and great to use everyday. Even my husband uses it. Even though he always takes care of his skin,  this winter has been really hard on his hands and face. I have noticed a change in his skin, he looks hydrated and is softer. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> My skin looks more radiant and it gives me that glow</li>
            <li> Great serum for my skin. It has made my skin appear better and I will continue using it. Interested to see the results over time. I use it before applying my serums and moisturizer. Just be careful to not go near the eye area. I kept it away from my eyes but as the day went on, my eyes stung a little. I assume from concealer and such that moves around with the hot outdoors so now I don&#x27;t go anywhere near the eye area at all and I&#x27;ve not had a problem.</li>
            <li> A tiny bottle of BAM!  It seems to help quite a bit with the spots.</li>
            <li> Love the Vitamin C Serum! I use it daily on my hands and nails and have noticed a huge difference. My fingers were chapped because of the cold and now they are looking normal! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This serum is great!  I feel like my skin is glowing.  It is not too heavy and works wonderfully under moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It does not leave a sticky oil film on your face. Only a smooth silky serum that get&#x27;s absorbed  completely when it is well accepted and needed. Leaves no evidence behind. I am a repeat buyer. Once this hits your skin, you are a frequent user for life. I don&#x27;t care who you are, we all love our faces to feel this great.</li>
            <li> Every woman should have vitamin C in her beauty regimen and the Vitamin C Serum from Majestic Pure is a quality product that you can be sure will help you look younger and more healthy.  The bottle comes with a dropper for easy use.</li>
            <li> The product seems adequate just not quite as thick as some other serums I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is great for your skin. This is something I use daily so I was excited to get a bottle for a great price. I have tried a small amount on my cheek to make sure of no break outs. I have used it twice today and so far my very sensitive skin has had no reaction which is great for me and means this is a pretty good quality product. I&#x27;ll continue using on my cheek for a week to see the final results. this review was honest and given by a product I purchased</li>
            <li> This is another great Majestic Pure company top hit.  I love this Vitamin C Serum for its huge multitude of uses.  I think it was Dr Oz that said that vitamin C serums can drop a decade off your face.  I actually believe it.  My skin has both wrinkles and age spots.  In just the short time Ive been using it I have noticed the wrinkles gone and the age spots fading.  I LOVE THIS FORMULA.</li>
            <li> product for review: LOVE IT</li>
            <li> So far so good. Ive used his for 3 days and my skin feels so much tighter and my pores look more shallow immediately.  Ill be 30 in february and this is something my skin needs to stay youthful. I plan on ordering their rose hip oil too!</li>
            <li> I really do love this product ! I have been using this every night as part of my regimen and I can clearly see a difference in my skin in only a couple of days. I usually have really bad bags and dull looking skin, but I think that the Vitamin C has really boosted my skin giving me a more glowing appearance. I cannot wait to see the further results that I will have with this product !</li>
            <li> This was surprisingly amazing. It has vitamin C and aloe in it and the skin on my face started becoming smoother, softer and clearer within just a couple of days. I use a natural soap first, then I use this in place of my moisturizer. I live in the south where it&#x27;s humid so that works for me. 4 stars because the picture with 3 bottles was a little misleading. It only comes with one bottle.</li>
            <li> i love how the skin feels after i apply it, leves ur skin so soft and fresh  like baby and i also love that it has a very light sweet and clean smell like  orange soap</li>
            <li> It works like magic.. My skin is softer and  glowing since I started using it.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking better then ever.</li>
            <li> vitamin C is good for your skin i have begun using it daily and have already started to see a change. i have less bags or darkness under my eyes, it helps me to keep that youthful glow to my skin and keep me looking fresh and it helps from getting over dried out from all the makeup and cleaners i use on my face. this 1 oz bottle is enough for about 2 months so its a very good value.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this I did get a little redness to my face but I think I put too much on cause it&#x27;s a little to thick. After that I didn&#x27;t put much on and it worked better no redness or reaction. Made my face feel better and smoother. It did take some of my blemishes away so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good but definitely not a serum</li>
            <li> I have tried many different kinds of vitamin c serums and they all did ok with my skin. Some were really greasy so I don&#x27;t think they were quality products. Well I was offered this Vitamin C Serum from Majestic Pure for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a bottle because I like the products from Majestic Pure. It arrived and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and I don&#x27;t have any breakouts or even a greasy feeling to it. I have noticed that my big wrinkles on my forehead are slightly less defined. I definitely recommend this Vitamin C Serum from Majestic Pure for anyone who is looking for a great C Serum.</li>
            <li> This makes my face feel awesome!  I really love this stuff. It has a weird texture coming out of the bottle but it still works.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the serum feels like a water down milky white liquid. I was expecting more of silky/semi-tacky texture like most serum w/Vit C. After putting the serum on cleaned skin, it had made no difference in the texture of the skin nor did it moisturize the skin. This product was sent back.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed testing out this vitamin c. It leaves my face very pretty and gives it an instant glow. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent, it&#x27;s not oily, absorbs very well into the skin, and hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out. I did receive it to review.</li>
            <li> Great product. Reasonable price. After first couple days, my skin feels firmer and tighter. I am going to keep using this product.</li>
            <li> Stayed using this product a few days ago.  It works good. I noticed my skin felt taunt which was good.  The smell was mild . Not bag for the price.</li>
            <li> Was chosen to be an amazon reviewer. i was given this item at a low cost to give my honest opinion. My wife has been using this serum for a few weeks now and I am very pleased with the results as of now.  She uses the serum every day and it makesher skin feel so good and also feels very firm. She truly loves it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. I already notice a slight difference and its only been a week. Great quality product. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This product is great helped with brightening my face as well as lightening up dark spots I would definitely recommend. I&#x27;ve only been using this for about 3weeks and I see major improvements!</li>
            <li> I love using products as natural as possible on my skin. This ingredients seem to stray away fro toxins. I&#x27;m getting this particular one for my mother. I will write an updated review after she has used it some. Good amount for a good price.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s good for lips and hands, too! This is an easy FIVE STARS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After opting for same-day shipping and receiving it on Thursday, 08/20/2015 - because at 53, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this serum - and after using it twice a day (morning &amp; evening after washing my face) for only six days, I already see noticeable improvement. I already noticed a difference on the very first day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday, 08/26/2015:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FACE: After washing my face and applying Majestic Pure Vit. C Serum that first night, my skin tightened up and is already smoother. I always apply night cream (Aveeno) and do it now *after* gently massaging in the Majestic serum. Now, six days later, my complexion is glowing as it&#x27;s never glowed before; age/sun spots are rapidly fading, pores are shrinking considerably, and skin keeps on tightening. I mean, what little fine lines I&#x27;ve had (and can only be seen when wearing foundation) they&#x27;re all but gone, leaving my skin smooth and full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LIPS: I use pinkie finger to apply a couple of drops of serum on my lips when I do my face, (I have full lips that are showing lines since they&#x27;re losing their elasticity - something you can see after a full day of wearing lipcolor). They&#x27;ve puffed up and they&#x27;re getting that old pink color back, and I don&#x27;t have those &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34; that look dry and sad after wearing lipcolor for an entire day! Lips are fuller, softer, smoother. At night, after I&#x27;ve applied the Serum, I follow that up with a tiny lick of Nivea lip butter (or you can use vaseline - but always use pinkie finger! it has the least strength so you&#x27;ll never overdo it) to trap in the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HANDS: Excellent for aging hands as well! I&#x27;m showing signs of &amp;#34;loose skin&amp;#34; on the backs of my hands and fingers, and tiny age spots have been appearing lately. These age spots are already fading and the skin on the backs of my hands are tightening up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suffice it to say, I can&#x27;t wait until I&#x27;ve used this serum for the recommended thirty days. Now that I&#x27;ve used this Serum for six days, I&#x27;ll make images of the skin of my face, lips, and hands tomorrow and then again in three weeks to see the difference. I will post them after the thirty days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep updating my progress. I&#x27;m more than satisfied with the results only after six days - something NO expensive creams have ever been able to provide. I&#x27;m happily surprised at how youthful my skin has become when I took a picture of my face with my iphone - and this is only after six days of use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next update: September 17/2015or the recommended thirty days. Now that I&#x27;ve used this Serum for six days, I&#x27;ll make images of the skin of my face, lips, and hands tomorrow and then again in three weeks to see the difference.

            <li> I am on my mid 40&#x27;s sliding into 50, so my skin regimen is very important to me. Even though I do use moisturizers and eye creams, I&#x27;ve been researching on vitamin c and hyaluronic acid, after careful reading of reviews and a special offer to buy this serum at a great deal to share my opinion I chose to do it. This serum is not too runny and you only need a couple or few drops to cover your whole face. Comes with a dropper so there is no waste here. I did notice after just a couple of weeks that my finest wrinkles around my eyes and lip are diminishing. Also a noticeable reduction of puffiness under my eyes. Small note that it comes with a plastic seal that it is important to me. I am very pleased wit this serum and do recommend it!</li>
            <li> Feels and reacts like water.</li>
            <li> I buy a ton of products from this company. They are always at a decent price and with good ingredients. This product is good, but not my favorite. I use Vitamin C serum in the morning after my shower. I found that this one left my skin feeling a bit dry compared to other brands that I have used. I also use hyaluronic acid at night so I thought that the dryness was possibly from that. I stopped using the the hyaluronic acid and my skin still feels a bit dry so it may be this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> Received this product to test &amp; review.  I do not know the manufacturer or merchant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love it.  I use it on my face at night and in the morning (prior to putting on my makeup).  There really is no scent to it (which I like), it&#x27;s light and I don&#x27;t feel like it is heavy on my face.  I do feel like it brightens my face and it keeps my face feeling soft all day (not oily at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Starts without a doubt...Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like to use this product after my toner and before other serums. It leaves my skin feeling nice and smooth and so far it hasnt made me break out</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell, the texture and I don&#x27;t think is just Vitamin C</li>
            <li> Very effective serum . first tried this serum wondering how it works , worried about its price. As soon as I put it on my face I knew i has change. It makes your skin feels fair soft and instantly brighten my complexion. I purchase this under promotional item with my Honest review opinion.</li>
            <li> I love my Vitamin C! My skin feels moisturized and its removing my dark spots</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptic when in comes to using something on my face but this one really stands out. a little thicker on the side but with just 2 drops will really cover the entire face and no sticky feeling, no foul smell. I saw a little improvement with my dark spots in my forehead portion and under my eye. Works wonder. I&#x27;m loving this on. Definitely will buy more once this bottle goes almost empty. Very lucky to get this one under promotional value.</li>
            <li> Great product. Most people don&#x27;t associate a topical Vitamin C product with good health, but if you want to look good on the outside, get rid of blemishes and wrinkles daily use of this high quality product is recommended.  As I always say t men , don&#x27;t be ashamed to use products like this, looking young and healthy can give you a competitive edge in business and in your personal life.  I received this as a promotion but still stnad by its quality and effectiveness.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend had me try this and I have to say, as a man, I was a little skeptical at first. However, after using it daily for the past two weeks, I have been pleasantly surprised to see a huge improvement in the overall look and feel of my skin. I will definitely be using this product on a regular basis and buying a bottle of my own when the time comes. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> This serum goes a long way and makes my skin feel great.  I just put a few drops in my hands and rub it in and my face looks nice and bright!</li>
            <li> I have uneven skin tone!! But regular use of this serum has reduced my uneven tone! It make skin smooth, radiant, glowing!! Very light observe quick! Little goes a long!&lt;br /&gt;I got this serum at special price to review but opinion is my own!!</li>
            <li> Really like the Vitamin C Serum...not greasy, easily absorbed..too early to tell if it&#x27;s going to do some good for my skin, but I feel like it will!! thank you....</li>
            <li> This vitamin c serum has already made my face feel smoother after using it I&#x27;m sure it will help with aging over time it may take a week or so to get results so I&#x27;ll update my review after using it for longer like giving my review right away but so far compared to other products it is smoother and makes your face glow I&#x27;m in love already can&#x27;t wait to show mire results with before and after pictures keep watching I&#x27;ll update</li>
            <li> I have used vitamin c oil for several years and it is a huge help. This bottle is a lot bigger than what I expected and it was packaged nice when I received it in the mail. I have used several different brands but this is going to be one of my new favorites</li>
            <li> I ordered this Vitamin C Serum for a close friend. She has some sun damage that she&#x27;s been really concerned about and had been wanting to add a Vitamin C Serum to her skin care routine. Even after just a week of use, she is noticing a difference in her skin. It feels a lot softer and she really just looks healthier in general, like she&#x27;s got a natural glow that wasn&#x27;t there before. I definitely recommend this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Worked wonders for my face.  Seems to have brighten up my tone and clear up my face.</li>
            <li> I was excited to be able to get this as a promotional offer and trying this product was such a good thing for me. I have been noticing that my skin has been starting to have fine lines. It has been a sad day to see these. I know I am getting older and to do something about it, so I thought to try this Vitamin C Serum. I just dabbed and rubbed it in. My skin felt smooth and soft. Looking forward to looking in the mirror again.. thank you so much for opportunity</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 weeks and I have seen a reduction in my wrinkles and improved clarity in my skin. Friends and family have commented that my skin looks fresher and more supple. I would highly recommend this Vitamin C product. I have bought some other Vitamin C brands that had cost a lot more, and I can honestly say this one works just as well. Better value overall. I will definitely be ordering more of this product once it has run out.</li>
            <li> Once again... I&#x27;m amazed. My skin drank this serum up. Face is smooth and supple. Amazing stuff</li>

I love applying in the AM/PM after I wash my face and before I apply my moisturizer and SPF</li>
            <li> DISCLAIMER: FEEE OR DISCOUNTED PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I USUSALLY DO NOT PUCHASE ANYTHING FOR MY FACE BECAUSE I MAKE MY OWN PRODUCTS, BUT THIS IS TO DIE FOR!&lt;br /&gt;I JUST WASHED MY FACE AND APPLIED THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME. MY FACE FEELS SO SUPPLE. THIS IS A PRODUCT I WILL DEFINATELY PURCHASE AGAIN</li>
            <li> The lid does not stay on,  it spilled all in my travel bag, not happy at all with this. i had almost a full jar. Other than that I liked the product.</li>
            <li> I do love it thank you</li>
            <li> So far my wife loves it. I may have to order another one. Have to see what she say.</li>
            <li> The serum is ok, absorb easily still waiting for dramatic result after a month.... Hope to see results soon. By the way, is the color of the solution suppose to be clear like water?</li>
            <li> I recently reviewed another version of this vit C serum and had the same results. Other than the moisturizing qualities of jojoba that the other version had, I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference. Both products reduce wrinkles well. This product is watery and sinks in easily. I was able to apply my makeup right after with no problems. The skin lightening promised never really materialized, but I do see a hydrated glow that wasn&#x27;t there before. It also has a high content of aloe that has helped heal little blemishes on my skin. I am a tester for Amazon products and have been given the opportunity by a product testing club to try quite a few vit C face serums and creams. I am not paid in any way, but I do receive the products for free or for a reduced price. I have targeted different problem areas on my skin for the different products to get a fair assessment of each formula. The results I post are results specific to this product.</li>
            <li> This is a review of Majestic Pure Vitamin C Serum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum has its own dropper already in it which is great you don’t have to worry about losing it.  The serum is a bit watery, it’s clear, and I detected a small smell but I couldn’t identify it.  It’s easy to use you take a small amount of it and apply it to your face.  I tried to hit specifically under my eyes with a little more since I tend to have bags.  While it was on, I felt a tightening in my face. The serum dried rather quickly. I applied moisturizer to wear throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, I could tell that my face had brightened somewhat.  It seemed like my age spots had faded just a tad.  And my dark bags weren’t as bad.  Each day it seemed to get better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can’t wait to see what it will be like after the entire month.  I’m very happy with it right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this product in exchanged for an unbiased and truthful review.  This is 100% my thoughts.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on a scar and it seems to be making my scar lighter. I haven&#x27;t used it on my face yet though. It soaks in fast. It does have a bad smell for about a minute and then goes away.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product consistently for a few weeks and my skin looks amazing!  Brighter complexion, fine lines are gone and an overall healthy look. I will definitely keep using this and I&#x27;m going to order for my mother as well.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping! Great product, my skin looks fantastic!</li>
            <li> I loved this! And it smells so good too! I recently had my baby really sick. I had a lot of sleepless nights. I had previously used a vitamin c cream but I ended up with acne. I started using this after sleepless night. It felt so light and refreshing on my face. It has not given me any acne but it has been refreshing and gives all the benefits of the vitamin c cream I used before, but without the negative side affect of building up oil on my skin. How ironic 😊 Like I said, loved it. Would buy it again and recommend it 😉</li>
            <li> Beauty in a bottle!!  I was glad to add this to my skin care regimen.  It has several great ingredients other than Vitamin C.  It also has Hyaluronic acid, Ferulic acid along with Aloe, Amino blend and jojoba oil.  I have fine lines on my face that I do not want to get any worse and I have been able to use this serum to help give my face that youthful glow again.  The best part is if you are not satisfied with the product then you can return it for a refund!!  What is not to love about that?!? Many people get amazing results because of the quality ingredients in this serum.  Majestic Pure has an entire line of trustworthy products that I have tried and love just as much as this one!!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  *received for testing and review.</li>
            <li> I adore this product! This does what serums are suppose to do! For me it has tighten and made my face a lot more radiant and youthful which is a huge plus and one of the reasons why I love serums. The product arrived quickly and safely to my house! It actually arrived before the expected date. I totally recommend this product considering the price and what it does to my face!</li>
            <li> Not only do I love this, it came so fast in the mail!!! Immediate results.I will continue to buy this for years to come!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! This was my first time trying a vitamin c serum and I have to say it has exceeded my expectations. I have already noticed a beautiful change on my face. It also leaves you with a radiant glow. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This vitamin C serum has helped my skin so far to look really healthy, smooth and even toned.  I have naturally oily skin and I break out a lot.  I have to use a good cleanser twice a day, tone at least twice, exfoliate two or three times a week, and use a mask weekly to keep my skin in good shape.  This serum is light enough to wear without feeling oily or too moisturized.  I use this as my moisturizer, although it&#x27;s not really a moisturizer.  The instructions even say to apply this BEFORE your regular moisturizer, but I cannot use anything else on my face or else I will break out.  So I put this on after my toner and it absorbs nicely into my skin.  It feels good going on - it doesn&#x27;t really feel like anything - more like water really.  It has a light citrus scent and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  Here are some before and after photos of my skin while I was using this (and a few other new products) on my skin :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading my review!</li>
            <li> I really hoped this would give positive results, given the other reviews- it smelled so bad, however, that I could not force myself to use it for more than a week.  I am not sensitive to smells, it just was So bad.  Very sad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for about three weeks.  This product smells a little funny to me even though it&#x27;s within it&#x27;s expiration date.  I do feel like it&#x27;s lightening some darker age spots, but I&#x27;ve broken out with cystic type acne in my cheek area.  I didn&#x27;t break out this much in high school at one time!  Maybe it&#x27;s just purging my skin....I just hope it stops soon or I&#x27;ll be forced to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I actually gave this to my sister. She is looking great it was noticeable after 3 days. Now she is looking so much better, her skin is moist and wrinkles that she was getting have began to deminage. I highly recommend this product. My Mom asked me if I can give her a bottle for her birthday, but I am not going to wait to send her a bottle. The good thing about Amazon is easy to send your loved ones a gift</li>
            <li> I’m 31, so I’m becoming more and more concerned with my skin as my first wrinkles are starting to appear. This is why it’s very important for me to use exceptional quality products for my facial care. I know it’ll happen, but I would like to postpone it for as long as I can! This Vitamin C Serum feels very good on my skin and you don’t need a lot of it for 1 application. It has a nice consistency and doesn’t have a strong smell. In fact, the smell is mild and very neutral. I will keep on using it and I have every reason to believe that this serum will help me a lot. I received a sample of this product for testing and reviewing purposes and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mother and once I started seeing the results I also started to use it. it has reduced the darkness below my eyes. A very good natural alternative to the harsh chemicals on the market with actual results you will notice.</li>
            <li> This is the best little serum I have tried.  It was a little thinner then a typical serum but it is great.  It makes my skin so soft and although I have not been using this for very long yet (about a week) I am noticing differences in my skin already. My dark circles have started to look less noticeable and a couple Sun spots have lightened a little.  My skin has not felt this good in a long time.  I am happy that I got this as part of a promotion so that I could review it.  It was so worth it and I would recommend this to everyone young (preventive) and old (renewed).</li>
            <li> Very light, little to no scent and does not feel oily.  I have a problem with dark circles and I was excited to try out anything that might help.  I feel like my circles are not quite as dark and that my skin is moisturized.  No eye irritation, either.  That&#x27;s a big problem for me as I am allergic to everything.  Would highly recommend for anyone else dealing with dark circles or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is touted as a natural anti-aging solution. It works by healing sun damage, helps skin repair itself by increasing collagen production ( which gives skin its elasticity), and reduces free radicals by neutralizing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C also helps revive other antioxidants like vitamin E, which helps skin retain its moisture. Together they have a synergistic effect on the skin and reversing damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Majestic Pure Vitamin C Serum and Hyaluronic Acid for 2 weeks. I apply to my face, concentrating on my eyes, neck, and cleavage, coupling it with vitamin E, and then moisturizing with jojoba oil or argan oil. The skin of my face feels firmer and plumper and softer. There is an overall smoother texture to my skin. I&#x27;ve also noticed the dark circles under my eyes getting lighter. I&#x27;ll keep using it in the hopes of more results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no negative side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C oxidizes easily so this comes in a dark amber bottle. The dropper makes using the right amount simple. The serum has a light herbal smell due to the organic herbal infusion in the serum.</li>
            <li> Good serum.. my acne scars are less..</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve used a whole bottle and haven&#x27;t seen any results yet. That being said I used the entire bottle within 10 days. Probably because I put it on my face neck and chest to try to get rid of dark spots. I ordered two more bottles because it looks like the price has been lowered to $12.50. I&#x27;m going to keep trying for at least a month and see if there&#x27;s any difference then I&#x27;ll write another review.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I instantly notice a difference with my wrinkles &amp; pores. For the price it seems to be the best I&#x27;ve tried. Be careful though! I used it too often &amp; it irritated my sensitive skin a bit.</li>
            <li> Was chosen to be an amazon reviewer. i was given this item at a low cost to give my honest opinion. i love vitamin c for my face. its a great pick me up in the morning adds enough moisture but doesnt make me oily. i have oily skin so adding oil to it seems dumb but this was amazing .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that great but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I was able to purchases this product at a promotional price.  I am getting to the age where I wished I would have taken care of my skin when I was younger.  The age you know that sun spots and wrinkles start jumping out every time you look in the mirror. I liked the fact the Vitamin C Serum came with a dropper making it easy to you.  I wear make up so I applied in the morning before make up and at night after removing my make up.  The directions clearly states that you need to use it for 30 days to really see the results.  It&#x27;s affordable and I like being able to do something for myself.  I will continue to use and hopefully prevent any future damage.  This is my experience and not reflected by anyone else.  Once you apply of course it feels a little oily/wet.  After rubbing in with my finger tip, it then felt like a moisturizer.  It didn&#x27;t really have too much of scent so after you rub it in you can forget about it.</li>
            <li> I love to try new beauty products and I love to try and keep ahead of the aging process! I received this serum as a sample for review and evaluation and I really love using it. Sometimes I use it alone and others I use it under my regular moisturizer. I have combination skin and the serum absorbs completely and quickly. It doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor and it has not caused any irritation. I can tell that it is helping to soften some of my line but I more so notice how refreshed and healthy I look overall. It&#x27;s the dead of winter and I struggle to achieve that look right now but this has helped. Overall I am very pleased and I really like using this.</li>
            <li> My skin has dry patches that take some heavy duty moisturizing to smooth out.  I am now officially obsessed with Vitamin C Serum.  I have been using Vitamin C Serum for a few weeks and I&#x27;ve seen a remarkable change in my skin.  It is overall more smooth and appears brighter than in the past.  I mix it in with my daily moisturizer 2 times a day.  Gives my skin a major boost! I highly recommend this product.  I was given the opportunity to try and give my honest opinion on this product.</li>
            <li> Silky serum. It helps with spots, etc. worth a try!</li>
            <li> I am very particular about my skin so initially I was hesitant about this product. I have used a vitamin C serum before that was much more expensive than this brand. I must say I&#x27;m impressed. I love that it&#x27;s all natural and contains vitamin e and aloe. It&#x27;s not too think but a little goes a long way. It has a very mild scent that fades immediately when put on the face. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day and I love it. I will definitely be ordering this again and keeping it in my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> So far, I really think its gonna be great. I have only been using it 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I used Vitamin oil in my baths, lotions, and on my cuticles. I think the best way to get oil in the skin is to add a little to my bath water and take a long soak. This way I don&#x27;t have to do so much massaging. I notice my skin is much softer when I add the oil to my bath water. When I take a shower before I dry off I just use the oil like lotion on my body. Then I dry off. A dropper come with the oil, nice because it comes in handy for dispensing just a couple of drops at a time. So far it has help remove and reduce the appearance of fine lines and age spots.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is seriously the ultimate in skin care. I love that they don&#x27;t test on animals and it is made right here in the US. It is a great combo of Vitamin C, Hyraluronic Acid and Vitamin E. I used to use each one seperat and now I don&#x27;t have too! I had a chance to get this for a promotional price and Im glad I decided to try it. I will be a repeat customer for sure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month since I have used this product, during that time I have experienced dry and tightness, slight burning on my face. My skin broke out. It looked like a horrible rash, it has cleared up, but now I am experienceing peeling of the skin. The bottle is officially done and my skin has a rough feel and texture to it. I wil not be purchaging this product again.</li>
            <li> Wow I love it , it smoothes out your skin, so its great if your going out.&lt;br /&gt;After I apply it I put a base sealer , then my makup and it looks wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;  I hope it does fade the sun spots in time.  We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I love this! My fine lines are diminishing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Vitamin C serum twice daily for the past few weeks, and I can honestly say that I am starting to see a difference! My pores seem less noticeable, my skin color seems more even, and some smaller wrinkles seem to have disappeared! I have been putting a few drops in my palm with a few drops of my olay moisturizer because using it straight was a bit drying for my skin. I will continue to use the product. I just celebrated my 53 birthday so any product that works, I will gladly endorse!</li>
            <li> Great product . I have recommended the serum to my friends it leaves your skin soft like renewed skin. I have also noticed that my deepest wrinkles look more relaxed.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is jit good all around. Can&#x27;t go wrong with it. Using for my face and neck. Can&#x27;t wait to see the glow and moisture this is going to being.&lt;br /&gt;Got this during a trial period and this review is of my own.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS MORNING AND NIGHT UNDER MY REGULAR MOISTURIZER.  IT SOAKS IN QUICKLY AND MY FINE LINES AND WRINKLES ARE DISAPPEARING.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;I am in the sun A LOT and I worry about damage. I have been using the Vitamin C Serum for a short period of time, and already see results!&lt;br /&gt;With quality ingredients like :  Contains Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin E and Ferulic Acid. Best Anti Aging Face Serum Moisturizer with Natural Ingredients Including Organic Aloe, Amino Blend and Jojoba Oil how can you go wrong???</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as described. I have only used it a few times but so far product seems to be great quality.</li>
            <li> On a clean and dry face, I apply in a circular motion, all over my face and neck, no more than a tune full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not odor less but has a nice natural&lt;br /&gt;Scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs well into the skin and quite easy to rub in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always on the look out for beauty trends, anything to help me look my best and I&#x27;m happy this product has anti- aging components.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just started using the product and I am hoping for great results</li>
            <li> The vitamin C in great, it keeps my skin fresh and healthy.  I love that this product is not too oily because it does not leave my skin with that greasy feeling.  A few drops is all I need to cover a large area and my skin feels great all day.  highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Used this product after a chemical peel and I swear my skin healed days faster than normal. Has helped to smooth the appearance of the aging look of my hands and fingers also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great ! My face literally drinks it up!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it makes my skin feel so amazing and it&#x27;s smoothing it out!!I&#x27;m 25 and its making the texture less bumpy taking away the wrinkles!!</li>
            <li> Its okay. Nothing really noticeable happened when using it.</li>
            <li> This serum helped a lot to take away the dry skin especially in my face. It will give you a much better result if you apply it twice a day after washing the face. Leave it in your face for a moment before putting any moisturizer. This is a good choice for a serum and must be included in your beauty regimen. Love it</li>
            <li> It works perfectly to my sensitive skin. No feeling of irritation and the smell is not bad.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that this vitamin c serum saved my eyes from severe dark circles during my time with the dreadful flu. I have stubborn sensitive skin and sensitive smell which in the case of beauty products is always a scary thing. The smell was neither unpleasant nor offending in any way and the best thing my face had no bad reactions. No breakout, no clogged pores, no greasy residue. This claims to help with fine lines and wrinkles which are not a major problem for me but anything I can add to my beauty routine to prevent those is an added benefit for me as well this acts as a great moisturizer under my makeup in the morning. I would say all in all this is one of the best Vitamin C serums I have tried.</li>
            <li> This serum has some good ingredients, besides being 20% Vitamin C, it also contains Vitamin E, Organic Aloe, and Jojoba Oil. Majestic Pure promotes this product as an anti-aging wrinkle serum and even though I can easily pass as a late teen/early twenty-something I just turned 29, so wrinkles and signs of aging are definitely on my radar. I believe in being proactive instead of reactive so I&#x27;m preserving my pretty before it starts to age. The serum also boosts of fighting sun damage and dark circles under eyes while benefiting skin tone and texture.    I have been using this product twice daily as a moisturizer. I apply after my toner and spot treatment for any breakouts, if I&#x27;m having any. What I found is that it&#x27;s not as oily as I previous thought it would be. It easily spreads onto your skin but dries completely matte, which as an oily girl I LOVE. It is a great base under makeup as well. I&#x27;ve been using it consistently and have noticed brighter, better looking skin. The other day I went out with makeup and realized my bare skin was looking almost as good as it does when I wear BB cream. Of course it&#x27;s not perfect, I still have marks and acne scars but it&#x27;s no where as visible as before. I look forward to watching my skin improve over the use of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several products from MAJESTIC PURE so I knew I was going to get a great product.  This is my second purchase of Vitamin C serum with Hyaluronic Acid. The first product I used was an eye serum. This one I have been using on my face and neck. It absorbs quickly, and leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft. I use my regular daily moisturizer over this serum.    I have found that my skin has never looked better with  out make up. I have mild Rosacea, and while it is certainly not cured I do not feel like Raggedy Ann, either.  My face has a more even tone than when I was using moisturizer alone. I think the combination of Vitamin C serum + moisturizer is a winning combination.  I live in the Northeast; the winter and winds have been brutal. With this double defense, I feel as though my skin is well protected and it has never looked better.     Majestic Pure has always provided a top quality product, and this one did not disappoint .I was given the opportunity to test and try this product. I was so glad I did; I don&#x27;t think I will ever be without this serum in my medicine chest. Highly recommend this product based on quality and performance.</li>
            <li> I am using it for my under eye dark ..uneven skin ..it&#x27;s safe .its smooth...results coming..with patience.never knew something could fix that..hopefully if I stick to this ultimate serum I can get an even skin tone by applying it to my acne spots too...apply with instructions...definetlyneither useful</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t notice much difference yet, but it does leave a soothing and refreshing feeling which is plenty worth it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for 2 weeks now and I like it so far. I have been using it at night after washing all my make up away and honestly, my face feels a lot softer. Vit. C is truly good for our skin. This serum has a good consistency and does not have funky or perfume-y smell. A little drop goes a long way but I like putting a little bit more on my face and neck.  So far I haven&#x27;t had a bad reaction so I am very happy about that. No redness or itchiness. I will definitely keep on using this serum until I run out and hopefully it will also help with my sun spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a promotional price for the purpose of testing and reviewing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item based on high ratings with Amazon.  The first bottle I received had an unpleasant odor to it (like an ashtray?), so I exchanged it for another bottle, which had the same odor.  The odor stayed on my skin for more than 15 minutes.  It may work well, but I couldn&#x27;t get past the&lt;br /&gt;smell.  I sent the second bottle back also.</li>

            <li> Been using this for a couple weeks now. So far, not much change, but I just read that its great for under-eye bags, so I am going to try that.</li>
            <li> My skin feels dry after not sure that is normal.</li>
            <li> I have tried several Vitamin C Serums in the last few weeks due to some review for product options I&#x27;ve been given. I have learned a lot about what I like and what I hate in a Vitamin C Serum and I wanted to share some of that here since the Majestic Pure brand is now the only one I will buy at full price. Here&#x27;s what is so great about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s Majestic Pure! There products are seriously the best I have tried in years. I will not go to any other essential oil after using theirs. Totally worth it. If you want to know more about why, visit my other reviews on any of the Majestic Pure products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The dropper. I can&#x27;t say enough about the fact that this company gets those of us that use essential oils for lotions and in our daily lifestyle. The high-quality dropper is not only perfect for their other oils, but for this serum it is a must have. I can&#x27;t stand the pumps because you spend half the time just trying to get the right amount out of the pump and not air or bubbles. The dropper makes it easy to dispense what you need and get it every single time. So, yeah that&#x27;s a huge plus especially if you are using this as a full face or large area serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) There is no scent to this and no sticky residue. It goes on easily, dries within seconds, and there is no sticky feeling left. Perfect if you are using it before bed or first thing in the morning and you need to add moisturizer or makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) It&#x27;s in a glass bottle. When they say 4 ounces they mean it. So you are getting what you pay for instead of paying for a bunch of plastic housing that isn&#x27;t marked as BPA-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a great serum that is going to get the job done and be worth the price then this is it.</li>
            <li> I am new to the Majestic Pure product line but I am already very impressed.  This vitamin C serum has a very light fragrance, is fast absorbing and literally leaves my skin feeling silky smooth.  A little bit goes a long way which is another plus for such a high quality serum.</li>
            <li> I have kind of been delving into trying a few Vitamin C serums as of late. So, I was excited to try this serum. What I personally find most appealing about this particular serum is how light it is. It absorbs almost instantaneously and you aren&#x27;t left with any residue or weird sticky feeling almost immediately after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another huge perk for me was the fact that along with the quick absorption, your skin is left feeling quite a bit softer right upon application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I don&#x27;t find this to be particularly strong enough for my incredibly winter damaged skin (I spend a lot of time out in the elements)- I&#x27;m definitely holding on to this for summer. It is the perfect light, cooling Vitamin C serum for hot muggy days and definitely won&#x27;t bog you down.</li>
            <li> Great Product and service!!!</li>
            <li> The serum is of great quality and super gentle. I like it that it is mostly natural ingredients and the serum is really easy to absorb. I do see visible results after a few uses and the vitamin C brightens up my face.&lt;br /&gt;The product was well packed and in its retail packaging when arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I have purchased this product with an introductory discount. My review is honest and unbiased.</li>
            <li> This vitamin c serum drop really works for those people with the scary dark circles around their eyes. I have been using this for a few day and I notices those dark circle around my eyes was fading away and it does not dry my skin. It is also very easy to use by placing a few drops on your finger tip and rub it where you want on you rub in a circle. It does not cause any inflammation or any burning sensation on your face. I really liked how well it covers all those wrinkles I have on my face. It make my face feel smooth, clean and refreshed. You wont have to feel embarrassed about hiding your eyes by wearing sunglasses in public. Give these a try, you have nothing to lose!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dark spots---praying that it works.</li>
            <li> noticed no discernable effects good or bad - like using nothing wont buy again</li>
            <li> I received this vitamin C serum for a consumer review and I really love it. I always mention when a product is made here in the USA because I think it is great to support companies that keep our jobs at home. This is a product proudly made in the USA.  For the best results you need to use the serum twice daily for about a month, we have been using it only for a couple of days, but we can already see it working. We have what I consider normal, age appropriate signs of growing older. My husband has deep worry lines though, he is the stresser in our family. Always worried about something. We are always interested in finding a product to slow the signs of aging on our face and it is even better when we can find a product that helps to reverse those signs! This does both! My husband has very sensitive skin and he says that he feels a warmth for a few moments when he puts it around his eyes. I use the same amount as he does and I do not feel any warmth. This may be because of how sensitive his skin is, so people with very sensitive skin may notice this too. It is not uncomfortable to him, and he says it only last momentarily. The serum does not leave your face feeling greasy or sticky. After the first couple of applications your skin will feel softer and look better. I will comment on this review after using the product for 30 days to tell you how we look and what effect it has had on our skin with longer, consistent use. In the mean time, I suggest that you try this serum yourself. It is backed with a 100% money back guarantee so if you dont think it works for you or doesnt work as well as you like you can have the peace of mind knowing that you can get your money back.</li>
            <li> After three days I can feel the difference in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> &amp;#62;Love this! Works great with my derma roller!</li>
            <li> I was thrilled with the vitamin C serum  from the first time I used it. The Vitamin C serum absorbed in my skin very rapidly and evenly. It left my face feeling clean and refreshed. It did not leave a greasy or slimy feeling to my skin at all. My skin had a refreshed feeling to it after the first time in used it and it feels better and better every time. Product was purchased for the intent of review. Overall I am very happy with the way this product has made my skin feel and I have no doubt that after a couple weeks my skin will have a very noticeable and smoother look to it.</li>
            <li> The dropper gives just the right amount of serum for my entire face. It applies and absorbs fast. I wore it under makeup and I think it acted a bit as a primer. Loving it so far.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Having seen &amp;#34;experts on TV shopping channels&amp;#34; tout Vitamin C Serum, I knew I wanted to try it.  After just a few days I felt the texture of my skin was better.  I felt more hydrated and the area under my eyes seemed lighter. Vitamin C Serum has all the benefits it says it does. I believe the benefits of this product make it a must for anyone fighting to keep their age off their face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned the following from DermReview.com:&lt;br /&gt;Dampen your face with water and start by applying the serum to your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;Let it dry for some time and then apply a moisturizer, if possible use one with a sunscreen in it as Vitamin C Serum exfoliates. It is important that you use the serum before moisturizing and not after. This is because the serum is easily absorbed into the skin, while moisturizers work on the surface. If you use the moisturizer first, your skin will not be able to absorb the vitamin c serum.  Also after purchasing the serum, it’s a good idea to keep it refrigerated. This will keep the serum from oxidizing too quickly, and will give you a better result for the price.  (I encourage you to say sold! Your face will thank you.)</li>
            <li> This has helped clear up some acme spots that would not go away! Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Superior product.  Half the price of some others I have used and just as good if not more so.&lt;br /&gt;Also appreciated the email follow up by the company as to how the Serum was working for me.  I have very good skin for age 67, but ladies the deeper lines (around the mouth) and a few age spots I couldn&#x27;t get rid of...now I am.  Use this for a few weeks twice a day and watch the age spots (hands and face) start to fade and plump the lines right up on the face and neck to the point where they are almost not noticeable.  Use around the mouth and watch your lipstick stop bleeding.  I use this at night followed by whatever cream I have available.  I have oily skin, so I use this in the morning with no follow up cream.  It&#x27;s been working like a champ and I have already ordered again.  Shake the bottle before you apply.  I find it works better that way.</li>
            <li> Got this as I ran out of another brand of the same serum. Pleased so far.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and well packaged. The dropper is already in the bottle when it arrives and there were no leaks or concerns whatsoever. The bottle itself is good and thick and, while I certainly don&#x27;t recommend trying this, I don&#x27;t think it would break easily if it were dropped as easily as some other bottles might. I actually (accidentally) hit it pretty hard on a doorway and thought for sure it would break, but it didn&#x27;t even crack. So the quality of the bottle itself is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum inside is easy to use. A little goes a long way and this appears that it will last for MANY uses. I have an oily nose and really dry forehead. I noticed immediately after starting to use it that my forehead is no where near as dry and scaly looking as it normally is. This does not leave a greasy feeling behind when you use it. I have sensitive skin and have had no reactions to it. The serum DOES have a light scent. It is not obnoxious but it may be noticeable to you if you are sensitive to odors. My suspicion is that this, like any other product in this type of category, will work for some and others might not see a huge difference. That said, this is a nice item and I would definitely recommend trying this before you go and spend huge amounts of money on other items or procedures. It&#x27;s easy to use and beneficial for your skin. I was able to receive this product for free in exchange to give the company my review on their product.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time👍&lt;br /&gt;Pleased with the product👍</li>
            <li> Very good. . Gives nice glow</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this out as I have enough Fine Lines that you can use them to draw a picture on my face with. So once it arrived I read how it works and started to use it for a week. At first I could not tell it was doing much but the more I used it the lines started to be less noticeable. Plus I had a few age spots I wanted to try it out on and they started to lighten up which excited me as I do not want to look old!!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product!</li>
            <li> So far my skin looks revived. It hasnt removed the sun spots as I wished, that&#x27;s the reason I bought it. But it has only been 1 month. I do see a difference in my skin a little lighter and the glow and refreshed looked is noticeable. I will keep using it and probably buy again . Their customer service has been exceptional and really appreciate feedback. I never leave reviews but since there are so many phony reviews out there I decided to leave this company (that is really trying to get unbiased real reviews ) one .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working and I like it, but it&#x27;s out of stock now?  What&#x27;s up with that?</li>
            <li> I like it so far , It make my skin brighter than before</li>
            <li> I will not ever go without using Vitamin C serum again, as I am an aging 55..and Majestic Pure&#x27;s serums seems to be the best. I&#x27;ve tried numerous brands, but there is something about this Vitamin C serum that seems to set itself apart. The serum itself seems to have a richer, silkier feel when smoothing on face, with an immediate difference in how your facial skin feels. It&#x27;s a professional grade of 20%, where you will see some on the market with no disclosure of %, or a lower concentrate. Makes a huge difference! Great brand to choose, quick results!</li>
            <li> The company is great to work with.  The product is good, hoped for a better smelling serum.  You do feel a slight tingle upon application, which makes you feel like it is working, but I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and I don&#x27;t really see much of a difference.  I will use it until it&#x27;s gone but I&#x27;m not sure I will order it again.  It is my first vitamin C product so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a gift from a friend after hearing me complain about the dark circles around my eyes. In the beginning I was skeptical and was not really convinced that these products work as they claim but after using it just for about a month I noticed a change and me and my wife now use it because the product really woks and makes your skin very smooth and silky. It may have a different effect based on your skin type but when the seller is willing to take that risk by giving you 60 day money back guarantee than why not..right! The bottle comes with a dropper so you don&#x27;t really use a lot but I am about half done so soon it will be time to order again.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serum has saved my life. I was so upset and worried at the same time due to the little lines underneath my eyes. When I do my makeup all the concealer looked so bad under my eyes. I applied this serum for few days and It showed awesome results. Just take few drops on your fingertips and apply on your face. Within 2-3 days you will feel big difference on your skin. Those little lines are almost gone, the skin on my face is so soft and smooth. I love this serum so much. Im 100% satisfied with this product. I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I received this Vitamin C serum in exchange of unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Love it! This Vitamin C Serum has helped my dark circles under my eyes.. Until I received the opportunity to field-test this item for review purposes, I honestly never even knew that it had any benefits when it could be used externally. I have used in on my wrinkles and am amazed at the difference in them.. My skin looks so much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;This arrived quickly and well packaged.  Love the dropper in the bottle and no leaks.  It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:72d777af575ef7c272ca9238837482c6]]Vitamin C is so good for your skin. It helps with the production of collagen, over all tightens your skin and the dark sun spots. Within seconds of applying this product I felt my skin get tighter. After using this just 4 times I noticed my dark circles under my eyes started to fade. I ran into a friend I havent seen in months, and she was telling me how amazing my skin looks.I only use this product once a day and im sure if I used it twice like said in the instructions I would see so much more. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good Vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;I have received this item during a promotional period and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well and is compatible with Lemon.</li>
            <li> I love this vitamin C Serum. It covers my face. It makes it so soft. My face looks absolutely awesome. It makes it glow and that glow look natural. I will continue using this twice a day. Fine lines and wrinkles have been reduced.</li>
