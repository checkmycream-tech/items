            <li>Seems to keep me moisturized for most of the day.</li>
            <li>As a naturopath I can say you can&#x27;t get better.</li>
            <li>Very healing and smells great.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Most stores had sold out this spring.  </li>
            <li>Light, quality ingredients, wonderful natural light fragrance.</li>
            <li>She absolutely insists on buying/using the absolute best which for her</li>
            <li>we just love this product it works very well on any form or any kind of skin when use it for my grandfather and his home and for my father at his working location if you have skin that needs healing and has no residue</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nourishing, absorbs quickly, and has a pleasant citrus/grapefruit smell that is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>The product is excellent but from Amazon it appeared to be watered down.  </li>
            <li>Makes your skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>This product arrived with the top broken, but i was reimbursed an allowed to keep the product which is great!  </li>

            <li>It has a light, fresh scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean fragrance...</li>
            <li>Aloe Life is a wonderful product and it is the only moisturizer I use on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>It is a great product that doesn&#x27;t have any harsh chemicals and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs well and leaves skin feeling naturally fresh.</li>
            <li>I do have to apply frequently to relieve the sandpaper feeling of my skin, but I have to do that with most lotions.  </li>
            <li>My health food store also stopped carrying it (was my beloved \\&quot;Henry&#x27;s\\&quot; in Encinitas and now \\&quot;Sprout&#x27;s, they slowly keep taking away all of my favorite items).  </li>
            <li>Fantastic all natural quality with fresh grapefruit smell!</li>
            <li>Soaks right in without leaving a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>Seems to absorb right in and leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>although the price is ridiculous, this is by far the best lotion for my face</li>
            <li>The price is higher than I would like.</li>
            <li>;)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It provides good protection and doesn&#x27;t leave hands greasy, and although I usually prefer unscented lotions such as Lubriderm, the scent is so light and fresh</li>
            <li>love this product and it will be &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34; as long as it&#x27;s on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Moisturizing and light enough to use in the hot summer.  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday and love that it is for the face too!</li>
            <li>I first purchased a small bottle of this locally and found my skin so happy with it, that I then purchased the 16 oz.</li>
            <li>I am also very picky about my ingredients.</li>
            <li>So far I tolerate this lotion pretty well.  </li>
            <li>previous favorite was discontinued.</li>
            <li>This lotion is clean, simple, natural.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m really sad that Aloe Life International has lost a large distribution deal so that Sprouts can push their own and other preferred vendors instead of the ones loved by customers for years.  </li>
            <li>I have spent much, much more money on facial and body moisturizer and it just can&#x27;t compare.  </li>
            <li>First the shipment came as an open bottle</li>
            <li>all natural.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to see it again</li>
            <li>Save yourself time and trouble and expense, this product is comparable to anything you would find at wally world, nothing special at all.</li>
            <li>This lotion left his dry sensitive newborn skin perfectly soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I really wish they would just bring down the price.</li>

            <li> this is a excellent lotion.  When I know I&#x27;m putting something that&#x27;s good for my skin and body...I feel good!  and when I feel good...what more is there to say!</li>
            <li> This lotion has been great. Doesn&#x27;t feel oily after application. Seems to absorb right in and leaves my skin soft and smooth. Smells wonderfully citric as well. My local health store quit carrying it so I found it on the internet. Really happy that I did.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It provides good protection and doesn&#x27;t leave hands greasy, and although I usually prefer unscented lotions such as Lubriderm, the scent is so light and fresh I love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion before having my baby. This lotion left his dry sensitive newborn skin perfectly soft and supple. I loved using it too since its paraben and toxic free!</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean fragrance...all natural.  Makes your skin silky smooth.  I use it everyday and love that it is for the face too!</li>
            <li> supe good skin moisterizer!!!!  Completely satisfied   with product and delivery.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body lotion. It has a light, fresh scent that is not overpowering. It absorbs well and leaves skin feeling naturally fresh. It is the only lotion I look for.</li>
            <li> It is a great product that doesn&#x27;t have any harsh chemicals and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> So far I tolerate this lotion pretty well.  It does seem thin or watered down.  I like the smell.  I do have to apply frequently to relieve the sandpaper feeling of my skin, but I have to do that with most lotions.  The price is higher than I would like.</li>
            <li> although the price is ridiculous, this is by far the best lotion for my face i&#x27;ve ever used. (i wouldnt dare use it as an all over-too expensive)&lt;br /&gt;My mother and i had to move in together for a short period of time. She is obsessed with facial creams and anything antiwrinkle. She absolutely insists on buying/using the absolute best which for her that&#x27;s determined by the price tag-higher the better  ;)&lt;br /&gt;I had just bought some of this from my local  HFS and left it on the counter. She helped herself one day out of curiousity. She was immediately hooked. I didnt throw the bottle away until we had literally opened the cap and scraped the left overs with a q tip. Whatever concoction they whipped together in this one works fantastically. It doesnt break my skin out either and that is a miracle in itself. I really wish they would just bring down the price.</li>
            <li> I like the product. Seems to keep me moisturized for most of the day. It is watery though.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have ever seen or used. As a naturopath I can say you can&#x27;t get better. If you know anything about Aloelife company you wouldn&#x27;t expect anything else...&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t cause acne, rashes, burning or anything else. Very healing and smells great. Orange Blossom fragrance...</li>
            <li> Best lotion on the market.</li>
            <li> Soaks right in without leaving a greasy feeling.  Has a nice aroma that is very soft and mellow.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best!  It&#x27;s very nourishing, absorbs quickly, and has a pleasant citrus/grapefruit smell that is not overpowering.  It&#x27;s the best lotion I&#x27;ve come across that not only hydrates all day but also helps me not have to shave as often when I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I first purchased a small bottle of this locally and found my skin so happy with it, that I then purchased the 16 oz. from them and this time opted for the Amazon offering to save money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and it will be &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34; as long as it&#x27;s on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous favorite was discontinued.</li>
            <li> Aloe Life is a wonderful product and it is the only moisturizer I use on a daily basis.  You can&#x27;t go wrong for the money.  I have spent much, much more money on facial and body moisturizer and it just can&#x27;t compare.  If I am going to wear make-up I apply Squalene over it and then my make-up just glides on.  If I am not going to wear make-up I just use the Aloe Life Cream.  Besides, it lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regards,</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. Light, quality ingredients, wonderful natural light fragrance. Perfect for all purpose moisturizing. I buy two at a time.</li>
            <li> Save yourself time and trouble and expense, this product is comparable to anything you would find at wally world, nothing special at all. Ended up throwing it away after using half the bottle.</li>
            <li> I am a lotion snob, I own that.  I hate it when they&#x27;re too thick or too thin.  I am also very picky about my ingredients. A lot of research goes into what goes on my skin and in my body.  This lotion is the best!  My health food store also stopped carrying it (was my beloved \\&quot;Henry&#x27;s\\&quot; in Encinitas and now \\&quot;Sprout&#x27;s, they slowly keep taking away all of my favorite items).  I&#x27;m so happy I can order this lotion on the internet but I&#x27;m really sad that Aloe Life International has lost a large distribution deal so that Sprouts can push their own and other preferred vendors instead of the ones loved by customers for years.  Oh how I miss \\&quot;Boney&#x27;s\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;~ Kym[[ASIN:B00028OSJ4 Face &amp; Body Lotion - 16 oz - Liquid]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for an after shave lotion for years.</li>
            <li> Great lotion.  Moisturizing and light enough to use in the hot summer.  It has a very appealing light citrus scent.</li>
            <li> Fantastic all natural quality with fresh grapefruit smell!</li>
            <li> we just love this product it works very well on any form or any kind of skin when use it for my grandfather and his home and for my father at his working location if you have skin that needs healing and has no residue this is the product I would suggest for you to use.</li>
            <li> Great Face Lotion.  I wish it was less expansive, hard to find.  Most stores had sold out this spring.  I was surprised to see it again</li>
            <li> I got a small sample of this lotion at a trade show and brought it home. Husband has sensitive skin, so we have to be careful about what he uses. He loves this stuff and we both use it on face and body. Needless to say, when it was time to get more, we couldn&#x27;t beat this wonderful deal. This lotion is clean, simple, natural. Gotta love that!</li>
            <li> This product arrived with the top broken, but i was reimbursed an allowed to keep the product which is great!  It&#x27;s moisturizing without being greasy.  And it gives my skin a glow.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion, pleasant smell and no skin reaction.  I&#x27;m picky with lotion and this was a winner.</li>
            <li> First the shipment came as an open bottle so I lost some lotion in shipping.  I have been a user of this product for at least 10 years.  The product is excellent but from Amazon it appeared to be watered down.  It came out the dispenser like a squirt gun not like the thick lotion that it normally does.  I will buy this again but from the aloelife web site.</li>
