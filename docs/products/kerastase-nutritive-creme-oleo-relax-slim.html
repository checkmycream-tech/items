            <li>I love this creme!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing for your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing that I can put it in, comb it through, I don&#x27;t even have to do anything else (no styling or drying), and my hair air dries into nice bouncy waves.  </li>
            <li>And, I think it smells really nice</li>
            <li>This product feels nice and smells nice, but truly does nothing for the hair.</li>
            <li>OK, but nothing spectacular.  </li>
            <li>and I always love my hair after, so I bought some.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The next morning, I had no frizz, perfect amount of volume</li>
            <li>Keeps my frizzy hair smooth!</li>
            <li>Great for the ends, not too much close to roots.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>I would like it to be more moisturizing like the Matrix</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many leave-in shine and silk serums over the years</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not stiff and sticky and makes my hair look great.</li>
            <li>Creates frizz free curls that look healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to use when I want to enhance and define my natural curls.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to make my hair look silky and smooth for years.</li>
            <li>It does a decent job on my shoulder length curly and frizzy hair, although when I apply considerably more than the recommended amount it does do a slightly better job.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li>The products are pricey but worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Works great whether I blow-dry or air dry my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair felt much more soft and healthy after just one try.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and healthy looking too!</li>
            <li>Smells good and works great, seriously!  </li>
            <li>It seems to work ok, but I can&#x27;t really use it because of the smell.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff.</li>
            <li>it has stripped my salon colored hair more quickly than the real product purchased at the salon.</li>
            <li>It calms down my frizzy fly away hair leaving it</li>
            <li>This worked within the first week!</li>
            <li>hair&#x27;s puffiness and volume was reduced significantly after the first use.</li>
            <li>but dint see it useful on my hair.</li>
            <li>Despite the fabulous reviews, this product didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations:</li>
            <li>Of course, as my stylist promised, hair rebonding made my hair straight, soft, and seemingly healthy.</li>
            <li>It really saved my hair!</li>
            <li>I first put on Kerastase Nutritive Oleo-Relax Serum (about 3-4 pumps) after towel drying hair on the ends, scrunch that stuff around.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Kerastase!</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>A little humidity or a nice breeze</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>It does not take much either when you apply.</li>
            <li>This really helps to keep my hair straight and fights frizz and dullness.</li>
            <li>I have to admit I was not expecting too much when I bought it.</li>
            <li>, it makes my hair really oily.</li>
            <li>The result (if blowdrying or air drying) is non-frizzy wavy/curly hair that looks like I spent more time than 3 minutes applying product.</li>
            <li>MAKES YOUR HAIR VERY SILKY.</li>
            <li>GETS RID OF THE FRIZZ AND MAKES HAIR VERY MANAGEABLE.</li>
            <li>I had heard so much about it</li>
            <li>With this bottle, I can use as much as I want with no problems.  </li>
            <li>On top of that I use about 2/3 product of what I was using with the other brands.</li>
            <li>It also holds well and individual hairs are highlighted/separated so that there&#x27;s an added special something to the product.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have very frizzy and unruly hair, and I mean VERY, then this product might be great for you especially if you can grow fond of its sub-par smell.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>Great product, and a bottle lasts forever since you only need a very small amount.</li>
            <li>results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to use a little more if you are not going to blow it</li>
            <li>As far a performance I really have no complaints</li>
            <li>( I live in humid Florida</li>
            <li>When I woke up, it was like I had a new head of hair .</li>
            <li>It minimized the puffiness and made it soft and silky!</li>
            <li>And I first used this when my hair was at its thickest and heaviest, 3 weeks after my last haircut.</li>
            <li>My hair is natural but I wear it straightened 95% of the time.</li>
            <li>This product is completely misrepresented-it is not the product as labeled.</li>
            <li>but no where near the results I&#x27;ve had when buying directly from my stylist.  </li>
            <li>Either way, my hair is soft and frizz-free, with no oily look.</li>
            <li>It is expensive but it&#x27;s worth it if you need it and it has lasted me more than 6 months</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this.it&#x27;s kinda pricey, but it last for awhile.</li>
            <li>So when I want to blow dry it straight without frizz, I use this product.</li>
            <li>Also works well when I blow dry my hair straight.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried to straighten my hair while using it, but I would never (ever) pay this much for a hair product again unless I knew that it would make my big hair smaller.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very thick and wavy (though it is silky on the top).</li>
            <li>I like this product, but it barely relaxes the hair.</li>
            <li>I have the Irish hair that has natural curl but frizzes no matter what I do.</li>
            <li>It makes my thick hair smooth, silky and relaxed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s either that this is a fake product or just not an effective one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>its not at all useful , I wasted my money.</li>
            <li>My hair grows super fast, and I have to get my hair cut every 3 weeks to thin and texturize it or else</li>
            <li>This product is the ONLY one that has ever tamed it without sacrificing my hairs natural body or making it feel like it will break at a single touch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had long hair, but could never grow it as long as I really wanted because it becomes frizzy, dry and unmanageable.</li>

            <li> For 40 years I have been searching for something that actually would tame my hair and make it straight and silky.</li>
            <li> I wanted it to tame my curly hair, but it really didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I usually love Kerastase products but this one has a horrible strong smell to it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is really unruly and frizzy but no more of that with this.  </li>
            <li> I have very coarse, dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have pretty much struggled with thinly-veiled hate for my hair my whole life.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and coarse Asian hair that I wear in a pixie cut because that&#x27;s the only way it looks halfway decent.</li>
            <li> I USE IT AFTER I DRY MY HAIR.</li>
            <li> In the past, when using too much it weighted down my hair and you had to really be careful not to overdo.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> EXPENSIVE BUT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> Once it is dry, I add a small amount of Elixir Ultime to give my hair extra softness and shine.  </li>
            <li> When I straighten my hair, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so this bottle lasts 6+ months on my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> (some of the other reviewers didn&#x27;t think so).</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands stating they are for thick/frizzy hair and the other products don&#x27;t even come close to this one.</li>
            <li> I never need any other product.</li>
            <li> Definitely a little odd that the package came all the way from England with some slight differences in the labeling on the back.</li>
            <li> I have very difficult hair - thick, frizzy, wavy hair pattern top half, you name it.</li>
            <li> The amount of volume would always prevent me from leaving it down</li>
            <li> so it took me years to find something that would slim down my hair while keeping the curls and waves.</li>
            <li> I just applied it to the mid-section of my hair all the way down AFTER air-drying it and then slept on it.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but a little goes a long way to tame those curly locks.</li>
            <li> My hair looks less damaged and frizzy when I use this product.  </li>
            <li> (I apply about a table spoon and a half to my long, thick hair).</li>
            <li> and I wash my hair every other day, using a dab about the size of a nickel after towel drying it; on the days I don&#x27;t wash it, I just need to dampen it ever so slightly and use a dab about the size of a dime on it, usually just using my hands to style it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy, and is the answer for those with coarse, thick hair!</li>
            <li> The one negative of this product is the smell though, not a very pleasant aroma, definitely not a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> The product is expensive, but only a small amount is needed and a container of this size lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I just rub a dime sized amount into towel dried hair, brush my hair then ponytail it until it dries.  </li>
            <li> Of course I cannot say if it is or is not genuine--</li>
            <li> If only it wasn&#x27;t sooo expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll order again...</li>
            <li> I washed my hair, put the creme in, and went to bed as usual.</li>
            <li> Very few products perform as well as they claim, and this one isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle relaxant for my thick tangled hair.</li>
            <li> It seriously felt like I lost 10 pounds on my head after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a 43 year old that lives in NY and in the summer time the heat and humidity can be brutal on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I stumbled into this product when I was searching separately for treatments for my poor over-treated hair.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed considering the high price.</li>
            <li> So sorry it toke me 43 years to find it.</li>
            <li> Seriously, if you have horrible hair that you would like to turn to silk, try this.</li>
            <li> perhaps it was a bad batch.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything and have always been disappointed.</li>

            <li> OK, but nothing spectacular.  I wanted it to tame my curly hair, but it really didn&#x27;t.  I haven&#x27;t tried to straighten my hair while using it, but I would never (ever) pay this much for a hair product again unless I knew that it would make my big hair smaller.  HA!</li>
            <li> Works great on my curly and unruly hair. Creates frizz free curls that look healthy and shiny. Pricey but worth it!</li>

This stuff is amazing!!!!!!  It is expensive but worth every penny.  My hair is really unruly and frizzy but no more of that with this.  I highly recommend this.  So sorry it toke me 43 years to find it.</li>
            <li> For 40 years I have been searching for something that actually would tame my hair and make it straight and silky. In that time I have tried literally hundreds of products. This one actually works!    I&#x27;ve always had long hair, but could never grow it as long as I really wanted because it becomes frizzy, dry and unmanageable. A little humidity or a nice breeze and I wind up looking like Larry from the 3 Stooges. Now my hair is approaching shoulder length and it looks like I&#x27;ve always dreamed. I only wish it had been around in the 70&#x27;s!    Seriously, if you have horrible hair that you would like to turn to silk, try this.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!!!!!! It makes my thick hair smooth, silky and relaxed. Works great whether I blow-dry or air dry my hair. And, I think it smells really nice (some of the other reviewers didn&#x27;t think so).</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and tends to be frizzy. This product, which is used after shampooing and is left in hair as it dries, helps to keep my hair under control. The product is expensive, but only a small amount is needed and a container of this size lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I usually love Kerastase products but this one has a horrible strong smell to it.  It seems to work ok, but I can&#x27;t really use it because of the smell.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but a little goes a long way to tame those curly locks. It adds shine, texture, control. An all-in-one product</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and wavy (though it is silky on the top). The amount of volume would always prevent me from leaving it down so it took me years to find something that would slim down my hair while keeping the curls and waves. This worked within the first week! I just applied it to the mid-section of my hair all the way down AFTER air-drying it and then slept on it. The next morning, I had no frizz, perfect amount of volume (no poof!), and my curls and waves were well-defined. I think you should go for it if your poofiness has proved to be a problem! It is expensive but it&#x27;s worth it if you need it and it has lasted me more than 6 months (I apply about a table spoon and a half to my long, thick hair). I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for your hair.</li>
            <li> Keeps my frizzy hair smooth!</li>
            <li> My hair looks less damaged and frizzy when I use this product.  I just rub a dime sized amount into towel dried hair, brush my hair then ponytail it until it dries.  Once it is dry, I add a small amount of Elixir Ultime to give my hair extra softness and shine.  The products are pricey but worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair. So when I want to blow dry it straight without frizz, I use this product. It is excellent in keeping your hair smooth.  It does not take much either when you apply.</li>
            <li> Despite the fabulous reviews, this product didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations:( I live in humid Florida and I guess Kerastse just doesn&#x27;t control the frizz...I tried the recommended amount and when that didn&#x27;t work I tried additional product...to no avail.</li>
            <li> Great product, and a bottle lasts forever since you only need a very small amount.</li>
            <li> It softens and defines my curls. When I straighten my hair, a little goes a long way. Great for the ends, not too much close to roots.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use when I want to enhance and define my natural curls. It makes my hair soft and healthy looking too!</li>
            <li> I swear by this product, my hair loves it!  It&#x27;s amazing that I can put it in, comb it through, I don&#x27;t even have to do anything else (no styling or drying), and my hair air dries into nice bouncy waves.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I loveeee this stuff. My hair is natural but I wear it straightened 95% of the time. This really helps to keep my hair straight and fights frizz and dullness.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s what I use it for. I love, love, love this product. It&#x27;s not stiff and sticky and makes my hair look great. It also holds well and individual hairs are highlighted/separated so that there&#x27;s an added special something to the product.  If only it wasn&#x27;t sooo expensive.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, dry, frizzy hair. I have been trying to make my hair look silky and smooth for years. Along the years, I have amassed numerous hair care products. And finally, something works!!  I use Japanese hair rebonding every five months just to enable myself go outside without a hat. Of course, as my stylist promised, hair rebonding made my hair straight, soft, and seemingly healthy. However, last month I noticed my hair endings look like burnt grass....Urgggg......  I stumbled into this product when I was searching separately for treatments for my poor over-treated hair. I have to admit I was not expecting too much when I bought it. But!! It really saved my hair! My hair felt much more soft and healthy after just one try. I will definitely purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> Very few products perform as well as they claim, and this one isn&#x27;t one of them. It does a decent job on my shoulder length curly and frizzy hair, although when I apply considerably more than the recommended amount it does do a slightly better job. As far a performance I really have no complaints but I have no praises either. The one negative of this product is the smell though, not a very pleasant aroma, definitely not a fan of the smell. I probably will finish the bottle but won&#x27;t be buying again. If you don&#x27;t have very frizzy and unruly hair, and I mean VERY, then this product might be great for you especially if you can grow fond of its sub-par smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for about a month now and have not noticed any difference yet. It&#x27;s either that this is a fake product or just not an effective one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it makes my hair really oily.</li>
            <li> I have very difficult hair - thick, frizzy, wavy hair pattern top half, you name it. I have tried other brands stating they are for thick/frizzy hair and the other products don&#x27;t even come close to this one. On top of that I use about 2/3 product of what I was using with the other brands. I first put on Kerastase Nutritive Oleo-Relax Serum (about 3-4 pumps) after towel drying hair on the ends, scrunch that stuff around. And then apply this item, about a quarter sized amount on the palm of hand and scrunch all over. The result (if blowdrying or air drying) is non-frizzy wavy/curly hair that looks like I spent more time than 3 minutes applying product. HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but it barely relaxes the hair. It is a bit costly for its performance. I would like it to be more moisturizing like the Matrix products.&lt;br /&gt;There is more hype than performance here! I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll order again...</li>
            <li> This product is completely misrepresented-it is not the product as labeled. different color ,texture and it has stripped my salon colored hair more quickly than the real product purchased at the salon. this product is supposed to be made in France-not spain-read the label. also-lable is applied instead of imprinted. Buyer&#x27;s beware.</li>
            <li> I have pretty much struggled with thinly-veiled hate for my hair my whole life. I have very thick and coarse Asian hair that I wear in a pixie cut because that&#x27;s the only way it looks halfway decent. My hair grows super fast, and I have to get my hair cut every 3 weeks to thin and texturize it or else it ends up looking like I have snap-on Lego helmet head hair. I&#x27;ve tried many leave-in shine and silk serums over the years (Cristalli Liquidi, Paul Mitchell, etc.) but none of them have worked the miracle that this product has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair&#x27;s puffiness and volume was reduced significantly after the first use. I washed my hair, put the creme in, and went to bed as usual. When I woke up, it was like I had a new head of hair . It minimized the puffiness and made it soft and silky! And I first used this when my hair was at its thickest and heaviest, 3 weeks after my last haircut. It seriously felt like I lost 10 pounds on my head after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy, and is the answer for those with coarse, thick hair! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff. Try it! Thanks, Kerastase!</li>
            <li> I USE IT AFTER I DRY MY HAIR. MAKES YOUR HAIR VERY SILKY. GETS RID OF THE FRIZZ AND MAKES HAIR VERY MANAGEABLE. EXPENSIVE BUT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> its not at all useful , I wasted my money. I had heard so much about it but dint see it useful on my hair. my hair is still fuzzy even after applying this.</li>
            <li> I use this relaxing creme on my curly  hair to get relaxed curls. Gives the tosseled, beach hair look. Also works well when I blow dry my hair straight. Leaves my hair super soft. A little goes a long way so this bottle lasts 6+ months on my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I have used Kerastase Oleo Relax Slim for years with great results.  This time the product had a noticeably different smell, texture/feel, and result.  It did help defrizz my hair somewhat but no where near the results I&#x27;ve had when buying directly from my stylist.  In the past, when using too much it weighted down my hair and you had to really be careful not to overdo.  With this bottle, I can use as much as I want with no problems.  Of course I cannot say if it is or is not genuine-- perhaps it was a bad batch.  Definitely a little odd that the package came all the way from England with some slight differences in the labeling on the back.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at my Gene Juarez Salon, but they discontinued it. Thank goodness for Amazon.com! This is a miracle relaxant for my thick tangled hair.</li>
            <li> I love this creme! I have the Irish hair that has natural curl but frizzes no matter what I do. Years ago, my 3-year daughter commented from the back seat of the car once: &amp;#34;Momma, you gots big hair&amp;#34;. This product is the ONLY one that has ever tamed it without sacrificing my hairs natural body or making it feel like it will break at a single touch. I have tried everything and have always been disappointed. I have been using the Oleo Slim for about 4 years now. With this creme, I can let my hair airdry or use a  hairdryer and styling brush; winter or humid summer! Either way, my hair is soft and frizz-free, with no oily look. My hair is now cut to about mid-neck and I wash my hair every other day, using a dab about the size of a nickel after towel drying it; on the days I don&#x27;t wash it, I just need to dampen it ever so slightly and use a dab about the size of a dime on it, usually just using my hands to style it. The 6.8 oz bottle lasts me almost a year. I never need any other product.</li>
            <li> This product feels nice and smells nice, but truly does nothing for the hair. Very disappointed considering the high price. I used the entire Oleo Slim line and had dryer hair, without any visible smoothing or frizz ease whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I truly like this product!  It calms down my frizzy fly away hair leaving it&lt;br /&gt;soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;I can use this product with or without blow drying and get great results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to use a little more if you are not going to blow it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what I will do if they ever stop making it!</li>
