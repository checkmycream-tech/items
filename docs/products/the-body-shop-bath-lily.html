            <li>I love these bath lillies!  </li>
            <li>The cloth ring for hanging is nice, though.</li>
            <li>Very soft and feels great on the skin!</li>
            <li>This is what I use the most when showering.  </li>
            <li>I just LOVE their products AND their service.</li>
            <li>These are way better than tthe ones I bought at the grocery store or Target.</li>
            <li>I was hoping, based on the price, this might be better than the $1-$2 ones you can pick up at Walmart or Target....</li>
            <li>I will buy more just so that I&#x27;m never out.</li>
            <li>nothing better than clean scrubbed skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very particular about my scrubber, but I&#x27;m happy to say this are soft and durable.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect gentle bath puff -- not too rough, but still exfoliates the skin.  </li>
            <li>Nothing more can be said really, gets the job done well and has lasted.</li>
            <li>Full bath pouf, keeps shape well.</li>
            <li>The color is very pretty, too.</li>
            <li>Use it every time i take a shower to apply the body wash, feels very nice on my skin and helps in removing dead skin to leave you feeling clean.</li>
            <li>For how inexpensive it is, this little guy is great.  </li>
            <li>These round Loofahs (Sponges)  are very nice.  </li>
            <li>I like to pour a nice thick body wash on it and enjoy washing.  </li>
            <li>Pretty color and very well constructed, doesn&#x27;t look like it will start unraveling after the first wash or two with it.</li>
            <li>Super soft and fluffly!</li>
            <li>I got the light blue one and the string is light blue.</li>
            <li>and they lather-up very well.</li>
            <li>High quality soft mesh, nice ribbon strap, but not a large pouf</li>
            <li>I was looking for a nice, big fluffy one like one that I got years ago.  </li>
            <li>Always check the manufacturer&#x27;s website first for any possible specials.</li>
            <li>I would send it back if postage wouldn&#x27;t cost me as much as the item!</li>
            <li>They are really soft.</li>
            <li>this sucker keeps all my cracks and crevasses squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good with an unexpected problem: the little string to hang it is really hard to find!</li>
            <li>I have tried different kinds before and none were as soft as this</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have tried different kinds before and none were as soft as this</li>
            <li> Also, the loofa is not from the Body Shop but from &amp;#34;Diane&#x27;s Beauty.&amp;#34; The tag has the real branding and labeling it under &amp;#34;The Body Shop&amp;#34; sold by &amp;#34;The Body Shop&amp;#34; is very misleading and false advertising.</li>
            <li> As far as scrubbing goes this does the job, for the average person, No can brush their back with out help unless you have something else to used but all in all this is what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Better than the rope ones that feel unpleasant while washing yourself.</li>
            <li> The fabric used is soft, and the balls are thick.  </li>
            <li> the fibers on it aren&#x27;t too loose like they are on other poufs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the case with the other ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, upon receiving this package, I found that it was messily stuffed into a dirty envelope without any additional packaging to protect or keep the product clean.</li>
            <li> I continue to buy these over and over again for the past few years.</li>
            <li> No better than the $2 one I have from Walmart.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s no better -</li>
            <li> I mean it works, but it&#x27;s no better than one you can pick up from the supermarket for 2 dollars.</li>
            <li> This was very small and thin.  </li>
            <li> Very expensive for the quality that I expected.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say about this bath/shower product.</li>
            <li> how can you make a bad loofa?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s good with an unexpected problem: the little string to hang it is really hard to find! I got the light blue one and the string is light blue. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the case with the other ones. This is not a big deal obviously, especially if you don&#x27;t hang it, but I would sometimes just be standing there looking for the darn string. Otherwise, this is great.</li>
            <li> This was very small and thin.  It is also not aqua colored but smoky blue.  Very expensive for the quality that I expected.</li>
            <li> High quality soft mesh, nice ribbon strap, but not a large pouf</li>
            <li> These round Loofahs (Sponges)  are very nice.  The fabric used is soft, and the balls are thick.  This is what I use the most when showering.  I like to pour a nice thick body wash on it and enjoy washing.  They of course have a string loop that you can use to hang it.</li>
            <li> This is a great bath pouf from The Body Shop!  It appears well made and the fibers on it aren&#x27;t too loose like they are on other poufs.</li>
            <li> Very soft and feels great on the skin!</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say about this bath/shower product. Well made and feels great. The color is very pretty, too. I will buy this again when I need one.</li>
            <li> It worked for 2 weeks and then came apart! It unravelled while I was in the shower and now it&#x27;s in the trash</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price. Nothing more can be said really, gets the job done well and has lasted.</li>
            <li> As far as scrubbing goes this does the job, for the average person, No can brush their back with out help unless you have something else to used but all in all this is what it says it does.</li>
            <li> I love these bath lillies!  I bought an extra one just to keep on hand.  They are really soft. They don&#x27;t scratch your skin like some others do and they lather-up very well.</li>
            <li> I mean it works, but it&#x27;s no better than one you can pick up from the supermarket for 2 dollars. The cloth ring for hanging is nice, though. Better than the rope ones that feel unpleasant while washing yourself.</li>
            <li> it is the softest bath sponge I ever used. It is the best I will buy more definitly. I have tried different kinds before and none were as soft as this</li>
            <li> Use it every time i take a shower to apply the body wash, feels very nice on my skin and helps in removing dead skin to leave you feeling clean.</li>
            <li> nothing better than clean scrubbed skin</li>
            <li> Always check the manufacturer&#x27;s website first for any possible specials. This same Bath Lily (you can see it in the name above) regularly sells for $3 and is currently on sale for 50% off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I do not work for The Body Shop and do not get anything from them for my review. I just LOVE their products AND their service.</li>
            <li> These are way better than tthe ones I bought at the grocery store or Target. I continue to buy these over and over again for the past few years.</li>
            <li> When searching for a bath loofa, this product was listed &amp;#34;The Body Shop Bath Lily, Aqua&amp;#34; sold by &amp;#34;The Body Shop.&amp;#34; The description makes it seem as though it supplies and resells products from the legitimate Body Shop http://www.thebodyshop-usa.com/.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, upon receiving this package, I found that it was messily stuffed into a dirty envelope without any additional packaging to protect or keep the product clean. Also, the loofa is not from the Body Shop but from &amp;#34;Diane&#x27;s Beauty.&amp;#34; The tag has the real branding and labeling it under &amp;#34;The Body Shop&amp;#34; sold by &amp;#34;The Body Shop&amp;#34; is very misleading and false advertising. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> For how inexpensive it is, this little guy is great.  It has kept is shape and has not become flimsy.</li>
            <li> how can you make a bad loofa? this sucker keeps all my cracks and crevasses squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> No better than the $2 one I have from Walmart.  I was looking for a nice, big fluffy one like one that I got years ago.  I was hoping, based on the price, this might be better than the $1-$2 ones you can pick up at Walmart or Target....but it&#x27;s no better - so it was totally overpriced.  I would send it back if postage wouldn&#x27;t cost me as much as the item!</li>
            <li> Super soft and fluffly!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect gentle bath puff -- not too rough, but still exfoliates the skin.  Great quality, too.</li>
            <li> Pretty color and very well constructed, doesn&#x27;t look like it will start unraveling after the first wash or two with it.</li>
            <li> Full bath pouf, keeps shape well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very particular about my scrubber, but I&#x27;m happy to say this are soft and durable. I&#x27;ve ordered enough to have a spare for my bath and one each on my gym bag and my travel bag. I will buy more just so that I&#x27;m never out.</li>
            <li> Good size. I was worried that it may be one of those tiny ones given out with some liquid soap. This one is about six inches in diameter.</li>
