            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it and glad I&#x27;ve found it.</li>
            <li>Impressed with Oleavine which is a new brand to me made in the USA.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice light non-oily cream that feels good on.</li>

            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product works perfect.</li>

            <li>The scent is very light and does not linger once you apply it.</li>
            <li>Very light lotion.  </li>
            <li>, it is nice and creamy, making it easy to absorb.</li>
            <li>Love the twist top dispenser, excellent idea and very travel friendly.</li>
            <li>Also the price is very good for an all natural &amp; organic product.</li>
            <li>The great thing that I love about using an air pump is it makes it so easy to apply the right amount of the Oleavine moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>That is a huge plus!</li>
            <li>It is soooo cute</li>
            <li>and I LOVE butterflies.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time after I&#x27;ve cleaned my face and applied a bit of a serum (hyaluronic acid and/or vitamin c), I apply this lovely moisturizer.</li>
            <li>When they said fragrance free, they weren&#x27;t kidding around!</li>
            <li>I use it morning and night and in the morning follow with a toner, a treatment, a Serum, and then Oleavine Moisturizer and it has been doing wonderful things for my skin and the back of my hands because I&#x27;ve been putting it there</li>
            <li>Such a beautiful way to moisturizer!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>received this product free in exchange for my unbiased, honest review.</li>
            <li>but I really do love it.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s kind of important to me because I don&#x27;t want to put something on my face that smells funky.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>The pump pops up out of the top.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Skin feels lovely after application.</li>
            <li>It is light on the skin but affective!  </li>
            <li>well, I Love it beyond compare.  </li>
            <li>Even the Olivine Facial Moisturizer would make a great gift for your loved ones too.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s even better is the nature and benefit of the ingredients used in this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Some people love a matte finish and this would be for you.</li>
            <li>Instead I have been using this as my serum and applying thicker layer of moisturizer on top of it.</li>
            <li>Love the quality ingredients and that it&#x27;s made in the U.S.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so I would know when to order more.</li>
            <li>Customer for life :)</li>
            <li>I love that the product went on smooth on the face and it was not oily it moisturize nicely, when I put it on in the morning</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love the packaging.</li>
            <li>I also love how you just twist the bottle to make the pump show up and twist again and the pump disappears.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is organic.  </li>
            <li>I love how this gives my skin a more balanced, refreshed look to it.</li>
            <li>This is okay but has not done any better than any of the over-the-counter products I have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not spend the money on buying another bottle.</li>
            <li>also love the airless pump.  </li>
            <li>Well, this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t need one because the bottle twists and the dispenser pops out of the top.</li>
            <li>and I think more companies should put more more effort and designs on their products.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product!!</li>
            <li>I had to use a hammer to knock off the top</li>
            <li>I then have to knock the top off because the product won&#x27;t come out of the top.</li>
            <li>It has so many benefit for your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like a cream based but more like a lotion based moisturiser.</li>
            <li>I did received this for free to try out, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Vitamin C: Will brighten your skin making it look more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

            <li>I love everything about it; from the packaging, to the nice light sent, to how it makes my face feel pampered, to how smoothly my makeup goes on over it.</li>
            <li>, that means the ingredients aren&#x27;t altered and stay more to their true form which means they do what they say they&#x27;re going to do!</li>
            <li>This has more of a lotion consistency, and I liked how quickly it absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>I also love that the container closes up easily for travel.</li>

            <li>It has a light and refreshing citrus smell which smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>The way the lid closes makes it easy to bring with you and not worry about leaks.</li>
            <li>I love the mild, floral scent, organic/natural ingredients, the ease of application on my skin, the way it feels on my face, and most importantly, the results.</li>
            <li>Also didn&#x27;t like the strong flowery scent.</li>
            <li>On top of that, Oleavine takes special care during the creation of this product through cold-processing.</li>
            <li>, I Love to get what I am promised, and I Love good science, and if I can trust it enough to use on my children…</li>
            <li>The moisturizer has a light fragrance that smells clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>It is not only pretty and makes a wonderful gift for the women in your life</li>
            <li>Vitamin A will over time reduce any fine lines and wrinkles, sun or age spots, acne scarring, and keep your skin looking fresh.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This bottle is easy to open, close, and great for travel.</li>
            <li>Oleavine Moisturizer comes in beautifully luxurious looking packaging, simply twist the silver top and the pump comes out and you can administer just the right amount of product to your fingertips.</li>
            <li>and I feel comfortable just using it without makeup on some days.</li>
            <li>It feels smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>This is such a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It goes on light, soaks in, and moisturizes thoroughly.</li>
            <li>and my makeup goes on so smoothly with it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light weight and not greasy.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is fantastic.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and supple after using it.</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on smoothly over this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face glowing and feeling smooth all day.</li>
            <li>I also love the pop-up pump--very quick and efficient--and keeps the product clean and germ free.</li>
            <li>GOES ON SMOOTHLY</li>
            <li>There are cheaper options available which are also free of chemicals.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It is smooth and one pump of the container is ample for covering the face and neck.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your skin silky smooth without a greasy residue....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural, organic and feels so good going on your skin.</li>
            <li>it work through the whole intire day, which I love because I didn&#x27;t have to put more in the evening.&lt;br</li>
            <li>On top of that this moisturizer is packed with a ton of other great ingredients to make my skin look &amp; feel luxuriously smooth.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t that bottle so pretty!!</li>
            <li>It is very neat and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I suffer from severely dry skin, and since I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer my skin has felt perfectly hydrated and looks much brighter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First of all, I love the packaging.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loaded with Vitamins A, B.C + E, along with botanicals rich in Omegas 3, 6, 7 + 9.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth and my color is more toned and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend plus, the packaging is super cute and it makes it even more fun to use!</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect much but am delighted with the result.</li>
            <li>You will completely fall in love with this product!</li>
            <li>Aside from being preservative free, paraben free, petroleum free, phthalate free, sulfate free, silicone free, cruelty free, gluten free, allergy free and non greasy, it uses several botanicals, plant stem cells and vitamins to lock in moisture while also improving the texture and tone of your skin.</li>
            <li>but this is non-greasy and leaves skin very smooth and ready to apply a foundation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer, but I&#x27;ve had other nice moisturizers.</li>
            <li>This one is just right for my skin!</li>
            <li>I tend to have dry, flaky skin and this is very effective.</li>
            <li>I have seen only good results.</li>
            <li>I liked that it made my face feel soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer, and so much so that I use it on my children.</li>
            <li>I also had better results with the Oleavine when I really rubbed it into my skin -</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with your product, only have to use small amount, works great !</li>
            <li>My skin feels really fresh and light.</li>
            <li>They gave me a full refund without me having to go through the hassle and confusion of returning the product.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t make my skin (more) oily, instead it really does balance my skin out.</li>
            <li>I really love the whole design of this product</li>
            <li>Overall, a good moisturizer</li>
            <li>The bottle is really cool too.</li>
            <li>Per Oleavine, this moisturizer is a  blend of skin rejuvenating botanicals rich in Omegas 3, 6, 7 &amp; 9 combined with powerful actives to help lock in moisture while improving texture and tone.</li>
            <li>It feels clean and fresh on the face.</li>
            <li>It does not leave a greasy coating and feels so fresh and clean when you apply it.  </li>
            <li>I personally would prefer the option of a mild fragrance, something reminiscent of the beautiful, feminine packaging!</li>
            <li>It tingles a bit when applied but quickly soaks into skin and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li>I Love clever</li>
            <li>I was so satisfied with the product that I have become a steady customer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very, happy that I finally found a product that actually does what it claims.</li>
            <li>The texture is serum-like which makes it penetrate quickly</li>
            <li>sure I was satisfied with the product and encouraging me to email them back if I had any questions or concerns.</li>
            <li>The product dries quickly and leaves a silky feel to it.</li>
            <li>I especially like the twist open and close cap, the best I have ever used!</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into your skin.</li>
            <li>and I feel like I started seeing results rather quickly as well.</li>
            <li>I expected more from the product I guess, haven&#x27;t seen any change, tho its a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and not messy at all.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very pretty and convenient.</li>
            <li>and I feel like I have seen a positive difference in the fine lines on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, it&#x27;s chemical free, organic, has nearly zero scent to it, and makes my skin feel and look more healthy while giving a radiant natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has become one of my new favorite beauty products.</li>
            <li>I noticed that it is very hydrating and blends easily and effortlessly.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working nicely and has not made my sensitive skin break out, which is a major bonus as most products irritate or make my skin break out.</li>
            <li>First of all, the packaging is BEA-U-TIFUL, and unique in that</li>
            <li>So far, two thumbs up!  :)</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more before I run out!</li>
            <li>is stays fresh for the whole use!!</li>
            <li>I now have to say this is the Best Natural Facial Moisturizer I&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
            <li>Was using it for a few weeks when people started telling me how great my skin looked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not regular pimples, but some kind of raised bump that looks like a pimple but isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I was however extremely surprised and pleased with the customer service and care shown to me by Oleavine.</li>
            <li>It is a gorgeous design with pink butterflies.</li>
            <li>I love that its organic and natural cuse rest assured the chemicals in a lot of products</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good as some of the really expensive creams and serums I&#x27;ve tried but for such a great price!  </li>
            <li>absolutely love products that are natural and chemical free, and who wants all of those chemicals applied on their face?  </li>
            <li>It has the silky texture of a lotion rather than a heavy cream, which is important to me because I&#x27;m the kind of girl who gets hot at night really easily.</li>
            <li>Second this is allergy friendly, so I felt confident that it wouldn&#x27;t irritates my skin; and after using this myself, I&#x27;ve had no issues with any sensitivity to my skin.</li>
            <li>Excellent light feeling non greasy, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I found this to be a special, more personal feature</li>
            <li>Plus the airless pump also ensures that I don&#x27;t stick my hands right into the moisturizer, which would allow germs and bacteria to enter.  </li>
            <li>Well, right into the product itself.</li>
            <li>The pump allows for just the right amount to be distributed without over dispensing.</li>
            <li>and it comes right out, no fussing with it.</li>
            <li>When I first used it though it was thinner than my prior moisturizer, however, this moisturizer made my makeup look SO amazing.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that does not respond very well to most chemical laced moisturizers.</li>
            <li>great product, small amount.</li>
            <li>Plus, the company actually checks in with you to make sure you&#x27;re 100 satisfied and offers services if you&#x27;re not.</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer overall and am so glad that I found it!</li>
            <li>It has been very gentle to my skin and it gives me the right amount of moisture that I need.</li>
            <li>You only need a little bit and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li>, I really wish the product had even a mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>I recently received a complimentary sample of Oleavine&#x27;s Moisturizer + Rejuvenating Actives to test out, and this meets my expectations on so many levels.</li>
            <li>The Facial Moisturizer is an anti-aging serum and rejuvenating moisturizer in one so double duty in my book is great.</li>
            <li>It came super fast</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t found it to be anything special particularly for the price.</li>
            <li>I like it very much .But</li>
            <li>The reason you do not want a ton in your hand is that the product spreads out quite a bit and covers a good amount of area with just a little bit of product.</li>
            <li>moisturizer is especially great during the winter when the air is dry and my skin tends to be less hydrated and supple.</li>
            <li>It is more hydrated-especially for this time of year, the dark circles around my eyes are lightening up, and my fine lines are diminishing.</li>
            <li>I love that you don&#x27;t have to open a lid and</li>
            <li>I am pretty picky when it comes to using any product on my face...</li>
            <li>I put it on, and by the time I would be ready to put my makeup on, this is nicely absorbed into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And this is a personal preference more than anything</li>
            <li>The packaging and the bottle itself are quite pretty.</li>
            <li>Oleavine is leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It REALLY works!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>Very like it!</li>
            <li>so that means a whole lot!</li>
            <li>Just recieved this product and the bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>However,  I have not found it outstanding enough to warrant the price charged for a one ounce bottle.</li>
            <li>First of all, I have oily skin.</li>
            <li>Spend all the money you want on facial moisturizer,but you will not find better than this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>But the fact that it is chemical free and has natural ingredients is what sold me on this</li>
            <li>Another thing I love about this mouisturizer is when you open your box, you&#x27;ll find a Thank</li>
            <li>I am actually thinking of ordering more.</li>
            <li>It is light and airy and not heavy or oily.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>And all I can say that this is my current favorite moisturizer for holiday.</li>
            <li>leaves skin soft and smooth, would buy again</li>
            <li>With this being on sale the price is really reasonable and I want to continue using it!</li>
            <li>As an Esthetician, when most of my clients come in for facial services</li>
            <li>, Aloe will keep your skin soft and smooth and keep the redness</li>
            <li>recommend this product to anyone that wants to have fresh youthful looking skin!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this is pretty</li>
            <li>I love how this feels and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>Holy cow,  I really love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>It took some time to see the positive results but after finishing my first bottle I can say it&#x27;s made a difference.</li>
            <li>Other than that it was top notch 5 star worthy in my book,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that after using it for a few weeks the texture of my skin is slightly more smooth.</li>
            <li>I really like this product very much.  </li>
            <li>The moisturizer itself is a very light consistency and sinks into my skin immediately leaving it feeling soft and smooth, it doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of residue.</li>
            <li>I found that Oleavine Facial Moisturizer is very easy to dispense, just push down on the top</li>
            <li>It is an easy to use twist cap up and down jar, and expenses precise amounts of moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This was my first product that I have tried from Oleavine and I can say that I really like it</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s good about it is that I have not had any breakouts since using the cream which typically happens when I try a new product.</li>
            <li>I felt that it absorbed too quickly and wanted to reapply but after the first week of use the difference in my skin showed that it was not necessary.</li>
            <li>I reccomend it more for night use right before bed due to the shine and the smell after a while.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lucky me, I&#x27;ve recently purchased this wonderful product above, Oleavine Beauty Professional Facial Moisturizer + Rejuvenating Actives.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and leaves my skin velvety soft.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my skin more dry.</li>
            <li>My stylish bottle is almost empty I have been using it SO much!</li>
            <li>This is my new lotion !!</li>
            <li>First and foremost, I simply love that Oleavine Facial Moisturizer is ALL NATURAL.</li>
            <li>I can see a difference in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I am a moisturizer person because my face is normal to dry and espeacially here in a hot place, but now that is winter I have to put more moisturizer.</li>
            <li>May be a better fit during the summer, but for me during the winter, this is not enough for my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>now I am 100% sure my dry spots will be gone within a week!</li>
            <li>This my testimony; I have been using Oleavine for several days now, with and without make up, I notice a HUGE difference in the feel of my face.</li>
            <li>I really do like</li>
            <li>I lightly massaged the cream into my skin with my fingertips and then went to bed shortly</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so gentle</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>In just a few weeks my skin looked like the 29 year old I like to claim to be, which pleases the 39 year old that I am greatly.</li>
            <li>My sincerest compliments and thanks to Research &amp; Development at Olievine, for  </li>
            <li>Olievine&#x27;s moisturizer has done what none have accomplished before - appease the Censorious Scientist, the Anti-Age Avenger, and the Overbearing Momma in me.</li>
            <li>It really has made a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>The only reason I am not giving it five stars is because it is not 100% fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer works very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I am very picky with what I put on my face.</li>
            <li>and it has really helped soften it.</li>
            <li>My only 2 issues are: 1) it leaves my face shiny and 2) after about 3 hours, it starts making my face smell like cheap crayons.</li>
            <li>It basically healed my moderately sunburned shoulders in 2 days, and now I have a smooth and &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; looking tan (even though a tan is basically damage).</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really noticed much difference.</li>
            <li>It’s not too oily but it moisturizes my skin very well –</li>
            <li>I think it is very girly looking.</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I think my skin feels much smoother with this moistur</li>
            <li>This Moisturizer really works.</li>
            <li>I like how you don&#x27;t need much product to moisturize your whole face.</li>
            <li>take much to cover</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like the moisturizer, and would give it 5 stars, but can&#x27;t get the product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I really like this moisture cream.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is decorated very fancy looking.</li>
            <li>I especially appreciate that it is free from harmful chemical ingredients.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, nice-smelling, non-greasy and makes my face seem a tad younger.</li>
            <li>Light-weight, yet very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I do not see much difference though with lightening sun spots or acne scars.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it at all, but my wife really loves it.</li>
            <li>I really like the Oleavine Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a real difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>, I thought, &amp;#34;Another moisturizer..... and expected the same old, same old.&amp;#34; You know some are nice, some are nicer, and some are really nice.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>very much - leaves my skin very soft and smooth, and I have to say that I do really like the container that it comes in - the way you can open and close it -</li>
            <li>this is all natural!!!</li>
            <li>This moisturizer soaks right into your skin and leaves your skin feeling very moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>I love the convenient pump top and that it only takes one pump to cover my whole face and neck meaning it will last quite a long time.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love it.</li>
            <li>that most other moisturizers may not offer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The one thing you do have to watch though is how much you press down to avoid getting more than you need in your hand.</li>
            <li>I only use gluten free ingredients, and it is so much easier when companies clearly label if a product is GF, which this product does.</li>
            <li>Usually lotions make my face way to greecy, but this one feels light and fresh!</li>
            <li>They shipped fast and was brand new in box.</li>
            <li>It has been working much better than my previous moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love the hidden pump.</li>
            <li>Like the array of ingredients particularly the omegas .</li>
            <li>The packaging is clever, but I could live with a more conventional dispenser to get more actual product or a larger version that lowers the cost per ounce.</li>
            <li>While I would normally use this during the warmer months, I have found that it is keeping my skin hydrated, soft and smooth when I am traditionally battling the flakes at this point.</li>
            <li>but I now see why it is so highly rated.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend ((:</li>
            <li>Since I am out of work I opted to try something that was rated high on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The product absorbed really quickly into the skin and left my skin definitely feeling hydrated, plumper and softer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always losing those little tops that come with most of my beauty products.</li>
            <li>After a little over a month of using this product, I can safely say I&#x27;ve seen results.</li>
            <li>Been using it over a week, so far I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Oleavine has made my skin dewy soft, and very hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I really like that it is made with natural and organic ingredients</li>
            <li>So far I really like this product</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a new moisturizer, I highly recommend this trying this product.</li>
            <li>I love a moisturizer that absorbs quickly into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave behind that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>and the key is to apply makeup right away.  </li>
            <li>I like this better than just a plain jane bottle.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is gorgeous with pink butterflies that resemble cherry blossom trees, The bottle is different from ANY other moisturizer bottles I&#x27;ve used in the past; the elegant dispenser has a twist top with a push down pump, And all you need is a pea sized amount for your whole face and neck area.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to determine if it helps with wrinkles but so far I&#x27;m enjoying this product.</li>
            <li>And the package does not even look new.</li>
            <li>Live and learn</li>
            <li>I actually received a few nice compliments from family/friends and co-workers.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and am having no problems with rashes or breaking out.  </li>
            <li>cream is very soft ,non greasy ,and maintain my face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly I want to add that my skin is very sensitive, and at times can be overly oily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first experience with using products from Oleavine Beauty, but this will not be my last.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to check out other products from Oleavine Beauty.</li>
            <li>My skin was feels so hydrated and soft!</li>
            <li>After thoroughly removing all my makeup (if I was wearing any that day) and cleansing my face with my regular cleanser, I applied a small dollop all over my face and neck--the pump nozzle comes in handy to squirt out just what you need.</li>
            <li>With the cold months upon us our skin tends to dry out and look much more weathered and old, but with the Oleavine moisturizer, we can combat the signs of aging while keeping our skin nicely hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>and I am surprised at how well this product is making my skin look and feel.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and we&#x27;ll hydrated and</li>
            <li>Seems to not bother my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Just a tiny bit is very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>We are glowing, and as soft as we were the day we were born.</li>
            <li>Its organic &amp; natural which is always a plus.</li>
            <li>When I look for a moisturizer, I look for something that uses natural ingredients, and that provides the benefits of a cream, in a light-weight, non-greasy lotion.</li>
            <li>So far I am liking this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Goes on so soft just like I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I have highly sensitive skin, so this did not surprise me.</li>
            <li>This Anti Aging Facial Moisturizer really works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy, watery moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I also noticed a natural glow when I applied it on.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised by the pump because I haven&#x27;t had any moisturizers that twists and then the pump pops out.</li>
            <li>Well, I do really like this moisturizer but wish the company would package it differently.</li>
            <li>This cream leaves my face soft, and it has soften my lines around my eyes too.</li>
            <li>So far I like this lotion</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to individuals with sensitive skin as well as acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>A natural skin moisturizer and anti inflammatory agent</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully on my sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Combined with the sensitive skin cerave face wash</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and had no problems with the  product.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and not oil.</li>
            <li>The Olivine Facial Moisturizer is such a fun product to use.</li>
            <li>This does it all and is perfect  for thin delicate eye areas as well as deeper wrinkles in the forehead and around your mouth etc.</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t be using it over the summer because there isn&#x27;t a sunscreen in it, but I have really enjoyed it over the last few months of winter.  </li>
            <li>I feel confident using this and comfortable knowing nothing bad is being absorbed into dry skin.</li>
            <li>The bottle it comes in is super cute and looks expensive while the product itself is actually quite affordable.</li>
            <li>I do like the bottle especially for travel, but I wish I could see how much product is left.</li>
            <li>Deep moisturizing, my skin feels so soft, has a youthful glow, but no greasy feel and the feeling of young, dewy skin lasts.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for a few days, but already I feel its benefits with silky smooth skin.</li>
            <li>After only a few days, my face feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Light weight, non greasy, a little goes a long way !</li>
            <li>I researched this product before buying and it was cheaper than bare minerals moisturizer.</li>
            <li>; it&#x27;s earthy, yet not heavy or poignant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 40 year old female with oily/dry skin who breakouts on the chin area.</li>
            <li>I usually purchase known brands, but took a chance on this after seeing the list of ingredients, which I hope is true.</li>
            <li>When you twist the top of it for the product to come out of the container when you push down, it aways seems to fall back down.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t speak to long term anti aging as I don&#x27;t use as often as recommended since my skin is so sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I went back to old moisturizer for a few days because I wanted to finish that one up, but realized how much I missed using the Oleavine.  </li>
            <li>; it makes the skin so soft and supple , hydrates all day long.</li>
            <li>In the past two years I&#x27;ve tried Burts Bees Intense Facial Cream With Clay Sage and Aveeno Active Natural Positively Radiant Cream.</li>
            <li>It is another anti-aging facial moisturizer which includes so many benefit in it/\.I actually needed a new facial moisturiser as I was so bored with my regular one.</li>
            <li>If you have little ones who always empty your beauty products for fun</li>
            <li>In brief, cold processing is much better when you use natural and organic ingredients because it preserves the quality of the ingredients, allowing them to do what they do.</li>

            <li> I use it morning and night and in the morning follow with a toner, a treatment, a Serum, and then Oleavine Moisturizer and it has been doing wonderful things for my skin and the back of my hands because I&#x27;ve been putting it there</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful way to moisturizer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> received this product free in exchange for my unbiased, honest review.</li>
            <li> but I really do love it.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s kind of important to me because I don&#x27;t want to put something on my face that smells funky.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> The pump pops up out of the top.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Skin feels lovely after application.</li>
            <li> It is light on the skin but affective!  </li>
            <li> well, I Love it beyond compare.  </li>
            <li> Even the Olivine Facial Moisturizer would make a great gift for your loved ones too.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s even better is the nature and benefit of the ingredients used in this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Some people love a matte finish and this would be for you.</li>
            <li> Instead I have been using this as my serum and applying thicker layer of moisturizer on top of it.</li>
            <li> Love the quality ingredients and that it&#x27;s made in the U.S.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> so I would know when to order more.</li>
            <li> Customer for life :)</li>
            <li> I love that the product went on smooth on the face and it was not oily it moisturize nicely, when I put it on in the morning</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging.</li>
            <li> I also love how you just twist the bottle to make the pump show up and twist again and the pump disappears.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is organic.  </li>
            <li> I love how this gives my skin a more balanced, refreshed look to it.</li>
            <li> This is okay but has not done any better than any of the over-the-counter products I have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not spend the money on buying another bottle.</li>
            <li> also love the airless pump.  </li>
            <li> Well, this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t need one because the bottle twists and the dispenser pops out of the top.</li>
            <li> and I think more companies should put more more effort and designs on their products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product!!</li>
            <li> I had to use a hammer to knock off the top</li>
            <li> I then have to knock the top off because the product won&#x27;t come out of the top.</li>
            <li> It has so many benefit for your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like a cream based but more like a lotion based moisturiser.</li>
            <li> I did received this for free to try out, but all opinions are my own.</li>

            <li> I love everything about it; from the packaging, to the nice light sent, to how it makes my face feel pampered, to how smoothly my makeup goes on over it.</li>
            <li> , that means the ingredients aren&#x27;t altered and stay more to their true form which means they do what they say they&#x27;re going to do!</li>
            <li> This has more of a lotion consistency, and I liked how quickly it absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> I also love that the container closes up easily for travel.</li>

            <li> This moisturizer does have a light, fresh (and -- amazingly -- tolerable) scent to it.  </li>
            <li> If you can easily afford the cost, go for it.</li>
            <li> It has a light and refreshing citrus smell which smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> The way the lid closes makes it easy to bring with you and not worry about leaks.</li>
            <li> I love the mild, floral scent, organic/natural ingredients, the ease of application on my skin, the way it feels on my face, and most importantly, the results.</li>
            <li> Also didn&#x27;t like the strong flowery scent.</li>
            <li> On top of that, Oleavine takes special care during the creation of this product through cold-processing.</li>
            <li> , I Love to get what I am promised, and I Love good science, and if I can trust it enough to use on my children…</li>

            <li> and I feel comfortable just using it without makeup on some days.</li>
            <li> It feels smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> This is such a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It goes on light, soaks in, and moisturizes thoroughly.</li>
            <li> and my makeup goes on so smoothly with it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light weight and not greasy.</li>

            <li> My skin feels smooth and supple after using it.</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on smoothly over this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face glowing and feeling smooth all day.</li>

            <li> GOES ON SMOOTHLY</li>
            <li> There are cheaper options available which are also free of chemicals.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It is smooth and one pump of the container is ample for covering the face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your skin silky smooth without a greasy residue....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural, organic and feels so good going on your skin.</li>
            <li> it work through the whole intire day, which I love because I didn&#x27;t have to put more in the evening.&lt;br</li>
            <li> On top of that this moisturizer is packed with a ton of other great ingredients to make my skin look &amp; feel luxuriously smooth.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t that bottle so pretty!!</li>
            <li> It is very neat and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I suffer from severely dry skin, and since I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer my skin has felt perfectly hydrated and looks much brighter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the packaging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loaded with Vitamins A, B.C + E, along with botanicals rich in Omegas 3, 6, 7 + 9.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth and my color is more toned and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend plus, the packaging is super cute and it makes it even more fun to use!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect much but am delighted with the result.</li>
            <li> You will completely fall in love with this product!</li>
            <li> Aside from being preservative free, paraben free, petroleum free, phthalate free, sulfate free, silicone free, cruelty free, gluten free, allergy free and non greasy, it uses several botanicals, plant stem cells and vitamins to lock in moisture while also improving the texture and tone of your skin.</li>
            <li> but this is non-greasy and leaves skin very smooth and ready to apply a foundation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer, but I&#x27;ve had other nice moisturizers.</li>
            <li> This one is just right for my skin!</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry, flaky skin and this is very effective.</li>
            <li> I have seen only good results.</li>
            <li> I liked that it made my face feel soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer, and so much so that I use it on my children.</li>
            <li> I also had better results with the Oleavine when I really rubbed it into my skin -</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with your product, only have to use small amount, works great !</li>
            <li> My skin feels really fresh and light.</li>
            <li> They gave me a full refund without me having to go through the hassle and confusion of returning the product.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t make my skin (more) oily, instead it really does balance my skin out.</li>
            <li> I really love the whole design of this product</li>
            <li> Overall, a good moisturizer</li>
            <li> The bottle is really cool too.</li>
            <li> Per Oleavine, this moisturizer is a  blend of skin rejuvenating botanicals rich in Omegas 3, 6, 7 &amp; 9 combined with powerful actives to help lock in moisture while improving texture and tone.</li>
            <li> It feels clean and fresh on the face.</li>
            <li> It does not leave a greasy coating and feels so fresh and clean when you apply it.  </li>
            <li> I personally would prefer the option of a mild fragrance, something reminiscent of the beautiful, feminine packaging!</li>
            <li> It tingles a bit when applied but quickly soaks into skin and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I Love clever</li>
            <li> I was so satisfied with the product that I have become a steady customer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very, happy that I finally found a product that actually does what it claims.</li>
            <li> The texture is serum-like which makes it penetrate quickly</li>
            <li> sure I was satisfied with the product and encouraging me to email them back if I had any questions or concerns.</li>
            <li> The product dries quickly and leaves a silky feel to it.</li>
            <li> I especially like the twist open and close cap, the best I have ever used!</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into your skin.</li>
            <li> and I feel like I started seeing results rather quickly as well.</li>
            <li> I expected more from the product I guess, haven&#x27;t seen any change, tho its a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and not messy at all.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very pretty and convenient.</li>
            <li> and I feel like I have seen a positive difference in the fine lines on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, it&#x27;s chemical free, organic, has nearly zero scent to it, and makes my skin feel and look more healthy while giving a radiant natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has become one of my new favorite beauty products.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it is very hydrating and blends easily and effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working nicely and has not made my sensitive skin break out, which is a major bonus as most products irritate or make my skin break out.</li>
            <li> First of all, the packaging is BEA-U-TIFUL, and unique in that</li>
            <li> So far, two thumbs up!  :)</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more before I run out!</li>
            <li> is stays fresh for the whole use!!</li>
            <li> I now have to say this is the Best Natural Facial Moisturizer I&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
            <li> Was using it for a few weeks when people started telling me how great my skin looked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not regular pimples, but some kind of raised bump that looks like a pimple but isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I was however extremely surprised and pleased with the customer service and care shown to me by Oleavine.</li>
            <li> It is a gorgeous design with pink butterflies.</li>
            <li> I love that its organic and natural cuse rest assured the chemicals in a lot of products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as good as some of the really expensive creams and serums I&#x27;ve tried but for such a great price!  </li>
            <li> absolutely love products that are natural and chemical free, and who wants all of those chemicals applied on their face?  </li>
            <li> It has the silky texture of a lotion rather than a heavy cream, which is important to me because I&#x27;m the kind of girl who gets hot at night really easily.</li>
            <li> Second this is allergy friendly, so I felt confident that it wouldn&#x27;t irritates my skin; and after using this myself, I&#x27;ve had no issues with any sensitivity to my skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent light feeling non greasy, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a special, more personal feature</li>
            <li> Plus the airless pump also ensures that I don&#x27;t stick my hands right into the moisturizer, which would allow germs and bacteria to enter.  </li>
            <li> Well, right into the product itself.</li>
            <li> The pump allows for just the right amount to be distributed without over dispensing.</li>
            <li> and it comes right out, no fussing with it.</li>
            <li> When I first used it though it was thinner than my prior moisturizer, however, this moisturizer made my makeup look SO amazing.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that does not respond very well to most chemical laced moisturizers.</li>
            <li> great product, small amount.</li>
            <li> Plus, the company actually checks in with you to make sure you&#x27;re 100 satisfied and offers services if you&#x27;re not.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer overall and am so glad that I found it!</li>
            <li> It has been very gentle to my skin and it gives me the right amount of moisture that I need.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li> , I really wish the product had even a mild fragrance.</li>
            <li> I recently received a complimentary sample of Oleavine&#x27;s Moisturizer + Rejuvenating Actives to test out, and this meets my expectations on so many levels.</li>
            <li> The Facial Moisturizer is an anti-aging serum and rejuvenating moisturizer in one so double duty in my book is great.</li>
            <li> It came super fast</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t found it to be anything special particularly for the price.</li>
            <li> I like it very much .But</li>
            <li> The reason you do not want a ton in your hand is that the product spreads out quite a bit and covers a good amount of area with just a little bit of product.</li>
            <li> moisturizer is especially great during the winter when the air is dry and my skin tends to be less hydrated and supple.</li>
            <li> It is more hydrated-especially for this time of year, the dark circles around my eyes are lightening up, and my fine lines are diminishing.</li>
            <li> I love that you don&#x27;t have to open a lid and</li>
            <li> I am pretty picky when it comes to using any product on my face...</li>
            <li> I put it on, and by the time I would be ready to put my makeup on, this is nicely absorbed into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And this is a personal preference more than anything</li>
            <li> The packaging and the bottle itself are quite pretty.</li>
            <li> Oleavine is leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It REALLY works!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer!  </li>
            <li> Very like it!</li>
            <li> so that means a whole lot!</li>
            <li> Just recieved this product and the bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> However,  I have not found it outstanding enough to warrant the price charged for a one ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> Spend all the money you want on facial moisturizer,but you will not find better than this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> But the fact that it is chemical free and has natural ingredients is what sold me on this</li>
            <li> Another thing I love about this mouisturizer is when you open your box, you&#x27;ll find a Thank</li>
            <li> I am actually thinking of ordering more.</li>
            <li> It is light and airy and not heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> And all I can say that this is my current favorite moisturizer for holiday.</li>
            <li> leaves skin soft and smooth, would buy again</li>
            <li> With this being on sale the price is really reasonable and I want to continue using it!</li>
            <li> As an Esthetician, when most of my clients come in for facial services</li>
            <li> , Aloe will keep your skin soft and smooth and keep the redness</li>
            <li> recommend this product to anyone that wants to have fresh youthful looking skin!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this is pretty</li>
            <li> I love how this feels and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Holy cow,  I really love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> It took some time to see the positive results but after finishing my first bottle I can say it&#x27;s made a difference.</li>
            <li> Other than that it was top notch 5 star worthy in my book,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that after using it for a few weeks the texture of my skin is slightly more smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like this product very much.  </li>
            <li> The moisturizer itself is a very light consistency and sinks into my skin immediately leaving it feeling soft and smooth, it doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of residue.</li>
            <li> I found that Oleavine Facial Moisturizer is very easy to dispense, just push down on the top</li>
            <li> It is an easy to use twist cap up and down jar, and expenses precise amounts of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This was my first product that I have tried from Oleavine and I can say that I really like it</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s good about it is that I have not had any breakouts since using the cream which typically happens when I try a new product.</li>
            <li> I felt that it absorbed too quickly and wanted to reapply but after the first week of use the difference in my skin showed that it was not necessary.</li>
            <li> I reccomend it more for night use right before bed due to the shine and the smell after a while.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lucky me, I&#x27;ve recently purchased this wonderful product above, Oleavine Beauty Professional Facial Moisturizer + Rejuvenating Actives.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and leaves my skin velvety soft.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my skin more dry.</li>
            <li> My stylish bottle is almost empty I have been using it SO much!</li>
            <li> This is my new lotion !!</li>
            <li> First and foremost, I simply love that Oleavine Facial Moisturizer is ALL NATURAL.</li>
            <li> I can see a difference in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am a moisturizer person because my face is normal to dry and espeacially here in a hot place, but now that is winter I have to put more moisturizer.</li>
            <li> May be a better fit during the summer, but for me during the winter, this is not enough for my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> now I am 100% sure my dry spots will be gone within a week!</li>
            <li> This my testimony; I have been using Oleavine for several days now, with and without make up, I notice a HUGE difference in the feel of my face.</li>
            <li> I really do like</li>
            <li> I lightly massaged the cream into my skin with my fingertips and then went to bed shortly</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so gentle</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> In just a few weeks my skin looked like the 29 year old I like to claim to be, which pleases the 39 year old that I am greatly.</li>
            <li> My sincerest compliments and thanks to Research &amp; Development at Olievine, for  </li>
            <li> Olievine&#x27;s moisturizer has done what none have accomplished before - appease the Censorious Scientist, the Anti-Age Avenger, and the Overbearing Momma in me.</li>
            <li> It really has made a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> The only reason I am not giving it five stars is because it is not 100% fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer works very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I am very picky with what I put on my face.</li>
            <li> and it has really helped soften it.</li>
            <li> My only 2 issues are: 1) it leaves my face shiny and 2) after about 3 hours, it starts making my face smell like cheap crayons.</li>
            <li> It basically healed my moderately sunburned shoulders in 2 days, and now I have a smooth and &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; looking tan (even though a tan is basically damage).</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really noticed much difference.</li>
            <li> It’s not too oily but it moisturizes my skin very well –</li>
            <li> I think it is very girly looking.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I think my skin feels much smoother with this moistur</li>
            <li> This Moisturizer really works.</li>
            <li> I like how you don&#x27;t need much product to moisturize your whole face.</li>
            <li> take much to cover</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like the moisturizer, and would give it 5 stars, but can&#x27;t get the product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisture cream.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is decorated very fancy looking.</li>
            <li> I especially appreciate that it is free from harmful chemical ingredients.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, nice-smelling, non-greasy and makes my face seem a tad younger.</li>
            <li> Light-weight, yet very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I do not see much difference though with lightening sun spots or acne scars.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it at all, but my wife really loves it.</li>
            <li> I really like the Oleavine Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a real difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> , I thought, &amp;#34;Another moisturizer..... and expected the same old, same old.&amp;#34; You know some are nice, some are nicer, and some are really nice.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> very much - leaves my skin very soft and smooth, and I have to say that I do really like the container that it comes in - the way you can open and close it -</li>
            <li> this is all natural!!!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer soaks right into your skin and leaves your skin feeling very moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> I love the convenient pump top and that it only takes one pump to cover my whole face and neck meaning it will last quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I love it.</li>
            <li> that most other moisturizers may not offer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one thing you do have to watch though is how much you press down to avoid getting more than you need in your hand.</li>
            <li> I only use gluten free ingredients, and it is so much easier when companies clearly label if a product is GF, which this product does.</li>
            <li> Usually lotions make my face way to greecy, but this one feels light and fresh!</li>
            <li> They shipped fast and was brand new in box.</li>
            <li> It has been working much better than my previous moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love the hidden pump.</li>
            <li> Like the array of ingredients particularly the omegas .</li>
            <li> The packaging is clever, but I could live with a more conventional dispenser to get more actual product or a larger version that lowers the cost per ounce.</li>
            <li> While I would normally use this during the warmer months, I have found that it is keeping my skin hydrated, soft and smooth when I am traditionally battling the flakes at this point.</li>
            <li> but I now see why it is so highly rated.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend ((:</li>
            <li> Since I am out of work I opted to try something that was rated high on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The product absorbed really quickly into the skin and left my skin definitely feeling hydrated, plumper and softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always losing those little tops that come with most of my beauty products.</li>
            <li> After a little over a month of using this product, I can safely say I&#x27;ve seen results.</li>
            <li> Been using it over a week, so far I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Oleavine has made my skin dewy soft, and very hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I really like that it is made with natural and organic ingredients</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a new moisturizer, I highly recommend this trying this product.</li>
            <li> I love a moisturizer that absorbs quickly into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave behind that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> and the key is to apply makeup right away.  </li>
            <li> I like this better than just a plain jane bottle.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is gorgeous with pink butterflies that resemble cherry blossom trees, The bottle is different from ANY other moisturizer bottles I&#x27;ve used in the past; the elegant dispenser has a twist top with a push down pump, And all you need is a pea sized amount for your whole face and neck area.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to determine if it helps with wrinkles but so far I&#x27;m enjoying this product.</li>
            <li> And the package does not even look new.</li>
            <li> Live and learn</li>
            <li> I actually received a few nice compliments from family/friends and co-workers.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am having no problems with rashes or breaking out.  </li>
            <li> cream is very soft ,non greasy ,and maintain my face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly I want to add that my skin is very sensitive, and at times can be overly oily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first experience with using products from Oleavine Beauty, but this will not be my last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to check out other products from Oleavine Beauty.</li>
            <li> My skin was feels so hydrated and soft!</li>
            <li> After thoroughly removing all my makeup (if I was wearing any that day) and cleansing my face with my regular cleanser, I applied a small dollop all over my face and neck--the pump nozzle comes in handy to squirt out just what you need.</li>
            <li> With the cold months upon us our skin tends to dry out and look much more weathered and old, but with the Oleavine moisturizer, we can combat the signs of aging while keeping our skin nicely hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> and I am surprised at how well this product is making my skin look and feel.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and we&#x27;ll hydrated and</li>
            <li> Seems to not bother my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Just a tiny bit is very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> We are glowing, and as soft as we were the day we were born.</li>
            <li> Its organic &amp; natural which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> When I look for a moisturizer, I look for something that uses natural ingredients, and that provides the benefits of a cream, in a light-weight, non-greasy lotion.</li>
            <li> So far I am liking this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Goes on so soft just like I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have highly sensitive skin, so this did not surprise me.</li>
            <li> This Anti Aging Facial Moisturizer really works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy, watery moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I also noticed a natural glow when I applied it on.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised by the pump because I haven&#x27;t had any moisturizers that twists and then the pump pops out.</li>
            <li> Well, I do really like this moisturizer but wish the company would package it differently.</li>
            <li> This cream leaves my face soft, and it has soften my lines around my eyes too.</li>
            <li> So far I like this lotion</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to individuals with sensitive skin as well as acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> A natural skin moisturizer and anti inflammatory agent</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully on my sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Combined with the sensitive skin cerave face wash</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and had no problems with the  product.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and not oil.</li>
            <li> The Olivine Facial Moisturizer is such a fun product to use.</li>
            <li> This does it all and is perfect  for thin delicate eye areas as well as deeper wrinkles in the forehead and around your mouth etc.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t be using it over the summer because there isn&#x27;t a sunscreen in it, but I have really enjoyed it over the last few months of winter.  </li>
            <li> I feel confident using this and comfortable knowing nothing bad is being absorbed into dry skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle it comes in is super cute and looks expensive while the product itself is actually quite affordable.</li>
            <li> I do like the bottle especially for travel, but I wish I could see how much product is left.</li>
            <li> Deep moisturizing, my skin feels so soft, has a youthful glow, but no greasy feel and the feeling of young, dewy skin lasts.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few days, but already I feel its benefits with silky smooth skin.</li>
            <li> After only a few days, my face feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Light weight, non greasy, a little goes a long way !</li>
            <li> I researched this product before buying and it was cheaper than bare minerals moisturizer.</li>
            <li> ; it&#x27;s earthy, yet not heavy or poignant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 40 year old female with oily/dry skin who breakouts on the chin area.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase known brands, but took a chance on this after seeing the list of ingredients, which I hope is true.</li>
            <li> When you twist the top of it for the product to come out of the container when you push down, it aways seems to fall back down.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t speak to long term anti aging as I don&#x27;t use as often as recommended since my skin is so sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I went back to old moisturizer for a few days because I wanted to finish that one up, but realized how much I missed using the Oleavine.  </li>
            <li> ; it makes the skin so soft and supple , hydrates all day long.</li>
            <li> In the past two years I&#x27;ve tried Burts Bees Intense Facial Cream With Clay Sage and Aveeno Active Natural Positively Radiant Cream.</li>
            <li> It is another anti-aging facial moisturizer which includes so many benefit in it/\.I actually needed a new facial moisturiser as I was so bored with my regular one.</li>
            <li> If you have little ones who always empty your beauty products for fun</li>
            <li> In brief, cold processing is much better when you use natural and organic ingredients because it preserves the quality of the ingredients, allowing them to do what they do.</li>
            <li> So it is hard to find the right moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too thick nor too runny, just the right consistency for me.</li>
            <li> After trying the moisturizer for a couple of weeks, I didn&#x27;t see a decrease in the slight burning sensation, so I emailed them asking if it was normal.</li>
            <li> Will order again and maybe do a little research to see what else they make to go with this for older skin type.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m pretty naive.</li>
            <li> I normally give my moisturizer a few minutes to &amp;#34;settle&amp;#34; before I start putting my makeup on anyway, and I never have an issue when I use the Oleavine Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> When I first apply it, I take a small amount and apply it in a circular motion, and then when I applied the foundation and blush, I noticed that the makeup did not feel greasy at all!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin, especially around the nose and cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from dry skin and couple days were enough for the turnaround.</li>
            <li> probably more so) using my less expensive lotion, so I think I&#x27;ll save the money in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought another tube since I have a long trip coming up</li>
            <li> I love Oleavine because it has organic and natural ingredients that don’t make my skin go crazy!</li>
            <li> I think this just gives the product that extra something over other moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use any other facial substitute lotion, just a smidge of Oleavine</li>
            <li> The list of ingredients is similar to other face moisturizers out there that cost a fortune yet</li>
            <li> After it settles in or seems to dry a bit, I apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> Before I would slather on tons of moisturizer in the morning,  and still have dry flakes after applying my powder foundation.  </li>
            <li> If I forget one day to put it on my face, that day my face will not feel dry at all.</li>
            <li> It keeps the dry areas of my face moisturized but doesn&#x27;t make the oilier parts greasy.</li>
            <li> but I still have dry patches on my face.</li>
            <li> It works for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin gets so dry that it peels on my nose and chin.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Lancome or other high end moisturizers.</li>
            <li> They promptly responded stating that a burning sensation is not normal, and that maybe my skin wasn&#x27;t agreeing with one of the ingredients in the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If you are not completely satisfied, the company offers a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee.</li>
            <li> My pores minimized and there&#x27;s definite improvement around the eye area, particularly my dark circles.</li>
            <li> The previous moisturizer I was using left my face feeling dry but this doesn&#x27;t do that.  </li>
            <li> I really appreciate their hard work on packaging too!</li>
            <li> However, when I applied the moisturizer to my face, there was a slight burning sensation, especially around my lips.</li>
            <li> but they look less obvious.</li>
            <li> so soft and dry patches are slowly going away</li>
            <li> My skin a soft glow instead of an oily sheen that I have had in the past from other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I mix it with a pump of hyaluronic acid to make is smoother and it goes a little bit further.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I would like to see is maybe a little gap in the tube</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t feel bad about what I am using on my face and can feel confident in the product I am using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I use it sparingly since it is rather expensive but worth it.  </li>
            <li> It even works in the dead of winter, for all those around me are red and chapped, except me and mine.</li>
            <li> It is thin, no grease, and really soaks in.</li>
            <li> In fact, I have absolutely no problems with the moisturizer</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I find myself having to wait 30 or minutes before putting on makeup with other moisturizers, but not with this.</li>
            <li> I could use it instead of eye cream and it won&#x27;t irritate my eyes like other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I am extremely allergic to all chemical scents.  </li>
            <li> I never had redness or a breakout, which I&#x27;ve had with other lotions.</li>
            <li> I have used other products from this company and am hooked on the Konjac Sponge ( a must try ..</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> My face looks a little pink.  </li>
            <li> Very little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it to go through this again.  </li>
            <li> It goes on softly and leaves no greasy or oily feeling behind.  </li>
            <li> As the cold weather approaches, my face dries out quickly, and it is so hard for me because it starts to flake and my makeup always looks patchy and dry without any glow.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other moisturizers and the scent of this one beats them all!</li>
            <li> I used this moisturizer every single night for the past 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s less than $.25 a day</li>
            <li> You would not drink half the stuff thats in beauty products</li>
            <li> but I continue to have problems after I have used about half.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do half the things it claims to do.</li>
            <li> I have to go wash my face now because I feel a slight burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> I like that they use little to no heat when making this moisturizer</li>
            <li> My skin does feel a little firmer &amp; clearer.</li>
            <li> Not to heavy.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for few weeks</li>
            <li> I like the slender container because it takes up very little space on my cosmetic shelf and little space in my make-up bag when traveling.  </li>
            <li> I was using a very expensive product, then tried Oleavine, and I like it just as much as the one triple the price.  </li>
            <li> No more dried up moisturizer at the tip of thw pump</li>
            <li> I was buying it as a gift, and it&#x27;s pathetically small when it arrived.</li>
            <li> I just think is lttle bit too small .</li>
            <li> I am an analytical biochemist, a mother of two small children, and about to turn 40 in a matter of weeks.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will be buying again,</li>
            <li> No more peeling the skin with tweezers...</li>
            <li> Ill definitely be buying again when this bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> Lots of other moisturizer on the market are full of chemicals and cost an outrageous sum of money.</li>
            <li> At least it didn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> The texture wasn&#x27;t too thick like a butter nor too runny like an elixir or serum.</li>
            <li> No more!  </li>
            <li> No more lotion all over your cosmetic bag!</li>
            <li> seriously) I have found that adding this into my skincare routine along with the Konjac Sponge  had improved my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I am so shocked at other reviewers complaining about the price.</li>
            <li> No more complicated skin care routine for me!</li>
            <li> So it can be difficult to get the product out.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel like I am using a really expensive product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I saw all the 5 stars, but I ordered anyway because it wasn&#x27;t a bad price.  </li>
            <li> Quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> It works well even for these cold winter days.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed, so I contacted the company.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this product and am sure I will order it again,  I especially love the convenience of the dispensing of it.  I love that you don&#x27;t have to open a lid and the way it opens and closes,  Its a good day moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am pretty picky when it comes to using any product on my face...I know! I know!  I should use moisturizer!  So, when I was given the opportunity to try a facial moisturizer by Oleavine, I had to jump on board. Per Oleavine, this moisturizer is a  blend of skin rejuvenating botanicals rich in Omegas 3, 6, 7 &amp; 9 combined with powerful actives to help lock in moisture while improving texture and tone. Featuring Plant Stem Cells, Vitamins A, B &amp; C along with Hyaluronic Acid.  I wanted to get a closer look at the packaging.  Even it this was not Oleavine, the packaging alone would have drawn me in.  It is soooo cute and I LOVE butterflies.  I think this just gives the product that extra something over other moisturizers.  This has more of a lotion consistency, and I liked how quickly it absorbed into my skin. I find myself having to wait 30 or minutes before putting on makeup with other moisturizers, but not with this. I put it on, and by the time I would be ready to put my makeup on, this is nicely absorbed into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that this is chemical free.  I have very sensitive skin and this has not caused any drying, peeling, or acne.  I have been using it for about a week, and plan to continue to use this daily.  I really do like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall impressions...another great product from Oleavine. I was able to try this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! Oleavine beauty professional moisturizer with rejuvenating actives feels just wonderful  on my face. The packaging is beautiful, too, and adds a touch of class to my counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was given the opportunity to receive this product for review, I thought, &amp;#34;Another moisturizer..... and expected the same old, same old.&amp;#34; You know some are nice, some are nicer, and some are really nice. And then you get some that one application is all they get on your skin and then you toss them. Not so with Oleavine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oleavine beauty is a keeper. I have seen only good results. My face has a nice feel, a bit of a glow, and I just feel really good about using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day. Most of the time after I&#x27;ve cleaned my face and applied a bit of a serum (hyaluronic acid and/or vitamin c), I apply this lovely moisturizer. After it settles in or seems to dry a bit, I apply my makeup. Oleavine works great with my makeup and I feel comfortable just using it without makeup on some days.</li>
            <li> I used this moisturizer every single night for the past 3 weeks. After thoroughly removing all my makeup (if I was wearing any that day) and cleansing my face with my regular cleanser, I applied a small dollop all over my face and neck--the pump nozzle comes in handy to squirt out just what you need. I lightly massaged the cream into my skin with my fingertips and then went to bed shortly thereafter.&lt;br /&gt;I really liked this cream--it&#x27;s not too thick nor too runny, just the right consistency for me. It has the silky texture of a lotion rather than a heavy cream, which is important to me because I&#x27;m the kind of girl who gets hot at night really easily. A sticky face is not for me! The product absorbed really quickly into the skin and left my skin definitely feeling hydrated, plumper and softer. All in all, it felt really great! My only quibble? And this is a personal preference more than anything, I really wish the product had even a mild fragrance. When they said fragrance free, they weren&#x27;t kidding around! I personally would prefer the option of a mild fragrance, something reminiscent of the beautiful, feminine packaging!</li>
            <li> Been using it over a week, so far I really like it.  They shipped fast and was brand new in box. Will order again and maybe do a little research to see what else they make to go with this for older skin type.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer with all the added benefits of my favorite vitamin c serum. The texture wasn&#x27;t too thick like a butter nor too runny like an elixir or serum. I liked that it made my face feel soft and not greasy. My skin a soft glow instead of an oily sheen that I have had in the past from other moisturizers. I felt that it absorbed too quickly and wanted to reapply but after the first week of use the difference in my skin showed that it was not necessary. I would like to have seen an added SPF sl that I could use it alone without my daily sunblock. Other than that it was top notch 5 star worthy in my book,</li>
            <li> This moisturizer feels great on my face and does not feel greasy or oily.  A little goes a long way.  I have very sensitive skin and am having no problems with rashes or breaking out.  Also, I am in my 60&#x27;s and I am surprised at how well this product is making my skin look and feel.  I really didn&#x27;t expect much but am delighted with the result.</li>
            <li> I now have to say this is the Best Natural Facial Moisturizer I&#x27;ve used thus far. In the past two years I&#x27;ve tried Burts Bees Intense Facial Cream With Clay Sage and Aveeno Active Natural Positively Radiant Cream. Both products, Burts Bees and Aveeno Naturals, made my face break out uncontrollably with acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucky me, I&#x27;ve recently purchased this wonderful product above, Oleavine Beauty Professional Facial Moisturizer + Rejuvenating Actives. I purchased through Amazon, great speedy delivery and nice packaging. It is an easy to use twist cap up and down jar, and expenses precise amounts of moisturizer. This my testimony; I have been using Oleavine for several days now, with and without make up, I notice a HUGE difference in the feel of my face. I use it once in the morning, and at night before bed after cleansing. I don&#x27;t have to use any other facial substitute lotion, just a smidge of Oleavine and I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since I received it and i can see a difference on my skin. It feels smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I was buying it as a gift, and it&#x27;s pathetically small when it arrived. And the package does not even look new. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t that bottle so pretty!! The picture doesn&#x27;t even do it justice! Oleavine gave me this Moisturizer for testing purposes, to try and review on my blog and it&#x27;s amazing! I have been using this for 1 month and can totally see results! I use it morning and night and in the morning follow with a toner, a treatment, a Serum, and then Oleavine Moisturizer and it has been doing wonderful things for my skin and the back of my hands because I&#x27;ve been putting it there too!&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful Moisturizer and I would truly recommend this to anyone looking for a very good Moisturizer looking to see results!&lt;br /&gt;This would make a wonderful gift for any Beauty Queen!</li>
            <li> Not greasy, light weight and great for all day wear.</li>
            <li> Extremely happy with product and service.</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful way to moisturizer! It is not only pretty and makes a wonderful gift for the women in your life but it also works so well! I LOVE THIS STUFF! I have acne and use a lot of topical ointments for it so moisturizer is a must for me and this stuff is wonderful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Very little goes a long way.  I mix it with a pump of hyaluronic acid to make is smoother and it goes a little bit further.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, I simply love that Oleavine Facial Moisturizer is ALL NATURAL. The packaging and the bottle itself are quite pretty. The moisturizer has a light fragrance that smells clean and refreshing. It goes on smooth and not greasy, which is important to me; I hate it when a lotion or serum makes it feel greasy. Oleavine is leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth. It looks brighter and feels great. I would recommend giving Oleavine a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free in exchange for my unbiased, honest review. All opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> It REALLY works! It deeply moisturizes without leaving you skin feeling greasy. All the nutrients that your skin needs to look beautiful.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife and she totally loved it from the first day. She has very sensitive skin and this moisturizer works perfect with her skin.</li>
            <li> Gave me a glow I didn&#x27;t have before! Love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent light feeling non greasy, a little goes a long way.I will purchase again. Also the price is very good for an all natural &amp; organic product. I trust this company</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks but I really do love it.  I like the smell and that&#x27;s kind of important to me because I don&#x27;t want to put something on my face that smells funky.  The previous moisturizer I was using left my face feeling dry but this doesn&#x27;t do that.  My skin feels hydrated.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to determine if it helps with wrinkles but so far I&#x27;m enjoying this product.</li>
            <li> My sister gave me Oleavine as part of a Christmas gift. She had never used it, and I had never heard of it.  Love it.  It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  I use it sparingly since it is rather expensive but worth it.  Ordered this bottle because I had used up the one I received as a gift.  Would and  have recommended to others.  The pump is half-screw to open and close the same way.  The pump pops up out of the top. Love it.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer.  Not greasy or gummy. Great alone or under makeup.  Easy to use and store packaging. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> It took some time to see the positive results but after finishing my first bottle I can say it&#x27;s made a difference. I am on my third bottle now and it&#x27;s made a big difference in how I feel about my appearance. I don&#x27;t feel the need to add extra anti aging products or moisturizers. I do add a spf cream though as this product doesn&#x27;t contain that. If you buy this don&#x27;t expect instant results...give it time to change your skin.</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer. Not to heavy. Love the unique bottle, easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> This is such a great moisturizer. I&#x27;m so glad I bought it. Leaves my skin soft and we&#x27;ll hydrated and it&#x27;s so gentle I could use it instead of eye cream and it won&#x27;t irritate my eyes like other moisturizers. It&#x27;s all natural, organic and feels so good going on your skin. Will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful creamy very absorbable lotion.  Seems to not bother my sensitive skin.  Can&#x27;t speak to long term anti aging as I don&#x27;t use as often as recommended since my skin is so sensitive.  Just a tiny bit is very moisturizing.  Good value.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer!  It is smooth, non-greasy and works great under make-up.  I will definitely purchasing another bottle of this before I run out of my current one!  ♥</li>
            <li> I researched this product before buying and it was cheaper than bare minerals moisturizer. I&#x27;ve loved it ever since! It tingles a bit when applied but quickly soaks into skin and is non-greasy. And I think it&#x27;s helped keep my skin younger looking!</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Skin feels lovely after application.</li>
            <li> products is good I just think is lttle bit too small . But I recommend it. Thanks</li>
            <li> My husband found this moisturizer for me, and he was impressed with all the beneficial ingredients found in the product. Lots of other moisturizer on the market are full of chemicals and cost an outrageous sum of money. That&#x27;s way I am so shocked at other reviewers complaining about the price. They need to go to some department store and check out prices for an ounce of moisturizer. Anyway, BEAUTY moisturizer delivers. It is light on the skin but affective!  I can see a difference in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, especially around my eyes. Do yourself a favor and purchase a bottle of this anti-aging miracle. You have nothing to lose but lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working nicely and has not made my sensitive skin break out, which is a major bonus as most products irritate or make my skin break out.</li>
            <li> The quality is very good. Very like it!</li>
            <li> My new favorite moisturizer!!  It feels so good on my skin! I love it!</li>
            <li> I am an analytical biochemist, a mother of two small children, and about to turn 40 in a matter of weeks. I love this moisturizer, and so much so that I use it on my children. It even works in the dead of winter, for all those around me are red and chapped, except me and mine. We are glowing, and as soft as we were the day we were born. In just a few weeks my skin looked like the 29 year old I like to claim to be, which pleases the 39 year old that I am greatly. The packaging even shows the thought and care that went into developing this product. The pump delivers the perfect amount and the clever closure that not only ensures that no product is lost, but, praise the Beauty Product Gods, there is No cap to obsess over losing either! I Love clever, I Love to get what I am promised, and I Love good science, and if I can trust it enough to use on my children… well, I Love it beyond compare.  My sincerest compliments and thanks to Research &amp; Development at Olievine, for  Olievine&#x27;s moisturizer has done what none have accomplished before - appease the Censorious Scientist, the Anti-Age Avenger, and the Overbearing Momma in me.</li>
            <li> This is actually a re-order for me.  I was so satisfied with the product that I have become a steady customer.  I am always looking for organic products and have been very pleased with this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Like the array of ingredients particularly the omegas . It is also  not greasy. Just started. Am hoping will maintain youthful features</li>
            <li> The Olivine Facial Moisturizer is such a fun product to use. Its organic &amp; natural which is always a plus. On top of that this moisturizer is packed with a ton of other great ingredients to make my skin look &amp; feel luxuriously smooth. Even the Olivine Facial Moisturizer would make a great gift for your loved ones too.</li>
            <li> Initially, I liked this product a lot.  But after about a month of using it I have noticed breakouts in my face.  It&#x27;s not regular pimples, but some kind of raised bump that looks like a pimple but isn&#x27;t.  I stopped using the product and this problem went away.  Quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> great product, small amount.</li>
            <li> A very good moisturizer. I need a heavier cream at night and this one is perfect for daytime use.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!!! It really has made a difference in my skin.  I have extremely dry skin, especially around the nose and cheeks.  Before I would slather on tons of moisturizer in the morning,  and still have dry flakes after applying my powder foundation.  No more!  Oleavine has made my skin dewy soft, and very hydrated.  Olevine is now a must for my daily skin care regimen when prepping my skin in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very, happy that I finally found a product that actually does what it claims.</li>
            <li> When I look for a moisturizer, I look for something that uses natural ingredients, and that provides the benefits of a cream, in a light-weight, non-greasy lotion. I recently received a complimentary sample of Oleavine&#x27;s Moisturizer + Rejuvenating Actives to test out, and this meets my expectations on so many levels. First of all, the packaging is BEA-U-TIFUL, and unique in that you twist-up the pump-top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s even better is the nature and benefit of the ingredients used in this moisturizer. Aside from being preservative free, paraben free, petroleum free, phthalate free, sulfate free, silicone free, cruelty free, gluten free, allergy free and non greasy, it uses several botanicals, plant stem cells and vitamins to lock in moisture while also improving the texture and tone of your skin. On top of that, Oleavine takes special care during the creation of this product through cold-processing. In brief, cold processing is much better when you use natural and organic ingredients because it preserves the quality of the ingredients, allowing them to do what they do. If things are refined and processed in heat, they are often damaged, and will not function as they would in nature. Plus, this moisturizer has a nice, clean scent which reminds me of a spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, it is nice and creamy, making it easy to absorb. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy or slimy whatsoever. I normally give my moisturizer a few minutes to &amp;#34;settle&amp;#34; before I start putting my makeup on anyway, and I never have an issue when I use the Oleavine Moisturizer. While I would normally use this during the warmer months, I have found that it is keeping my skin hydrated, soft and smooth when I am traditionally battling the flakes at this point. Very impressed and pleasantly surprised by that!</li>
            <li> A wonderful moisturizer!  This is as close to organic you can get without making your own moisturizer at home.  Just read the list of ingredients!!!  I am extremely allergic to all chemical scents.  Even though the box said &amp;#34;allergy friendly&amp;#34; I was concerned.  This moisturizer does have a light, fresh (and -- amazingly -- tolerable) scent to it.  It goes on softly and leaves no greasy or oily feeling behind.  I highly recommend this product!  The only reason I am not giving it five stars is because it is not 100% fragrance free.  I ordered Standard Delivery and it was here within three days.  I will be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> So far I am liking this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on good reviews and reasonable price. I do like the bottle especially for travel, but I wish I could see how much product is left. The scent is very light and does not linger once you apply it. The texture is serum-like which makes it penetrate quickly but I was hoping for a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t disappear entirely into my skin. Some people love a matte finish and this would be for you. I always strive for a dewy finish, almost shiny, so this isn&#x27;t enough for me. Instead I have been using this as my serum and applying thicker layer of moisturizer on top of it.</li>
            <li> Love this! Goes on so soft just like I was looking for. Up there with the $90 lotion I tried. Except this one actually works! Was using it for a few weeks when people started telling me how great my skin looked. Just had my 50th birthday so that means a whole lot! This is my new lotion !!</li>
            <li> it makes your face feeling so good. i have lots of wrinlkles frome riding a motorcycle fr 30 years wish i had this years ago,</li>
            <li> I love how this moisturizer seeps into my skin! No greasy film. I can apply my make up soon after application.</li>
            <li> By far the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. Does not make my face oily at all. Since using just a couple weeks ago my face is smoother and zero breakouts! I only use gluten free ingredients, and it is so much easier when companies clearly label if a product is GF, which this product does. Love the quality ingredients and that it&#x27;s made in the U.S.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I saw all the 5 stars, but I ordered anyway because it wasn&#x27;t a bad price.  When I first used it though it was thinner than my prior moisturizer, however, this moisturizer made my makeup look SO amazing.  I went back to old moisturizer for a few days because I wanted to finish that one up, but realized how much I missed using the Oleavine.  I also had better results with the Oleavine when I really rubbed it into my skin - I massaged it in my skin until it was absorb....and the key is to apply makeup right away.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with your product, only have to use small amount, works great !</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works very well.  I will definately order again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. The price point on this moisturizer is perfect. I&#x27;ve been using the same tube (2 pumps each use) every night since mid-November and I still haven&#x27;t run out. That&#x27;s less than $.25 a day and I&#x27;m still counting! I like the smell; it&#x27;s earthy, yet not heavy or poignant. My skin feels really fresh and light. I never had redness or a breakout, which I&#x27;ve had with other lotions. I especially LOVE the twist top. I already took it on two flights and the size and twist top make it ideal for carry-on travel. The only thing that I would like to see is maybe a little gap in the tube so I would know when to order more. I bought another tube since I have a long trip coming up and I don&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, I like the smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of Murad moisturizer because of the price and good reviews. I have been very happy with it. It goes on light, soaks in, and moisturizes thoroughly. I also love that the container closes up easily for travel. I tend to have dry, flaky skin and this is very effective.</li>
            <li> Just recieved this product and the bottle is pretty. The moisturizer smells nice as well. It goes on smooth and makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I really like this product very much.  It is lotion looking but acts like a serum.  I like the way my skin looks and my makeup goes on so smoothly with it.  Also my face isn&#x27;t greasy and my skin looks bright.  I was using a very expensive product, then tried Oleavine, and I like it just as much as the one triple the price.  I have switched to Oleavine.</li>
            <li> This is a nice moisturizer without a doubt. However,  I have not found it outstanding enough to warrant the price charged for a one ounce bottle. The packaging is clever, but I could live with a more conventional dispenser to get more actual product or a larger version that lowers the cost per ounce. If you can easily afford the cost, go for it.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with almost everything about the product. The smell, feel, quality, and packaging were all above my expectations. However, when I applied the moisturizer to my face, there was a slight burning sensation, especially around my lips. Oleavine had sent me an email making sure I was satisfied with the product and encouraging me to email them back if I had any questions or concerns. After trying the moisturizer for a couple of weeks, I didn&#x27;t see a decrease in the slight burning sensation, so I emailed them asking if it was normal. They promptly responded stating that a burning sensation is not normal, and that maybe my skin wasn&#x27;t agreeing with one of the ingredients in the moisturizer. I have highly sensitive skin, so this did not surprise me. I was however extremely surprised and pleased with the customer service and care shown to me by Oleavine. They gave me a full refund without me having to go through the hassle and confusion of returning the product. So, although the moisturizer didn&#x27;t turn out like I&#x27;d hoped, the understanding and quality of the customer service was beyond five stars and the best I have ever received.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have oily skin. So it is hard to find the right moisturizer.  I am very picky with what I put on my face. This bottle is great! It is a gorgeous design with pink butterflies. The product dries quickly and leaves a silky feel to it. It is thin, no grease, and really soaks in. I have a deep \\&quot;frown line\\&quot; between my eyes and it has really helped soften it. That is a huge plus! My only 2 issues are: 1) it leaves my face shiny and 2) after about 3 hours, it starts making my face smell like cheap crayons. Other than that, I love it. I reccomend it more for night use right before bed due to the shine and the smell after a while. I will buy this again though. It has helped my skin greatly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle in a matter of months because I also use it on parts of my body. Wish it came in a 16 oz or something! It basically healed my moderately sunburned shoulders in 2 days, and now I have a smooth and &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; looking tan (even though a tan is basically damage). Customer for life :)</li>
            <li> An amazing product. Deep moisturizing, my skin feels so soft, has a youthful glow, but no greasy feel and the feeling of young, dewy skin lasts. I&#x27;m not a person that has patience for a skincare &amp;#34;routine&amp;#34; with 6 products and 8 steps. This does it all and is perfect  for thin delicate eye areas as well as deeper wrinkles in the forehead and around your mouth etc. It&#x27;s great alone or under makeup and Amazon pricing makes it affordable. Spend all the money you want on facial moisturizer,but you will not find better than this product. The fact that it&#x27;s organic and not full of chemicals is amazing and the very best part. I just turned 40 and will be using this lotion for years to come.</li>
            <li> This was my first product that I have tried from Oleavine and I can say that I really like it I am a moisturizer person because my face is normal to dry and espeacially here in a hot place, but now that is winter I have to put more moisturizer. Not only the box is beautiful but the bottle is catchy and amazing looking too. I love that the product went on smooth on the face and it was not oily it moisturize nicely, when I put it on in the morning it work through the whole intire day, which I love because I didn&#x27;t have to put more in the evening.&lt;br /&gt; I was able to try this product in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li> I am currently using this product and I like it..</li>
            <li> I like it, it is very light, which is perfect for summer. Not sure if I will be buying again, didn&#x27;t really noticed much difference. Like the pump!</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product but I now see why it is so highly rated. You only need a little bit and my skin looks great! Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Very light and easy to apply, no skin irritation at all. Perfect for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Okay I have a mole on my face what ever is in this cream is  shrinking my mole! This stuff is amazing  . I have only been using it 2 weeks my skin feels amazing this is all natural!!! But I can&#x27;t buy this anyone I can&#x27;t find it anymore on amazon I want to buy more !!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is really good and suitable for my skin .The cream is very soft ,non greasy ,and maintain my face moisturizer.I like it very much .But I don&#x27;t like it&#x27;s frangences.</li>
            <li> Love it! I have purchased several bottles. It feels clean and fresh on the face. I especially like the twist open and close cap, the best I have ever used! This bottle is easy to open, close, and great for travel. No more lotion all over your cosmetic bag!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. The top is amazing by the way. Very easy to use and not messy at all. I have sensitive skin and this product works perfect. I did get this as part of a review and have been so happy with it. My current moisturizer had just run out when I got this to try so it was perfect timing. I have used other products from this company and am hooked on the Konjac Sponge ( a must try ..seriously) I have found that adding this into my skincare routine along with the Konjac Sponge  had improved my acne prone skin. People have even asked what I have been doing different.  The Facial Moisturizer is an anti-aging serum and rejuvenating moisturizer in one so double duty in my book is great. I love that its organic and natural cuse rest assured the chemicals in a lot of products o the market are not. You would not drink half the stuff thats in beauty products so why would you ever put it on your skin to absorb? Think about that. I feel confident using this and comfortable knowing nothing bad is being absorbed into dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that does not respond very well to most chemical laced moisturizers. I love Oleavine because it has organic and natural ingredients that don’t make my skin go crazy! It has been very gentle to my skin and it gives me the right amount of moisture that I need. It’s not too oily but it moisturizes my skin very well – it’s perfect for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging. I think it is very girly looking. I like this better than just a plain jane bottle. I also love how you just twist the bottle to make the pump show up and twist again and the pump disappears. If you have little ones who always empty your beauty products for fun then you definitely want to get this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer is great too. I have added it to my daily beauty regimen. It leaves my skin nice and soft. It has been working much better than my previous moisturizer. I was provided this product at no cost in order to facilitate a review. This review is based on my own honest opinion of, and experience with, this product. Yours may differ</li>
            <li> This is the the perfect moisturizer for me! I have combination, acne-prone skin that tends to be oily in some areas and dry/flaky in others. This one is just right for my skin! It absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and leaves my skin velvety soft. No more complicated skin care routine for me! Now all I need are this and Clarisea Skintox Activated Charcoal soap bar (found at clarisea.com). Using these 2 products, my skin has literally never looked better, and people notice! I really hope this gets relaunched on Amazon soon, because this would be a great gift for the women in my life!</li>
            <li> I love that this product is organic.  It is a really nice moisturizer with really good ingredients.  I use on face and hands before bed.  My skin is definitely softer!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product !  Love it!</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer. I think my skin feels much smoother with this moistur</li>
            <li> This Anti Aging Facial Moisturizer really works. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin more dry. If I forget one day to put it on my face, that day my face will not feel dry at all. This Moisturizer really works. I love this product and it also smells good. When I apply this product to my face and neck it feels so refreshing, which is always a great feeling! The boxing and product container are so cute! The only downside to this product for me is how the product container works.  When you twist the top of it for the product to come out of the container when you push down, it aways seems to fall back down. So it can be difficult to get the product out.</li>
            <li> This mouisturizer is my favorite! The bottle is what initially got my attention. But the fact that it is chemical free and has natural ingredients is what sold me on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is gorgeous with pink butterflies that resemble cherry blossom trees, The bottle is different from ANY other moisturizer bottles I&#x27;ve used in the past; the elegant dispenser has a twist top with a push down pump, And all you need is a pea sized amount for your whole face and neck area. Another thing I love about this mouisturizer is when you open your box, you&#x27;ll find a Thank You note inside. I found this to be a special, more personal feature that most other moisturizers may not offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first experience with using products from Oleavine Beauty, but this will not be my last. I love how this gives my skin a more balanced, refreshed look to it. It&#x27;s not greasy, it&#x27;s chemical free, organic, has nearly zero scent to it, and makes my skin feel and look more healthy while giving a radiant natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this twice a day to my skin, once in the morning before applying my makeup; and again after I wash my makeup off/after my shower...&lt;br /&gt;Lastly I want to add that my skin is very sensitive, and at times can be overly oily. This doesn&#x27;t make my skin (more) oily, instead it really does balance my skin out. Second this is allergy friendly, so I felt confident that it wouldn&#x27;t irritates my skin; and after using this myself, I&#x27;ve had no issues with any sensitivity to my skin.</li>
            <li> Holy cow,  I really love this stuff!  It&#x27;s just as good as some of the really expensive creams and serums I&#x27;ve tried but for such a great price!  I especially think it softens my eye wrinkles.  They don&#x27;t go away,  of course,  but they look less obvious.</li>
            <li> This is okay but has not done any better than any of the over-the-counter products I have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not spend the money on buying another bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy, watery moisturizer. Very cute design.</li>
            <li> As the cold weather approaches, my face dries out quickly, and it is so hard for me because it starts to flake and my makeup always looks patchy and dry without any glow.  When I apply this moiturizer, it instantly absorbs into the skin and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the airless pump.  The great thing that I love about using an air pump is it makes it so easy to apply the right amount of the Oleavine moisturizer.  I usually only apply about 1/2 a pump, and that&#x27;s all I need.  Plus the airless pump also ensures that I don&#x27;t stick my hands right into the moisturizer, which would allow germs and bacteria to enter.  The airless pump also protects this moisturizer from oxidizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love products that are natural and chemical free, and who wants all of those chemicals applied on their face?  Not me for sure!  I have not had any breakouts nor any allergic reactions when I applied this moisturizer.  My face loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also had the chance to apply it under my makeup.  When I first apply it, I take a small amount and apply it in a circular motion, and then when I applied the foundation and blush, I noticed that the makeup did not feel greasy at all! I love that it does not make my face look greasy or oily! I also noticed a natural glow when I applied it on.  I am so happy with this moisturizer and will continue using it!</li>
            <li> One of the things I liked the most about this moisturizer is the packaging. I&#x27;m always losing those little tops that come with most of my beauty products. Well, this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t need one because the bottle twists and the dispenser pops out of the top. It is very neat and very easy to use. But, that&#x27;s not what is best about this moisturizer. I love a moisturizer that absorbs quickly into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave behind that greasy feeling. This moisturizer does just that. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and balanced. This is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the packaging. It&#x27;s way too adorable and would look really nice on a vanity. I was surprised by the pump because I haven&#x27;t had any moisturizers that twists and then the pump pops out. I really love the whole design of this product and I think more companies should put more more effort and designs on their products. Well, right into the product itself. I noticed that it is very hydrating and blends easily and effortlessly. I like how you don&#x27;t need much product to moisturize your whole face. It works well even for these cold winter days. I am very pleased with this product and recommend to all the ladies out there.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer!  I can honestly say my face went ahhhh when I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;After only two days of applying, I knew I would be a return buyer, it feels wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t take much to cover so I see this lasting me awhile using it twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about this product!! It is a wonderful moisturizer!! I am actually thinking of ordering more. My stylish bottle is almost empty I have been using it SO much! It is light and airy and not heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST daytime moisturizer that I&#x27;ve ever used. I love everything about it; from the packaging, to the nice light sent, to how it makes my face feel pampered, to how smoothly my makeup goes on over it. I think it&#x27;s fabulous!!!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is amazing! A little goes a long way! I love how my skin looks &amp; feels!!</li>
            <li> I really like the moisturizer, and would give it 5 stars, but can&#x27;t get the product out of the bottle. The dispenser part of the bottle simply doesn&#x27;t work. I buy my foundation with the same type of dispenser and have never had a problem. I will not be purchasing this again unless the company uses a different type of bottle. I had to use a hammer to knock off the top just so I could use the moisturizer. Not worth it to go through this again.  Well, I do really like this moisturizer but wish the company would package it differently. In fact, I have absolutely no problems with the moisturizer but I continue to have problems after I have used about half. I then have to knock the top off because the product won&#x27;t come out of the top. Please, make it in a tube so I can squeeze it out.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! What a find! I usually purchase known brands, but took a chance on this after seeing the list of ingredients, which I hope is true. It&#x27;s so light weight and not greasy. On humid nights it still feels really good. Nice price too.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisture cream.  it does  not leave my skin oily, because I have oily skin.  My skin just absorbs this cream.  I use this at night.  This cream leaves my face soft, and it has soften my lines around my eyes too.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have been using it for few weeks and I see and feel the difference on my face. I&#x27;m very pleased with it and glad I&#x27;ve found it.</li>
            <li> So far I like this lotion very much - leaves my skin very soft and smooth, and I have to say that I do really like the container that it comes in - the way you can open and close it - it&#x27;s very pretty and convenient.</li>
            <li> Look how cute the packaging is!! It is another anti-aging facial moisturizer which includes so many benefit in it/\.I actually needed a new facial moisturiser as I was so bored with my regular one.This one does make me excited because it&#x27;s very fancy and an awesome moisturizer. And all I can say that this is my current favorite moisturizer for holiday. I am over 20&#x27;s and definitely started  using all kinda anti-aging products already. This is a great moisturiser for matured skin.It has so many benefit for your skin. And as you can read by the ingredients,you can imagine that it&#x27;s a pack of goodness for your skin. It&#x27;s not like a cream based but more like a lotion based moisturiser. ; it makes the skin so soft and supple , hydrates all day long. It&#x27;s not greasy /oily/sticky at all!! Good for any skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know guys, you should check out these kinda small business brands, because they do make some awesome and amazing products for all skin type and I feel like ,they are trying to make better quality than the drugstore brand !! (ahem..!)  I really appreciate their hard work on packaging too! Make everything look luxurious!♥☺ !!</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer! It absorbs quickly into your skin. I love the floral scent! I&#x27;ve tried other moisturizers and the scent of this one beats them all! I have not noticed reduced wrinkles or anything like that. I would recommend this product to individuals with sensitive skin as well as acne prone skin. This product has not caused me to break out. Best of luck!</li>
            <li> wonderful! leaves skin soft and smooth, would buy again</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife and she&#x27;s happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;And if she happy it means I&#x27;m happy too))</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is fantastic. It moisturizes my skin without making it oily or greasy and it actually locks in the moisture. My skin feels smooth and supple after using it. I&#x27;ve noticed that after using it for a few weeks the texture of my skin is slightly more smooth. This is soothing and it reduces inflammation. I like that they use little to no heat when making this moisturizer, that means the ingredients aren&#x27;t altered and stay more to their true form which means they do what they say they&#x27;re going to do! With this being on sale the price is really reasonable and I want to continue using it! I did received this for free to try out, but all opinions are my own. I use this around my eyes as well instead of using a separate eye cream. It keeps the dry areas of my face moisturized but doesn&#x27;t make the oilier parts greasy. It&#x27;s great! I&#x27;d also like to add that I love that this is in a pump because it stays much more clean and sanitary. Thank you!</li>
            <li> As an Esthetician, when most of my clients come in for facial services and I ask them what their concerns are, they say that they want younger looking skin. With the cold months upon us our skin tends to dry out and look much more weathered and old, but with the Oleavine moisturizer, we can combat the signs of aging while keeping our skin nicely hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;What are the ingredients?&lt;br /&gt;Aloe: A natural skin moisturizer and anti inflammatory agent, Aloe will keep your skin soft and smooth and keep the redness down.&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin A: Will exfoliate your skin from the inside out, fighting the signs of aging. Vitamin A will over time reduce any fine lines and wrinkles, sun or age spots, acne scarring, and keep your skin looking fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C: Will brighten your skin making it look more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;The Oleavine Moisturizer comes in beautifully luxurious looking packaging, simply twist the silver top and the pump comes out and you can administer just the right amount of product to your fingertips. The moisturizer itself is a very light consistency and sinks into my skin immediately leaving it feeling soft and smooth, it doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of residue. I suffer from severely dry skin, and since I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer my skin has felt perfectly hydrated and looks much brighter.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone that wants to have fresh youthful looking skin!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my unbiased review</li>
            <li> Impressed with Oleavine which is a new brand to me made in the USA.  It has a very light pleasant scent, goes on smoothly, and almost disappears into the skin while moisturizing well.  This is my kind of beauty product.  It does not leave a greasy coating and feels so fresh and clean when you apply it.  The list of ingredients is similar to other face moisturizers out there that cost a fortune yet this is pretty affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to use it until this bottle runs out and report on results.  So far, two thumbs up!  :)</li>
            <li> Overall, a good moisturizer but I still have dry patches on my face. May be a better fit during the summer, but for me during the winter, this is not enough for my extremely dry skin. Love the twist top dispenser, excellent idea and very travel friendly.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with the packaging of this moisturizer. It comes in a gorgeous box with ingredients and instructions listed on it. The bottle is decorated very fancy looking. It makes me feel like I am using a really expensive product. I love the hidden pump. The pump allows for just the right amount to be distributed without over dispensing. The moisturizer is white and creamy. It has a light and refreshing citrus smell which smells fantastic. Most moisturizers break me out and leave my skin greasy. This moisturizer soaks right into your skin and leaves your skin feeling very moisturized and soft. It has no caused any breakouts at all. My makeup goes on smoothly over this moisturizer. It leaves my face glowing and feeling smooth all day. I love that this product is organic and all-natural. It&#x27;s loaded with tons of great vitamins. The best part... it&#x27;s made in the USA. If you are looking for a new moisturizer, I highly recommend this trying this product. If you are not completely satisfied, the company offers a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee. You will completely fall in love with this product! This has become one of my new favorite beauty products. I&#x27;m excited to check out other products from Oleavine Beauty. I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. Regardless, I only recommend products that I would personally myself.</li>
            <li> Light weight, non greasy, a little goes a long way !</li>
            <li> This is a great lightweight and non-irritating moisturizer for my oily skin this winter. The moisturizer absorbs quickly once applied and has a nice light smell. I especially appreciate that it is free from harmful chemical ingredients. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks now and my skin feels softer. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the product! &amp;#60;3 It works wonders for my skin. It&#x27;s light, nice-smelling, non-greasy and makes my face seem a tad younger. Another bonus is that and doesn&#x27;t contain toxic and/or harmful chemicals. I highly recommend ((:</li>
            <li> Light-weight, yet very moisturizing. I love the tube it&#x27;s in so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it pumping out lotion while in a travel bag and the air-lock system to keep bacteria at bay is genius.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer, but I&#x27;ve had other nice moisturizers. It doesn&#x27;t do half the things it claims to do. Disappointed! At least it didn&#x27;t break me out. Also didn&#x27;t like the strong flowery scent. I guess I&#x27;m pretty naive. I tend to purchase many things on Amazon just because the reviews are good. Oh well! Live and learn, I guess.</li>
            <li> one of the best moisturizers I recently purchased. I have a combination skin but this is non-greasy and leaves skin very smooth and ready to apply a foundation.</li>
            <li> This is a very impressive product. Have been using it for a couple of weeks now. Before, I was using a separate product for the wrinkling undereye area--this product does that job on it&#x27;s own--plus! It&#x27;s loaded with Vitamins A, B.C + E, along with botanicals rich in Omegas 3, 6, 7 + 9. Features plant stem cells and Hyaluronic Acid. I also love the pop-up pump--very quick and efficient--and keeps the product clean and germ free.</li>
            <li> I have never given another moisturizer 5 stars except for this one. I have only used it for a few days, but already I feel its benefits with silky smooth skin. The bottle is really cool too. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 40 year old female with oily/dry skin who breakouts on the chin area. I&#x27;ve been applying this to my face twice a day for about a week now. It&#x27;s a nice light non-oily cream that feels good on. My skin does feel a little firmer &amp; clearer. What&#x27;s good about it is that I have not had any breakouts since using the cream which typically happens when I try a new product. I do not see much difference though with lightening sun spots or acne scars. I will continue using it &amp; see what happens!</li>
            <li> Organic!  I love this product.</li>
            <li> I like it but I haven&#x27;t found it to be anything special particularly for the price. Honestly, I&#x27;m just as happy (probably more so) using my less expensive lotion, so I think I&#x27;ll save the money in the future.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it at all, but my wife really loves it. So I give it a 5 stars rate.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE PREMEASURED FEATURE...GOES ON SMOOTHLY, NO FUSS AND FEELS GREAT.</li>
            <li> I really like the Oleavine Moisturizer. It came super fast and I feel like I started seeing results rather quickly as well. Within a week my skin looked more toned and smooth. My skin was feels so hydrated and soft! I absolutely love it! It works wonderfully on my sensitive skin and unlike some moisturizers, this one never made me break out at all. I really like that it is made with natural and organic ingredients so I don&#x27;t feel bad about what I am using on my face and can feel confident in the product I am using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is especially great during the winter when the air is dry and my skin tends to be less hydrated and supple. The bottle it comes in is super cute and looks expensive while the product itself is actually quite affordable. I love the convenient pump top and that it only takes one pump to cover my whole face and neck meaning it will last quite a long time. I have noticed a real difference in my skin. It is more hydrated-especially for this time of year, the dark circles around my eyes are lightening up, and my fine lines are diminishing. My skin feels soft and smooth and my color is more toned and healthy looking. I really like this moisturizer overall and am so glad that I found it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to think.  I received the order in a day - great!  The packaging is very pretty and the pump is really cool - great!  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor - great!  It&#x27;s not greasy and makes my skin soft - great!  I have to go wash my face now because I feel a slight burning sensation.  My face looks a little pink.  Is this good?  Should I try again tomorrow?</li>
            <li> This product was not for me. I have extremely sensitive skin and it left me with a burning sensation on my face. I was disappointed, so I contacted the company. Within twelve hours, my purchase was refunded without the need to send the product back. Fabulous customer service! I will say that the bottle is gorgeous and the smell is fantastic! I&#x27;m giving it five stars because although it didn&#x27;t work for me, the purchase experience was great, the customer service was amazing, the bottle is adorable and the smell is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for being such a great company, Oleavine!</li>
            <li> Every cream I&#x27;ve ever tried has cause me to have acne or irritated/burned&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m at that fun age of wrinkles and pimples, this is great! ESP. Combined with the sensitive skin cerave face wash</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the anti-aging benefits, but if you have oily skin like I do, it leaves my skin oily looking and shiny, even with makeup on.  I will use it, but only at night.</li>
            <li> After only a few days, my face feels silky smooth. I love how this feels and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is pricey for the amount of lotion. The product itself is one of top 5 in my books and feels good on your skin. I cannot justify the $$. The smell is not overpowering and is neutral. I suffer from dry skin and couple days were enough for the turnaround. There are cheaper options available which are also free of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Feels great on skin, not too oily. Perfect for dry Colorado weather.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic moisturizer.  It is smooth and one pump of the container is ample for covering the face and neck.  I like the slender container because it takes up very little space on my cosmetic shelf and little space in my make-up bag when traveling.  Good value.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time. I just statred using the product but it is not greasy. has no lasting scent and I love the pump bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now. Forst I have to say that I absolutely love the way the pump is on here! It works for my dry skin. My skin gets so dry that it peels on my nose and chin. This definitely helped with that. No more peeling the skin with tweezers... so I&#x27;m a happy camper. I will definitely be ordering more before I run out!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li> I usually buy Lancome or other high end moisturizers. Since I am out of work I opted to try something that was rated high on Amazon. This moisturizer is amazing! My skin looks radiant. I will look to see if this line carries moisturizer that has SPF in it next time.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has helped my neck area a lot!  I lost a lot of weight so the skin was wrinkly and sagging.  This product has helped to tighten it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the moisturize. Planning to buy it again. Thanks</li>
            <li> Very light lotion.  It smells good and I feel like I have seen a positive difference in the fine lines on my skin.  I probably won&#x27;t be using it over the summer because there isn&#x27;t a sunscreen in it, but I have really enjoyed it over the last few months of winter.  I will definitely buy this again.  It is also great to travel with.  The way the lid closes makes it easy to bring with you and not worry about leaks.</li>
            <li> I recently recieved the oleavine facial moisturizer. It is absolutely amazing. I have never tried a moisturizer that works to well!! My skin feels so soft and dry patches are slowly going away ive had this product for about a week now I am 100% sure my dry spots will be gone within a week! I also see a difference in my skin being brighter! The price is AMAZING compared to the quality!!  I highly recommend plus, the packaging is super cute and it makes it even more fun to use! Another thing I love about this product is the twist top! No more dried up moisturizer at the tip of thw pump it seals it so is stays fresh for the whole use!! Il be buying myself more!!! #Oleavine</li>
            <li> One thing that stood out to me before even using the product was the packaging, I like the colors they used on the box and bottle, it makes it stand out more in the crowd. I found that Oleavine Facial Moisturizer is very easy to dispense, just push down on the top and it comes right out, no fussing with it. This product looks like lotion with a white color and creamy texture. The one thing you do have to watch though is how much you press down to avoid getting more than you need in your hand. The reason you do not want a ton in your hand is that the product spreads out quite a bit and covers a good amount of area with just a little bit of product. So far I really like this product, it makes my face feel so smooth and awake!!</li>
            <li> Has a a nice light scent. I have sensitive skin and had no problems with the  product. My skin is soft and not oil. The packaging is awesome and is easy to travel with or throw into your make up kit without worry of the product leaking all over your stuff.  Will be reordering this product!</li>
            <li> Great product.... Leaves your skin silky smooth without a greasy residue....</li>
            <li> I expected more from the product I guess, haven&#x27;t seen any change, tho its a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this anti-aging moisturizer! I love the mild, floral scent, organic/natural ingredients, the ease of application on my skin, the way it feels on my face, and most importantly, the results. After a little over a month of using this product, I can safely say I&#x27;ve seen results. My pores minimized and there&#x27;s definite improvement around the eye area, particularly my dark circles. I actually received a few nice compliments from family/friends and co-workers. I would also like to note the superior customer service experience I had with Oleavine. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Does a beautiful job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This cream just melts into your skin, love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying this moisturizer for a couple weeks now and I have to say I really do love it. Usually lotions make my face way to greecy, but this one feels light and fresh! Plus, the company actually checks in with you to make sure you&#x27;re 100 satisfied and offers services if you&#x27;re not. Ill definitely be buying again when this bottle is gone.</li>
