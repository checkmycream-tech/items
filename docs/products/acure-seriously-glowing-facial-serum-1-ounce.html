            <li>Great product, feels good going on, smells nice.</li>
            <li>For the money they are good.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good eye makeup remover, but otherwise, just a bit greasy.</li>
            <li>but I guess I was swayed by all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>Love it smells very nice and feels great on the skin</li>

            <li>okay!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this Serum (oil)!</li>
            <li>I love that it is organically made and not tested on animals too!</li>
            <li>Wow....this serum is amazing, I put it at night after the Acure Toner Rose</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>the Serum just feels amazing over it.</li>
            <li>amazing serum.  </li>
            <li>The product had a nice smell</li>
            <li>I used this as a night moisturizer for a couple of nights, and my boyfriend (unprompted, mind you) commented how nice my skin looked.</li>
            <li>Nicely hydrated.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched over most of my skin care and shampoo products to acure brand and my hair and scalp have never been better!</li>
            <li>However, I found I liked the Argan Oil they make better than this.</li>
            <li>It is natural, safe and feels wonderful on the skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients and the organic nature of them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if it were light-sensitive they would put it in an amber bottle, but I prefer for my products to be packaged that way regardless, just to be sure.</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it -</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not quite sure what it&#x27;s doing, if anything.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This is more of an oil than serum,  </li>
            <li>The scent is lovely.</li>
            <li>Love love that this company is also cruelty free!</li>
            <li>My skin does seem more hydrated in the morning.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better, and at my age that is saying something.</li>
            <li>Love Acure products.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>i LOVE this serum.</li>
            <li>I love Acures products.</li>
            <li>love this serum.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell of this.</li>
            <li>I love anything from Acure.</li>
            <li>It is not certified so it is filled with GMO!</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I guess I should have known better because a lot of products containing oil cause my skin to break out</li>
            <li>Smells great and no bad ingredients for a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li>Just a nice supple sheen that looks beautiful mixed with the Ultamd.</li>
            <li>Considering all the high quality ingredients, the price is great.</li>
            <li>I liked how natural it is, and read some good reviews about face oils for skin like mine.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never been so happy, clear, and balanced!  </li>
            <li>Plus it smells great and leaves my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>but I notice it diminishing fine lines more.</li>
            <li>It absorbed nicely</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love, absolute LOVE with my skin again!</li>
            <li>Overall a good product, but wish it wasn&#x27;t as oily as it is - but maybe that&#x27;s what makes it effective.</li>
            <li>I really feel like it visibly smooths the fine lines around my eyes and mouth too!!  </li>
            <li>it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>perfect for a night time moisturizer - it leaves the skin a little too oily to be a daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li>that within a month or two I will be able go go foundation free for the first time in 30 years!</li>
            <li>since using this product i&#x27;ve seen a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice for hydration, oil-based without being really oily.</li>
            <li>It does soak in and leaves skin smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li>I give this product 3 stars because it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t give me any acne.  </li>
            <li>Acure has been a fantastic line for my face.  </li>
            <li>I like this for a light night tme moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Makes skin silky and comfortable, I cannot go without oil on my skin ever.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even like Serum, but I totally enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product not only for your face but for you hair as well.  </li>
            <li>An excellent brand, sold at Whole Foods but sold here for about the same price.</li>
            <li>Good for nighttime because I woke up with my skin feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>I originally found this product as a sample from Birch Box then immediately ordered off Amazon after my sample was out.</li>
            <li>The skin in my eyelid and above is very sensative and I have been using the Strivectin for it, but as happy as I am with this product line (the citrus face wash is another one I love</li>
            <li>I use this on my face in the winter and its great for dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried dozens of anti-aging skin products and this is by far my favorite to date!  </li>
            <li>Super fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li>Fairly priced, goes on seemingly greedy though absorbed quickly, leaves my skin soft and visibly firmer.</li>
            <li>Though the best I have found and firming favorite  is Necksil, sadly it is for some reason no longer available.</li>
            <li>I love, very hydrating and plumping.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ingredients: Organic safflower oil, organic sesame seed oil, organic pumpkin see oil, organic borage oil, organic argan oil, organic sweet orange oil, organic cranberry seed oil, organic bulgarian lavender oil, organic olive oil, organic rosemary oil.</li>
            <li>my new favorite product - I put it on my face and neck at night, wake up to smooth skin, even tone...</li>
            <li>I mean EXCELLENT.</li>
            <li>Seems to oily at first I was nervous because my fave breaks out easily.  </li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel super soft and it smells great and very natural.</li>
            <li>Very light and sinks in nicely without leaving oily residue on your skin.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s super hydrated.</li>
            <li>but the smell fades quick)</li>
            <li>This is an oil but absorbs in to face quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick tip that works for me</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing and my skin just loves this oil.</li>
            <li>I use this first, let it absorb for a couple seconds and then use a light moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li>And, with no unpleasant side&lt;br /&gt;effects.</li>
            <li>I love how my skin amd face feel soft and not oily, it seems to have eavend some scarring and it great for dry hair!!</li>
            <li>Looks like it would be oily, but it is very smooth and settles in quickly and is lovely for this dry winter as a serum layer.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much firming, to be honest, but my skin is more even and rarely has any dry patches like it used to.</li>
            <li>I use it on top of Andalou natural cleaners and toners.  </li>
            <li>and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>You instantly feel a different and amazon has a great price ($17).</li>
            <li>you wake up and your face is smooth and silky soft!  </li>
            <li>In about ten days, I have seen a difference in fine lines and my skin seems brighter too!</li>
            <li>I like the results very much</li>
            <li>It smells lovely and lasts for several months.  </li>
            <li>and I will because I have more left in bottle.</li>
            <li>Be sure to pull your hair back so it doesn&#x27;t get in the oil on your face.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>Tried the Argan oil facial oil first, it was ok.</li>
            <li>For smooth, soft and glowing skin this serum is it.</li>
            <li>the oil ingredients are organic and on the bottle says it restores moisture to the skin’s lipid layer which is exactly what i needed.  </li>
            <li>They have made an amazing difference in my skin because I have an autoimmune condition I have to use natural ingredients as much as possible.</li>
            <li>Definitely agree that this product is more of an oil than a serum, but I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I love everyone of their products so far and have noticed a clear difference in the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li>It is super soft now</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s &amp;#34;seriously firming&amp;#34; or just makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and breakout scars.</li>
            <li>I can certainly see a difference in my skin tone.</li>
            <li>My new holy grail product!!</li>
            <li>I warm a little in my hands and then apply it .It</li>
            <li>I use this product both night and day as a neck firming serum, and truthfully, it really works.</li>
            <li>, it smells gently like a lavender.</li>
            <li>I really like these products</li>
            <li>I see subtle changes and my skin is super soft and bright.  </li>
            <li>but I really didn&#x27;t notice any changes or firming of my skin.  </li>
            <li>gently removes even mascara using just fingertips)</li>
            <li>but I feel this product really helps my skin.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>Really helps my skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely the piece to fit the puzzle.</li>
            <li>This serum is a light oil, I only needed one pump for decent coverage.</li>
            <li>I think if you applied it in the morning and allowed it ample time to absorb before applying any other products you would be OK.</li>
            <li>I was so excited my husband could tell a difference in my face after a day or two and asked my what I was doing different!</li>
            <li>From the first morning, when I applied it at night,  I noticed my face felt baby soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t use for daytime because there&#x27;s no SPF, and sometimes oil can have the opposite effect, but other than that this is great.</li>
            <li>My skin looks luminous and feels very soft after applying!  </li>
            <li>so I think I get a little more oily</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice any firming action, but I think it breaks me out each time I use it...</li>
            <li>Pretty much some essential oils blended together.</li>
            <li>so with normal skin</li>
            <li>Only thing I&#x27;d change is for it to be more &amp;#34;serum-y&amp;#34; and less pure oil.</li>
            <li>We live in a humid area</li>
            <li>I do have super dry skin</li>
            <li>Sometimes I put this on twice a day if I&#x27;m super dry.  </li>
            <li>I literally only use one pump for my whole face, it spreads evenly and absorbs really well.</li>
            <li>When i noticed what affect it had on my super dry cheeks</li>
            <li>leaves my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>However, after a few minutes it absorbed into my skin and left it feeling silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have tries several special order products (Meaningful Beauty, Oxytoken and Stryvectin to name a few), as well as over the counter products.</li>
            <li>Especially in areas that my need a little more attention.</li>
            <li>I pair it with the Eltamd UV clear SPF 46 for acne, rosacea and hyper pigmentation.</li>
            <li>my skin is clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking of getting microdermabrasion or something to clear this stuff out of my pores.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this firming serum</li>
            <li>Always looking for natural, preferably organic products for my face.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic, it works wonders during the wintertime, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or break me out despite having oily/combo/sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worked for me so far.  </li>
            <li>I use this at night in conjunction with Acure Sensitive Skin Moisturizer (now granted</li>
            <li>I also purchased the face wash for my 13 &amp; 16 year old grandsons for acne problems and the gentler wash for my daughter with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and works miracles on my skin.</li>
            <li>First if all lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I place a drop or two in my lotion or place it directly on my face after placing it on my fingers.</li>
            <li>To tell you the truth, No one has said nor noticed any changes on my skin,however,I like it,because it leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I wake up to soft, moisturized skin.  </li>
            <li>Try a certified brand and do not waste your time.</li>
            <li>My incredibly sensitive, reactive skin loves this face oil.</li>
            <li>plumps your skin, it gives a soft sheen</li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>So far I like the product.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft, and after the bottle is used up, will see if there is a reduction in wrinkle areas.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face vibrant, not dry at all.</li>
            <li>A very little bit goes a long way and it can feel very oily on your skin as it is very rich.</li>
            <li>Like.. its not disturbing what the pad left on my face, and its giving me all these nutrients from the organic oils into my open newly emptied pores.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin, but when I first applied it I was worried that it would leave my skin too oily.</li>
            <li>I love it, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I clean my face at night,  use a night cream,  then press a few drops of this oil into my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I love this Seriously Firming Serum.</li>
            <li>Love this serum, seriously hydrating, and the scent is calming.</li>
            <li>I really like it for my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Such a simple regimen and so pure.</li>
            <li>Light enough that it works into your face after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I also love that there isn&#x27;t a single harsh chemical in this product, and my skin is definitely thanking me for that.</li>
            <li>Not sure this is really a serum, its really a face oil.&lt;br /&gt;Which</li>
            <li>2 days later voila his cheeks are so moisturized and soft</li>
            <li>I rarely review products, but I have to give this a few stars.</li>
            <li>Every other day I use the ACURE Organics Brightening Facial Scrub Sea Kelp+ Chlorella Growth Factor to switch it up.&lt;br /&gt;I have always been self conscious about my large pores on my cheeks and nose, I&#x27;ve been using this combination of products for about a week</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy or oily, it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li>Skin feels smooth and less breakouts!!!</li>
            <li>Not a single breakout, blackhead, whitehead or clogged pore.</li>
            <li>I am in my mid-30s, and have sensitive, dry, and mildly acne prone skin, that usually stays under control.  </li>
            <li>and it only takes 1 pump for your whole face down to your neck.</li>
            <li>I am 26, have oily to combination skin that sometimes appears dull, and rarely use products on my face.</li>

            <li> For the money they are good.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good eye makeup remover, but otherwise, just a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> but I guess I was swayed by all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> Love it smells very nice and feels great on the skin</li>

            <li> okay!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this Serum (oil)!</li>
            <li> I love that it is organically made and not tested on animals too!</li>
            <li> Wow....this serum is amazing, I put it at night after the Acure Toner Rose</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> the Serum just feels amazing over it.</li>
            <li> amazing serum.  </li>
            <li> The product had a nice smell</li>
            <li> I used this as a night moisturizer for a couple of nights, and my boyfriend (unprompted, mind you) commented how nice my skin looked.</li>
            <li> Nicely hydrated.</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched over most of my skin care and shampoo products to acure brand and my hair and scalp have never been better!</li>
            <li> However, I found I liked the Argan Oil they make better than this.</li>
            <li> It is natural, safe and feels wonderful on the skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients and the organic nature of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if it were light-sensitive they would put it in an amber bottle, but I prefer for my products to be packaged that way regardless, just to be sure.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it -</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not quite sure what it&#x27;s doing, if anything.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This is more of an oil than serum,  </li>
            <li> The scent is lovely.</li>
            <li> Love love that this company is also cruelty free!</li>
            <li> My skin does seem more hydrated in the morning.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better, and at my age that is saying something.</li>
            <li> Love Acure products.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> i LOVE this serum.</li>
            <li> I love Acures products.</li>
            <li> love this serum.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell of this.</li>
            <li> I love anything from Acure.</li>
            <li> It is not certified so it is filled with GMO!</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I guess I should have known better because a lot of products containing oil cause my skin to break out</li>
            <li> Smells great and no bad ingredients for a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Just a nice supple sheen that looks beautiful mixed with the Ultamd.</li>
            <li> Considering all the high quality ingredients, the price is great.</li>
            <li> I liked how natural it is, and read some good reviews about face oils for skin like mine.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never been so happy, clear, and balanced!  </li>
            <li> Plus it smells great and leaves my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> but I notice it diminishing fine lines more.</li>
            <li> It absorbed nicely</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love, absolute LOVE with my skin again!</li>
            <li> Overall a good product, but wish it wasn&#x27;t as oily as it is - but maybe that&#x27;s what makes it effective.</li>
            <li> I really feel like it visibly smooths the fine lines around my eyes and mouth too!!  </li>
            <li> it worked fine.  </li>
            <li> perfect for a night time moisturizer - it leaves the skin a little too oily to be a daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> that within a month or two I will be able go go foundation free for the first time in 30 years!</li>
            <li> since using this product i&#x27;ve seen a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice for hydration, oil-based without being really oily.</li>
            <li> It does soak in and leaves skin smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li> I give this product 3 stars because it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t give me any acne.  </li>
            <li> Acure has been a fantastic line for my face.  </li>
            <li> I like this for a light night tme moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Makes skin silky and comfortable, I cannot go without oil on my skin ever.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even like Serum, but I totally enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product not only for your face but for you hair as well.  </li>
            <li> An excellent brand, sold at Whole Foods but sold here for about the same price.</li>
            <li> Good for nighttime because I woke up with my skin feeling super soft.</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> I originally found this product as a sample from Birch Box then immediately ordered off Amazon after my sample was out.</li>
            <li> The skin in my eyelid and above is very sensative and I have been using the Strivectin for it, but as happy as I am with this product line (the citrus face wash is another one I love</li>
            <li> I use this on my face in the winter and its great for dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of anti-aging skin products and this is by far my favorite to date!  </li>
            <li> Super fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> Fairly priced, goes on seemingly greedy though absorbed quickly, leaves my skin soft and visibly firmer.</li>
            <li> Though the best I have found and firming favorite  is Necksil, sadly it is for some reason no longer available.</li>
            <li> I love, very hydrating and plumping.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients: Organic safflower oil, organic sesame seed oil, organic pumpkin see oil, organic borage oil, organic argan oil, organic sweet orange oil, organic cranberry seed oil, organic bulgarian lavender oil, organic olive oil, organic rosemary oil.</li>
            <li> my new favorite product - I put it on my face and neck at night, wake up to smooth skin, even tone...</li>
            <li> I mean EXCELLENT.</li>
            <li> Seems to oily at first I was nervous because my fave breaks out easily.  </li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel super soft and it smells great and very natural.</li>
            <li> Very light and sinks in nicely without leaving oily residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s super hydrated.</li>
            <li> but the smell fades quick)</li>
            <li> This is an oil but absorbs in to face quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick tip that works for me</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing and my skin just loves this oil.</li>
            <li> I use this first, let it absorb for a couple seconds and then use a light moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li> And, with no unpleasant side&lt;br /&gt;effects.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin amd face feel soft and not oily, it seems to have eavend some scarring and it great for dry hair!!</li>
            <li> Looks like it would be oily, but it is very smooth and settles in quickly and is lovely for this dry winter as a serum layer.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much firming, to be honest, but my skin is more even and rarely has any dry patches like it used to.</li>
            <li> I use it on top of Andalou natural cleaners and toners.  </li>
            <li> and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> You instantly feel a different and amazon has a great price ($17).</li>
            <li> you wake up and your face is smooth and silky soft!  </li>
            <li> In about ten days, I have seen a difference in fine lines and my skin seems brighter too!</li>
            <li> I like the results very much</li>
            <li> It smells lovely and lasts for several months.  </li>
            <li> and I will because I have more left in bottle.</li>
            <li> Be sure to pull your hair back so it doesn&#x27;t get in the oil on your face.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> Tried the Argan oil facial oil first, it was ok.</li>
            <li> For smooth, soft and glowing skin this serum is it.</li>
            <li> the oil ingredients are organic and on the bottle says it restores moisture to the skin’s lipid layer which is exactly what i needed.  </li>
            <li> They have made an amazing difference in my skin because I have an autoimmune condition I have to use natural ingredients as much as possible.</li>
            <li> Definitely agree that this product is more of an oil than a serum, but I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I love everyone of their products so far and have noticed a clear difference in the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li> It is super soft now</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s &amp;#34;seriously firming&amp;#34; or just makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> I have large pores and breakout scars.</li>
            <li> I can certainly see a difference in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> My new holy grail product!!</li>
            <li> I warm a little in my hands and then apply it .It</li>
            <li> I use this product both night and day as a neck firming serum, and truthfully, it really works.</li>
            <li> , it smells gently like a lavender.</li>
            <li> I really like these products</li>
            <li> I see subtle changes and my skin is super soft and bright.  </li>
            <li> but I really didn&#x27;t notice any changes or firming of my skin.  </li>
            <li> gently removes even mascara using just fingertips)</li>
            <li> but I feel this product really helps my skin.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> Really helps my skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely the piece to fit the puzzle.</li>
            <li> This serum is a light oil, I only needed one pump for decent coverage.</li>
            <li> I think if you applied it in the morning and allowed it ample time to absorb before applying any other products you would be OK.</li>
            <li> I was so excited my husband could tell a difference in my face after a day or two and asked my what I was doing different!</li>
            <li> From the first morning, when I applied it at night,  I noticed my face felt baby soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t use for daytime because there&#x27;s no SPF, and sometimes oil can have the opposite effect, but other than that this is great.</li>
            <li> My skin looks luminous and feels very soft after applying!  </li>
            <li> so I think I get a little more oily</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice any firming action, but I think it breaks me out each time I use it...</li>
            <li> Pretty much some essential oils blended together.</li>
            <li> so with normal skin</li>
            <li> Only thing I&#x27;d change is for it to be more &amp;#34;serum-y&amp;#34; and less pure oil.</li>
            <li> We live in a humid area</li>
            <li> I do have super dry skin</li>
            <li> Sometimes I put this on twice a day if I&#x27;m super dry.  </li>
            <li> I literally only use one pump for my whole face, it spreads evenly and absorbs really well.</li>
            <li> When i noticed what affect it had on my super dry cheeks</li>
            <li> leaves my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> However, after a few minutes it absorbed into my skin and left it feeling silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have tries several special order products (Meaningful Beauty, Oxytoken and Stryvectin to name a few), as well as over the counter products.</li>
            <li> Especially in areas that my need a little more attention.</li>
            <li> I pair it with the Eltamd UV clear SPF 46 for acne, rosacea and hyper pigmentation.</li>
            <li> my skin is clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of getting microdermabrasion or something to clear this stuff out of my pores.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this firming serum</li>
            <li> Always looking for natural, preferably organic products for my face.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic, it works wonders during the wintertime, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or break me out despite having oily/combo/sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worked for me so far.  </li>
            <li> I use this at night in conjunction with Acure Sensitive Skin Moisturizer (now granted</li>
            <li> I also purchased the face wash for my 13 &amp; 16 year old grandsons for acne problems and the gentler wash for my daughter with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and works miracles on my skin.</li>
            <li> First if all lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I place a drop or two in my lotion or place it directly on my face after placing it on my fingers.</li>
            <li> To tell you the truth, No one has said nor noticed any changes on my skin,however,I like it,because it leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I wake up to soft, moisturized skin.  </li>
            <li> Try a certified brand and do not waste your time.</li>
            <li> My incredibly sensitive, reactive skin loves this face oil.</li>
            <li> plumps your skin, it gives a soft sheen</li>
            <li> WOW.  </li>
            <li> So far I like the product.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft, and after the bottle is used up, will see if there is a reduction in wrinkle areas.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face vibrant, not dry at all.</li>
            <li> A very little bit goes a long way and it can feel very oily on your skin as it is very rich.</li>
            <li> Like.. its not disturbing what the pad left on my face, and its giving me all these nutrients from the organic oils into my open newly emptied pores.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, but when I first applied it I was worried that it would leave my skin too oily.</li>
            <li> I love it, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I clean my face at night,  use a night cream,  then press a few drops of this oil into my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I love this Seriously Firming Serum.</li>
            <li> Love this serum, seriously hydrating, and the scent is calming.</li>
            <li> I really like it for my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Such a simple regimen and so pure.</li>
            <li> Light enough that it works into your face after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I also love that there isn&#x27;t a single harsh chemical in this product, and my skin is definitely thanking me for that.</li>
            <li> Not sure this is really a serum, its really a face oil.&lt;br /&gt;Which</li>
            <li> 2 days later voila his cheeks are so moisturized and soft</li>
            <li> I rarely review products, but I have to give this a few stars.</li>
            <li> Every other day I use the ACURE Organics Brightening Facial Scrub Sea Kelp+ Chlorella Growth Factor to switch it up.&lt;br /&gt;I have always been self conscious about my large pores on my cheeks and nose, I&#x27;ve been using this combination of products for about a week</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy or oily, it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li> Skin feels smooth and less breakouts!!!</li>
            <li> Not a single breakout, blackhead, whitehead or clogged pore.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-30s, and have sensitive, dry, and mildly acne prone skin, that usually stays under control.  </li>
            <li> and it only takes 1 pump for your whole face down to your neck.</li>
            <li> I am 26, have oily to combination skin that sometimes appears dull, and rarely use products on my face.</li>
            <li> No dark marks no large pores</li>
            <li> I use at night - popping a thin layer all over my clean face and neck.</li>
            <li> Acne stuff usually drys my face out, but these pads not so much, and</li>
            <li> These will be my new skin care products, hands down, and I intend to convert my friends and family onto ACURE!</li>
            <li> The bottle makes it come out a little too much and quickly so be careful.</li>
            <li> i thought i would apply it on my son who&#x27;s 7 months old with extreme dry cheeks and flaky.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin on my face and had a red spotty chest.</li>
            <li> My skin is usually very dry, red and also my skin peels.  </li>
            <li> what a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time fan of this brand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disappointing because I don&#x27;t want to waste any of this precious stuff!</li>
            <li> You need just a little bit, and it just sinks into your skin and makes it glow and soft.</li>
            <li> soaks into my skin unlike other similar products .</li>
            <li> This is a long lasting extreme moisturizer for very dry skin like mine.</li>
            <li> It helped my spots and my skin is no longer dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 56 yo with dry skin</li>
            <li> I put in on at night when my face it feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> Every single day.</li>
            <li> This REALLY hydrates my skin, but it is surprisingly not oily/greasy.  </li>
            <li> I am a 52 year old woman, few post acne dark spots, had skin issues now and then; clogged pores, flaking, itching (from using all the RX treatments) and post menopausal thinning.</li>
            <li> Bottle only half empty.</li>
            <li> Use as little as possible and rub your hands together and one drop will cover your face and neck.</li>
            <li> Neither seems to work well without the other for severely dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected-</li>
            <li> Be careful around your eyes as it will sting if you get it in your eyes or even if you rub your eyes if the serum is in the eye area.</li>
            <li> I use it with my daily moisturizer everyday.</li>
            <li> It has been 6 weeks since I stopped using this product, and my skin still feels rough all over from the breakout.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain what the difference is between this item and the Acure Moroccan Argan Oil..</li>
            <li> I had very dry skin with some flaking on my cheek area, it&#x27;s GONE!</li>
            <li> no breakouts and my skin is not dry and flaky like it usually is in the winter.  </li>
            <li> The firming action is subtle yet noticeable.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on other chemical laden stuff that make big promises and dont waste your time looking.</li>
            <li> I use this when I need a little extra hydration, usually at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having some breakout problems the past few months and this has totally hepled.</li>
            <li> Pat it on so it less heavy and the oiliness becomes less as it sinks into your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it to remove eye makeup, which is accomplished well, but I feel it is a little too expensive for that purpose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this is the only product I&#x27;ve used so far that has helped the &#x27;chicken skin&#x27; on my neck.</li>
            <li> My face brokeout ALL over after less than a week of use.  </li>
            <li> I have black heads on my cheeks, which has never happened before in my life.  </li>
            <li> This keeps my pillowcase a little less oily.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and hardly use make up at all.</li>
            <li> have to recant my previous review (above).&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for a few weeks, I noticed a change in my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a little too oily for me to use during the day, but I have spot-moisturized with it during the winter (around my nose and cheeks where I get dry/chapped skin).</li>
            <li> Then under make up as a primer/moisturizer I put just a little bit...and then foundation and/or powder and my skin looks supple.</li>
            <li> However, this particular pump is a little awkward, and some of the serum always runs down the side of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money purchasing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> goes on heavy but soaks in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days.  </li>
            <li> It does firm,</li>
            <li> Bought this a few months ago.</li>
            <li> At night I mix a few drops of Indian Tulsi Oil with the serum</li>
            <li> (speechless).....very disappointed right now.</li>
            <li> I usually wait a while</li>
            <li> No more bumps under my skin.</li>
            <li> I use just a small amount morning and evening.</li>
            <li> I would test this product in a small area for a week before putting it all over your face.  </li>
            <li> I also pull my hair up because it will make a serious mess out of your hair.</li>
            <li> They are both very heavy oil products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I would call it seriously smoothing, but I will attest that it has improved my skin.</li>
            <li> Hydration without greasy skin that breaks out - which I am prone to - even in my late 40s.</li>
            <li> Skin sucks it in and plumps up.</li>
            <li> But common now, if you have oily acne prone skin, how do you expect it not to break out, if using oil?</li>
            <li> I use the Seriously Firming Serum over the Acure Night Cream.</li>
            <li> Seriously.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten into the habit of putting on a night cream (I use Andalou products) and putting the seriously firming serum just around my lips, eyes and neck.</li>
            <li> Seriously firming Serum.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously the BOMB!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews for products unless they are terrible, but I have to share!</li>
            <li> I use it every day except on the really bad winter days, and I gotta tell ya</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Pretty much some essential oils blended together. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money purchasing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to recant my previous review (above).&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for a few weeks, I noticed a change in my skin. It is super soft now and I love the citrus smell! I think this is the only product I&#x27;ve used so far that has helped the &#x27;chicken skin&#x27; on my neck. I&#x27;m not sure I would call it seriously smoothing, but I will attest that it has improved my skin. I use this at night because it is an oil and needs time to soak in. I also pull my hair up because it will make a serious mess out of your hair. I will be purchasing this again!!</li>
            <li> Love this product...has been so great on my skin.  I have sensitive skin and this firming serum has performed beautifully!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product . I use several different Acure products . I warm a little in my hands and then apply it .It soaks into my skin unlike other similar products . Like the way my skin feels after I use it . I usually wait a while and then I apply my Acure Night cream</li>
            <li> I use this product both night and day as a neck firming serum, and truthfully, it really works. And, with no unpleasant side&lt;br /&gt;effects.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin on my face and had a red spotty chest. This product was perfect for me. It helped my spots and my skin is no longer dry.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> Only 2-3 drops is plenty at night. I really like it for my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected- nothing firming about it. It&#x27;s nice for hydration, oil-based without being really oily. Still, I was hoping for something in the firming department.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. I mean EXCELLENT. the skin absorbs it immediately. I recommended the line to my friend who had pimples on her cheeks, and they disappeared after a week. I am buying the cleansing goji lotion as well. wonderful. please, never discontinue the line.&lt;br /&gt;also, it smells gently like a lavender. wonderful to put on before going to bed.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face in the winter and its great for dry winter skin.  It smells lovely and lasts for several months.  The only reason that I give it four stars is because I believe that it has caused some break outs.  I am thirty-one and prone to break outs so with normal skin it probably would not have the same effect.</li>
            <li> Been using over a month and don&#x27;t see any difference or &amp;#34;lifting&amp;#34;?  Maybe I have to use longer and I will because I have more left in bottle. I like that its oil and doesn&#x27;t wash off like cream everytime I rinse my mouth etc.</li>
            <li> I use the Seriously Firming Serum over the Acure Night Cream. Neither seems to work well without the other for severely dry skin. A very little bit goes a long way and it can feel very oily on your skin as it is very rich. Use as little as possible and rub your hands together and one drop will cover your face and neck. Pat it on so it less heavy and the oiliness becomes less as it sinks into your skin. Be sure to pull your hair back so it doesn&#x27;t get in the oil on your face. It&#x27;s great for my fingernails and hands while applying to my face. Be careful around your eyes as it will sting if you get it in your eyes or even if you rub your eyes if the serum is in the eye area. Overall a good product, but wish it wasn&#x27;t as oily as it is - but maybe that&#x27;s what makes it effective.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I am 26, have oily to combination skin that sometimes appears dull, and rarely use products on my face. I started using this at night after I wash my face and I wake up with GLOWING skin. I love the ingredients and the organic nature of them. For me, this is non-irritating and I haven&#x27;t experienced any increase in acne. The bottle has lasted me months so I feel the price is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a little too oily for me to use during the day, but I have spot-moisturized with it during the winter (around my nose and cheeks where I get dry/chapped skin). I think if you applied it in the morning and allowed it ample time to absorb before applying any other products you would be OK. I&#x27;ve also used it to remove eye makeup, which is accomplished well, but I feel it is a little too expensive for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I wish the manufacturer would change is the bottle. I&#x27;m sure if it were light-sensitive they would put it in an amber bottle, but I prefer for my products to be packaged that way regardless, just to be sure. For now I am keeping the bottle in the box it came in. The idea of a pump is great--I feel droppers can contaminate, expose the product to air (oxidation) and put you at risk of spills. However, this particular pump is a little awkward, and some of the serum always runs down the side of the bottle. It&#x27;s disappointing because I don&#x27;t want to waste any of this precious stuff!</li>
            <li> I really like these products</li>
            <li> love this stuff. goes on heavy but soaks in. smells great. leaves my skin so soft! I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s &amp;#34;seriously firming&amp;#34; or just makes my skin super soft. but I love it.</li>
            <li> I really like it! Only thing I&#x27;d change is for it to be more &amp;#34;serum-y&amp;#34; and less pure oil.</li>
            <li> Love it - I see subtle changes and my skin is super soft and bright.  I just ordered another bottle</li>
            <li> Love it!  Will definitely purchase again.  Both moisturizing and firming. Love the Acure face scrub as well!  Great products!</li>
            <li> Always looking for natural, preferably organic products for my face. The firming action is subtle yet noticeable. Without harmful chemicals. Happy customer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks. I have large pores and breakout scars. My pores are shrinking and my complexion is brighter. I am convinced ! that within a month or two I will be able go go foundation free for the first time in 30 years! Love this stuff! I use it both morning and night. It does soak in and leaves skin smooth and not oily. Seriously.....this is doing amazing things to my pores!</li>
            <li> I give this product 3 stars because it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t give me any acne.  Plus it&#x27;s organic and cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I don&#x27;t know what firming it&#x27;s doing.  I use it every day except on the really bad winter days, and I gotta tell ya, my complexion hasn&#x27;t improved one iota.  There&#x27;s no improvement in firmness, texture, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not quite sure what it&#x27;s doing, if anything.</li>
            <li> The product had a nice smell but I really didn&#x27;t notice any changes or firming of my skin.  It absorbed nicely</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Smells great and I think it makes a difference on my skin. I would recommend putting this on before bedtime.</li>
            <li> It is natural, safe and feels wonderful on the skin</li>
            <li> Works well, very oily so only use a few drops. I mix mine with my daily moisturizer. It has made a great difference on my neck. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is more of an oil than serum,  but I do know it&#x27;s awesome.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days.  I clean my face at night,  use a night cream,  then press a few drops of this oil into my face and neck.  The scent is lovely. The lavender calms my skin.  I have no idea how it works,  but my skin appears smoother and tighter (I am noticing especially my forehead lines) ,  but it&#x27;s super hydrated.</li>
            <li> I love this Seriously Firming Serum. I use it with the night cream every night and it just makes my skin feel great.  I do have super dry skin and it&#x27;s perfect.  Love love that this company is also cruelty free!</li>
            <li> Repeat customer.  This stuff works! I use OZ Naturals Hyaluric Acid and Vitamin C off Amazon and this helps deliver the Acure product into my skin. I&#x27;m 56 yo with dry skin this is a must.  I use it am and pm</li>
            <li> Definitely agree that this product is more of an oil than a serum, but I really like this product. I use at night - popping a thin layer all over my clean face and neck. It smells fantastic, it works wonders during the wintertime, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or break me out despite having oily/combo/sensitive skin. I have mixed a pump in my foundation as well when makeup just needs an extra kick of moisture. I haven&#x27;t seen much firming, to be honest, but my skin is more even and rarely has any dry patches like it used to. Worth it!</li>
            <li> Only took 4 days for the product to arrive...  I have dry skin, and hardly use make up at all. I&#x27;ve been use it on my face( and eye lids) morning and evening.  It&#x27;s worked for me so far.  My skin does seem more hydrated in the morning.  But, I have not noticed any firming yet?  Perhaps time will tell.</li>
            <li> Have purchased the oil from Acure and the firming serum.  For the money they are good. They are both very heavy oil products but I like them.</li>
            <li> Wow....this serum is amazing, I put it at night after the Acure Toner Rose and I wake up to dewy skin. Then under make up as a primer/moisturizer I put just a little bit...and then foundation and/or powder and my skin looks supple. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this serum, seriously hydrating, and the scent is calming.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously the BOMB!  You need just a little bit, and it just sinks into your skin and makes it glow and soft. I use it with my daily moisturizer everyday. My skin has never looked better, and at my age that is saying something. I will always use this serum.....My new holy grail product!!</li>
            <li> my new favorite product - I put it on my face and neck at night, wake up to smooth skin, even tone...I am 54 and my skin is looking amazing!</li>
            <li> I could swear I see a difference in my stretch marks after using this. I originally found this product as a sample from Birch Box then immediately ordered off Amazon after my sample was out.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have dry skin, but when I first applied it I was worried that it would leave my skin too oily. However, after a few minutes it absorbed into my skin and left it feeling silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I&#x27;ve been having some breakout problems the past few months and this has totally hepled. My pores are smaller, skin smoother and clearer. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. I use this at night in conjunction with Acure Sensitive Skin Moisturizer (now granted that stuff doesn&#x27;t smell that great...but the smell fades quick) So both products produced great results in 3 days.</li>
            <li> I have tries several special order products (Meaningful Beauty, Oxytoken and Stryvectin to name a few), as well as over the counter products. Though the best I have found and firming favorite  is Necksil, sadly it is for some reason no longer available. That said this product is wonderful. Fairly priced, goes on seemingly greedy though absorbed quickly, leaves my skin soft and visibly firmer. The skin in my eyelid and above is very sensative and I have been using the Strivectin for it, but as happy as I am with this product line (the citrus face wash is another one I love gently removes even mascara using just fingertips), I have sent for the eye cream also. I also purchased the face wash for my 13 &amp; 16 year old grandsons for acne problems and the gentler wash for my daughter with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, 1 drop and I add 1 drop of Frankincense heat up in my hands and pat my face, neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; makes my skin glow!</li>
            <li> As everyone else has stated, this is definitely an oil.  That said, it is a holy grail product for me.  I actually have oily, acne prone skin... especially hormonally in recent years.. 34 and now I break out??  I use this every morning (after washing with the superfruit + chlorella cleansing gel or the brightening scrub, and before the chlorella edelweiss stem cell eye cream), and let it soak in before applying my tinted moisturizer and mineral powder.  My skin has never been so happy, clear, and balanced!  Who knew oil would make my oily skin look so great?  It reduces the redness and inflammation in my skin, and seems to balance out my oil production.  Plus it smells great and leaves my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> this is one of the best skin products I ever bought</li>
            <li> Love Acure products.  Hydration without greasy skin that breaks out - which I am prone to - even in my late 40s.</li>
            <li> This is an oil not a serum. I like the results very much but I don&#x27;t like how oily it is. I&#x27;ve gotten into the habit of putting on a night cream (I use Andalou products) and putting the seriously firming serum just around my lips, eyes and neck. This keeps my pillowcase a little less oily. I do notice results using this. It does firm, but I notice it diminishing fine lines more.</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old.  I started using this serum about 2 weeks ago.  I use it on top of Andalou natural cleaners and toners.  From the first morning, when I applied it at night,  I noticed my face felt baby soft and hydrated.  I have already ordered another bottle so I never run out.  I had very dry skin with some flaking on my cheek area, it&#x27;s GONE! It&#x27;s all natural and works miracles on my skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this a few months ago. First if all lasts a long time. Bottle only half empty. I am a 52 year old woman, few post acne dark spots, had skin issues now and then; clogged pores, flaking, itching (from using all the RX treatments) and post menopausal thinning. I always had something either on my face or festering underneath. I have every concealer there is! Tried the Argan oil facial oil first, it was ok. But this has been a miracle. I pair it with the Eltamd UV clear SPF 46 for acne, rosacea and hyper pigmentation. Every single day. Not a single breakout, blackhead, whitehead or clogged pore. No more bumps under my skin. Does not leave an oily film on face. Just a nice supple sheen that looks beautiful mixed with the Ultamd. Skin sucks it in and plumps up. My skin is now almost translucent and glowing. No dark marks no large pores, wrinkles are almost nonexistent. my skin is clear. Absolutely love it. Will never be without it. Nothing else compares. Don&#x27;t waste your money on other chemical laden stuff that make big promises and dont waste your time looking. This is the one. Such a simple regimen and so pure. LOVE it!!!!💜</li>
            <li> Love this product. I love how my skin amd face feel soft and not oily, it seems to have eavend some scarring and it great for dry hair!! The multi usues are just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Acure has been a fantastic line for my face.  I love everyone of their products so far and have noticed a clear difference in the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li> I put this on after I shower. It smells great, doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and I can tell that my skin is firmer and smoother to the touch in the morning. I also love that there isn&#x27;t a single harsh chemical in this product, and my skin is definitely thanking me for that.</li>
            <li> This product caused my face to breakout, so I use it on my hands at night...what a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I rarely review products, but I have to give this a few stars. I used this as a night moisturizer for a couple of nights, and my boyfriend (unprompted, mind you) commented how nice my skin looked. This serum is a light oil, I only needed one pump for decent coverage. Good for nighttime because I woke up with my skin feeling super soft. The &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; claim is a bunch of BS, so if you&#x27;re looking for firming cream, don&#x27;t bother with this. Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t use for daytime because there&#x27;s no SPF, and sometimes oil can have the opposite effect, but other than that this is great.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and it is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I like this for a light night tme moisturizer. Very light and sinks in nicely without leaving oily residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use just a small amount morning and evening. In about ten days, I have seen a difference in fine lines and my skin seems brighter too! Smells great and no bad ingredients for a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Not greasy like some products I&#x27;ve tried. This is an oil but absorbs in to face quickly. I place a drop or two in my lotion or place it directly on my face after placing it on my fingers. Especially in areas that my need a little more attention. I was so excited my husband could tell a difference in my face after a day or two and asked my what I was doing different! I loved it! I will continue to use Acure Organics Seriously firming Serum.&lt;br /&gt;My order was delivered propyl even in a blizzard! The seller and product are both 5 Star!</li>
            <li> Looks like it would be oily, but it is very smooth and settles in quickly and is lovely for this dry winter as a serum layer.</li>
            <li> This is not serum, misleading label, it&#x27;s facial oil. This is a long lasting extreme moisturizer for very dry skin like mine. Makes skin silky and comfortable, I cannot go without oil on my skin ever. But common now, if you have oily acne prone skin, how do you expect it not to break out, if using oil? Please don&#x27;t give this product 1, 2, 3 stars if you didn&#x27;t do you research. Every review states that it is oil.</li>
            <li> Too oily. Not moisturizing at all</li>
            <li> 5 stars. I don&#x27;t even like Serum, but I totally enjoy this product. I use on nights that I use my Neutrogena treatment pads (2-3 times a week). Acne stuff usually drys my face out, but these pads not so much, and the Serum just feels amazing over it. Like.. its not disturbing what the pad left on my face, and its giving me all these nutrients from the organic oils into my open newly emptied pores. luv dot com, okay! and it only takes 1 pump for your whole face down to your neck.</li>
            <li> i LOVE this serum. perfect for a night time moisturizer - it leaves the skin a little too oily to be a daytime moisturizer. Considering all the high quality ingredients, the price is great. my face feels firmer when i use it!</li>
            <li> So, help me understand wh a sticker was placed over the directions on how to use the product? (speechless).....very disappointed right now.</li>
            <li> Nothing great about this serum for me. Saw no improvement using it. Didn&#x27;t hurt nor did it help. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Aweful- I just threw it out- it just sits on the skin and no tightening at all.</li>
            <li> An excellent brand, sold at Whole Foods but sold here for about the same price. It leaves my face vibrant, not dry at all. We live in a humid area so I think I get a little more oily but I feel this product really helps my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain what the difference is between this item and the Acure Moroccan Argan Oil..but it&#x27;s a great product. Light enough that it works into your face after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This REALLY hydrates my skin, but it is surprisingly not oily/greasy.  I put in on at night when my face it feeling dry.  I wake up &amp; feel like I had a facial!</li>
            <li> ❤️❤️❤️❤️💕💕💕💕it worked fine.  The bottle makes it come out a little too much and quickly so be careful.</li>
            <li> I love Acures products. They have made an amazing difference in my skin because I have an autoimmune condition I have to use natural ingredients as much as possible. However, I found I liked the Argan Oil they make better than this.</li>
            <li> Not sure this is really a serum, its really a face oil.&lt;br /&gt;Which I love, very hydrating and plumping.&lt;br /&gt;My skin soaks it up, use a cream after absorption and only use at nighttime.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery!!! Quality product! Thank you!</li>
            <li> To tell you the truth, No one has said nor noticed any changes on my skin,however,I like it,because it leaves my skin soft.The only drawback,is that it&#x27;s way too oily and stains my pillowcases.</li>
            <li> Lines are definitely diminished.</li>
            <li> Holy grail serum/oil. This is It for me!  I&#x27;m done searching for the perfect serum, I pair this with their night cream every night. It&#x27;s a perfect combination for my skin.  I wake up to soft, moisturized skin.  Sometimes I put this on twice a day if I&#x27;m super dry.  I&#x27;ve switched over most of my skin care and shampoo products to acure brand and my hair and scalp have never been better!</li>
            <li> Seems to oily at first I was nervous because my fave breaks out easily.  But I have been using it for over a month no breakouts and my skin is not dry and flaky like it usually is in the winter.  I love it, a little goes a long way so it&#x27;s a good price.</li>
            <li> love this serum.  Have purchased for awhile now.  Where can you go to get an organic serum for this price.???</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this. Lavender is perfect for bedtime. And it seems to have evened out my skin color &amp; lines. Nicely hydrated. Really like this product.</li>
            <li> This is a mixture of oils. I put it on my face, one pulse in the palm of my hand, after my moisturizer and I think it looks great and feels great!. At night I mix a few drops of Indian Tulsi Oil with the serum and I put it before the night cream. Excellent results !</li>
            <li> I can certainly see a difference in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> oh my gosh- all I can say is breakouts, breakouts, breakouts!!! I am in my mid-30s, and have sensitive, dry, and mildly acne prone skin, that usually stays under control.  Before trying this product, I used a number of night creams w/ oil and had no problems with breakouts. I tried this b/c I liked how natural it is, and read some good reviews about face oils for skin like mine.  My face brokeout ALL over after less than a week of use.  I had blackheads, whiteheads, and deep red acne that hurt.  It has been 6 weeks since I stopped using this product, and my skin still feels rough all over from the breakout. I&#x27;m thinking of getting microdermabrasion or something to clear this stuff out of my pores. I have black heads on my cheeks, which has never happened before in my life.  Unless you have skin that never breaks out, don&#x27;t believe the hype about oil cleansing- it doesn&#x27;t work!  I would test this product in a small area for a week before putting it all over your face.  I only used one pump too- it&#x27;s not like I was bathing in oil.</li>
            <li> Skin feels smooth and less breakouts!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, feels good going on, smells nice.</li>
            <li> I love anything from Acure. This makes my skin feel super soft and it smells great and very natural. You instantly feel a different and amazon has a great price ($17). It can sell for $30 in the store. I&#x27;m a long time fan of this brand. Great for all skin types. There is argan oil in it (wonderful!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s vegan and organic. No gluten, sulfates, parabens, phthalates, petroleum, PEG, synthetic fragrances or silicone. 100% biodegradable and cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Organic safflower oil, organic sesame seed oil, organic pumpkin see oil, organic borage oil, organic argan oil, organic sweet orange oil, organic cranberry seed oil, organic bulgarian lavender oil, organic olive oil, organic rosemary oil.</li>
            <li> It is not certified so it is filled with GMO! Try a certified brand and do not waste your time. It chemicals</li>
            <li> My incredibly sensitive, reactive skin loves this face oil. It smells wonderful and gives my skin a healthy glow without clogging pores or leaving any residue….</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this Serum (oil)! I literally only use one pump for my whole face, it spreads evenly and absorbs really well. Even though it&#x27;s all oil, I still feel like my skin can breathe. I love that there are no chemicals, and the mixture of ingredients must be perfect for my skin because I use this twice a day and my skin is the clearest it&#x27;s ever been! I wash my face twice a day with ACURE Facial Cleansing Gel Superfruit + Chlorella, then follow up with using the ACURE Serioulsy Firming Facial Serum. Every other day I use the ACURE Organics Brightening Facial Scrub Sea Kelp+ Chlorella Growth Factor to switch it up.&lt;br /&gt;I have always been self conscious about my large pores on my cheeks and nose, I&#x27;ve been using this combination of products for about a week and I&#x27;m in love, absolute LOVE with my skin again! It&#x27;s truly amazing! I don&#x27;t normally write reviews for products unless they are terrible, but I have to share! These will be my new skin care products, hands down, and I intend to convert my friends and family onto ACURE!</li>
            <li> I love it.  It&#x27;s a great product not only for your face but for you hair as well.  It goes on nicely and I do see an improvement on the texture of my face.&lt;br /&gt;It plumps your skin, it gives a soft sheen and it&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It is an oil that isn&#x27;t oily.  Really helps my skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely the piece to fit the puzzle. For smooth, soft and glowing skin this serum is it. It&#x27;s not too heavy or oily, it&#x27;s just right.👍</li>
            <li> I use this when I need a little extra hydration, usually at night. I don&#x27;t really notice any firming action, but I think it breaks me out each time I use it...I have had oily, acne prone skin my entire life, however. It&#x27;s a good eye makeup remover, but otherwise, just a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> Made my face break out, but it&#x27;s great for the neck.</li>
            <li> Love love love!!! amazing serum.  i use it once every night after apply my night cream.  you wake up and your face is smooth and silky soft!  WOW.  My skin is usually very dry, red and also my skin peels.  since using this product i&#x27;ve seen a huge difference.  When i noticed what affect it had on my super dry cheeks i thought i would apply it on my son who&#x27;s 7 months old with extreme dry cheeks and flaky.  2 days later voila his cheeks are so moisturized and soft i couldn&#x27;t believe it.  the oil ingredients are organic and on the bottle says it restores moisture to the skin’s lipid layer which is exactly what i needed.  I wish they did a baby range</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for almost a week now and so far I love it. My skin looks luminous and feels very soft after applying!  I really feel like it visibly smooths the fine lines around my eyes and mouth too!!  I have tried dozens of anti-aging skin products and this is by far my favorite to date!  I love that it is organically made and not tested on animals too!</li>
            <li> Back for my third bottle. I love this product. I wish they made it in a larger size. Quick tip that works for me I use this first, let it absorb for a couple seconds and then use a light moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li> This product made my skin break out and I, therefore, cannot use it.  I guess I should have known better because a lot of products containing oil cause my skin to break out but I guess I was swayed by all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> Love it !! Super moisturizing and my skin just loves this oil. It&#x27;s great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Love it smells very nice and feels great on the skin</li>
            <li> So far I like the product. Makes my skin soft, and after the bottle is used up, will see if there is a reduction in wrinkle areas.</li>
