            <li>The closeness of the shave is okay and battery life is excellent.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this purchase as my Norelco shaver works great and was priced at a bargain cost.</li>
            <li>Excellent razor works fine.</li>
            <li>This is a fine shaver and a superb deal, but for me, I&#x27;ll stick to my almost ancient version of it.</li>
            <li>We are used to electric shavers (vs disposable razors) and we think it gives quite a good shave.</li>
            <li>note that on this razor is printed: \\&quot;Made in Netherlands\\&quot;, which is a bit surprising, since to my knowledge, Phillips Norelco consumer electric/electronic devices (including the PT730) have been made in China for some time.</li>
            <li>The PT724 is a good mid-level product.  </li>
            <li>even if battery low&lt;br /&gt;-low price, good value</li>
            <li>My son loved this razor.  </li>
            <li>This razor gives me a good shave.</li>
            <li>The razor flows fairly effortless across the contours of the face and deliver a close shave.  </li>
            <li>A good value.</li>
            <li>Good value</li>
            <li>Good, close shave and the charge lasts for days &amp; days.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>what is it good for then?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dependable and does a good job at shaving.</li>
            <li>and it looks good to me.</li>
            <li>Good price.  </li>
            <li>It is a good razor.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is good and if you use it once a day, you should charge it once every two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Good bargain.</li>
            <li>like it because is rechargeable, the three blades give you a perfect smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>Good quality razor for my son.</li>
            <li>The product is really good, i have had norelco for about 20 yrs.  </li>
            <li>Seems to hold a charge well; but does not do a good job to cut &amp;#34;thick, full&amp;#34; beard.</li>
            <li>Superior design.</li>
            <li>After reading the good reviews on this shaver, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>A good choice for the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair the downsides of Electric:&lt;br /</li>
            <li>This is a good value cordless razor from Philips.</li>
            <li>This razor does a fair job of trimming, but on my neck, it&#x27;s not as close of a shave as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>Good shave in about two minutes.</li>
            <li>He has done nothing but rave about this Norelco Shaver since he received it, loves the features, so I&#x27;d have to say for price and product it was a good buy.</li>

            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Another good thing about it is that it works so well for a good price.</li>
            <li>Not so good.</li>
            <li>Does a good job</li>

            <li>I got this as gift, they were nice,</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re accustomed to a manual razor, you&#x27;re used to getting a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And, don&#x27;t expect any kind of precision with this thing.</li>
            <li>Nice, yet inexpensive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, the lithium ion battery is nice.  </li>
            <li>My husband has loved Norelco razors for many years.  </li>
            <li>This Phillips Norelco does a nice job though, and doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin.</li>
            <li>that also shaves nice and close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife liked to use my razor for her legs, and we had one that I had got in college in the 1960&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>As an inexpensive travel razor, this product works nicely.</li>
            <li>The side burn trimmer is nice too.  </li>
            <li>Nice shaver for the $$.</li>
            <li>Would be nice to have a stand</li>
            <li>He has been wanting an electric razor for awhile and says shave is nice.</li>
            <li>Nice product and met my requirement.</li>
            <li>A nice razor for a nice price.  </li>
            <li>I have used a Shick Quattro 4 blade razor for years and liked it quite a bit.</li>
            <li>My husband really liked the shaver.</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast and packaging was great!</li>
            <li>Good for the price and husband satisfied.</li>
            <li>Its a nice price for what you get.</li>
            <li>The price also is more than fair.  </li>
            <li>But this one is effective and</li>
            <li>This razor gives my husband a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>Nice shaver for the money.  </li>
            <li>Gives a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>Nice razor.</li>
            <li>I got this as a gift for my husband but it did not work as well as we would have liked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the Braun that I am replacing, but not quite as good as the $80-$100 models out there.</li>
            <li>He really liked ir</li>
            <li>What a nice razer.  </li>
            <li>It cuts nice and close without pulling or knicking my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s handy to have, holds</li>
            <li>This is a nice shaver for the price.  </li>
            <li>Husband is loving this gift.</li>
            <li>I believe, and still believe, even after using this one, that the best shaves come from a non-electric device, with a real razor blade.</li>
            <li>lithium ion battery is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>think that this particular Norelco is a perfect blend of simplicity and function at a price point</li>
            <li>Charges good, Clean Shave!</li>
            <li>perfectly Gives a close, smooth,  adequate shave.</li>
            <li>My husband is very happy with his new razor.</li>
            <li>This is a good useable shaver that is both economical and serves a good utilitarian purpose.</li>
            <li>Cleanup is very easy.</li>
            <li>It also glides across my face very easily.</li>
            <li>Pretty darn good for the price!</li>
            <li>Very good shaving experience, clean and comfortable</li>
            <li>Great price for such a good razor!</li>
            <li>The trimmer works great too, and I love just opening it and rinsing it clean.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had many electric razors, but this one works great and gives a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>He really flipped at the excellent price and he is more than satisfied with the razor.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to clean it, and wash the screen with mild soap and water to get the best results.</li>
            <li>It is nice to be able to move around though now.</li>
            <li>Of those, I liked the 9000 series most.  </li>
            <li>Aside from the charging I liked the Norelco much better.</li>
            <li>(I have a light beard, so YMMV...), and gives as good a shave as one can expect with an electric.</li>
            <li>He tells me it is light in his hand and does a good job.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied and find I use the Norelco more and more.</li>
            <li>Purchased this razor from Amazon after seeing a competing razor on a Best Buy Daily Deal -- am very satisfied with this razor.  </li>
            <li>Excellent razor, much better than my old one, quieter too!</li>
            <li>bottom line is that this is a very good basic rechargeable shaver which will gives good value for the money.  </li>
            <li>gives good clean shave</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this product has been pretty great</li>
            <li>It has met my expectations and then some, very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>* Very light weight&lt;</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>that being said - there is something amazing about how easy it is.</li>
            <li>The PT724/41 Powertouch lives up to the promise and includes a lithium ion battery, which is becoming more popular in electric razors for extended shaving time between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has a good feel in hand and gets job done quickly.</li>
            <li>They are reliable, easy to use, and perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love this razor and it works fine!</li>
            <li>The pop up edger does a really nice job though of creating a fine neck line under a beard or for trimming the sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Battery life seems very good so far.</li>
            <li>The price was better then any I could find.  </li>
            <li>this shaver is better than the one I bought before.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Electric shavers seem to work better on some than others.  </li>
            <li>I am sure you will like it.</li>
            <li>I love not having to lather my face up with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I love not having to rinse the razor after every pass.</li>
            <li>like better than reg bick razer</li>
            <li>Pleased with the close shave.</li>
            <li>An outstanding shaver.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my dad and he is pleased with the quality and performance.</li>
            <li>It worked much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay works well.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get many shaves in before having to worry about charging the battery and the power of lithium ion</li>
            <li>My recommendation: if you travel, and don&#x27;t want to spend more, get this shaver.</li>
            <li>for any of these models, they come with the better 8-series combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thing I didn&#x27;t like is that there is not a replacement option for the battery if the battery were to die (or not keep a charge, which I&#x27;m sure will happen at some point).</li>
            <li>This shaver replaces a Norelco purchased many many years ago.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We have been a &#x27;Norelco&#x27; house for many years now</li>
            <li>My husband hasn&#x27;t said, but I don&#x27;t think he is quite as satisfied with it as I thought he would be, the shaver doesn&#x27;t seem to give a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; shave.</li>
            <li>I bought thus as a gift for my son I am sure he will like it too.</li>
            <li>But this one is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Works great and the price is really good.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>Used in that context, I&#x27;m okay with it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad i did.  </li>
            <li>It is very quiet as well, very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I Love my Philips Norelco PT724/41 Philips Powertouch Electic Razor.</li>
            <li>but probably would cost us more.</li>
            <li>but I think that is offset by the better grip.</li>
            <li>He charged it once, mainly to top it off since we were traveling.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I used it exclusively as directed for 4 weeks and am now looking for a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve started shaving more often.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the close shave.</li>
            <li>I had hoped for better results.</li>
            <li>; it&#x27;s a lot better than trying to brush stubble fragments out of the mechanism.</li>
            <li>I had purchased Norelco Razor many times before, and always have been satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works okay.</li>
            <li>Hairs seemed to be for the most part collected in the shaver head.</li>
            <li>If I used it every day I would recommend you buy a better Razor.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>So you have to go over it more than once.</li>
            <li>This shaver works very nicely, much better than my 9195 with brand-new replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>It cleans up easily; provides a good clean shave; holds the charge; and compact too.</li>
            <li>and I have owned many electric razors through the years.</li>
            <li>thing that could be better would be if it had a spring corded charger.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s excellent.  </li>
            <li>Just seems to work better with each use.</li>
            <li>the norelcoPT724/41 is really good and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I would like to see more moving parts with a stronger motor.  </li>
            <li>I am perfectly satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>The product cheaper than buying more than $30 in China.</li>
            <li>I have been using Philips, more trust the quality.</li>
            <li>What more could you want?</li>
            <li>I would like to see more things made in America though.</li>
            <li>If not, then factor in the worthwhile upgrade in the price.</li>
            <li>He is in the acne stage of his life and this works out better for him than a razor.</li>
            <li>Better than I thought.</li>
            <li>works ok ,</li>
            <li>(so there&#x27;s more gunk to be cleared</li>
            <li>I had a Norelco that died after many years.  </li>
            <li>It Was a gift to my husband and he love&#x27;s it</li>
            <li>I get more than a week on a charge, and it works close without causing ingrown hair issues.  </li>
            <li>My father said it works great, THANKS</li>
            <li>Okay for the price.</li>
            <li>It works much better than the Remington shaver I used to use.</li>
            <li>I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they will.</li>
            <li>Nice close smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave every time!</li>
            <li>I have to guess more as to where they are and sort of shave into my beard to make sure the blades are getting close</li>
            <li>I love it~</li>
            <li>It feels very familiar, lighter, better charging cable.</li>
            <li>Good battery life, sharp blades, good shave, good value for the money.</li>
            <li>Works very well, keeps the charge and is a great successor to the great older razors</li>
            <li>Great razor, glad I got it to replace my older unit.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco</li>
            <li>Really good product, the first days you will have some iirritation, but after all ok.</li>
            <li>Cleaning and maintenance is very easy with detailed instructions.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth his face is after an easy shave with this!</li>
            <li>Great razor,charges fast  cuts smooth and quickly,  very comfortable to hold</li>
            <li>The very modern design and the way it fits the hand is a plus for the talented people who designed it.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I am using,and found no problems.as good as the first shaver.</li>
            <li>Best shave I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li>Works well just as described, love the rechargeable feature and easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a good razor and has a good clipper as well.</li>
            <li>A good machine, in my opinion is necessary for a good shave.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Very easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>My college son says the Philips Norelco PT724/41 Philips Powertouch Electric Razor feels comfortable on the skin and is a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>&gt; Once done, rinse your face with water and voila you will be a clean shaven man!  </li>
            <li>This shaver is excellent cuts very close and easy to use the floating heads work very well and</li>
            <li>I love being able to wash the razor clean rather than using a brush.</li>
            <li>Best shaver I have used ,I really like that you can rinse it under hot water to clean it .</li>
            <li>, MY FIFTH OR SIXTH MODEL, IS THE MOST COMFORTABLE YET.</li>
            <li>OLD ONE GREAT.</li>
            <li>This was the best $40 I have ever spent.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been satisfied with the ability of the blades to give me a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Replaced his old one, and he is happy.</li>
            <li>I love this type of Philips , just comfortable</li>
            <li>Really liking how good it works.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this shaver followed that course, but for the money it provides a very workable solution.&lt;br /&gt;The good things:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really good shave Much closer</li>
            <li>It also charges fast which is good also.  </li>
            <li>The Braun vibrates so much and while it gave a good shave for a while the head lost its edge after maybe 3 months.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have much good to say about this razor.  </li>
            <li>Not as close a cut as with a razor, but much quicker and nearly as good.</li>
            <li>Very nice Electric razor,  shaves very close good clean shave , fast shipping</li>
            <li>the battery system is much more \\&quot;speedy\\&quot; in the 1150X, in that it recharges much more quickly.  </li>
            <li>He has Parkinson&#x27;s Disease and is somewhat limited with what he can do, but he&#x27;s happy that he can still shave his own whiskers.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a very clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver and i am glad I got it!</li>
            <li>Oh and by the way make sure to clean the razor heads after each shave.  </li>
            <li>I find that my skin is never irritated and it shaves very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold and to operate.</li>
            <li>The razor was as advertised and shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to grip.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it cleans up easily and lasts just about forever.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold in your hand</li>
            <li>Easy to use and wash.</li>
            <li>* Easy to see and understand LED indicators.</li>
            <li>It is an easy to use shaver.</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s easy to clean (you can detach the head and run the trio of rotating razors under the tap) makes it an even better investment.</li>
            <li>Bleeds easily.</li>
            <li>It replaced a much older Norelco that was also good, but had quit working.</li>
            <li>The price was good, but I have 10 year old Norelco Razors that cut better than this one.</li>
            <li>The battery seems to hold a decent charge; I get 9-10 good shaves between plugins.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>In fact, this shaver uses the superior lithium ion battery technology where the older ones use NiCad.</li>
            <li>Run the water again and get some more hands full of water to the face to rinse off leftover</li>
            <li>I wanted him to have a nice product for his first electric shaver but didn&#x27;t want to break the bank just in case an electric razor wasn&#x27;t his thing.</li>
            <li>The electric shavers good quality, origin of the Netherlands, arrived quickly, but the packaging is simple commodity intact, have been charged to use, my husband is very satisfied.</li>
            <li>He says it does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>and it shaves just fine.</li>
            <li>and it now it&#x27;s working fine again.</li>
            <li>Works just fine.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a razor and shaving cream, but it is fine for weekends, which is when I use it or when I am in a hurry.</li>
            <li>I purchased this razor to replace my ladies razor and it works fine for my purposes.  </li>
            <li>battery life is fine.</li>
            <li>Razor was fine and I give it a 5 star rating</li>
            <li>Seems to be working fine for my Dad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>However, if you are looking for a more fully featured shaver (with for example a quick charge, a charging stand and a travel case), I suggest you choose another product.</li>
            <li>I love the quick shave mode which is shaving while it&#x27;s plugged on.</li>
            <li>I still use my manual razor if I have an important meeting or if I have a date night with my wife, but for most days this electric razor is adequate.</li>
            <li>Light and easy to pack, this razor gives a close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Clean cut, easy on the face, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Cheap but working fine.</li>
            <li>It gives me a smooth shave and has an attached trimmer that works fine for sideburns, etc.  </li>
            <li>yea OK...but with a little pain....not sure i would recommend!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Excellent, little noise</li>
            <li>This way the motorized heads will shave more powerfully and closer.  </li>

            <li>whiskers fall into the razor and are easy to clean out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently on the hunt for a great razor.  </li>
            <li>The shaver gives fairly smooth shave</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>He likes it; says it works well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>But it is smooth and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It shaves close and is comfortable.</li>
            <li>light weight (</li>
            <li>Great razor and got it here for only 39.99.</li>
            <li>Second one- just great.</li>
            <li>Perhaps there are others more powerful</li>
            <li>An extremely smooth shave that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>The heft and feel of this razor is light and platic-y, which can tend to make me question the quality of the parts and hence the longevity before having to replace it.</li>
            <li>The heft and feel of this razor is light and platic-y, which can tend to make me question the quality of the parts and hence the longevity before having to replace it.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Nice and a reasonable price</li>
            <li>This razor doesn&#x27;t give you a smooth shaving if you have days of hair growing on your face.</li>
            <li>He says it works great and would definitely buy another one</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to clean</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Amazon replaced it and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with most anything Phillips has to do with lately.</li>
            <li>I thought a man&#x27;s electric razor was built for the sensitive skin for a face so it might be good for legs.  </li>
            <li>the side cutter does it job good, and for forty dollars why spend more for the same shave</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband for Christmas and so far, so good.</li>
            <li>The new one is fast, holds a charge for many days, cleans easily, and does a good job.</li>
            <li>My husband is very satisfied with his new Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean under hot water faucet and shaves very comfortably.</li>
            <li>Would Highly recommend this!!!!</li>
            <li>That is very useful when traveling.</li>
            <li>very nice for regular shaving.....</li>
            <li>Its light and small (good for travelling), shaves close, has no irritation when using it, and is still fairly cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives a smooth clean close shave.</li>
            <li>He was/is thrilled with this particular one.  </li>
            <li>great for the price- can&#x27;t tell difference from my previous model which was supposedly a better model</li>
            <li>&gt; The first and foremost requisite is to make sure to wash your face with soap and water and leave the face damp for shaving.  </li>
            <li>I originally went to Amazon to purchase heads for my husband&#x27;s Norelco shaver, but saw this shaver on sale and decided to purchase it instead.</li>
            <li>More than the higher end model that he&#x27;s had for some time,</li>
            <li>Read an article where you have to buy a higher model # to get the better blades.</li>
            <li>Great shave and battery lasts a long time between charges.</li>
            <li>It holds the charge for a long time and provides a great shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase, it&#x27;s an unbelievable price performer for a rechargeable razor (i&#x27;m over a dozen shaves without recharging)</li>
            <li>For some of us Norelco users, the company reached some sort of peak in shavers with the original Quadra XL line.</li>
            <li>Love that you clean with running hot water.</li>
            <li>but this one is very good and does the job and costs quite a bit less.</li>
            <li>The flip out trimmer could work a little better, but all in all, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>He started his first shaving with a Phillips Norelco rotary and now several years later this kind is still the best.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sort of in the way when you want to clean it -</li>
            <li>Fell apart when opened it up to clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought norelco electric razors before and this one has been the best so far especially for the price.</li>
            <li>So now I remove the head and clean it with water but do not run water over the body of the shaver.</li>
            <li>Even though they sold them, the old repair guy told me not to replace them unless I had problems; he said they were self-sharpening and lasted many years for most people.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that it stores cut hair inside, leaving the user and sink area clean of debris.</li>
            <li>so I clean it with the brush.  </li>
            <li>this razor, east to clean and use.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t decided whether I like the way you clean it on not?  </li>
            <li>, you can still have a clean looking face before having to run out...</li>
            <li>Provides a nice close shave and fits comfortably to my hand - not heavy or bulky.</li>
            <li>clean shave.</li>
            <li>and I get a clean shave in 1/5 of the time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain that there are better shavers out there...</li>
            <li>Works just as advertised, and the lithium batteries are a special pleasure.  </li>
            <li>I Like it and the price was right!  </li>
            <li>the PRICE IS RIGHT!  </li>
            <li>In using the razor make sure you stretch the skin as you shave as this will cut the beard much closer.  </li>
            <li>means that you&#x27;ll get good, constant power until the battery is drained.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li>Good battery life and the quietest motor I have ever heard on a device such as this.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and defitnely enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>I use it when I&#x27;m rushed and don&#x27;t have the time (or patience) to do the shaving Full Monty.</li>
            <li>So in a lot of ways I think this is a superior choice especially in the value department.</li>
            <li>Well, that may be true to some extent like materials used but this razor is everything</li>
            <li>but surprisingly it was the opposite.</li>
            <li>The smaller charger is also good.</li>
            <li>razor shaves well and is a good choice for anybody who doesn&#x27;t want a razor with a lot of extra features or accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;*A full charge takes 8 hours&lt;</li>
            <li>It is quiet, lightweight, and does a good job.</li>
            <li>Perfect razor, if I had a complaint I suppose it would be that what you see is what you get, razor and a cord,</li>
            <li>Love this shaver, works as its supposed to and very reliable.</li>
            <li>Also bought battery operated - 2 AAs - that runs much faster and is OK.  </li>
            <li>It is quiet and will not wake my roommates up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;The price is fair,</li>
            <li>I have to go over my face several times to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>Does a good job, especially when I haven&#x27;t shaved or a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I do not speak English, but this good.</li>
            <li>A nice step up from my old 7310 which I like a lot.  </li>
            <li>Even though I have fairly full hair growth</li>
            <li>No memory effect and a full charge lasts for about 45minutes of shaving time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco shavers for many years and they have also been very reliable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily, everyone knows ball cooties die at midnight, so if you do your face and then your balls, you&#x27;ll be good to go the next morning.</li>
            <li>It takes 12 hours to do a full recharge which is good for only 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>is super easy to clean and maintain, I like this razor very much and wholeheartedly recommend it.umps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>is super easy to clean and maintain, I like this razor very much and wholeheartedly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, easy to use and clean, and gets hair on my neck that my old Braun foil did not get easily.  </li>
            <li>and we&#x27;re concerned that the hinge could break off pretty easily, and</li>
            <li>Worth a few more bucks to get a more effective shaver.</li>
            <li>Sharp with a great design.</li>
            <li>Great battery life I charge once every other week or so.  </li>
            <li>On the first full charge i received 7 full shaves before the time to charge light came on.</li>
            <li>great price/ every thing as expected!</li>
            <li>i will be happy and just buy a new one --- cheap enough.</li>
            <li>more can I say, it gives a great shave and it does not break the bank like some other high end models.</li>
            <li>Though I don&#x27;t always do this, if you want to continue with any electric and get a close shave quickly, this should be done.</li>
            <li>Every charge gives it 40 minutes of use, which is a lot considering how quick you&#x27;ll finish shaving with this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To conclude, while I love Norelco shavers, the PT724 requires replacement heads to do a great job, so I recommend upgrading to at least the PT730.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and arrived as described.</li>
            <li>This razor is adequate.</li>
            <li>What you&#x27;re going to get is a device that will do an *adequate* job - you&#x27;ll feel and look as if you&#x27;ve shaved, but you&#x27;re not going to be complimented on how closely you&#x27;ve shaved.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better shavers in this category, but they can only marginally mitigate the fundamental flaw that all of these devices share.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and on time.</li>
            <li>This does an adequate (nothing to complain about) job of cleaning up around the lips, soul patch, and adam&#x27;s apple after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have done better to replace the blades in the older model as this does not shave well at all.  </li>
            <li>Gave me mild irritation, shave is as close as when i shave with a razor.</li>
            <li>Fastest way to shave when you gotta go somewhere quick.</li>
            <li>...recharges quickly and stays charged up to three weeks.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok shaver but the shaver heads are of the older variety.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had an electric razor irritate my face the way this one does; stay away and actually spend the money to get something that will give you a nice, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>This item really gives a close shave and is easy to use and clean, I recommend everyone purchase this item.</li>
            <li>It provides a comfortable and pretty close shave.</li>
            <li>Overall:  Very pleased with the razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Been using for awhile, holds charge well, shaves well, overall very pleased.</li>
            <li>This one is easy to use, somewhat lighter than the old one, and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>In every other way it does a good job unless you want to spend many times as much and get a \\&quot;little\\&quot; closer shave.</li>
            <li>this new one is so much better.</li>
            <li>I had a norelco previously and it too was a great razor.</li>
            <li>Great shave, improvement over my previous Norelco Rotary shaver.</li>
            <li>As long as it does a reasonable job I am happy.  </li>
            <li>Works very well and easy to use.</li>
            <li>but not necessarily thorough - this is a good first electric razor for someone frightened of skinning themselves in the process.  </li>
            <li>To clean the unit, you flip open the top and the top remains attached - we don&#x27;t like that so much, because it is just plastic</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an excellent value shaver especially for one who is value minded or as a first shaver as a gift for that youngster just starting out in his shaving life.</li>
            <li>The light weight of this new model at first felt flimsy compared to the older one, but, after using it, the lighter weight IS nice.  </li>
            <li>I bought this new shaver to replace my old Philips Norelco that I had for many years, it finally gave up working, The new shaver works great, I love it.</li>
            <li>Then you just run hot water in and around the chambers and through the razor head to clean it all out.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and liking it more and more!</li>
            <li>Norelco has a great reputation and this little gem has a two year warranty.</li>
            <li>This rechargeable Norelco electric shaver gives a fast, smooth and close shave (by electric shaver standards) with no pulling or irritation of my skin.  </li>
            <li>It feels so smooth on my face, yet it really shaves.</li>
            <li>If you need a close shave without the pain, this shaver is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Works well but does not seem that much better than my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>Much better than my old shaver.</li>
            <li>Nice flip-out blade on back for trimming!</li>
            <li>Frankly, I was surprised that this one seems to shave better, and faster than my SpeedXL 8140.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice not to have an extra item around).</li>
            <li>Could be useful for travel</li>
            <li>The pop up trimmer seemed like a nice extra when I bought it</li>
            <li>I would give it only ONE star, but the Norelco customer service agent was SO kind and helpful when I called to return it.  </li>
            <li>OK as far as Electric Shavers go, not the Closest shave out there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as easy as older models</li>
            <li>Certainly worth the $40 price.</li>
            <li>one is by FAR the most efficient shaver for me.</li>
            <li>THE RAZOR IS WELL WORTH $34.95</li>
            <li>I own a different model of Philips Norelco that shave well</li>
            <li>Not a big fan of rechargeables but is nice not fighting plug-in wire.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this kind of razor before but tried a foil razor last time.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts for 15-20 shaves, so it&#x27;s a nice upgrade from my last one.</li>
            <li>Worked well and much better than my old worn out Norelco.</li>
            <li>somewhat effective, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver so far.</li>
            <li>It does cut pretty good, but not completely.</li>
            <li>So far I love this.  </li>
            <li>It works so much better than his old model.</li>
            <li>So far, really is a good shaver and better than expected.  </li>
            <li>My last shaver before this one was an 8138XL which was pricier and had some better features such as: greater surface area, and most important to me, a longer battery charge (50 minutes) with (and this is the most important feature) a lot less time for charging (1 hour versus 8 hours on this model).</li>
            <li>It works great, is hard to clean, because you have to disassemble the blade system.  </li>
            <li>Good for a quick clean up shave, but doesn&#x27;t go as far down as a razor would to make it completely smooth.</li>
            <li>Very much, easy to use, frequency of use after charging too much, do not waste electricity, I feel very comfortable, reasonably priced</li>
            <li>long battery life, clean shaves, so easy to clean quickly.  </li>
            <li>But all in all you will have a clean appearance that will last through most of the day.  </li>
            <li>Good basic electric razor, no frills, but decent.  </li>
            <li>It seems to make even old blades cut like razors doing a very clean job.</li>
            <li>As good as my other Philip shaver.</li>
            <li>It may not have the heft and solid sound of the Norelco products he has owned in the past, but as always it does an excellent job.</li>
            <li>The 5 minute quick charge (for a single shave) is nice also.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed at the right price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the position of the power-on button, which is right where my thumb goes</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the position of the power-on button, which is right where my thumb goes</li>
            <li>The price was right and amazon sent the shaver in a couple of days.</li>
            <li>This shaver does not seem to be working right.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is not charging right or what.</li>
            <li>But I throw package away right after I receive it</li>
            <li>I was right.  </li>
            <li>takes a while to cleanly shave your whole face</li>
            <li>These cut fast and clean from day one, even before the heads had time to \\&quot;break</li>
            <li>Smooth, fast, quiet, and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The battery generally lasts me more than a week of shaving.</li>
            <li>Was afraid we needed to spend more, but this lower priced shaver is comfortable and does a great job.</li>
            <li>But that is a small inconvenience for an otherwise great rotary shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned 4 Norelco triple headers over the past 30 years and they are just great to shave with.</li>
            <li>Have bought Phillips or Norelco products over the past 40 years - have always been happy with them.</li>
            <li>It is,  by far, the best one I have used yet - such a close shave, it is quiet and runs on battery or power.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re not going to get an exceptional shave from this electric razor or any other.</li>
            <li>If I had it to do over I would spend a little more to get the better model</li>
            <li>My husband loves his new razor - He has had electric shavers before that were not as comfortable and efficient as this Philips Norelco.  </li>
            <li>I CAN NOT STAND VERY LONG, AND THIS RAZOR ALLOWS ME TO SIT AND STILL GET A NICE CLOSE SHAVE.</li>
            <li>Purchased this electric razor primarily to shave my head, it works fantastic and equally as well on my face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Razors like this seem to do a better job of catching my thick curly hairs.</li>
            <li>triangular razor head isn&#x27;t as precise as a straight edged head and the pop-up trimmer doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a pretty cheap (~$30) electric razor package I got at Walgreens, so this is my first experience with a decent electric razor ...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend using water to clean.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast and arrived sooner than promised.</li>
            <li>The unit cuts smoothly and uniformly despite other reviews that claim the two stage screens cut even better.</li>
            <li>This would have been a useful feature, since the shaver lays flat on the counter when not in use, taking up more space than the 8260XL, which came with a charging stand.  </li>
            <li>A pretty good little electric razor does the job</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had this for about 3 weeks and think it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to make several passes over each part of your face.  </li>
            <li>That said, I have owned many different Norelco&#x27;s over the years.  </li>
            <li>When I was young and primarily shaved with a safety razor, I got the smoothest shaves in my life.</li>
            <li>Bought it as a gift for a first time user.</li>
            <li>The instructions for both the 7310XL and the Shaver 3100 said they can be cleaned by flushing under running hot water.</li>
            <li>When the first Shaver 3100 died I opened it up the 7310XL and found that the motor was covered in rust and locked up.</li>
            <li>Makes me wonder if water leaking into the first 3100 caused its demise.</li>
            <li>sure enough, that was the difference.</li>
            <li>While Norelco says the battery can&#x27;t be replaced, on many Norleco models you can find third party replacement batteries online and solder them in.</li>
            <li>PT734/41]] is the PT730 with a stand but currently costs much more.  </li>

            <li>PT734/41]] is the PT730 with a stand but currently costs much more.  </li>
            <li>It offers a smooth shave in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>The earlier cheaper model i had was better.</li>
            <li>This one has the ability to pop open the top and rinse the clippings out with water under the faucet.  </li>
            <li>I assume these ones shave better because of a more open design, or sharper blades or some such since they dont have to be waterproofed.</li>
            <li>So in that sense for me, these cheaper Norelcos actually do work better.</li>
            <li>I really like this razor!</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;I have been using a Phillips Norelco 8240XL for several years, which costs more than this model.  </li>
            <li>The PT724 has a lithium battery, a low battery indicator, charging and full charge indicator light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a damn shame they don&#x27;t come with the razor in the first place.</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied with the same.</li>
            <li>I have tried to use it while shaving my dad and it seems to miss entire sections no matter how many times I go over the area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the first charge</li>
            <li>Ran heads under hot water with top open, added couple of drops of hand soap, used brush to help remove clog and to dissolve body oils and to remove any remaining hair.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li>So, i am pretty picky about electric shavers.</li>
            <li>and I love how quiet it is.</li>
            <li>I have shaved four times and still on first charge.</li>
            <li>I was an avid Norelco customer.</li>
            <li>I even could not finish shaving for the first time.</li>
            <li>I will upgrade to a better product next time.</li>
            <li>This is my second electric, this one much better than the first.</li>
            <li>My first shaver was a Philips Norelco and I&#x27;ve had it for maybe 8 years now, still works but doesn&#x27;t hold a charge</li>
            <li>I had used a different leading brand for many years.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Great for the price, with the added bonus of a liithium battery which hoipefully will last a long time.</li>
            <li>By the time the water is hot (a minute or 2)</li>
            <li>Turn the hot water on and rinse out the razor.</li>
            <li>His stubble is getting thick now and this works great.</li>
            <li>Phillips can make it even better if they can design it to use standard charger, like USB or micro USB.</li>
            <li>It works very well; &amp;#34;Like socks on a rooster&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make a loud buzzing sound when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>Being able to rinse it under hot water is a BIG plus.</li>
            <li>However, I bought the razor for my son and he absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>I have a  set from my old unit and the new set cuts better than the fancier screens.</li>
            <li>All the new Norelco models look super efficient and I am sure the review will be the same no matter which model you select.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;there aren&#x27;t many downsides other than initial cost, which is easily offset even by the relatively cheap blade packs for the quattro and shaving</li>
            <li>The best part is that the lithium ion batteries are lasting longer per charge than the older batteries, and shouldn&#x27;t suffer from the charge memory that killed the batteries after a year or so use.</li>
            <li>It lasts me a week on one charge for the most part, on par with the other but this one seems to take longer to charge, overnight for full.</li>
            <li>I realize this is far from their top model, but even when fully charged and/or plugged in it is very sluggish, and takes twice the time to shave as most other shavers do.</li>
            <li>I had am older shaver with upgraded heads and replaced the new ones with the better quality using the new cutters and that did the trick</li>
            <li>My older Philips shaver needed new cutters, however this was on sale and cost me $10 more than a new set of cutters.  </li>
            <li>The overall feel is that is is made of lightweight plastic materials, but then it is a great value for money, so that is to be expected.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to clean it with water (just old fashion I guess)</li>
            <li>The brush also doesn&#x27;t seem to clean it out completely.</li>
            <li>(I am not sure how true that is), but he ended up loving it.</li>
            <li>The Phillips multigroom actually works better at this point (I have had the multigroom for 2 years without changing the blade, so that is saying something) and it&#x27;s much cheaper and comes with additional attachments.</li>
            <li>but it is good for daily use (especially at this price).</li>
            <li>The older model only has a charging and full charge light, no lithium battery and no way to tell if a charge is needed except by performance.  </li>
            <li>The razor generally works well, and I appreciate the thoughtful charging lights.</li>
            <li>PT724 does not come with a charging stand and apparently none is available.  </li>
            <li>As long as there is a screen between the blade and your face, it will never, ever be able to get as close as a blade.</li>
            <li>it worked really well for the first two shaves</li>
            <li>Obviously since this is not what it was designed for I don&#x27;t get the same silky smooth feeling like a razor , it&#x27;s more like the feel</li>
            <li>Good for its pricing but not a top notch shaver.</li>
            <li>Replacing a Norelco that is probably 10+ years old because the batteries will not longer hold a full charge / carry the charge as well.  </li>
            <li>Does not pull the skin, and gives a smooth shave nearly as close as a classic hand razor.  </li>
            <li>The heads and blades seem to me a bit slower and effective compared to the previous Norelco tgat I owned.</li>
            <li>A good clean shave in a short period of time, and recharges fully in a few hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably good when it comes to electric razors, and the battery does last a long time.</li>
            <li>Well, as for myself, I value this purely for convenience.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad i finally bought this new electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to report that this is it and the price was half the price of the 8240XL and less than the original one.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have never been able to shave so close and not irritate my skin around the corners of my mouth and upper chin area.</li>
            <li>But for occasional use it I&#x27;d fine</li>
            <li>this particular razor is that he uses it all of the time now!  </li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t have a little travel case, which I would have liked</li>
            <li>Meh... I had pretty high expectations when I bought this shaver</li>
            <li>If you, like me, have been a razor traditionalist (I even tried a straight razor for a brief period) considering a switch to electric, my take away from using this one is: don&#x27;t be cheap.</li>
            <li>Smooth,  fast, and quiet.</li>
            <li>not cut as close or as fast as SensoTouch models (albeit 3x the cost).</li>
            <li>I like the PT724/41 because it can be cleaned by running it underwater, which works very well.</li>
            <li>Does so in about 1/3 the time, which makes irritation SO much less.&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li>I gave this to my boyfriend as a gift because he really wanted one.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to men and it does get a close shave!</li>
            <li>Husband is very safisfied with shaver.</li>
            <li>very close cut.</li>
            <li>Lather up your skin with some water and this just glides over your skin, giving you a very close shave without hurting.</li>
            <li>Works better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very practical product</li>
            <li>What I really do is shave in the shower every morning.</li>
            <li>So I recommend it.any times as much and get a \\&quot;little\\&quot; closer shave.</li>
            <li>As much as I like Norelco razors, I don&#x27;t recommend this model.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To conclude, while I love Norelco shavers, the PT724 requires replacement heads to do a great job, so I recommend upgrading to at least the PT730.l shave, but if they can go 10 years with almost daily use, the HQ8 (which appear very similar in design and quality) might do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It provides a very close shave and the razor</li>
            <li>I know that my husband really likes</li>
            <li>The pop out razer part doesn&#x27;t really cut.</li>
            <li>This is worth the price so far.</li>
            <li>Works great on my son&#x27;s thin beard</li>
            <li>The motor seems anemic, but I can&#x27;t complain too much given what I paid.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, it works very well.</li>
            <li>but it is more convenient than a wet shave</li>
            <li>Quiet and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Very close shave without irritation.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know much about it myself...</li>
            <li>A real 1st class dud.  </li>
            <li>I wrote Norelco regarding this experience and like all modern day companies, they chose to ignore me.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my son and he really likes it.  </li>
            <li>I bought a Braun for my son that costs twice as much as this</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut that fast</li>
            <li>I really like this razor.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need the cordless ability that much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s MUCH easier than cleanup with my razor</li>
            <li>Very good!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It provides a smooth close shave, is very quiet and stays charged for about a week.</li>
            <li>From packaging to operation to cleanup, it&#x27;s very intuitive.</li>
            <li>Much quieter, too.</li>
            <li>very close shave</li>
            <li>but he&#x27;s been using a straight razor for years</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>so it must be modern materials like space craft.</li>
            <li>Does not cut very close and therefore the shaver has to be used almost twice a day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gift for my father, have not used, it is packed very well.&lt;br /&gt;Strongly</li>
            <li>fast shipping /</li>
            <li>Feels very underpowered.</li>
            <li>, the shaver does not make noise, is fast, I recommend it hundred percent.</li>
            <li>I have had a Philips shaver before and it worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>performed better than expected ...</li>
            <li>The shave is close, confortable, and fast.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had and used this razor about 2-3 weeks now, and I really like it.</li>
            <li>He really likes it</li>
            <li>Cutting is excellent as always, Battery seems to hold charge longer than&lt;br /&gt;previous models.  </li>
            <li>I took a chance because I didn&#x27;t really know if he would like it or not.</li>
            <li>He said he really likes it because it shaves him without breaking his face out.</li>
            <li>and he uses it on his whole head and face.</li>
            <li>Very good.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>For the price, this is a real winner.  </li>
            <li>* Cleaning is an absolute cinch.</li>
            <li>/&gt;All said and done, for the price and getting something that works very well and</li>
            <li>/&gt;All said and done, for the price and getting something that works very well and</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot of money.</li>
            <li>Much closer shave than what i was used to...</li>
            <li>got more than we expected for an inexpensive price..</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>We tried foil shavers and they did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair on my face and it grows fast</li>
            <li>Cleaning is the easiest ever and the shave head really removes the whiskers.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>does not shave very closely.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Which probably made a lot of sense, back when everything was so cheap.</li>
            <li>High five!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve straight razor shaved all my life and thought I&#x27;d try this to speed things up and skip the step of lathering.  </li>
            <li>THIS is much safer for him now.</li>
            <li>If there is any kind of distinction between where your chin ends and your neck begins, you&#x27;ll have to put a lot of effort into avoiding having a narrow line of stubble hang on there</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an everyday use washable shaver with a not so effective trimmer.</li>
            <li>Gives me a nice shave, but some times i have to use the traditional shave because it can&#x27;t cut the smaller hairs</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old Norelco which, after many years of usage, finally &amp;#34;died.&amp;#34;  The cost of replacing the battery was so high that it felt right to buy a new razor.  </li>
            <li>For example, the part which holds the rotating blades is fastened by plastic &#x27;dog and house&#x27; rather than the positive metal of the older model.</li>
            <li>But on the other hand, by the time I get done the razor is getting pretty warm, and seems to be irritating my face a lil more, and I dont have the option to cool it off or to apply a cream to my face ahead of time.</li>
            <li>Express is very powerful, DHL need only three days arrived in China.  </li>
            <li>This razor cuts quickly and no drag.  </li>
            <li>back to this model,  I like the way this one works - it is indeed a clean shave.</li>
            <li>but it definitely takes the pokey feeling away and leaves a clean shaven look.</li>
            <li>Can not get a clean shave on chin or upper</li>
            <li>Has decent battery power; I get almost 2 weeks out of each charge and teh shave has remained reasonable.</li>
            <li>This razor is virtually identical to my previous model, Philips Norelco PT730, with the exception that the PT724 does not come with a travel bag, and has a blue panel instead of black.&lt;br /&gt;The razor is capable of shaving fairly closely without irritation to the skin of the neck.</li>
            <li>I shave with a special shaving cream and it gets as close as a regular razor.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this razor to anyone wanting a clean shave at a low price.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s actually quite a bit more useful than I expected as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, an uncharged battery in the PT724 takes a full 8 hours of charging to bring it up to a full charge, while the time required to accomplish the same result in the 8260XL is only 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li>May try that when I get time, but also read that some people are changing the batteries (requires some soldering) in the old units, which says the old units overall are better than the one&#x27;s being made today.</li>
            <li>The PT724 gave as good a shave as the more expensive shaver, although it is not as quiet as the 8240XL.  </li>
            <li>girlfriend is pretty sensitive to stubble though</li>
            <li>Amazon offers so thanks to the quality of goods we use, thank you!</li>
            <li>This was a Christmas gift for my 20 year old son and his first electric shaver.</li>
            <li>but it really could use bit just a little more power</li>
            <li>Also repeat more often in the tough bearded areas to get the desired smooth results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>New in box.....works really well for my beard.....</li>
            <li>Not super energetic but it will do.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat it for the price and much better than the previous model from about 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>More hair falls out while I shave than on my previous electric razor, though.</li>
            <li>I have owned many Philips Norelco and Norelco shavers before, which have typically lasted anywhere from 7 - 10 years.</li>
            <li>Instead, I recommend the [[ASIN:B006GQYSGO Philips Norelco PT730 PowerTouch Rechargeable Cordless Razor]] which has better combs (what Norelco calls the screens that touch your face) which is currently about the same price.</li>
            <li>far it&#x27;s been much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: This razor gives a decent shave and none of the things I dislike about it</li>
            <li>Bought this for my elderly father to replace an older model.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps more expensive shavers provide a better experience.  </li>
            <li>It holds its charge for a decent time frame.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Going back to this now has been a tremendous surprise.  </li>
            <li>The razor replaces an older Norelco, so I already knew what to expect.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge a decent while as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I think this is common with electric shavers... and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I have an older corded model.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>On the basis of satisfaction per dollar, this product scores high for me.</li>
            <li>Buy Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, let you know how it holds up longterm.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Philips Norelco shavers.     </li>
            <li>Sure enough, 10 years later they still cut as well as my new HQ8 heads.</li>
            <li>Looking for a clean shave that lasts long?</li>
            <li>The rotary action works much better than other vibratory razors I have used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little better and can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li>You have to have a completely dry and clean face for optimal operation.  </li>
            <li>It is much easier to grip as well than his old one, he says.</li>
            <li>An old but very practical shaver.</li>
            <li>Works best on thin hair, such as facial hair.</li>
            <li>That is to say, when I&#x27;m done shaving, I look the way I would normally look early in the afternoon after having shaved with a real razor at 6AM.</li>
            <li>Close shave on normal growth</li>
            <li>Since thats pretty much the same you&#x27;d get from a women&#x27;s elec razor</li>
            <li>And this is pretty much the same razor I used when I was in the hospital having my spine rebuilt in 1968.</li>
            <li>more lets see how long they last.</li>
            <li>I tried, following the instructions for adapting from a blade to electric, but after I got razor burn 3 times, I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Because my husband normally like to use a disposable razor, I didn&#x27;t feel the need to pay a hundred plus dollars for one.</li>
            <li>Met all of his expectations and has no negative remarks regarding razor.</li>
            <li>I still prefer razors, as this tends to leave my face dryer than normal even with applying lotion or after shave.  </li>
            <li>this is a good, but not great razor.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>New is always nicer, and is worth the extra cost.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is my favorite part of this razor, I only charge mine every 2 or 3 weeks, it lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li>So we went right back to this.</li>
            <li>However, the heads on my old razor were only a couple months old, and I keep them clean.</li>
            <li>had to buy an adapter because I live in Portugal.</li>
            <li>it was time for a new one.</li>
            <li>hope the company provide the new products (the produced date) for us.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>I ordered the new razor for backup and to see how technology had come around in over 10 years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works like brand new.</li>
            <li>I figured that if, from now on, I am going to need to buy a new shaver</li>
            <li>Got this because I needed a new razor and it was on sale with a coupon.  </li>
            <li>Of course it&#x27;s still new, but that&#x27;s it for now.  </li>
            <li>I buy a new razor rather than buy replacement blades -</li>
            <li>So I was contemplating buying a new head</li>
            <li>I thought I could live without that, but I like the visible notification.  </li>
            <li>here&#x27;s what it looks like with this new</li>
            <li>For someone new to electric shaving, it can take up to 3 weeks for your skin to adjust to it.</li>
            <li>Was time for a new one.  </li>
            <li>I apply the head savings toward the cost of a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>my husband loves his new razer</li>
            <li>The charge seems to last and last and while the results are not as smooth and close as he had hoped for, it works, travels well and the ability to rinse the heads is a plus.</li>
            <li>It was smooth and effective cutting hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for over 2 months and it gives me a close shave, maybe not razor close, but smooth enough for me without the hassle of shaving daily.</li>
            <li>one complaint is that if you&#x27;re stubble is turning into a beard (say more than a cm in length) then this doesn&#x27;t really work for shaving it - you&#x27;ll need a separate beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>But once I started buying replacement heads more recently, I found that they are no good, nowhere close to the quality of the original heads.  </li>
            <li>Charges quickly and runs all week on a single charge.  </li>
            <li>Very surprised by how close a shave he can get.  </li>
            <li>my old norelco 10 yrs old shaved a little better</li>
            <li>The only problem is that the heads were not giving me the same close shave I was used to from the 9160, but it turned out that the HQ9 heads I&#x27;d bought for the old model fit the new one.  </li>
            <li>Good at home and good for trips away from home where 110 v outlets are sometimes hard to find or in an inconvenient location.  </li>
            <li>The shave is comparable to that provided by my much more expensive Norelco 8260XL shaver which I have regularly used for more than four years.  </li>
            <li>In general, I do not care that much about the replacement heads&#x27; surface area.</li>
            <li>he&#x27;s found they are much stiffer and harder to shave, but this item left him feeling as smooth as the proverbial &#x27;baby&#x27;s bottom.&amp;#34; Norelco will continue to be his electric shaver of choice.</li>
            <li>razor has a quieter hum similar to higher end models.</li>
            <li>razor has a quieter hum similar to higher end models.</li>
            <li>then my old one!</li>
            <li>Left the first one on a cruise ship.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 14 year old son and he loves it!</li>
            <li>Pull the lever on the back of the faucet to close the stopper and let the hot water collect in the basin.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 17 year old son who&#x27;s not too hairy and he loves it!</li>
            <li>Norelco has always been easy on my sensitive skin, way less irritated</li>
            <li>It leaves my face smooth with less pressure, compared to brand B.</li>
            <li>This thing is much quieter than any past shavers I have owned, it is curved and glides smoothly over my skin.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been using it every few days for the past year and it still runs great.  </li>
            <li>Package arrived quickly and everything was as expected.</li>
            <li>After a few passes of rinsing the razor in the water, it gets gunked up so drain that out and fill-up again with fresh hot water.</li>
            <li>full charge last only 1-2 dayes!</li>
            <li>well, that is what I first thought, but after using this shaver a couple of times I realized that I got a really close shave in one quarter of the time of my older heavy, high speed shaver.</li>
            <li>I may have only needed new blades in my old razor, but this new one shaves much closer.</li>
            <li>If I have a 5-6 day mess I use it as a prep for the razor, and it makes it very easy to shave the long growth.</li>
            <li>Norelco essentially forced me to give up on my favorite model (9195XL) and buy a new unit.  </li>
            <li>Wet shave is better than dry.</li>
            <li>The blades cartridges are reasonable and even though single blade disposable razors tend to leave nicks, the I never had much problem with irritation with the Quattro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco PT724/41 Powertouch Electric Razor provides a comfortable, close shave with little to no irritation.  </li>
            <li>It does not trim as deeply as the ~$200 model of Norelco shaver that I have, but it also doesn&#x27;t miss large patches like some of the cheap models I have used in the past (Remington, in particular).</li>
            <li>, I hardly noticed the difference with the old but better razor.</li>
            <li>The shaver was quiet and smooth but was not as close of shave as expected.  </li>
            <li>This is the replacement for  the old 7301 model.  </li>
            <li>As somebody that has tried countless electric razors (Philips Norelco, Braun, Wahl, Remington, and others), I often don&#x27;t have much faith in what the manufacturer often advertises.  </li>
            <li>Philips Norelco 6940 Reflex Action Men&#x27;s Shaving System[[ASIN:B00AEINQ9</li>
            <li>His old one died and he had been on the look out for another for some time.  </li>
            <li>The recharge times are pretty long.</li>
            <li>Now it shaves just as close as my old 6885XL.</li>
            <li>About 2-3 years after I got my old</li>
            <li>Keep it lubricated if it gets loud - use a shaver spray lube periodically.</li>
            <li>Keep it lubricated if it gets loud - use a shaver spray lube periodically.</li>
            <li>It has a sturdy feel that is not too heavy, but not too light either.</li>
            <li>my old Norelco razor.</li>
            <li>Unlike my old norelco the blades need some improvement....</li>
            <li>I had an old norelco which was geat and lasted me 6-7 Years</li>
            <li>That means that when the early afternoon hours do arrive I look as if I have 5 o&#x27;clock</li>
            <li>silent and very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my 10+ year old one was.</li>
            <li>also like the fact that the charger plugs into it instead of having a stand (I could plug in my old one and not use the stand as well,</li>
            <li>You actually can get a reasonably close shave with these blades.</li>
            <li>I chose this brand because I had an old shaver from Philips and the experience was good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I do like it quite a bit so far .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Been using this for several months and it seems to do the job reasonably well.</li>
            <li>Early days, though: how well will the battery be doing six months from now?</li>
            <li>It has a rubbery surface causing friction compared to the all metal one on my old razor.</li>
            <li>This shaver exceeded my expectations, It quiet and gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li>This is a replacement for my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>So, when my old one died about 2 years ago, I just became patient and waited until I could afford to get another one.</li>
            <li>At least a week or more in my case.</li>
            <li>and it is directly in touch with the skin.</li>
            <li>I got this shaver for my 82 year old father who was determined he would not like it.</li>
            <li>I got this for my son (15 years old) for Christmas.</li>
            <li>He does have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The Norelco handles the extra days of stubble much</li>
            <li>So far this is the item I was looking for-</li>
            <li>I really like the quiet of the rotary motor compared to reed motors.</li>
            <li>I have been a Norelco user all of my adult life and when the battery would not charge anymore, I had to look for another one and got the Philips Norelco PT724/41 Powertouch Electric Razor.  </li>
            <li>It is quiet, and gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor to replace my old Norelco which I thought was on</li>
            <li>How ever now I &#x27;am shaving with both razors ,the old one just won&#x27;t die.</li>
            <li>I was surprised for the money.</li>
            <li>If you have anything like sensitive skin, forget this shaver.</li>
            <li>This razor isn&#x27;t for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old one, which needed replacing, after I dropped it on a tile floor.  </li>
            <li>I have used Norelcos for 50 years and I still look as young as I did when I was shaving peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and really like it.  </li>
            <li>Much smoother cut than my last model.</li>
            <li>It really depends on your personal preference.</li>
            <li>, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>However, this is clearly a shaver built for the value sensitive customer.</li>
            <li>As for me, after using this for a bit, I returned to Amazon and ordered another set of batteries for my old Quadra.</li>
            <li>only costs a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>but I also like the ability to use it in the shower (to cool it down) or with cream or some sort of lubricant.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a place that simply doesn&#x27;t exist and never will until Gillette comes out with their nifty digital, pinpoint laser hair zapper, right around the year 2150.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;You wouldn&#x27;t want to use this before you head to the church to get hitched, nor would you use it before heading out on a date or any other important occasion where appearances are of the utmost importance - especially if photos will be taken.</li>
            <li>Just back off the pressure a bit and go back over the same areas for a clean shave.</li>
            <li>You have to consider that shaving is usually only a minute or two job so a single charge will last you for a week quite easily.</li>
            <li>Does exactly was is expected and good value for the money... really like the indicator that the cutting heads need to be replaced.</li>
            <li>Ok seriously my electric shaver of choice is a Braun that I used for a lot of years.</li>
            <li>it is not giving me a clean shave i dont want to go through the trouble to re furn it</li>
            <li>I guess it is OK but not real impressed.  </li>
            <li>As he has gotten older, and his whiskers turned from brown to white</li>
            <li>The big one may be - this particular one has some defect ?  </li>
            <li>Get a couple of hands full of water and splash my face to get it wet for the foam and to open the pores for closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>Actually it looks almost exactly like his last one.</li>
            <li>Does exactly everything more expensive shaver do.</li>
            <li>My older razor, you just have to open it and brush it</li>
            <li>works fine on medium to heavy beard so far, but I don&#x27;t use it daily.  </li>
            <li>will think I&#x27;m comparing new to old, and obviously that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s a difference.</li>
            <li>but, in light of the price I paid (less than $40), it&#x27;s terrific.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts quite long and holds charge really wells.</li>
            <li>Admittedly, I may have lighter facial hair than others, and spend only 90 seconds or so per full shave, but if they can go 10 years with almost daily use, the HQ8 (which appear very similar in design and quality) might do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>any case, I&#x27;d thought I was picking up this PT724/41 razor to be a travel/back-up for my 1150X, but it has quickly taken the other&#x27;s place, and I now use it as my regular razor, with my 1150X serving as my backup.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Almost as inexpensive as purchasing the replacement heads, but decided to get the new one because will/should last longer!  </li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the design of the rotary blades is slightly different than my previous Norelco, and you can&#x27;t see the sides as well when you&#x27;re shaving, so it&#x27;s not quite as easy to shave around the edges of my beard.</li>
            <li>Purchased one in early December 2014 and it completely died about 4 weeks later.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fairly simple razor, but much nicer than an basic model.&lt;br /&gt;One reason</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have a lot of growth and only see a few light hairs coming in after 3 days, then this shaver might work for you.  </li>
            <li>Shaves my face So fast (takes me half the time as my older one)</li>
            <li>I got this in hopes that it&#x27;d be a good replacement because sooner or later, the motor in mine will fail which is a part I cannot replace.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Such an improvement over my old Norelco!</li>
            <li>Maybe because of my curly hair and sensitive face, I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding just the right razor.</li>
            <li>If cost isn&#x27;t a factor by all means, but if you want to pay less and not sure which one to get, then this one will do nicely.  </li>
            <li>The razor has a charging status light that conveniently lets you know when it is about time to recharge, but typically still retains enough power to finish the current shave.</li>
            <li>I dont have super thick or fast facial growth</li>
            <li>I decided to give this electric shaver a try and see if I couldn&#x27;t reduce some of the time and mess the whole process takes, especially since i&#x27;m prone to get zits if I don&#x27;t wash my face really thoroughly after using shaving</li>
            <li>The three blade setup is nicer than the long blade kind that a few other electric razors use.</li>
            <li>there really isn&#x27;t much different from the older model (uses the same heads HQ8).</li>
            <li>Also, the PT724 has automatic worldwide voltage, something that is not on my older, more expensive model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is light and you hardly know its on.  </li>
            <li>I have had several Norelco shavers and this is of equal quality to those, which is quite high in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I was disappointed in my first use as the razor didn&#x27;t glide as smoothly on my skin compared to my old one, but the shave was really close compared to my old razor blades.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, and smooth, but it doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as some I have had in the past.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving since I was old enough to shave...</li>
            <li>my old 6885XL charges in about 1 hour for a similar use time.</li>
            <li>my old 6885XL charges in about 1 hour for a similar use time.</li>
            <li>I understand that everyone is different and every skin type varies, but this review is directly from my experience.</li>
            <li>and I barely had to charge it today and this reminded me about writing my review today.</li>
            <li>not go back to old way</li>
            <li>but now it barely shaves my stubble at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much quieter than I expected too.</li>
            <li>Expect to go over same spot multiple times to cut hairs(possibly in different directions), mirror is an absolute necessity when using this.</li>
            <li>The shave was really close,better than expected.</li>
            <li>Not much else to say, there are so many different razor models out there, but this one is above average.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for an old one of the same that broke after 30 years.</li>
            <li>Never going back to old razors again</li>
            <li>Barely a three star item, but it does get the job done at a value.</li>
            <li>This is quite big compare to my old Panasonic brand, and I&#x27;m alright with it.</li>
            <li>Just upgraded from an 11 year old Norelco that finally broke.  </li>
            <li>In this case light weight and slow RPM is something I will probably appreciate over time.</li>
            <li>I have had a Norelco razor for 15 years and many of the models in the intervening years have been poor.  </li>
            <li>It was heavy and ran with a powerful motor.  </li>
            <li>New blades cost almost as much as an entire new shaver, so he not only has sharp blades, but also a new motor.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my husband for Fathers day and though he never really get&#x27;s excited about much he does use it every day and hasn&#x27;t complained.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not holding it&#x27;s charge as long as it did when it was new (over 7 years ago ).</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco shavers for many years and though I have in the past tried other brands, I always return to Norelco.</li>
            <li>Overall, the PT724/41 exceeds the shave provided by other razors in higher price ranges.  </li>
            <li>I tried other kinds and he said they don&#x27;t work like this, so next time, maybe in another 5 years, we will buy another exactly like this.</li>
            <li>The way this thing is design made it hard to clean because there are holes and parts that will trap your hair.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s much quieter than the other electrics I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>You can buy a new razor for less than the cost of new blades and a battery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Meanwhile my much more expensive fancy $200 Norelco has quit on me twice now and is just over a year old and therefore out of warranty.</li>
            <li>Gives a decent, close shave, but you have to be careful using it.</li>
            <li>The one caveat is that they are round and are hiding under the head area making them a little bit challenging when determining where the line of cut is on your face; something that is critical if you have a goatee or beard.</li>
            <li>I did this not long ago with my 6885XL</li>
            <li>I did this not long ago with my 6885XL</li>
            <li>When I went on Amazon to get replacement blades, I saw this model on sale for $30 which was the same price as replacement blades for my more expensive ($150) old razor.</li>
            <li>caau/sed me to wait too long and get the old model clogged up.</li>
            <li>entire affair is lighter and offers less a sense that you are holding a device machined out of a billet than the older models.</li>
            <li>I tried to use it on my sideburns the first few times but eventually stopped bothering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Put foam on my face and start shaving, rinsing the razor out in the hot water in the basin after every few swipes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but its blades has half life span as my old one, I need to decide whether to buy a new shaver or change its blades in one year.</li>
            <li>The narrowness of where you grab the unit makes it a bit harder to hold onto compared to the older model, which was larger all around.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, it feels like I haven&#x27;t shaved with it no matter how hard I press!</li>
            <li>blade rotation speed seems a little slower than it should be with a full charge, but as long a blades are sharp, it is not a problem (so far)</li>
            <li>And, I was surprised to find that even a dry shave gave me no razor burn.</li>
            <li>The no-prep and no-mess of Electric means any last minute social or business situation that comes up</li>
            <li>As an aside, the other shaver brand I like is Braun - I have an older battery-operated Braun travel shaver similar to the [[ASIN:B002PCPZQA BRAUN POCKET SHAVER M60B]]</li>
            <li>Blades dull quickly showing low quality.</li>
            <li>The initial charging of the PT724/41 took about 12 hours (I don&#x27;t yet know how long the charge will last), while recharging of the 1150X takes about 20 minutes and lasts nearly a month.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is slight pulling on whiskers when the razor is moved too fast, not allowing for the blades to fully cut.</li>
            <li>The hair that&#x27;s left behind won&#x27;t wash out easily.</li>
            <li>....inexpensive, uncomplicated, and provides a very close, comfortable shave, without irritating my sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;Had a Remington shaver before this, and was not satisfied with the way it shaved.</li>
            <li>The battery life is decent and it slows down when</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> But, we did want this type of shaver, and among those we looked at, believe this was our best option.</li>
            <li> Now that&#x27;s a great bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> It is not the best shaver that I have ever had, but consider the pricing of this shaver.  </li>

            <li> I am very satisfied with this purchase as my Norelco shaver works great and was priced at a bargain cost.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor works fine.</li>
            <li> This is a fine shaver and a superb deal, but for me, I&#x27;ll stick to my almost ancient version of it.</li>
            <li> We are used to electric shavers (vs disposable razors) and we think it gives quite a good shave.</li>
            <li> note that on this razor is printed: \\&quot;Made in Netherlands\\&quot;, which is a bit surprising, since to my knowledge, Phillips Norelco consumer electric/electronic devices (including the PT730) have been made in China for some time.</li>
            <li> The PT724 is a good mid-level product.  </li>
            <li> even if battery low&lt;br /&gt;-low price, good value</li>
            <li> My son loved this razor.  </li>

            <li> what is it good for then?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dependable and does a good job at shaving.</li>
            <li> and it looks good to me.</li>
            <li> Good price.  </li>
            <li> It is a good razor.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is good and if you use it once a day, you should charge it once every two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Good bargain.</li>
            <li> like it because is rechargeable, the three blades give you a perfect smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Good quality razor for my son.</li>
            <li> The product is really good, i have had norelco for about 20 yrs.  </li>
            <li> Seems to hold a charge well; but does not do a good job to cut &amp;#34;thick, full&amp;#34; beard.</li>
            <li> Superior design.</li>
            <li> After reading the good reviews on this shaver, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> A good choice for the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be fair the downsides of Electric:&lt;br /</li>
            <li> This is a good value cordless razor from Philips.</li>
            <li> This razor does a fair job of trimming, but on my neck, it&#x27;s not as close of a shave as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> Good shave in about two minutes.</li>
            <li> He has done nothing but rave about this Norelco Shaver since he received it, loves the features, so I&#x27;d have to say for price and product it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> enjoy it best way to shave</li>
            <li> Good shave always</li>
            <li> but the shaver does a fairly good job.</li>
            <li> Good shave for the money</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> Another good thing about it is that it works so well for a good price.</li>
            <li> Not so good.</li>
            <li> Does a good job</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery stays charged and provides a good life.  </li>
            <li> Good electric razor for the price.</li>

            <li> Gives a great  and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Compared to that dinosaur turd, this thing is amazing</li>
            <li> I got this as gift, they were nice,</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re accustomed to a manual razor, you&#x27;re used to getting a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And, don&#x27;t expect any kind of precision with this thing.</li>
            <li> Nice, yet inexpensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, the lithium ion battery is nice.  </li>
            <li> My husband has loved Norelco razors for many years.  </li>
            <li> This Phillips Norelco does a nice job though, and doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> that also shaves nice and close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife liked to use my razor for her legs, and we had one that I had got in college in the 1960&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> As an inexpensive travel razor, this product works nicely.</li>
            <li> The side burn trimmer is nice too.  </li>
            <li> Nice shaver for the $$.</li>
            <li> Would be nice to have a stand</li>
            <li> He has been wanting an electric razor for awhile and says shave is nice.</li>
            <li> Nice product and met my requirement.</li>
            <li> A nice razor for a nice price.  </li>
            <li> I have used a Shick Quattro 4 blade razor for years and liked it quite a bit.</li>
            <li> My husband really liked the shaver.</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast and packaging was great!</li>
            <li> Good for the price and husband satisfied.</li>
            <li> Its a nice price for what you get.</li>
            <li> The price also is more than fair.  </li>
            <li> But this one is effective and</li>
            <li> This razor gives my husband a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> Nice shaver for the money.  </li>
            <li> Gives a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> Nice razor.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my husband but it did not work as well as we would have liked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the Braun that I am replacing, but not quite as good as the $80-$100 models out there.</li>
            <li> He really liked ir</li>
            <li> What a nice razer.  </li>
            <li> It cuts nice and close without pulling or knicking my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s handy to have, holds</li>
            <li> This is a nice shaver for the price.  </li>
            <li> Husband is loving this gift.</li>
            <li> I believe, and still believe, even after using this one, that the best shaves come from a non-electric device, with a real razor blade.</li>
            <li> lithium ion battery is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> think that this particular Norelco is a perfect blend of simplicity and function at a price point</li>
            <li> Charges good, Clean Shave!</li>
            <li> perfectly Gives a close, smooth,  adequate shave.</li>
            <li> My husband is very happy with his new razor.</li>
            <li> This is a good useable shaver that is both economical and serves a good utilitarian purpose.</li>
            <li> Cleanup is very easy.</li>
            <li> It also glides across my face very easily.</li>
            <li> Pretty darn good for the price!</li>
            <li> Very good shaving experience, clean and comfortable</li>
            <li> Great price for such a good razor!</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great too, and I love just opening it and rinsing it clean.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had many electric razors, but this one works great and gives a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> He really flipped at the excellent price and he is more than satisfied with the razor.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to clean it, and wash the screen with mild soap and water to get the best results.</li>
            <li> It is nice to be able to move around though now.</li>
            <li> Of those, I liked the 9000 series most.  </li>
            <li> Aside from the charging I liked the Norelco much better.</li>
            <li> (I have a light beard, so YMMV...), and gives as good a shave as one can expect with an electric.</li>
            <li> He tells me it is light in his hand and does a good job.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied and find I use the Norelco more and more.</li>
            <li> Purchased this razor from Amazon after seeing a competing razor on a Best Buy Daily Deal -- am very satisfied with this razor.  </li>
            <li> Excellent razor, much better than my old one, quieter too!</li>
            <li> bottom line is that this is a very good basic rechargeable shaver which will gives good value for the money.  </li>
            <li> gives good clean shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this product has been pretty great</li>
            <li> It has met my expectations and then some, very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> * Very light weight&lt;</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> that being said - there is something amazing about how easy it is.</li>
            <li> The PT724/41 Powertouch lives up to the promise and includes a lithium ion battery, which is becoming more popular in electric razors for extended shaving time between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has a good feel in hand and gets job done quickly.</li>
            <li> They are reliable, easy to use, and perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this razor and it works fine!</li>
            <li> The pop up edger does a really nice job though of creating a fine neck line under a beard or for trimming the sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Battery life seems very good so far.</li>
            <li> The price was better then any I could find.  </li>
            <li> this shaver is better than the one I bought before.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Electric shavers seem to work better on some than others.  </li>
            <li> I am sure you will like it.</li>
            <li> I love not having to lather my face up with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I love not having to rinse the razor after every pass.</li>
            <li> like better than reg bick razer</li>
            <li> Pleased with the close shave.</li>
            <li> An outstanding shaver.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my dad and he is pleased with the quality and performance.</li>
            <li> It worked much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay works well.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get many shaves in before having to worry about charging the battery and the power of lithium ion</li>
            <li> My recommendation: if you travel, and don&#x27;t want to spend more, get this shaver.</li>
            <li> for any of these models, they come with the better 8-series combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thing I didn&#x27;t like is that there is not a replacement option for the battery if the battery were to die (or not keep a charge, which I&#x27;m sure will happen at some point).</li>
            <li> This shaver replaces a Norelco purchased many many years ago.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We have been a &#x27;Norelco&#x27; house for many years now</li>
            <li> My husband hasn&#x27;t said, but I don&#x27;t think he is quite as satisfied with it as I thought he would be, the shaver doesn&#x27;t seem to give a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; shave.</li>
            <li> I bought thus as a gift for my son I am sure he will like it too.</li>
            <li> But this one is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Works great and the price is really good.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> Used in that context, I&#x27;m okay with it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad i did.  </li>
            <li> It is very quiet as well, very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I Love my Philips Norelco PT724/41 Philips Powertouch Electic Razor.</li>
            <li> but probably would cost us more.</li>
            <li> but I think that is offset by the better grip.</li>
            <li> He charged it once, mainly to top it off since we were traveling.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I used it exclusively as directed for 4 weeks and am now looking for a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve started shaving more often.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the close shave.</li>
            <li> I had hoped for better results.</li>
            <li> ; it&#x27;s a lot better than trying to brush stubble fragments out of the mechanism.</li>
            <li> I had purchased Norelco Razor many times before, and always have been satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works okay.</li>
            <li> Hairs seemed to be for the most part collected in the shaver head.</li>
            <li> If I used it every day I would recommend you buy a better Razor.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> So you have to go over it more than once.</li>
            <li> This shaver works very nicely, much better than my 9195 with brand-new replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> It cleans up easily; provides a good clean shave; holds the charge; and compact too.</li>
            <li> and I have owned many electric razors through the years.</li>
            <li> thing that could be better would be if it had a spring corded charger.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s excellent.  </li>
            <li> Just seems to work better with each use.</li>
            <li> the norelcoPT724/41 is really good and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I would like to see more moving parts with a stronger motor.  </li>
            <li> I am perfectly satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> The product cheaper than buying more than $30 in China.</li>
            <li> I have been using Philips, more trust the quality.</li>
            <li> What more could you want?</li>
            <li> I would like to see more things made in America though.</li>
            <li> If not, then factor in the worthwhile upgrade in the price.</li>
            <li> He is in the acne stage of his life and this works out better for him than a razor.</li>
            <li> Better than I thought.</li>
            <li> works ok ,</li>
            <li> (so there&#x27;s more gunk to be cleared</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco that died after many years.  </li>
            <li> It Was a gift to my husband and he love&#x27;s it</li>
            <li> I get more than a week on a charge, and it works close without causing ingrown hair issues.  </li>
            <li> My father said it works great, THANKS</li>
            <li> Okay for the price.</li>
            <li> It works much better than the Remington shaver I used to use.</li>
            <li> I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they will.</li>
            <li> Nice close smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave every time!</li>
            <li> I have to guess more as to where they are and sort of shave into my beard to make sure the blades are getting close</li>
            <li> I love it~</li>
            <li> It feels very familiar, lighter, better charging cable.</li>
            <li> Good battery life, sharp blades, good shave, good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Works very well, keeps the charge and is a great successor to the great older razors</li>
            <li> Great razor, glad I got it to replace my older unit.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco</li>
            <li> Really good product, the first days you will have some iirritation, but after all ok.</li>

            <li> I am using,and found no problems.as good as the first shaver.</li>
            <li> Best shave I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li> Works well just as described, love the rechargeable feature and easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a good razor and has a good clipper as well.</li>
            <li> A good machine, in my opinion is necessary for a good shave.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Very easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> My college son says the Philips Norelco PT724/41 Philips Powertouch Electric Razor feels comfortable on the skin and is a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> &gt; Once done, rinse your face with water and voila you will be a clean shaven man!  </li>
            <li> This shaver is excellent cuts very close and easy to use the floating heads work very well and</li>
            <li> I love being able to wash the razor clean rather than using a brush.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I have used ,I really like that you can rinse it under hot water to clean it .</li>
            <li> , MY FIFTH OR SIXTH MODEL, IS THE MOST COMFORTABLE YET.</li>
            <li> OLD ONE GREAT.</li>
            <li> This was the best $40 I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been satisfied with the ability of the blades to give me a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Replaced his old one, and he is happy.</li>
            <li> I love this type of Philips , just comfortable</li>
            <li> Really liking how good it works.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this shaver followed that course, but for the money it provides a very workable solution.&lt;br /&gt;The good things:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really good shave Much closer</li>
            <li> It also charges fast which is good also.  </li>
            <li> The Braun vibrates so much and while it gave a good shave for a while the head lost its edge after maybe 3 months.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have much good to say about this razor.  </li>
            <li> Not as close a cut as with a razor, but much quicker and nearly as good.</li>
            <li> Very nice Electric razor,  shaves very close good clean shave , fast shipping</li>
            <li> the battery system is much more \\&quot;speedy\\&quot; in the 1150X, in that it recharges much more quickly.  </li>
            <li> He has Parkinson&#x27;s Disease and is somewhat limited with what he can do, but he&#x27;s happy that he can still shave his own whiskers.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a very clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver and i am glad I got it!</li>
            <li> Oh and by the way make sure to clean the razor heads after each shave.  </li>
            <li> I find that my skin is never irritated and it shaves very quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold and to operate.</li>
            <li> The razor was as advertised and shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to grip.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it cleans up easily and lasts just about forever.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold in your hand</li>
            <li> Easy to use and wash.</li>
            <li> * Easy to see and understand LED indicators.</li>
            <li> It is an easy to use shaver.</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s easy to clean (you can detach the head and run the trio of rotating razors under the tap) makes it an even better investment.</li>
            <li> Bleeds easily.</li>
            <li> It replaced a much older Norelco that was also good, but had quit working.</li>
            <li> The price was good, but I have 10 year old Norelco Razors that cut better than this one.</li>
            <li> The battery seems to hold a decent charge; I get 9-10 good shaves between plugins.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> In fact, this shaver uses the superior lithium ion battery technology where the older ones use NiCad.</li>
            <li> Run the water again and get some more hands full of water to the face to rinse off leftover</li>
            <li> I wanted him to have a nice product for his first electric shaver but didn&#x27;t want to break the bank just in case an electric razor wasn&#x27;t his thing.</li>
            <li> The electric shavers good quality, origin of the Netherlands, arrived quickly, but the packaging is simple commodity intact, have been charged to use, my husband is very satisfied.</li>
            <li> He says it does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> and it shaves just fine.</li>
            <li> and it now it&#x27;s working fine again.</li>
            <li> Works just fine.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a razor and shaving cream, but it is fine for weekends, which is when I use it or when I am in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor to replace my ladies razor and it works fine for my purposes.  </li>
            <li> battery life is fine.</li>
            <li> Razor was fine and I give it a 5 star rating</li>
            <li> Seems to be working fine for my Dad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> However, if you are looking for a more fully featured shaver (with for example a quick charge, a charging stand and a travel case), I suggest you choose another product.</li>
            <li> I love the quick shave mode which is shaving while it&#x27;s plugged on.</li>
            <li> I still use my manual razor if I have an important meeting or if I have a date night with my wife, but for most days this electric razor is adequate.</li>
            <li> Light and easy to pack, this razor gives a close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Clean cut, easy on the face, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Cheap but working fine.</li>
            <li> It gives me a smooth shave and has an attached trimmer that works fine for sideburns, etc.  </li>
            <li> yea OK...but with a little pain....not sure i would recommend!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent, little noise</li>
            <li> This way the motorized heads will shave more powerfully and closer.  </li>

            <li> Second one- just great.</li>
            <li> Perhaps there are others more powerful</li>
            <li> An extremely smooth shave that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> The heft and feel of this razor is light and platic-y, which can tend to make me question the quality of the parts and hence the longevity before having to replace it.</li>
            <li> The heft and feel of this razor is light and platic-y, which can tend to make me question the quality of the parts and hence the longevity before having to replace it.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Nice and a reasonable price</li>
            <li> This razor doesn&#x27;t give you a smooth shaving if you have days of hair growing on your face.</li>
            <li> He says it works great and would definitely buy another one</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to clean</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Amazon replaced it and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with most anything Phillips has to do with lately.</li>
            <li> I thought a man&#x27;s electric razor was built for the sensitive skin for a face so it might be good for legs.  </li>
            <li> the side cutter does it job good, and for forty dollars why spend more for the same shave</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas and so far, so good.</li>
            <li> The new one is fast, holds a charge for many days, cleans easily, and does a good job.</li>
            <li> My husband is very satisfied with his new Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean under hot water faucet and shaves very comfortably.</li>
            <li> Would Highly recommend this!!!!</li>
            <li> That is very useful when traveling.</li>
            <li> very nice for regular shaving.....</li>
            <li> Its light and small (good for travelling), shaves close, has no irritation when using it, and is still fairly cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives a smooth clean close shave.</li>
            <li> He was/is thrilled with this particular one.  </li>
            <li> great for the price- can&#x27;t tell difference from my previous model which was supposedly a better model</li>
            <li> &gt; The first and foremost requisite is to make sure to wash your face with soap and water and leave the face damp for shaving.  </li>
            <li> I originally went to Amazon to purchase heads for my husband&#x27;s Norelco shaver, but saw this shaver on sale and decided to purchase it instead.</li>
            <li> More than the higher end model that he&#x27;s had for some time,</li>
            <li> Read an article where you have to buy a higher model # to get the better blades.</li>
            <li> Great shave and battery lasts a long time between charges.</li>
            <li> It holds the charge for a long time and provides a great shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase, it&#x27;s an unbelievable price performer for a rechargeable razor (i&#x27;m over a dozen shaves without recharging)</li>
            <li> For some of us Norelco users, the company reached some sort of peak in shavers with the original Quadra XL line.</li>
            <li> Love that you clean with running hot water.</li>
            <li> but this one is very good and does the job and costs quite a bit less.</li>
            <li> The flip out trimmer could work a little better, but all in all, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> He started his first shaving with a Phillips Norelco rotary and now several years later this kind is still the best.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sort of in the way when you want to clean it -</li>
            <li> Fell apart when opened it up to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought norelco electric razors before and this one has been the best so far especially for the price.</li>
            <li> So now I remove the head and clean it with water but do not run water over the body of the shaver.</li>
            <li> Even though they sold them, the old repair guy told me not to replace them unless I had problems; he said they were self-sharpening and lasted many years for most people.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that it stores cut hair inside, leaving the user and sink area clean of debris.</li>
            <li> so I clean it with the brush.  </li>
            <li> this razor, east to clean and use.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t decided whether I like the way you clean it on not?  </li>
            <li> , you can still have a clean looking face before having to run out...</li>
            <li> Provides a nice close shave and fits comfortably to my hand - not heavy or bulky.</li>
            <li> clean shave.</li>
            <li> and I get a clean shave in 1/5 of the time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certain that there are better shavers out there...</li>
            <li> Works just as advertised, and the lithium batteries are a special pleasure.  </li>
            <li> I Like it and the price was right!  </li>
            <li> the PRICE IS RIGHT!  </li>
            <li> In using the razor make sure you stretch the skin as you shave as this will cut the beard much closer.  </li>
            <li> means that you&#x27;ll get good, constant power until the battery is drained.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> Good battery life and the quietest motor I have ever heard on a device such as this.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and defitnely enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> I use it when I&#x27;m rushed and don&#x27;t have the time (or patience) to do the shaving Full Monty.</li>
            <li> So in a lot of ways I think this is a superior choice especially in the value department.</li>
            <li> Well, that may be true to some extent like materials used but this razor is everything</li>
            <li> but surprisingly it was the opposite.</li>
            <li> The smaller charger is also good.</li>
            <li> razor shaves well and is a good choice for anybody who doesn&#x27;t want a razor with a lot of extra features or accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;*A full charge takes 8 hours&lt;</li>
            <li> It is quiet, lightweight, and does a good job.</li>
            <li> Perfect razor, if I had a complaint I suppose it would be that what you see is what you get, razor and a cord,</li>
            <li> Love this shaver, works as its supposed to and very reliable.</li>
            <li> Also bought battery operated - 2 AAs - that runs much faster and is OK.  </li>
            <li> It is quiet and will not wake my roommates up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;The price is fair,</li>
            <li> I have to go over my face several times to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> Does a good job, especially when I haven&#x27;t shaved or a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I do not speak English, but this good.</li>
            <li> A nice step up from my old 7310 which I like a lot.  </li>
            <li> Even though I have fairly full hair growth</li>
            <li> No memory effect and a full charge lasts for about 45minutes of shaving time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for many years and they have also been very reliable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily, everyone knows ball cooties die at midnight, so if you do your face and then your balls, you&#x27;ll be good to go the next morning.</li>
            <li> It takes 12 hours to do a full recharge which is good for only 40 minutes.</li>
            <li> is super easy to clean and maintain, I like this razor very much and wholeheartedly recommend it.umps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> is super easy to clean and maintain, I like this razor very much and wholeheartedly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, easy to use and clean, and gets hair on my neck that my old Braun foil did not get easily.  </li>
            <li> and we&#x27;re concerned that the hinge could break off pretty easily, and</li>
            <li> Worth a few more bucks to get a more effective shaver.</li>
            <li> Sharp with a great design.</li>
            <li> Great battery life I charge once every other week or so.  </li>
            <li> On the first full charge i received 7 full shaves before the time to charge light came on.</li>
            <li> great price/ every thing as expected!</li>
            <li> i will be happy and just buy a new one --- cheap enough.</li>
            <li> more can I say, it gives a great shave and it does not break the bank like some other high end models.</li>
            <li> Though I don&#x27;t always do this, if you want to continue with any electric and get a close shave quickly, this should be done.</li>
            <li> Every charge gives it 40 minutes of use, which is a lot considering how quick you&#x27;ll finish shaving with this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To conclude, while I love Norelco shavers, the PT724 requires replacement heads to do a great job, so I recommend upgrading to at least the PT730.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and arrived as described.</li>
            <li> This razor is adequate.</li>
            <li> What you&#x27;re going to get is a device that will do an *adequate* job - you&#x27;ll feel and look as if you&#x27;ve shaved, but you&#x27;re not going to be complimented on how closely you&#x27;ve shaved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better shavers in this category, but they can only marginally mitigate the fundamental flaw that all of these devices share.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and on time.</li>
            <li> This does an adequate (nothing to complain about) job of cleaning up around the lips, soul patch, and adam&#x27;s apple after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have done better to replace the blades in the older model as this does not shave well at all.  </li>
            <li> Gave me mild irritation, shave is as close as when i shave with a razor.</li>
            <li> Fastest way to shave when you gotta go somewhere quick.</li>
            <li> ...recharges quickly and stays charged up to three weeks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok shaver but the shaver heads are of the older variety.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an electric razor irritate my face the way this one does; stay away and actually spend the money to get something that will give you a nice, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This item really gives a close shave and is easy to use and clean, I recommend everyone purchase this item.</li>
            <li> It provides a comfortable and pretty close shave.</li>
            <li> Overall:  Very pleased with the razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Been using for awhile, holds charge well, shaves well, overall very pleased.</li>
            <li> This one is easy to use, somewhat lighter than the old one, and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> In every other way it does a good job unless you want to spend many times as much and get a \\&quot;little\\&quot; closer shave.</li>
            <li> this new one is so much better.</li>
            <li> I had a norelco previously and it too was a great razor.</li>
            <li> Great shave, improvement over my previous Norelco Rotary shaver.</li>
            <li> As long as it does a reasonable job I am happy.  </li>
            <li> Works very well and easy to use.</li>
            <li> but not necessarily thorough - this is a good first electric razor for someone frightened of skinning themselves in the process.  </li>
            <li> To clean the unit, you flip open the top and the top remains attached - we don&#x27;t like that so much, because it is just plastic</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an excellent value shaver especially for one who is value minded or as a first shaver as a gift for that youngster just starting out in his shaving life.</li>
            <li> The light weight of this new model at first felt flimsy compared to the older one, but, after using it, the lighter weight IS nice.  </li>
            <li> I bought this new shaver to replace my old Philips Norelco that I had for many years, it finally gave up working, The new shaver works great, I love it.</li>
            <li> Then you just run hot water in and around the chambers and through the razor head to clean it all out.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and liking it more and more!</li>
            <li> Norelco has a great reputation and this little gem has a two year warranty.</li>
            <li> This rechargeable Norelco electric shaver gives a fast, smooth and close shave (by electric shaver standards) with no pulling or irritation of my skin.  </li>
            <li> It feels so smooth on my face, yet it really shaves.</li>
            <li> If you need a close shave without the pain, this shaver is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Works well but does not seem that much better than my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> Much better than my old shaver.</li>
            <li> Nice flip-out blade on back for trimming!</li>
            <li> Frankly, I was surprised that this one seems to shave better, and faster than my SpeedXL 8140.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice not to have an extra item around).</li>
            <li> Could be useful for travel</li>
            <li> The pop up trimmer seemed like a nice extra when I bought it</li>
            <li> I would give it only ONE star, but the Norelco customer service agent was SO kind and helpful when I called to return it.  </li>
            <li> OK as far as Electric Shavers go, not the Closest shave out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as easy as older models</li>
            <li> Certainly worth the $40 price.</li>
            <li> one is by FAR the most efficient shaver for me.</li>
            <li> THE RAZOR IS WELL WORTH $34.95</li>
            <li> I own a different model of Philips Norelco that shave well</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of rechargeables but is nice not fighting plug-in wire.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this kind of razor before but tried a foil razor last time.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts for 15-20 shaves, so it&#x27;s a nice upgrade from my last one.</li>
            <li> Worked well and much better than my old worn out Norelco.</li>
            <li> somewhat effective, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver so far.</li>
            <li> It does cut pretty good, but not completely.</li>
            <li> So far I love this.  </li>
            <li> It works so much better than his old model.</li>
            <li> So far, really is a good shaver and better than expected.  </li>
            <li> My last shaver before this one was an 8138XL which was pricier and had some better features such as: greater surface area, and most important to me, a longer battery charge (50 minutes) with (and this is the most important feature) a lot less time for charging (1 hour versus 8 hours on this model).</li>
            <li> It works great, is hard to clean, because you have to disassemble the blade system.  </li>
            <li> Good for a quick clean up shave, but doesn&#x27;t go as far down as a razor would to make it completely smooth.</li>
            <li> Very much, easy to use, frequency of use after charging too much, do not waste electricity, I feel very comfortable, reasonably priced</li>
            <li> long battery life, clean shaves, so easy to clean quickly.  </li>
            <li> But all in all you will have a clean appearance that will last through most of the day.  </li>
            <li> Good basic electric razor, no frills, but decent.  </li>
            <li> It seems to make even old blades cut like razors doing a very clean job.</li>
            <li> As good as my other Philip shaver.</li>
            <li> It may not have the heft and solid sound of the Norelco products he has owned in the past, but as always it does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> The 5 minute quick charge (for a single shave) is nice also.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed at the right price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the position of the power-on button, which is right where my thumb goes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the position of the power-on button, which is right where my thumb goes</li>
            <li> The price was right and amazon sent the shaver in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> This shaver does not seem to be working right.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is not charging right or what.</li>
            <li> But I throw package away right after I receive it</li>
            <li> I was right.  </li>
            <li> takes a while to cleanly shave your whole face</li>
            <li> These cut fast and clean from day one, even before the heads had time to \\&quot;break</li>
            <li> Smooth, fast, quiet, and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The battery generally lasts me more than a week of shaving.</li>
            <li> Was afraid we needed to spend more, but this lower priced shaver is comfortable and does a great job.</li>
            <li> But that is a small inconvenience for an otherwise great rotary shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 4 Norelco triple headers over the past 30 years and they are just great to shave with.</li>
            <li> Have bought Phillips or Norelco products over the past 40 years - have always been happy with them.</li>
            <li> It is,  by far, the best one I have used yet - such a close shave, it is quiet and runs on battery or power.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not going to get an exceptional shave from this electric razor or any other.</li>
            <li> If I had it to do over I would spend a little more to get the better model</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new razor - He has had electric shavers before that were not as comfortable and efficient as this Philips Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I CAN NOT STAND VERY LONG, AND THIS RAZOR ALLOWS ME TO SIT AND STILL GET A NICE CLOSE SHAVE.</li>
            <li> Purchased this electric razor primarily to shave my head, it works fantastic and equally as well on my face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Razors like this seem to do a better job of catching my thick curly hairs.</li>
            <li> triangular razor head isn&#x27;t as precise as a straight edged head and the pop-up trimmer doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a pretty cheap (~$30) electric razor package I got at Walgreens, so this is my first experience with a decent electric razor ...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend using water to clean.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast and arrived sooner than promised.</li>
            <li> The unit cuts smoothly and uniformly despite other reviews that claim the two stage screens cut even better.</li>
            <li> This would have been a useful feature, since the shaver lays flat on the counter when not in use, taking up more space than the 8260XL, which came with a charging stand.  </li>
            <li> A pretty good little electric razor does the job</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this for about 3 weeks and think it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to make several passes over each part of your face.  </li>
            <li> That said, I have owned many different Norelco&#x27;s over the years.  </li>
            <li> When I was young and primarily shaved with a safety razor, I got the smoothest shaves in my life.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for a first time user.</li>
            <li> The instructions for both the 7310XL and the Shaver 3100 said they can be cleaned by flushing under running hot water.</li>
            <li> When the first Shaver 3100 died I opened it up the 7310XL and found that the motor was covered in rust and locked up.</li>
            <li> Makes me wonder if water leaking into the first 3100 caused its demise.</li>
            <li> sure enough, that was the difference.</li>
            <li> While Norelco says the battery can&#x27;t be replaced, on many Norleco models you can find third party replacement batteries online and solder them in.</li>
            <li> PT734/41]] is the PT730 with a stand but currently costs much more.  </li>
            <li> While Norelco says the battery can&#x27;t be replaced, on many Norleco models you can find third party replacement batteries online and solder them in.</li>
            <li> PT734/41]] is the PT730 with a stand but currently costs much more.  </li>
            <li> It offers a smooth shave in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> The earlier cheaper model i had was better.</li>
            <li> This one has the ability to pop open the top and rinse the clippings out with water under the faucet.  </li>
            <li> I assume these ones shave better because of a more open design, or sharper blades or some such since they dont have to be waterproofed.</li>
            <li> So in that sense for me, these cheaper Norelcos actually do work better.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor!</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;I have been using a Phillips Norelco 8240XL for several years, which costs more than this model.  </li>
            <li> The PT724 has a lithium battery, a low battery indicator, charging and full charge indicator light.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a damn shame they don&#x27;t come with the razor in the first place.</li>
            <li> and I am satisfied with the same.</li>
            <li> I have tried to use it while shaving my dad and it seems to miss entire sections no matter how many times I go over the area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the first charge</li>
            <li> Ran heads under hot water with top open, added couple of drops of hand soap, used brush to help remove clog and to dissolve body oils and to remove any remaining hair.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li> So, i am pretty picky about electric shavers.</li>
            <li> and I love how quiet it is.</li>
            <li> I have shaved four times and still on first charge.</li>
            <li> I was an avid Norelco customer.</li>
            <li> I even could not finish shaving for the first time.</li>
            <li> I will upgrade to a better product next time.</li>
            <li> This is my second electric, this one much better than the first.</li>
            <li> My first shaver was a Philips Norelco and I&#x27;ve had it for maybe 8 years now, still works but doesn&#x27;t hold a charge</li>
            <li> I had used a different leading brand for many years.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, with the added bonus of a liithium battery which hoipefully will last a long time.</li>
            <li> By the time the water is hot (a minute or 2)</li>
            <li> Turn the hot water on and rinse out the razor.</li>
            <li> His stubble is getting thick now and this works great.</li>
            <li> Phillips can make it even better if they can design it to use standard charger, like USB or micro USB.</li>
            <li> It works very well; &amp;#34;Like socks on a rooster&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make a loud buzzing sound when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> Being able to rinse it under hot water is a BIG plus.</li>
            <li> However, I bought the razor for my son and he absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> I have a  set from my old unit and the new set cuts better than the fancier screens.</li>
            <li> All the new Norelco models look super efficient and I am sure the review will be the same no matter which model you select.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;there aren&#x27;t many downsides other than initial cost, which is easily offset even by the relatively cheap blade packs for the quattro and shaving</li>
            <li> The best part is that the lithium ion batteries are lasting longer per charge than the older batteries, and shouldn&#x27;t suffer from the charge memory that killed the batteries after a year or so use.</li>
            <li> It lasts me a week on one charge for the most part, on par with the other but this one seems to take longer to charge, overnight for full.</li>
            <li> I realize this is far from their top model, but even when fully charged and/or plugged in it is very sluggish, and takes twice the time to shave as most other shavers do.</li>
            <li> I had am older shaver with upgraded heads and replaced the new ones with the better quality using the new cutters and that did the trick</li>
            <li> My older Philips shaver needed new cutters, however this was on sale and cost me $10 more than a new set of cutters.  </li>
            <li> The overall feel is that is is made of lightweight plastic materials, but then it is a great value for money, so that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to clean it with water (just old fashion I guess)</li>
            <li> The brush also doesn&#x27;t seem to clean it out completely.</li>
            <li> (I am not sure how true that is), but he ended up loving it.</li>
            <li> The Phillips multigroom actually works better at this point (I have had the multigroom for 2 years without changing the blade, so that is saying something) and it&#x27;s much cheaper and comes with additional attachments.</li>
            <li> but it is good for daily use (especially at this price).</li>
            <li> The older model only has a charging and full charge light, no lithium battery and no way to tell if a charge is needed except by performance.  </li>
            <li> The razor generally works well, and I appreciate the thoughtful charging lights.</li>
            <li> PT724 does not come with a charging stand and apparently none is available.  </li>
            <li> As long as there is a screen between the blade and your face, it will never, ever be able to get as close as a blade.</li>
            <li> it worked really well for the first two shaves</li>
            <li> Obviously since this is not what it was designed for I don&#x27;t get the same silky smooth feeling like a razor , it&#x27;s more like the feel</li>
            <li> Good for its pricing but not a top notch shaver.</li>
            <li> Replacing a Norelco that is probably 10+ years old because the batteries will not longer hold a full charge / carry the charge as well.  </li>
            <li> Does not pull the skin, and gives a smooth shave nearly as close as a classic hand razor.  </li>
            <li> The heads and blades seem to me a bit slower and effective compared to the previous Norelco tgat I owned.</li>
            <li> A good clean shave in a short period of time, and recharges fully in a few hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably good when it comes to electric razors, and the battery does last a long time.</li>
            <li> Well, as for myself, I value this purely for convenience.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad i finally bought this new electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to report that this is it and the price was half the price of the 8240XL and less than the original one.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have never been able to shave so close and not irritate my skin around the corners of my mouth and upper chin area.</li>
            <li> But for occasional use it I&#x27;d fine</li>
            <li> this particular razor is that he uses it all of the time now!  </li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t have a little travel case, which I would have liked</li>
            <li> Meh... I had pretty high expectations when I bought this shaver</li>
            <li> If you, like me, have been a razor traditionalist (I even tried a straight razor for a brief period) considering a switch to electric, my take away from using this one is: don&#x27;t be cheap.</li>
            <li> Smooth,  fast, and quiet.</li>
            <li> not cut as close or as fast as SensoTouch models (albeit 3x the cost).</li>
            <li> I like the PT724/41 because it can be cleaned by running it underwater, which works very well.</li>
            <li> Does so in about 1/3 the time, which makes irritation SO much less.&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my boyfriend as a gift because he really wanted one.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to men and it does get a close shave!</li>
            <li> Husband is very safisfied with shaver.</li>
            <li> very close cut.</li>
            <li> Lather up your skin with some water and this just glides over your skin, giving you a very close shave without hurting.</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very practical product</li>
            <li> What I really do is shave in the shower every morning.</li>
            <li> So I recommend it.any times as much and get a \\&quot;little\\&quot; closer shave.</li>
            <li> As much as I like Norelco razors, I don&#x27;t recommend this model.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To conclude, while I love Norelco shavers, the PT724 requires replacement heads to do a great job, so I recommend upgrading to at least the PT730.l shave, but if they can go 10 years with almost daily use, the HQ8 (which appear very similar in design and quality) might do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It provides a very close shave and the razor</li>
            <li> I know that my husband really likes</li>
            <li> The pop out razer part doesn&#x27;t really cut.</li>
            <li> This is worth the price so far.</li>
            <li> Works great on my son&#x27;s thin beard</li>
            <li> The motor seems anemic, but I can&#x27;t complain too much given what I paid.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, it works very well.</li>
            <li> but it is more convenient than a wet shave</li>
            <li> Quiet and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Very close shave without irritation.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know much about it myself...</li>
            <li> A real 1st class dud.  </li>
            <li> I wrote Norelco regarding this experience and like all modern day companies, they chose to ignore me.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son and he really likes it.  </li>
            <li> I bought a Braun for my son that costs twice as much as this</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut that fast</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need the cordless ability that much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s MUCH easier than cleanup with my razor</li>
            <li> Very good!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It provides a smooth close shave, is very quiet and stays charged for about a week.</li>
            <li> From packaging to operation to cleanup, it&#x27;s very intuitive.</li>
            <li> Much quieter, too.</li>
            <li> very close shave</li>
            <li> but he&#x27;s been using a straight razor for years</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> so it must be modern materials like space craft.</li>
            <li> Does not cut very close and therefore the shaver has to be used almost twice a day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift for my father, have not used, it is packed very well.&lt;br /&gt;Strongly</li>
            <li> fast shipping /</li>
            <li> Feels very underpowered.</li>
            <li> , the shaver does not make noise, is fast, I recommend it hundred percent.</li>
            <li> I have had a Philips shaver before and it worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> performed better than expected ...</li>
            <li> The shave is close, confortable, and fast.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had and used this razor about 2-3 weeks now, and I really like it.</li>
            <li> He really likes it</li>
            <li> Cutting is excellent as always, Battery seems to hold charge longer than&lt;br /&gt;previous models.  </li>
            <li> I took a chance because I didn&#x27;t really know if he would like it or not.</li>
            <li> He said he really likes it because it shaves him without breaking his face out.</li>
            <li> and he uses it on his whole head and face.</li>
            <li> Very good.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a real winner.  </li>
            <li> * Cleaning is an absolute cinch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;All said and done, for the price and getting something that works very well and</li>
            <li> /&gt;All said and done, for the price and getting something that works very well and</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot of money.</li>
            <li> Much closer shave than what i was used to...</li>
            <li> got more than we expected for an inexpensive price..</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> We tried foil shavers and they did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair on my face and it grows fast</li>
            <li> Cleaning is the easiest ever and the shave head really removes the whiskers.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> does not shave very closely.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Which probably made a lot of sense, back when everything was so cheap.</li>
            <li> High five!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve straight razor shaved all my life and thought I&#x27;d try this to speed things up and skip the step of lathering.  </li>
            <li> THIS is much safer for him now.</li>
            <li> If there is any kind of distinction between where your chin ends and your neck begins, you&#x27;ll have to put a lot of effort into avoiding having a narrow line of stubble hang on there</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an everyday use washable shaver with a not so effective trimmer.</li>
            <li> Gives me a nice shave, but some times i have to use the traditional shave because it can&#x27;t cut the smaller hairs</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Norelco which, after many years of usage, finally &amp;#34;died.&amp;#34;  The cost of replacing the battery was so high that it felt right to buy a new razor.  </li>
            <li> For example, the part which holds the rotating blades is fastened by plastic &#x27;dog and house&#x27; rather than the positive metal of the older model.</li>
            <li> But on the other hand, by the time I get done the razor is getting pretty warm, and seems to be irritating my face a lil more, and I dont have the option to cool it off or to apply a cream to my face ahead of time.</li>
            <li> Express is very powerful, DHL need only three days arrived in China.  </li>
            <li> This razor cuts quickly and no drag.  </li>
            <li> back to this model,  I like the way this one works - it is indeed a clean shave.</li>
            <li> but it definitely takes the pokey feeling away and leaves a clean shaven look.</li>
            <li> Can not get a clean shave on chin or upper</li>
            <li> Has decent battery power; I get almost 2 weeks out of each charge and teh shave has remained reasonable.</li>
            <li> This razor is virtually identical to my previous model, Philips Norelco PT730, with the exception that the PT724 does not come with a travel bag, and has a blue panel instead of black.&lt;br /&gt;The razor is capable of shaving fairly closely without irritation to the skin of the neck.</li>
            <li> I shave with a special shaving cream and it gets as close as a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor to anyone wanting a clean shave at a low price.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s actually quite a bit more useful than I expected as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, an uncharged battery in the PT724 takes a full 8 hours of charging to bring it up to a full charge, while the time required to accomplish the same result in the 8260XL is only 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li> May try that when I get time, but also read that some people are changing the batteries (requires some soldering) in the old units, which says the old units overall are better than the one&#x27;s being made today.</li>
            <li> The PT724 gave as good a shave as the more expensive shaver, although it is not as quiet as the 8240XL.  </li>
            <li> girlfriend is pretty sensitive to stubble though</li>
            <li> Amazon offers so thanks to the quality of goods we use, thank you!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my 20 year old son and his first electric shaver.</li>
            <li> but it really could use bit just a little more power</li>
            <li> Also repeat more often in the tough bearded areas to get the desired smooth results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> New in box.....works really well for my beard.....</li>
            <li> Not super energetic but it will do.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat it for the price and much better than the previous model from about 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> More hair falls out while I shave than on my previous electric razor, though.</li>
            <li> I have owned many Philips Norelco and Norelco shavers before, which have typically lasted anywhere from 7 - 10 years.</li>
            <li> Instead, I recommend the [[ASIN:B006GQYSGO Philips Norelco PT730 PowerTouch Rechargeable Cordless Razor]] which has better combs (what Norelco calls the screens that touch your face) which is currently about the same price.</li>
            <li> far it&#x27;s been much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: This razor gives a decent shave and none of the things I dislike about it</li>
            <li> Bought this for my elderly father to replace an older model.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps more expensive shavers provide a better experience.  </li>
            <li> It holds its charge for a decent time frame.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Going back to this now has been a tremendous surprise.  </li>
            <li> The razor replaces an older Norelco, so I already knew what to expect.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge a decent while as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I think this is common with electric shavers... and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have an older corded model.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> On the basis of satisfaction per dollar, this product scores high for me.</li>
            <li> Buy Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, let you know how it holds up longterm.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Philips Norelco shavers.     </li>
            <li> Sure enough, 10 years later they still cut as well as my new HQ8 heads.</li>
            <li> Looking for a clean shave that lasts long?</li>
            <li> The rotary action works much better than other vibratory razors I have used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little better and can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> You have to have a completely dry and clean face for optimal operation.  </li>
            <li> It is much easier to grip as well than his old one, he says.</li>
            <li> An old but very practical shaver.</li>
            <li> Works best on thin hair, such as facial hair.</li>
            <li> That is to say, when I&#x27;m done shaving, I look the way I would normally look early in the afternoon after having shaved with a real razor at 6AM.</li>
            <li> Close shave on normal growth</li>
            <li> Since thats pretty much the same you&#x27;d get from a women&#x27;s elec razor</li>
            <li> And this is pretty much the same razor I used when I was in the hospital having my spine rebuilt in 1968.</li>
            <li> more lets see how long they last.</li>
            <li> I tried, following the instructions for adapting from a blade to electric, but after I got razor burn 3 times, I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Because my husband normally like to use a disposable razor, I didn&#x27;t feel the need to pay a hundred plus dollars for one.</li>
            <li> Met all of his expectations and has no negative remarks regarding razor.</li>
            <li> I still prefer razors, as this tends to leave my face dryer than normal even with applying lotion or after shave.  </li>
            <li> this is a good, but not great razor.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> New is always nicer, and is worth the extra cost.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is my favorite part of this razor, I only charge mine every 2 or 3 weeks, it lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> So we went right back to this.</li>
            <li> However, the heads on my old razor were only a couple months old, and I keep them clean.</li>
            <li> had to buy an adapter because I live in Portugal.</li>
            <li> it was time for a new one.</li>
            <li> hope the company provide the new products (the produced date) for us.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> I ordered the new razor for backup and to see how technology had come around in over 10 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works like brand new.</li>
            <li> I figured that if, from now on, I am going to need to buy a new shaver</li>
            <li> Got this because I needed a new razor and it was on sale with a coupon.  </li>
            <li> Of course it&#x27;s still new, but that&#x27;s it for now.  </li>
            <li> I buy a new razor rather than buy replacement blades -</li>
            <li> So I was contemplating buying a new head</li>
            <li> I thought I could live without that, but I like the visible notification.  </li>
            <li> here&#x27;s what it looks like with this new</li>
            <li> For someone new to electric shaving, it can take up to 3 weeks for your skin to adjust to it.</li>
            <li> Was time for a new one.  </li>
            <li> I apply the head savings toward the cost of a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> my husband loves his new razer</li>
            <li> The charge seems to last and last and while the results are not as smooth and close as he had hoped for, it works, travels well and the ability to rinse the heads is a plus.</li>
            <li> It was smooth and effective cutting hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 2 months and it gives me a close shave, maybe not razor close, but smooth enough for me without the hassle of shaving daily.</li>
            <li> one complaint is that if you&#x27;re stubble is turning into a beard (say more than a cm in length) then this doesn&#x27;t really work for shaving it - you&#x27;ll need a separate beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> But once I started buying replacement heads more recently, I found that they are no good, nowhere close to the quality of the original heads.  </li>
            <li> Charges quickly and runs all week on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> Very surprised by how close a shave he can get.  </li>
            <li> my old norelco 10 yrs old shaved a little better</li>
            <li> The only problem is that the heads were not giving me the same close shave I was used to from the 9160, but it turned out that the HQ9 heads I&#x27;d bought for the old model fit the new one.  </li>
            <li> Good at home and good for trips away from home where 110 v outlets are sometimes hard to find or in an inconvenient location.  </li>
            <li> The shave is comparable to that provided by my much more expensive Norelco 8260XL shaver which I have regularly used for more than four years.  </li>
            <li> In general, I do not care that much about the replacement heads&#x27; surface area.</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s found they are much stiffer and harder to shave, but this item left him feeling as smooth as the proverbial &#x27;baby&#x27;s bottom.&amp;#34; Norelco will continue to be his electric shaver of choice.</li>
            <li> razor has a quieter hum similar to higher end models.</li>
            <li> razor has a quieter hum similar to higher end models.</li>
            <li> then my old one!</li>
            <li> Left the first one on a cruise ship.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 14 year old son and he loves it!</li>
            <li> Pull the lever on the back of the faucet to close the stopper and let the hot water collect in the basin.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 17 year old son who&#x27;s not too hairy and he loves it!</li>
            <li> Norelco has always been easy on my sensitive skin, way less irritated</li>
            <li> It leaves my face smooth with less pressure, compared to brand B.</li>
            <li> This thing is much quieter than any past shavers I have owned, it is curved and glides smoothly over my skin.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using it every few days for the past year and it still runs great.  </li>
            <li> Package arrived quickly and everything was as expected.</li>
            <li> After a few passes of rinsing the razor in the water, it gets gunked up so drain that out and fill-up again with fresh hot water.</li>
            <li> full charge last only 1-2 dayes!</li>
            <li> well, that is what I first thought, but after using this shaver a couple of times I realized that I got a really close shave in one quarter of the time of my older heavy, high speed shaver.</li>
            <li> I may have only needed new blades in my old razor, but this new one shaves much closer.</li>
            <li> If I have a 5-6 day mess I use it as a prep for the razor, and it makes it very easy to shave the long growth.</li>
            <li> Norelco essentially forced me to give up on my favorite model (9195XL) and buy a new unit.  </li>
            <li> Wet shave is better than dry.</li>
            <li> The blades cartridges are reasonable and even though single blade disposable razors tend to leave nicks, the I never had much problem with irritation with the Quattro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco PT724/41 Powertouch Electric Razor provides a comfortable, close shave with little to no irritation.  </li>
            <li> It does not trim as deeply as the ~$200 model of Norelco shaver that I have, but it also doesn&#x27;t miss large patches like some of the cheap models I have used in the past (Remington, in particular).</li>
            <li> , I hardly noticed the difference with the old but better razor.</li>
            <li> The shaver was quiet and smooth but was not as close of shave as expected.  </li>
            <li> This is the replacement for  the old 7301 model.  </li>
            <li> As somebody that has tried countless electric razors (Philips Norelco, Braun, Wahl, Remington, and others), I often don&#x27;t have much faith in what the manufacturer often advertises.  </li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 6940 Reflex Action Men&#x27;s Shaving System[[ASIN:B00AEINQ9</li>
            <li> His old one died and he had been on the look out for another for some time.  </li>
            <li> The recharge times are pretty long.</li>
            <li> Now it shaves just as close as my old 6885XL.</li>
            <li> About 2-3 years after I got my old</li>
            <li> Keep it lubricated if it gets loud - use a shaver spray lube periodically.</li>
            <li> Keep it lubricated if it gets loud - use a shaver spray lube periodically.</li>
            <li> It has a sturdy feel that is not too heavy, but not too light either.</li>
            <li> my old Norelco razor.</li>
            <li> Unlike my old norelco the blades need some improvement....</li>
            <li> I had an old norelco which was geat and lasted me 6-7 Years</li>
            <li> That means that when the early afternoon hours do arrive I look as if I have 5 o&#x27;clock</li>
            <li> silent and very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my 10+ year old one was.</li>
            <li> also like the fact that the charger plugs into it instead of having a stand (I could plug in my old one and not use the stand as well,</li>
            <li> You actually can get a reasonably close shave with these blades.</li>
            <li> I chose this brand because I had an old shaver from Philips and the experience was good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I do like it quite a bit so far .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Been using this for several months and it seems to do the job reasonably well.</li>
            <li> Early days, though: how well will the battery be doing six months from now?</li>
            <li> It has a rubbery surface causing friction compared to the all metal one on my old razor.</li>
            <li> This shaver exceeded my expectations, It quiet and gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> So, when my old one died about 2 years ago, I just became patient and waited until I could afford to get another one.</li>
            <li> At least a week or more in my case.</li>
            <li> and it is directly in touch with the skin.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver for my 82 year old father who was determined he would not like it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son (15 years old) for Christmas.</li>
            <li> He does have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The Norelco handles the extra days of stubble much</li>
            <li> So far this is the item I was looking for-</li>
            <li> I really like the quiet of the rotary motor compared to reed motors.</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco user all of my adult life and when the battery would not charge anymore, I had to look for another one and got the Philips Norelco PT724/41 Powertouch Electric Razor.  </li>
            <li> It is quiet, and gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor to replace my old Norelco which I thought was on</li>
            <li> How ever now I &#x27;am shaving with both razors ,the old one just won&#x27;t die.</li>
            <li> I was surprised for the money.</li>
            <li> If you have anything like sensitive skin, forget this shaver.</li>
            <li> This razor isn&#x27;t for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old one, which needed replacing, after I dropped it on a tile floor.  </li>
            <li> I have used Norelcos for 50 years and I still look as young as I did when I was shaving peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and really like it.  </li>
            <li> Much smoother cut than my last model.</li>
            <li> It really depends on your personal preference.</li>
            <li> , I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> However, this is clearly a shaver built for the value sensitive customer.</li>
            <li> As for me, after using this for a bit, I returned to Amazon and ordered another set of batteries for my old Quadra.</li>
            <li> only costs a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> but I also like the ability to use it in the shower (to cool it down) or with cream or some sort of lubricant.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a place that simply doesn&#x27;t exist and never will until Gillette comes out with their nifty digital, pinpoint laser hair zapper, right around the year 2150.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;You wouldn&#x27;t want to use this before you head to the church to get hitched, nor would you use it before heading out on a date or any other important occasion where appearances are of the utmost importance - especially if photos will be taken.</li>
            <li> Just back off the pressure a bit and go back over the same areas for a clean shave.</li>
            <li> You have to consider that shaving is usually only a minute or two job so a single charge will last you for a week quite easily.</li>
            <li> Does exactly was is expected and good value for the money... really like the indicator that the cutting heads need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> Ok seriously my electric shaver of choice is a Braun that I used for a lot of years.</li>
            <li> it is not giving me a clean shave i dont want to go through the trouble to re furn it</li>
            <li> I guess it is OK but not real impressed.  </li>
            <li> As he has gotten older, and his whiskers turned from brown to white</li>
            <li> The big one may be - this particular one has some defect ?  </li>
            <li> Get a couple of hands full of water and splash my face to get it wet for the foam and to open the pores for closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Actually it looks almost exactly like his last one.</li>
            <li> Does exactly everything more expensive shaver do.</li>
            <li> My older razor, you just have to open it and brush it</li>
            <li> works fine on medium to heavy beard so far, but I don&#x27;t use it daily.  </li>
            <li> will think I&#x27;m comparing new to old, and obviously that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s a difference.</li>
            <li> but, in light of the price I paid (less than $40), it&#x27;s terrific.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts quite long and holds charge really wells.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I may have lighter facial hair than others, and spend only 90 seconds or so per full shave, but if they can go 10 years with almost daily use, the HQ8 (which appear very similar in design and quality) might do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> any case, I&#x27;d thought I was picking up this PT724/41 razor to be a travel/back-up for my 1150X, but it has quickly taken the other&#x27;s place, and I now use it as my regular razor, with my 1150X serving as my backup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Almost as inexpensive as purchasing the replacement heads, but decided to get the new one because will/should last longer!  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the design of the rotary blades is slightly different than my previous Norelco, and you can&#x27;t see the sides as well when you&#x27;re shaving, so it&#x27;s not quite as easy to shave around the edges of my beard.</li>
            <li> Purchased one in early December 2014 and it completely died about 4 weeks later.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fairly simple razor, but much nicer than an basic model.&lt;br /&gt;One reason</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have a lot of growth and only see a few light hairs coming in after 3 days, then this shaver might work for you.  </li>
            <li> Shaves my face So fast (takes me half the time as my older one)</li>
            <li> I got this in hopes that it&#x27;d be a good replacement because sooner or later, the motor in mine will fail which is a part I cannot replace.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Such an improvement over my old Norelco!</li>
            <li> Maybe because of my curly hair and sensitive face, I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding just the right razor.</li>
            <li> If cost isn&#x27;t a factor by all means, but if you want to pay less and not sure which one to get, then this one will do nicely.  </li>
            <li> The razor has a charging status light that conveniently lets you know when it is about time to recharge, but typically still retains enough power to finish the current shave.</li>
            <li> I dont have super thick or fast facial growth</li>
            <li> I decided to give this electric shaver a try and see if I couldn&#x27;t reduce some of the time and mess the whole process takes, especially since i&#x27;m prone to get zits if I don&#x27;t wash my face really thoroughly after using shaving</li>
            <li> The three blade setup is nicer than the long blade kind that a few other electric razors use.</li>
            <li> there really isn&#x27;t much different from the older model (uses the same heads HQ8).</li>
            <li> Also, the PT724 has automatic worldwide voltage, something that is not on my older, more expensive model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is light and you hardly know its on.  </li>
            <li> I have had several Norelco shavers and this is of equal quality to those, which is quite high in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in my first use as the razor didn&#x27;t glide as smoothly on my skin compared to my old one, but the shave was really close compared to my old razor blades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, and smooth, but it doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as some I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving since I was old enough to shave...</li>
            <li> my old 6885XL charges in about 1 hour for a similar use time.</li>
            <li> my old 6885XL charges in about 1 hour for a similar use time.</li>
            <li> I understand that everyone is different and every skin type varies, but this review is directly from my experience.</li>
            <li> and I barely had to charge it today and this reminded me about writing my review today.</li>
            <li> not go back to old way</li>
            <li> but now it barely shaves my stubble at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much quieter than I expected too.</li>
            <li> Expect to go over same spot multiple times to cut hairs(possibly in different directions), mirror is an absolute necessity when using this.</li>
            <li> The shave was really close,better than expected.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say, there are so many different razor models out there, but this one is above average.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for an old one of the same that broke after 30 years.</li>
            <li> Never going back to old razors again</li>
            <li> Barely a three star item, but it does get the job done at a value.</li>
            <li> This is quite big compare to my old Panasonic brand, and I&#x27;m alright with it.</li>
            <li> Just upgraded from an 11 year old Norelco that finally broke.  </li>
            <li> In this case light weight and slow RPM is something I will probably appreciate over time.</li>
            <li> I have had a Norelco razor for 15 years and many of the models in the intervening years have been poor.  </li>
            <li> It was heavy and ran with a powerful motor.  </li>
            <li> New blades cost almost as much as an entire new shaver, so he not only has sharp blades, but also a new motor.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband for Fathers day and though he never really get&#x27;s excited about much he does use it every day and hasn&#x27;t complained.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not holding it&#x27;s charge as long as it did when it was new (over 7 years ago ).</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for many years and though I have in the past tried other brands, I always return to Norelco.</li>
            <li> Overall, the PT724/41 exceeds the shave provided by other razors in higher price ranges.  </li>
            <li> I tried other kinds and he said they don&#x27;t work like this, so next time, maybe in another 5 years, we will buy another exactly like this.</li>
            <li> The way this thing is design made it hard to clean because there are holes and parts that will trap your hair.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s much quieter than the other electrics I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> You can buy a new razor for less than the cost of new blades and a battery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Meanwhile my much more expensive fancy $200 Norelco has quit on me twice now and is just over a year old and therefore out of warranty.</li>
            <li> Gives a decent, close shave, but you have to be careful using it.</li>
            <li> The one caveat is that they are round and are hiding under the head area making them a little bit challenging when determining where the line of cut is on your face; something that is critical if you have a goatee or beard.</li>
            <li> I did this not long ago with my 6885XL</li>
            <li> I did this not long ago with my 6885XL</li>
            <li> When I went on Amazon to get replacement blades, I saw this model on sale for $30 which was the same price as replacement blades for my more expensive ($150) old razor.</li>
            <li> caau/sed me to wait too long and get the old model clogged up.</li>
            <li> entire affair is lighter and offers less a sense that you are holding a device machined out of a billet than the older models.</li>
            <li> I tried to use it on my sideburns the first few times but eventually stopped bothering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Put foam on my face and start shaving, rinsing the razor out in the hot water in the basin after every few swipes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but its blades has half life span as my old one, I need to decide whether to buy a new shaver or change its blades in one year.</li>
            <li> The narrowness of where you grab the unit makes it a bit harder to hold onto compared to the older model, which was larger all around.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, it feels like I haven&#x27;t shaved with it no matter how hard I press!</li>
            <li> blade rotation speed seems a little slower than it should be with a full charge, but as long a blades are sharp, it is not a problem (so far)</li>
            <li> And, I was surprised to find that even a dry shave gave me no razor burn.</li>
            <li> The no-prep and no-mess of Electric means any last minute social or business situation that comes up</li>
            <li> As an aside, the other shaver brand I like is Braun - I have an older battery-operated Braun travel shaver similar to the [[ASIN:B002PCPZQA BRAUN POCKET SHAVER M60B]]</li>
            <li> Blades dull quickly showing low quality.</li>
            <li> The initial charging of the PT724/41 took about 12 hours (I don&#x27;t yet know how long the charge will last), while recharging of the 1150X takes about 20 minutes and lasts nearly a month.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is slight pulling on whiskers when the razor is moved too fast, not allowing for the blades to fully cut.</li>
            <li> The hair that&#x27;s left behind won&#x27;t wash out easily.</li>
            <li> ....inexpensive, uncomplicated, and provides a very close, comfortable shave, without irritating my sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;Had a Remington shaver before this, and was not satisfied with the way it shaved.</li>
            <li> The battery life is decent and it slows down when</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean for this to be a comparison review, but it&#x27;s worth saying that my daily razor is a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t cut quite as close as I&#x27;d like, though it&#x27;s no slouch, and it&#x27;s far preferable to my 1150X in almost every other respect.  </li>
            <li> although he does change the blades on his other Norelco frequently, he seems to prefer this one!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I AM 80 YEARS OLD AND DUE TO HEALTH ISSUES</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve purchased some top of the line models (with a solution cleaning base and more bells and whistles) in the past.</li>
            <li> The price is a little high for the quality</li>
            <li> I only used the shaver on half my beard and went back to using my old wore out Remington.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer of a similar product offered a caution which bears repeating: leave the unit open (both the head and the sideburn trimmer) after washing to let it dry thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really mind though, because you can just plug it in and use it, and I usually charge it overnight anyway - it won&#x27;t overcharge.</li>

            <li> It actually left my skin feeling really smooth and even worked well on my more difficult neck areas that other electrics in the past had trouble with.</li>
            <li> battery last a long time</li>
            <li> Holds the charge long enough.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and keeps a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> The battery last a long time.</li>
            <li> Repeat this a couple of times depending on how long its&#x27; been since last shave</li>
            <li> only like this because it&#x27;s not loud.</li>
            <li> This shaver is very quiet and the charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My husband has wanted a new electric razor for a few years.  </li>
            <li> I have been using my new shaver for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> I replaced it because the battery just wouldn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate the ability to simply rinse the razor under the water tap, as it is a bit awkward to take apart the blade assembly for more thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a problem for me because it fits in the case that came with my previous 8240XL, but it&#x27;s something you might want to consider if you travel frequently.  </li>
            <li> I tried several Norelco shavers in the past, including the old 8000 and 9000 series and the subsequent 3D-headed shavers (without the integrated trimmer).  </li>
            <li> heads are  roughly one half the cost of a new razor.  </li>
            <li> The 6885XL has Quadra Action heads with the little holes, so I got the replacement HQ8 heads and</li>
            <li> I counterplayed getting the cheap norelco compare to one of the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beyond that I really don&#x27;t have anything negative to say.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is not really a complaint but an observation you might want to keep in mind:  </li>
            <li> I am not sure, but when the Quadra Action shavers came out, I read that since the holes are smaller, the comb can be thinner in that area.</li>
            <li> Close shave, battery lasts a long time between charges.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the life-span of the battery is, but hopefully it is a long time since that is also the life span of the razor.</li>
            <li> Like the long battery life after charging.</li>
            <li> I did that a few times, but prefer to just shake it out like my old razor.  </li>
            <li> and  has a long charge life .Great</li>
            <li> , I wish I&#x27;d switched a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I like the long interval between battery charges.</li>
            <li> This razor gives me the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
            <li> And the battery life is quite long, too.</li>
            <li> long battery duration.</li>
            <li> Close shave, long charge.  </li>
            <li> I have had a Norelco 7 series for a long time.</li>
            <li> He has a heavy beard and sensitive skin and has no problem with getting a close shave without irritation.</li>
            <li> Battery holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s a long time.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t owned this long</li>
            <li> but I doubt it would be powerful enough for a real thick course beard.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement unit for by old Philips shaver that was broken and needed new heads.</li>
            <li> I know with cordless drills for example my Bosch it charges in only a half an hour, and you can use it occasionally for months without it needing a recharge.</li>
            <li> Switched to safety razor with proper shaving soap and brush and it hurts much less afterwards, no red bumps, and closer shaves.</li>
            <li> Seriously, thirty years from now do you want to look in someone&#x27;s wedding album and realize that the reason you looked haggard on a certain day was because you couldn&#x27;t be bothered take the time to shave properly?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have used an expensive high speed shaver you will probably think this light weight, slow RPM shaver is a piece of junk.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually quite a close shave now that I&#x27;ve gotten the technique down, much closer in fact, than dull blades would give me</li>
            <li> The down side is that the replacement blades are almost half the cost of a new electric razor.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy this or any other electric shaver and expect that it&#x27;s going to be the only shaving implement</li>
            <li> We spoke for some time about the shaver she felt might work for me, based on her several conversations and feedback with other burly-bearded men.</li>
            <li> The shave sounds stronger and the charging cord isn&#x27;t coiled with a very long lead.</li>
            <li> It includes the important washable feature but is minus a couple degrees of freedom in the head mounting that I always thought were of questionable value and don&#x27;t miss at all.  </li>
            <li> Get a towel, pat dry and apply some aftershave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While the water is running, start dry shaving with the electric.&lt;br</li>
            <li> * Dry shaving with the electric means</li>
            <li> Then just set it aside to air dry and no worries about built up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a panasonic (dry shave) for years.</li>
            <li> Prevents skin irritation, even if you shave dry</li>
            <li> My last shaver lasted 5 years and the only reason I had to replace it was that my grandson had accidentally dropped it and a few plastic pieces broke off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few weeks and the blades are supposed to last a year...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty tough on razors though since I have a beard to trim around.</li>
            <li> Shaves a little closer than my old Braun (which I had to abandon after 12 years due to the unavailability of foil/cutter assemblies).</li>
            <li> Every single time I used the razor it cut up and irritated my face.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get every single hair.</li>
            <li> not nearly as powerful as the last one i got, even when plugged in.</li>
            <li> Finally the old heads on that old one failed, and we had to replace it, and we ordered this while on Vacation in Palm Springs.  </li>
            <li> It arrived LATE (was a gift for hubby; GUARANTEED AMAZON delivery has failed for my last three orders, so beware of this issue), but is a nice little razor.</li>
            <li> One thing I learned, with the help of my son, is that when these get dull I just throw it out and buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This shaver does work well, but when compared to my old classic Quadra, it fails aesthetically if not functionally.</li>
            <li> So between the two batteries you are never left with your pants down.</li>
            <li> I resolved this by pouring white vinegar down through it or maybe it was hydrogen peroxide.  </li>
            <li> It is also easy to determine where the line is that you are cutting on.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the blades is awkward and not done easily.</li>
            <li> I paid $49.99, however, I noticed after the fact that Target is selling the same electric razor for $39.99 or $10 less.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product, and exactly 2 years and 2 months later, the rechargeable batteries quit charging, rendering the shaver useless.  </li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it is the same quality as my previous Philips Electric Razor which lasted four years until the battery would no longer charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I typically shave with a regular razor and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m moderately satisfied with this product, and only slightly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my previous Norelco for over a year now and the head is starting to show its age.  </li>
            <li> Now I am not particular about how close a razor shaves.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise, they mention that it might take a few shaves to get your skin accustomed and if you&#x27;re not happy after 3 weeks, you can return the razor for full refund.</li>
            <li> He has a very heavy beard and shaves daily (except on an occasional Saturday).  </li>
            <li> whatever clothes you don&#x27;t want to mess up, without worrying about getting water or foam or blood on it from regular</li>
            <li> I had been nursing my old Norelco along for years and finally decided to get a new one when the barber began cutting whiskers off my cheekbone.  </li>
            <li> The run time is a little short.</li>
            <li> I have only little beard.</li>
            <li> The dirty little smear that&#x27;s on top of his lip.</li>
            <li> After two days of use everything appears to be as I have read and expected.  </li>
            <li> Everything was as expected.</li>
            <li> so you want to be careful not to drop it onto a tile floor.</li>
            <li> It was what I had expected .</li>
            <li> No real need to flush it with water.  </li>
            <li> it does take a few seconds longer than a regular shave</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco a few years back and switched to a blade razor.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t care about wet shaving, the PowerTouch should work for you.</li>
            <li> My last few cordless shavers have been Norelco brand</li>
            <li> I got this and expected to use it about 50% of the time because I thought it would be a convenient time saver.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really not much faster.</li>
            <li> Not a very close shave</li>
            <li> This item was everything I expected in a razor.  </li>
            <li> And this model gives you a visible warning when there are still a few charges left.  </li>
            <li> Even though the skin looks shaven, you can expect it to feel like rough goosebumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not a very close shave</li>
            <li> Not much profit</li>
            <li> He thinks it&#x27;s money well spent.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for shaving nirvana, the place where you can quickly shave sans creams, expensive disposable razors and all prep and hassle that comes with conventional shaving, this is not that.</li>
            <li> I noticed a moldy/mildew smell when I used water because it didn&#x27;t have a chance to really dry out inside as the water drains down through the body and out the bottom trapping water inside.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;*It is impossible to tell how much battery charge is left until recharging is necessary</li>
            <li> My suggestion is to recharge the battery every other day.  </li>
            <li> And for whatever reason all norelco&#x27;s fall one one side or the other of this divide for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I can use the one from my other one.</li>
            <li> And the trimmer....takes care of other things.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and sharp</li>
            <li> It is noticably quieter than other razors.  </li>
            <li> My third one over the past decade.</li>
            <li> Once the heads were swapped in, the usual closeness was back.  </li>
            <li> Lithium ion doesn&#x27;t have memory like the other battery and won&#x27;t lose it capacity if charged when not fully drained.</li>
            <li> other advantages with the Electric:&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Not something the other ever did.  </li>
            <li> and noe he can shave every other day instead of 2 days in between.</li>
            <li> I had higher expectation for this razor and it failed to measure up.</li>
            <li> When it cuts, it doesn&#x27;t cut your hair to dust like my other razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there is a picture of the face cream next to the razor because it did not come with it.  </li>
            <li> But shaving got to be such a chore, and not really very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I do think if you have a really heavy, heavy beard, you might want to consider a different unit.</li>
            <li> Flashes green when charging, solid green when done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several expensive shavers and I figure this inexpensive one will probably last as long as they did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with other razors only getting the thick</li>
            <li> Due to this, the shaver emits a slight rattle as you draw it over your face.</li>
            <li> Impossible to clean without having the heads fall out.</li>
            <li> Same lift and cut that I&#x27;ve used for at least 35 years...</li>
            <li> It does NOT cut as close or as fast as the expensive SensoTouch model that I have.  </li>
            <li> That would be my only complaint.</li>
            <li> It does not come with a case but has a plastic cover for the blade part and is of average size.</li>
            <li> While the quality of an electric shave is at least \\&quot;business-ready\\&quot;, it&#x27;s not as close as you&#x27;d get with a standard razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does have something similar built in, but its small and not really comfortable to use except in emergency/travel</li>
            <li> I am a female and got to to shave my legs as I thought it would work with my hair which is NOT so condense and thick.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical of the high ratings on this razor, but I&#x27;ve always preferred Norelcos over other brands</li>
            <li> Not a deal breaker but still brings this down a notch.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been somewhat let down...</li>
            <li> Feels like when a battery is running down and the device is running out of power.</li>
            <li> The blades on this shaver have gotten somewhat dull after only a few months.</li>
            <li> think that he likes the fact that the weight of this razor is slightly less the heavier version he owns.</li>
            <li> THE LITHIUM BATTERY HOLDS A CHARGE LONGER THAN PREVIOUS MODELS.</li>
            <li> So I get the job done with less passes and faster.</li>
            <li> Since the PT724 costs less than the 8240XL, and its replacement heads also cost less than those for the 8240XL,  </li>
            <li> Blade shaving was soooo much less work in less time.</li>
            <li> Typically a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by 4 pm.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback I have found is that the cutting heads are a bit far from the edge, so I have to smush my nose to cut close to it.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m less concerned with it dying prematurely.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what a typical shave looks like for me</li>
            <li> Less than 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the razor is dull does not shave close and does not hold charge as long as specified  in your add at time of purchase</li>
            <li> Noise is very minimal with almost no strong vibrations.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;ll have to take it slow, but as long as you do you won&#x27;t get cut.  </li>
            <li> Since I am tight on budget I decided to get the cheapest one.</li>
            <li> I shaved against the grain, pulled my face tight and used circular motions as the direction stated.</li>
            <li> He said the blades were very sharp and he has a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> After my old one took an unfortunate trip down the stairs</li>
            <li> I expect this one may last at least another 15 years!  </li>
            <li> The one downside though is that I didn&#x27;t check prices with other retailers, as I usually do.</li>
            <li> Even immediately after shaving, my face still feels just a little bit</li>
            <li> &quot; combs with little holes that allow for a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Seems a little slower on the RPM&#x27;s then</li>
            <li> My brother uses this everytime he feels a little stubble.</li>
            <li> recommend a little bit of Nivea Balm before cleaning up your shave with this.</li>
            <li> It takes a little longer to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> Motor sounds weak compared to the last one I had.</li>
            <li> &gt; The little green LED to signal Charging burned out on my razor after a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> In fact, I have to be careful not to push too hard or it cuts too close.</li>
            <li> If you are coming from manual razors, you should give an electric razor time (up to a few weeks) before making a judgment call on its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> but it came out again after few days</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the entire head assembly is poorly designed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d have trouble getting all of the stubble off.</li>
            <li> So if he&#x27;s in a hurry, a few passes with this</li>
            <li> Broke after few use.</li>
            <li> rechargeable, and it does seems to hold a charge for quite a few shaves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waste of your money.</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t read their manual, I would likely return it for poor performance.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the product.</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised that the speed for cutting was not more powerful and smoother cutting.</li>
            <li> A motor is really weak and it takes so long time to shave my beard.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this and he is not easy to please</li>
            <li> So this is no easy feat.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how long the originals will stay sharp or how  difficult replacing them</li>
            <li> However as the week goes on the motor will slow down and the shave quality will be hampered.  </li>
            <li> It will be hard to find a razor for less than this costs.  </li>
            <li> This usually means you are either a blade man because electrics don&#x27;t cut it,</li>
            <li> Also, the the price is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> but I usually like to charge it once a week overnight.</li>
            <li> This seems excessive to me because</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the PT730 has the button in the same place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This seems excessive to me because</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the PT730 has the button in the same place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it does to a small degree,</li>
            <li> I charge usually once a week.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s obviously the lass expensive of this line.  </li>
            <li> The razor head is on a spring-hinged pivot with a small button on the front.</li>
            <li> But, if you&#x27;re in a hurry or feeling lazy or there&#x27;s no water around, this thing works like a charm.</li>
            <li> The cord supplied with the charger is stiff and hard to manage.</li>
            <li> However, when you clean the head it is extremely difficult to reassemble as the heads fall out and are very difficult to align.</li>
            <li> Relatively noisy, pivots to contours of face nicely, no spots i was unable to get.</li>
            <li> I decided to stay away from the least expensive model and buy this, the next up in the line.</li>
            <li> Then you turn it on and hear a weak little motor purring inside.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to get the places like under nose and the neck...</li>
            <li> Buy the cheapest model and throw it away when the blades get dull.  </li>
            <li> Hard to use</li>
            <li> I was cutting my face with the regular razor.  </li>
            <li> I was cutting my face with the regular razor.  </li>
            <li> this was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> Only one ring of blades that provide the cutting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very experienced with electric shavers, but this one does the job and holds a charge in times of no use.</li>
            <li> For me, my neck and my upper lip are very difficult for any shaver to cut.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very small downside.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very small downside.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> If you plan on using it strictly indoors, I would recommend looking at a corded Norelco model that is less expensive.</li>
            <li> So I ended up with a couple of formerly high-end shavers that I only can equip with terrible replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> Slow and weak shaver.  </li>
            <li> worse than the lack of closeness - the bulky head makes parts of my face really hard to reach.</li>
            <li> Probably not a good idea by the company to make it that way.</li>
            <li> With all my complaints, you&#x27;d think I hate using the thing, but I still choose it over my manual razor nearly every time I step out of the shower.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s hard to beat!</li>
            <li> If you push it to your face to hard, it WILL scratch you!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was sick and tired of all the women&#x27;s electric razors having a similar design that didn&#x27;t conform to the shape of my leg and the curve of my knees.  </li>
            <li> This shaver seems weak the moment you pull it out of the packaging.  </li>
            <li> I bought this locally, but wish I had bought it here as it is $10 cheaper :(  </li>
            <li> After a 30 trial period with this shaver, I can say it&#x27;s not for my tough whiskers.  </li>
            <li> Runs very slowly - spite giving it a 24 hr charge.  </li>
            <li> And, I hate that I have to shave the entire side of my face just to shave my sideburns.</li>
            <li> I was tired of using a blade razor and opted for this Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Trimmer does a poor job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The poor quality of Norelco&#x27;s replacement heads seems to be a part of their business model.  </li>
            <li> j am not happy wlth thjs razor.</li>
            <li> It rips the hair from your face and feels worse than dry-shaving your face with a $0.50 motel razor.  </li>
            <li> Rotors spin real slow IMHO.</li>
            <li> It left patches and not to mention it irritated his skin very bad.</li>
            <li> The little pop-up trimmer is nearly worthless.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think one can go wrong with Norelco or Panasonic shavers.</li>
            <li> I have used a number of Norelco razors, some inexpensive and some fairly expensive.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with a Philips/Norelco product</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco 8240XL which was the worst razor ever and left me wondering how it ever got out of quality control.  </li>
            <li> Sorry Norelco . . .</li>
            <li> I bought this as a random gift for my boyfriend, hoping that he would like it.</li>
            <li> Does not hold its charge like expensive models of shavers.&lt;br /&gt;Heavier or thicker beards can order another blade set, but for me that</li>
            <li> However I have to use a razor at the end for some difficult parts</li>
            <li> Never had an electric razor before, so I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> However, when it came down to cutting and cleaning, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I suffered from razor bumps so badly and they have decreased about 93% after using this shaving product.</li>
            <li> If we get to the point of having to replace the cutting parts, we do feel they are too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Rinses in water so never gets dirty.</li>
            <li> It hits every spot and doesn&#x27;t leave annoying hairs behind.</li>
            <li> Bad Mistake.</li>
            <li> I was worried that i&#x27;d make a bad decision.</li>
            <li> I tried one of those fancy &amp;#34;self cleaning&amp;#34; &amp;#34;digital&amp;#34; ones, and they were terrible, in fact, I have no idea how they can sell them for $200 when they work worse than this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a bit disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, I considered abandoning Norelco altogether, but I do like their rotary shavers.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> What a stupid invention.</li>
            <li> I hate to have to use the power cord all the time.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t heard anything bad about it!</li>
            <li> Lady shavers are horrible and junky.  </li>
            <li> and it is horrible!</li>

            <li> Great shaver for just shaving. Nothing fancy, gets the work done.</li>
            <li> My shaver arrived in a timely manner. After using my shaver every day for the last 3+ months it just quit on me. I have checked the connection and the cord but this shaver will not hold a charge. I want to know what this seller will do for me. My last shaver lasted 5 years and the only reason I had to replace it was that my grandson had accidentally dropped it and a few plastic pieces broke off.</li>
            <li> Works great but does not have battery level indicator.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this and he is not easy to please</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this for about 3 weeks and think it works pretty well.  We are used to electric shavers (vs disposable razors) and we think it gives quite a good shave. It replaced a much older Norelco that was also good, but had quit working. The light weight of this new model at first felt flimsy compared to the older one, but, after using it, the lighter weight IS nice.  The narrowness of where you grab the unit makes it a bit harder to hold onto compared to the older model, which was larger all around.  To clean the unit, you flip open the top and the top remains attached - we don&#x27;t like that so much, because it is just plastic and we&#x27;re concerned that the hinge could break off pretty easily, and it&#x27;s sort of in the way when you want to clean it - I suppose that&#x27;s just a matter of getting used to it.  If we get to the point of having to replace the cutting parts, we do feel they are too expensive.  But, we did want this type of shaver, and among those we looked at, believe this was our best option. Overall, for the price, convenience, and how close it shaves, we recommend it.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.  This is the replacement for  the old 7301 model.  I like something that works but nothing fancy.  The price was better then any I could find.  It does a great smooth job.</li>
            <li> Same shaver as the ones that cost over $100!  Same lift and cut that I&#x27;ve used for at least 35 years... This is the second one I have owned, and only the 3rd Norelco in my entire life...  I expect this one may last at least another 15 years!  Now that&#x27;s a great bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> Good razor for the price, the washable feature is nice.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband as a replacement shaver.  He says it does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> this shaver is better than the one I bought before.</li>
            <li> I got this as gift, they were nice,</li>
            <li> I love it. Cheap but working fine.</li>
            <li> I love being able to wash the razor clean rather than using a brush.</li>
            <li> This Philips Norelco shaver is a quality low priced shaver that will deliver satisfactory results.  It is not the best shaver that I have ever had, but consider the pricing of this shaver.  I have used this shaver now for over a week and have gotten use to the tricks of obtaining a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt; The first and foremost requisite is to make sure to wash your face with soap and water and leave the face damp for shaving.  In using the razor make sure you stretch the skin as you shave as this will cut the beard much closer.  Make sure to make several passes over each part of your face.  Also repeat more often in the tough bearded areas to get the desired smooth results.&lt;br /&gt; Once done, rinse your face with water and voila you will be a clean shaven man!  The results will not be like taking a razor to your face.  But all in all you will have a clean appearance that will last through most of the day.  Still there will be a five o&#x27;clock shadow and if you needed a fresher appearance you can shave if going out that evening.&lt;br /&gt; Also Norelco claims that the battery will last a week before recharging.  I found out that the battery will last a week.  However as the week goes on the motor will slow down and the shave quality will be hampered.  My suggestion is to recharge the battery every other day.  This way the motorized heads will shave more powerfully and closer.  Oh and by the way make sure to clean the razor heads after each shave.  Otherwise the quality of the shave will suffer.&lt;br /&gt; This is a good useable shaver that is both economical and serves a good utilitarian purpose.</li>
            <li> I bought it to shave my legs. It does an awesome job and works great, better than any woman&#x27;s shaver I have used.</li>
            <li> This razor is virtually identical to my previous model, Philips Norelco PT730, with the exception that the PT724 does not come with a travel bag, and has a blue panel instead of black.&lt;br /&gt;The razor is capable of shaving fairly closely without irritation to the skin of the neck. The razor has a charging status light that conveniently lets you know when it is about time to recharge, but typically still retains enough power to finish the current shave. I appreciate the ability to simply rinse the razor under the water tap, as it is a bit awkward to take apart the blade assembly for more thorough cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;I note that on this razor is printed: \\&quot;Made in Netherlands\\&quot;, which is a bit surprising, since to my knowledge, Phillips Norelco consumer electric/electronic devices (including the PT730) have been made in China for some time.</li>
            <li> Electric shavers seem to work better on some than others.  This usually means you are either a blade man because electrics don&#x27;t cut it, a Braun man or a Norelco man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a Norelco man.  Brauns don&#x27;t seem to cut it for my face and razor blades do a lot of damage.  That said, I have owned many different Norelco&#x27;s over the years.  The PT724 is a good mid-level product.  It does NOT cut as close or as fast as the expensive SensoTouch model that I have.  Still, it is very good and has all the features you want as listed below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-washable&lt;br /&gt;-good battery life (I charge it up every 2 weeks)&lt;br /&gt;-still works with power cord attached even if battery low&lt;br /&gt;-low price, good value&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-does not cut as close or as fast as SensoTouch models (albeit 3x the cost).</li>
            <li> solid, reliable item!</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for many years and though I have in the past tried other brands, I always return to Norelco. I like the PT724/41 because it can be cleaned by running it underwater, which works very well. My son keeps a Norelco in the shower. The battery generally lasts me more than a week of shaving. When I was young and primarily shaved with a safety razor, I got the smoothest shaves in my life. I have never found an electric that matched a safety razor, but the Norelco is close enough. I find that my skin is never irritated and it shaves very quickly. The manual says that the shaver blades should be changed every 12 months. Though I don&#x27;t always do this, if you want to continue with any electric and get a close shave quickly, this should be done. The down side is that the replacement blades are almost half the cost of a new electric razor. The replacements for this razor are about $25. Overall, this is a good razor and has a good clipper as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean for this to be a comparison review, but it&#x27;s worth saying that my daily razor is a [[ASIN:B006W2SYF8 Philips Norelco 1150X/46 SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor, Frustration Free Packaging]].  I&#x27;ve been fairly happy with it, and I must admit I was very pleasantly surprised when I found that this Norelco PT724 really blows it away in many respects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  Shaves almost as close as my Norelco 1150X.&lt;br /&gt;2)  Does so in about 1/3 the time, which makes irritation SO much less.&lt;br /&gt;3)  Costs just over 1/2 the price.&lt;br /&gt;4)  Replacement blades are about 2/3 the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is not really a complaint but an observation you might want to keep in mind:  the battery system is much more \\&quot;speedy\\&quot; in the 1150X, in that it recharges much more quickly.  The initial charging of the PT724/41 took about 12 hours (I don&#x27;t yet know how long the charge will last), while recharging of the 1150X takes about 20 minutes and lasts nearly a month.  Just an FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I&#x27;d thought I was picking up this PT724/41 razor to be a travel/back-up for my 1150X, but it has quickly taken the other&#x27;s place, and I now use it as my regular razor, with my 1150X serving as my backup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t cut quite as close as I&#x27;d like, though it&#x27;s no slouch, and it&#x27;s far preferable to my 1150X in almost every other respect.  I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li> This rechargeable Norelco electric shaver gives a fast, smooth and close shave (by electric shaver standards) with no pulling or irritation of my skin.  The shave is comparable to that provided by my much more expensive Norelco 8260XL shaver which I have regularly used for more than four years.  As an added convenience, this shaver is lighter in weight than the 8260XL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor in this PT724 is relatively quiet, but not as quiet as the motor in the 8260XL.  Also, an uncharged battery in the PT724 takes a full 8 hours of charging to bring it up to a full charge, while the time required to accomplish the same result in the 8260XL is only 45 minutes.  Waiting 8 hours for the battery to charge could become an inconvenience, especially if it needs a charge while I am traveling.  A fully charged battery in both shavers gives me about two weeks of use without needing a recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PT724 does not come with a charging stand and apparently none is available.  This would have been a useful feature, since the shaver lays flat on the counter when not in use, taking up more space than the 8260XL, which came with a charging stand.  The PT724 also did not come with a travel case, which also would have been useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that this is a very good basic rechargeable shaver which will gives good value for the money.  However, if you are looking for a more fully featured shaver (with for example a quick charge, a charging stand and a travel case), I suggest you choose another product.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my Philips Norelco Powertouch Electric Razor. The one downside though is that I didn&#x27;t check prices with other retailers, as I usually do. I paid $49.99, however, I noticed after the fact that Target is selling the same electric razor for $39.99 or $10 less.  Since Amazon doesn&#x27;t match prices, buyer beware!</li>
            <li> My son loved this razor.  Good product!</li>
            <li> Gift... specifically requested by my son...</li>
            <li> not nearly as powerful as the last one i got, even when plugged in. a bit disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> this is my second Philips shaver.I am using,and found no problems.as good as the first shaver.</li>
            <li> long battery life, clean shaves, so easy to clean quickly.  Best buy.</li>
            <li> Why did I ever use a razor?</li>
            <li> I gave this to my boyfriend as a gift because he really wanted one. He said that it takes 21 days to get used to it (I am not sure how true that is), but he ended up loving it. Would highly recommend to men and it does get a close shave!</li>
            <li> Husband is very safisfied with shaver.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for a first time user. Wet shave is better than dry. As the literature says ,use it for 3weeks( till skin adapts to the shaver) before you give up using it. I am sure you will like it.</li>
            <li> Impossible to clean without having the heads fall out.</li>
            <li> If you, like me, have been a razor traditionalist (I even tried a straight razor for a brief period) considering a switch to electric, my take away from using this one is: don&#x27;t be cheap. If you&#x27;re accustomed to a manual razor, you&#x27;re used to getting a nice, close shave. This model will probably leave you unsatisfied. Even immediately after shaving, my face still feels just a little bit rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even worse than the lack of closeness - the bulky head makes parts of my face really hard to reach. If there is any kind of distinction between where your chin ends and your neck begins, you&#x27;ll have to put a lot of effort into avoiding having a narrow line of stubble hang on there (perhaps they only tested it on fat men). And, I hate that I have to shave the entire side of my face just to shave my sideburns. I don&#x27;t need to shave my cheeks, but it&#x27;s the only way to get to my sideburns with a razor head that wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, don&#x27;t expect any kind of precision with this thing. The little pop-up trimmer is nearly worthless. I tried to use it on my sideburns the first few times but eventually stopped bothering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said - there is something amazing about how easy it is. With all my complaints, you&#x27;d think I hate using the thing, but I still choose it over my manual razor nearly every time I step out of the shower. I love not having to lather my face up with shaving cream. I love not having to rinse the razor after every pass. And, I was surprised to find that even a dry shave gave me no razor burn. I still use my manual razor if I have an important meeting or if I have a date night with my wife, but for most days this electric razor is adequate.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed at the right price. Close shave, battery lasts a long time between charges. Does not have all the bells and whistles</li>
            <li> Fell apart when opened it up to clean. Returned it for a refund. Would not recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> like better than reg bick razer</li>
            <li> Very good shaving experience, clean and comfortable, it is easy to clean. but its blades has half life span as my old one, I need to decide whether to buy a new shaver or change its blades in one year.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the close shave.</li>
            <li> The best shave ever.....timely and smooth.  Also, the the price is unbelievable.  It is hard to get the places like under nose and the neck...works great!</li>
            <li> As good as my other Philip shaver. I like it.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. Close shave, no burn, hope it lasts.</li>
            <li> excellent battery life. would recommend this product. very close cut.</li>
            <li> After two days of use everything appears to be as I have read and expected.  Time will tell if it continues.</li>
            <li> An outstanding shaver. Sharp with a great design. The sideburns trimmer is a plus. This is about my 10 Norelco. I wish it was still made in the USA.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a working shaver ... there really isn&#x27;t much different from the older model (uses the same heads HQ8). The shave sounds stronger and the charging cord isn&#x27;t coiled with a very long lead.</li>
            <li> Lather up your skin with some water and this just glides over your skin, giving you a very close shave without hurting. Works best on thin hair, such as facial hair. Hurts some if you try it on thicker hair. For those areas, the integrated pop-up trimmer works best. This shaver can be used while it&#x27;s charging or by itself. Every charge gives it 40 minutes of use, which is a lot considering how quick you&#x27;ll finish shaving with this. If you need a close shave without the pain, this shaver is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my dad and he is pleased with the quality and performance. He has Parkinson&#x27;s Disease and is somewhat limited with what he can do, but he&#x27;s happy that he can still shave his own whiskers.</li>
            <li> I have purchased for my husband and he has liked it very well. I think it is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> It is great - as you would expect.</li>
            <li> It is simple to use.I bought it for my father.</li>
            <li> It is cordless.  Good at home and good for trips away from home where 110 v outlets are sometimes hard to find or in an inconvenient location.  (hotel rooms)</li>
            <li> I had been using a Remington shaver and decided to try another brand. Bad Mistake. I only used the shaver on half my beard and went back to using my old wore out Remington. It worked much better.</li>
            <li> Terrific!  Was afraid we needed to spend more, but this lower priced shaver is comfortable and does a great job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay works well.</li>
            <li> Nice, yet inexpensive. Great buy.</li>
            <li> This razor gives me a good shave. Unlike my prior budget shaver, I can shave at the same time that the shaver is plugged in.</li>
            <li> Everything was as expected. Thank you</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco PT724/41 Powertouch Electric Razor provides a comfortable, close shave with little to no irritation.  As somebody that has tried countless electric razors (Philips Norelco, Braun, Wahl, Remington, and others), I often don&#x27;t have much faith in what the manufacturer often advertises.  The PT724/41 Powertouch lives up to the promise and includes a lithium ion battery, which is becoming more popular in electric razors for extended shaving time between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, the lithium ion battery is nice.  You can also used it corded for continuous power.  You&#x27;ll get many shaves in before having to worry about charging the battery and the power of lithium ion means that you&#x27;ll get good, constant power until the battery is drained.  The flexible heads do make for a comfortable shave.  The razor flows fairly effortless across the contours of the face and deliver a close shave.  If you are coming from manual razors, you should give an electric razor time (up to a few weeks) before making a judgment call on its effectiveness.  There is an adjustment period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean up is fairly simple.  You can release the head with a small button, then rinse with hot water.  Overall, the PT724/41 exceeds the shave provided by other razors in higher price ranges.  It&#x27;s a no frills model that gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Really liking how good it works. I would buy another one.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for a week now. I&#x27;ve bought norelco electric razors before and this one has been the best so far especially for the price. It delivers a very good shave for an electric (nothing can beat a blade). I have some parts of my face that have some thinner hair and this razor still gets them. I&#x27;ve had problems with other razors only getting the thick hairs.&lt;br /&gt; I give it four stars though because out of the package the trimmer on the back sticks and won&#x27;t pop up without a two handed effort. Not a deal breaker but still brings this down a notch. Maybe it will loosen up with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I definitely recommend this and would buy it again. A good value.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for 15 years. My last shaver before this one was an 8138XL which was pricier and had some better features such as: greater surface area, and most important to me, a longer battery charge (50 minutes) with (and this is the most important feature) a lot less time for charging (1 hour versus 8 hours on this model). In general, I do not care that much about the replacement heads&#x27; surface area. Why do I say that? I like to use a travel version with just 2 heads from time to time (Philips Norelco PQ208 [[ASIN:B00AEINQ9K Philips Norelco PQ208 Travel Electric Razor]])- and it shaves just fine. Plus, by using AA batteries, you are assured to actually finish the shave. My recommendation: if you travel, and don&#x27;t want to spend more, get this shaver. If you can, it is great to have an emergency travel shaver with AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;Getting back to this model,  I like the way this one works - it is indeed a clean shave. I like that the shaver is machine washable. If you plan on using it strictly indoors, I would recommend looking at a corded Norelco model that is less expensive. Philips Norelco 6940 Reflex Action Men&#x27;s Shaving System[[ASIN:B00AEINQ9K Philips Norelco PQ208 Travel Electric Razor]]. Overall, a good product. I don&#x27;t think one can go wrong with Norelco or Panasonic shavers.</li>
            <li> Such an improvement over my old Norelco!</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected.  I have owned a competitors razor for years.  this one surpasses my expectations.</li>
            <li> I originally went to Amazon to purchase heads for my husband&#x27;s Norelco shaver, but saw this shaver on sale and decided to purchase it instead. As always, he is quite happy with it. It may not have the heft and solid sound of the Norelco products he has owned in the past, but as always it does an excellent job. As he has gotten older, and his whiskers turned from brown to white he&#x27;s found they are much stiffer and harder to shave, but this item left him feeling as smooth as the proverbial &#x27;baby&#x27;s bottom.&amp;#34; Norelco will continue to be his electric shaver of choice.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my father-in-law, who loves it.</li>
            <li> Works great for it&#x27;s intended purpose and for the price.  Easy to clean and holds its charge for a goon week and probably longer but I usually like to charge it once a week overnight.</li>
            <li> This razor is fantastic.  I shave with a special shaving cream and it gets as close as a regular razor.  I was cutting my face with the regular razor.  This beats the standard razor by all means.  I was cutting my face with the regular razor.  That problems gone!</li>
            <li> I like it. It replaces the same make &amp; model that I had for 3 years.</li>
            <li> My husband has loved Norelco razors for many years.  His old one died and he had been on the look out for another for some time.  I suggested that he check Amazon.com.  He is a newbie and hadn&#x27;t realized that you carry everything.  He really flipped at the excellent price and he is more than satisfied with the razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very practical product</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product, and exactly 2 years and 2 months later, the rechargeable batteries quit charging, rendering the shaver useless.  Be forwarned, those rechargeable batteries last about 2 years or so.........</li>
            <li> If you have used an expensive high speed shaver you will probably think this light weight, slow RPM shaver is a piece of junk.  well, that is what I first thought, but after using this shaver a couple of times I realized that I got a really close shave in one quarter of the time of my older heavy, high speed shaver. In this case light weight and slow RPM is something I will probably appreciate over time. I&#x27;ve owned several expensive shavers and I figure this inexpensive one will probably last as long as they did. I have had to replace several sets of NiCad batteries which have a charging memory and will fail in time, but this shaver has a lithium battery which I have in three of my recent purchases and just love them.  Only time will truly tell.</li>
            <li> very good shaver for the money</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Norelco which, after many years of usage, finally &amp;#34;died.&amp;#34;  The cost of replacing the battery was so high that it felt right to buy a new razor.  This one is easy to use, somewhat lighter than the old one, and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> Purchased one in early December 2014 and it completely died about 4 weeks later. Amazon replaced it and so far so good. Good value unless this one dies too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I bought the Shaver 3100 to replace a Norelco 7310XL that I&#x27;ve had for about 3 years. The instructions for both the 7310XL and the Shaver 3100 said they can be cleaned by flushing under running hot water. When the first Shaver 3100 died I opened it up the 7310XL and found that the motor was covered in rust and locked up. Obviously it was not sealed well and water was leaking in. A soaking in Liquid Wrench finally freed it up and it now it&#x27;s working fine again. Makes me wonder if water leaking into the first 3100 caused its demise. So now I remove the head and clean it with water but do not run water over the body of the shaver.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving since I was old enough to shave... Ok seriously my electric shaver of choice is a Braun that I used for a lot of years. What I really do is shave in the shower every morning. It seems to make even old blades cut like razors doing a very clean job. It is also easy to determine where the line is that you are cutting on. All electrics don&#x27;t give you a razor close shave especially when you are steamed up in the shower. This Phillips Norelco does a nice job though, and doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin. The floating heads follow the contour of your face. The one caveat is that they are round and are hiding under the head area making them a little bit challenging when determining where the line of cut is on your face; something that is critical if you have a goatee or beard. The pop up edger does a really nice job though of creating a fine neck line under a beard or for trimming the sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is made out of plastic so you want to be careful not to drop it onto a tile floor. The recharge times are pretty long. It takes 12 hours to do a full recharge which is good for only 40 minutes. You have to consider that shaving is usually only a minute or two job so a single charge will last you for a week quite easily. I know with cordless drills for example my Bosch it charges in only a half an hour, and you can use it occasionally for months without it needing a recharge. So between the two batteries you are never left with your pants down. I was hoping this shaver followed that course, but for the money it provides a very workable solution.&lt;br /&gt;The good things:&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;Super light weight&lt;br /&gt;Floating heads follow the contours of your head&lt;br /&gt;Great shaver for refreshes before going out&lt;br /&gt;Can pop the head up and wash with water&lt;br /&gt;Pop up trimmer works great on sideburns or neckline under beard&lt;br /&gt;Overall I give it four stars only because of the recharge time. In every other way it does a good job unless you want to spend many times as much and get a \\&quot;little\\&quot; closer shave. So I recommend it.any times as much and get a \\&quot;little\\&quot; closer shave. So I recommend it.</li>
            <li> As much as I like Norelco razors, I don&#x27;t recommend this model.  Instead, I recommend the [[ASIN:B006GQYSGO Philips Norelco PT730 PowerTouch Rechargeable Cordless Razor]] which has better combs (what Norelco calls the screens that touch your face) which is currently about the same price. The PT724 has \\&quot;Comfort Cut\\&quot; combs which have standard slots all around, whereas the PT730 has 8-series \\&quot;DualPrecision\\&quot; combs with little holes that allow for a closer shave. When you buy [[ASIN:B000068PBT HQ8 replacement heads]] for any of these models, they come with the better 8-series combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using these combs for about a month to give my face time to adjust, I noticed my shave wasn&#x27;t as close as my 10-year-old Norelco 6885XL. The 6885XL has Quadra Action heads with the little holes, so I got the replacement HQ8 heads and sure enough, that was the difference. Now it shaves just as close as my old 6885XL. As an aside, the other shaver brand I like is Braun - I have an older battery-operated Braun travel shaver similar to the [[ASIN:B002PCPZQA BRAUN POCKET SHAVER M60B]] that also shaves nice and close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do the holes make a difference? I am not sure, but when the Quadra Action shavers came out, I read that since the holes are smaller, the comb can be thinner in that area. A Norelco rep also told me that the holes will hold the hairs straighter (think of pushing a stick into a pipe vs. a mail slot). Whatever the reason, it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco recommends replacing the heads annually. About 2-3 years after I got my old [[ASIN:B000050B65 Norelco 6885XL]], I went into a razor repair shop and asked for replacement heads. Even though they sold them, the old repair guy told me not to replace them unless I had problems; he said they were self-sharpening and lasted many years for most people. Sure enough, 10 years later they still cut as well as my new HQ8 heads. Admittedly, I may have lighter facial hair than others, and spend only 90 seconds or so per full shave, but if they can go 10 years with almost daily use, the HQ8 (which appear very similar in design and quality) might do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge time for the PT724 is 8 hours for 40+ minutes of use. This seems excessive to me because my old 6885XL charges in about 1 hour for a similar use time. I don&#x27;t really mind though, because you can just plug it in and use it, and I usually charge it overnight anyway - it won&#x27;t overcharge. While Norelco says the battery can&#x27;t be replaced, on many Norleco models you can find third party replacement batteries online and solder them in. I did this not long ago with my 6885XL and it took about 20 minutes - you just need a screwdriver, soldering iron, solder and solder wick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has a quieter hum similar to higher end models. Keep it lubricated if it gets loud - use a shaver spray lube periodically. I don&#x27;t care for the position of the power-on button, which is right where my thumb goes so the shaver will sporadically turn off while I&#x27;m shaving. Unfortunately, the PT730 has the button in the same place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PT724 and PT730 both come with a cleaning brush, protection cap, and plug-in charger, but no stand or case.  The [[ASIN:B0076ON5BE PT734/41]] is the PT730 with a stand but currently costs much more.  There is also a lower end [[ASIN:B006GQYSFA PT720]] model which Norelco told me is identical to this model but without the pop-up trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To conclude, while I love Norelco shavers, the PT724 requires replacement heads to do a great job, so I recommend upgrading to at least the PT730.l shave, but if they can go 10 years with almost daily use, the HQ8 (which appear very similar in design and quality) might do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge time for the PT724 is 8 hours for 40+ minutes of use. This seems excessive to me because my old 6885XL charges in about 1 hour for a similar use time. I don&#x27;t really mind though, because you can just plug it in and use it, and I usually charge it overnight anyway - it won&#x27;t overcharge. While Norelco says the battery can&#x27;t be replaced, on many Norleco models you can find third party replacement batteries online and solder them in. I did this not long ago with my 6885XL and it took about 20 minutes - you just need a screwdriver, soldering iron, solder and solder wick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor has a quieter hum similar to higher end models. Keep it lubricated if it gets loud - use a shaver spray lube periodically. I don&#x27;t care for the position of the power-on button, which is right where my thumb goes so the shaver will sporadically turn off while I&#x27;m shaving.

The [[ASIN:B0076ON5BE PT734/41]] is the PT730 with a stand but currently costs much more.  There is also a lower end [[ASIN:B006GQYSFA PT720]] model which Norelco told me is identical to this model but without the pop-up trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To conclude, while I love Norelco shavers, the PT724 requires replacement heads to do a great job, so I recommend upgrading to at least the PT730.</li>
            <li> This Norelco razor is a great razor for daily shaving. It offers a smooth shave in a timely manner. I appreciate that it stores cut hair inside, leaving the user and sink area clean of debris. Cleaning and maintenance is very easy with detailed instructions. Noise is very minimal with almost no strong vibrations. The razor is equipped with color-coded light signals to indicate charging process. I have not yet replaced the heads so I don&#x27;t know how long the originals will stay sharp or how  difficult replacing them will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I didn&#x27;t like is that there is not a replacement option for the battery if the battery were to die (or not keep a charge, which I&#x27;m sure will happen at some point). I don&#x27;t know what the life-span of the battery is, but hopefully it is a long time since that is also the life span of the razor.</li>
            <li> This shaver replaces a Norelco purchased many many years ago.  When the cutters wore out this time it was a no-brainer what the replacement would be.  Easy to clean under hot water faucet and shaves very comfortably.</li>
            <li> Good for a quick clean up shave, but doesn&#x27;t go as far down as a razor would to make it completely smooth.</li>
            <li> Great Razor I use this razor all of the time.</li>
            <li> great for the price- can&#x27;t tell difference from my previous model which was supposedly a better model</li>
            <li> I like it does a great job I would get another one</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this Norelco razor - as is my husband who gets to use it!&lt;br /&gt;We have been a &#x27;Norelco&#x27; house for many years now and I&#x27;ve purchased some top of the line models (with a solution cleaning base and more bells and whistles) in the past. I have personally used the low end Norelco model myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model is what I could call a medium level razor. It has a sturdy feel that is not too heavy, but not too light either. It can be immersed in water which the basic model that I use cannot. It provides a very close shave and the razor is a credit to the Norelco line. It&#x27;s a fairly simple razor, but much nicer than an basic model.&lt;br /&gt;One reason I know that my husband really likes this particular razor is that he uses it all of the time now!  More than the higher end model that he&#x27;s had for some time, although he does change the blades on his other Norelco frequently, he seems to prefer this one!&lt;br /&gt;I think that he likes the fact that the weight of this razor is slightly less the heavier version he owns. It&#x27;s substantial, but not too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that this particular Norelco is a perfect blend of simplicity and function at a price point that&#x27;s hard to beat! Well done Norelco!</li>
            <li> awesome machine. battery last a long time</li>
            <li> Works well but does not seem that much better than my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> Shaves well on face.  Pull hair on my neck.  In all it works well.  Seems a little slower on the RPM&#x27;s then my old Norelco razor.</li>
            <li> My wife liked to use my razor for her legs, and we had one that I had got in college in the 1960&#x27;s.  Finally the old heads on that old one failed, and we had to replace it, and we ordered this while on Vacation in Palm Springs.  It came in a timely manner and the wife has found it does the job</li>
            <li> The pop out razer part doesn&#x27;t really cut. That would be my only complaint.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for someone who has traditionally used a regular razor when shaving and has been leery of electrics.  However, he says he likes this electric and gets a close shave with it.  The unit feels lighter than my Norelco that I&#x27;ve used for years, but works just as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor for the money!  Good, close shave and the charge lasts for days &amp; days.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and arrived as described.</li>
            <li> Works great----no problems.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is bending inside when i use it. The earlier cheaper model i had was better. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> just as described.enjoying using</li>
            <li> My husband hasn&#x27;t said, but I don&#x27;t think he is quite as satisfied with it as I thought he would be, the shaver doesn&#x27;t seem to give a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; shave.</li>
            <li> Did not come with stand and case as shown. Was only the razor.</li>
            <li> As an inexpensive travel razor, this product works nicely. It does not trim as deeply as the ~$200 model of Norelco shaver that I have, but it also doesn&#x27;t miss large patches like some of the cheap models I have used in the past (Remington, in particular).</li>
            <li> This is worth the price so far. It arrived LATE (was a gift for hubby; GUARANTEED AMAZON delivery has failed for my last three orders, so beware of this issue), but is a nice little razor. The charge seems to last and last and while the results are not as smooth and close as he had hoped for, it works, travels well and the ability to rinse the heads is a plus. Will update if any changes are noted. Utilizing the coupon, the  price was terrific. Norelco has a great reputation and this little gem has a two year warranty. Recommended !!!</li>
            <li> It is made in china,the razor is ok,But I want to buy a razor made in Netherlands,so.......,just  only 3 stars</li>
            <li> Unlike my old norelco the blades need some improvement....feels like hair is being pulled out rather than cut....close shave..yea OK...but with a little pain....not sure i would recommend!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great, does not pull at my face. Great battery life I charge once every other week or so.  I dont have super thick or fast facial growth</li>
            <li> HAVE USED NORELCO RAZORS FOR OVER 60 YEARS AND THIS, MY FIFTH OR SIXTH MODEL, IS THE MOST COMFORTABLE YET. I ALSO LIKE THAT THE LITHIUM BATTERY HOLDS A CHARGE LONGER THAN PREVIOUS MODELS.</li>
            <li> This razor is adequate. Cleaning the blades is awkward and not done easily. The construction is light weight and seems somewhat cheap. I would not recommend purchasing this shaver. Basically you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It works but it doesn&#x27;t get close enough.  You have to go over the same area over and over again</li>
            <li> Much better than my old shaver. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Like the long battery life after charging.</li>
            <li> Really good shave Much closer then my old one!</li>
            <li> Shaves as close as a razer without the cuts and burn!</li>
            <li> New in box.....works really well for my beard.....quiet motor and pop up trimmer is improved over earlier models......recommended</li>
            <li> They dont make them like they used too.</li>
            <li> It was what I had expected . I bought thus as a gift for my son I am sure he will like it too.</li>
            <li> Great razor! Nice flip-out blade on back for trimming! Charges good, Clean Shave! Great price for such a good razor!</li>
            <li> It works great and very good price.</li>
            <li> gives good clean shave</li>
            <li> I have owned any number of razors over the years.  This is the quietest smoothest razor I have ever purchased.  Does not pull the skin, and gives a smooth shave nearly as close as a classic hand razor.  Good battery life and the quietest motor I have ever heard on a device such as this.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Seems to hold a charge well.  I don&#x27;t like to clean it with water (just old fashion I guess) so I clean it with the brush.  Shaves close.</li>
            <li> My husband just had surgery and was told by his doctor he has to use an electric razor.  For the price this is a very good product.</li>
            <li> I have had a Norelco razor for 15 years and many of the models in the intervening years have been poor.  But this one is outstanding.  Works very well, keeps the charge and is a great successor to the great older razors Norelco made before being bought out.</li>
            <li> I like the Philips Norelco PT724. It has a confortable shave and the battery charge seems to last about 3-4 weeks (at 3-4 minutes a day of use). I have used a number of Norelco razors, some inexpensive and some fairly expensive. This one works as well as any I have had, so I am happy with the performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The description on the Amazon website said the razon was manufactured in the Neatherlands, but the box says it is made in China. The overall feel is that is is made of lightweight plastic materials, but then it is a great value for money, so that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> Bought as a second inexpensive razor for my travel bag and it will suit that purpose perfectly Gives a close, smooth,  adequate shave.</li>
            <li> Works great on my son&#x27;s thin beard but I doubt it would be powerful enough for a real thick course beard.</li>
            <li> Works great and the price is really good.&lt;br /&gt;What more can I say, it gives a great shave and it does not break the bank like some other high end models.</li>
            <li> I got one of these for each of my sins and they both said it works well and they like it.</li>
            <li> I had an old norelco which was geat and lasted me 6-7 Years and then the blade housing cracked. I used glue to put it together but it came out again after few days so I knew its time to get another one. I counterplayed getting the cheap norelco compare to one of the expensive ones. Since I am tight on budget I decided to get the cheapest one. I think the shaver is one of the best bang for the buck. I didnt shave for 4 days and then used it. It was smooth and effective cutting hair. I really like this product and defitnely enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> I understand that everyone is different and every skin type varies, but this review is directly from my experience. I used this shaver solely for three plus weeks just as the directions specified to allow my face to become accustom to the razor. Every single time I used the razor it cut up and irritated my face. It not only did it never gave me a close shave but it always missed hairs forcing me to repeatedly shave the same area. I shaved against the grain, pulled my face tight and used circular motions as the direction stated. I dreaded shaving, praying that this time was the time it would not torture me. I do not see the point of this razor and I definitely would not buy again. I hope this review helps.</li>
            <li> The price was good, but I have 10 year old Norelco Razors that cut better than this one. Read an article where you have to buy a higher model # to get the better blades. May try that when I get time, but also read that some people are changing the batteries (requires some soldering) in the old units, which says the old units overall are better than the one&#x27;s being made today.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not going to get an exceptional shave from this electric razor or any other. Period. It can&#x27;t be done. As long as there is a screen between the blade and your face, it will never, ever be able to get as close as a blade. The width of that screen is the difference between a perfect shave and what you&#x27;re going to get from an electric. It&#x27;s only a fraction of a millimeter but it makes all the difference in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for shaving nirvana, the place where you can quickly shave sans creams, expensive disposable razors and all prep and hassle that comes with conventional shaving, this is not that. That&#x27;s a place that simply doesn&#x27;t exist and never will until Gillette comes out with their nifty digital, pinpoint laser hair zapper, right around the year 2150.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So don&#x27;t buy this or any other electric shaver and expect that it&#x27;s going to be the only shaving implement you&#x27;re ever going to need. What you&#x27;re going to get is a device that will do an *adequate* job - you&#x27;ll feel and look as if you&#x27;ve shaved, but you&#x27;re not going to be complimented on how closely you&#x27;ve shaved. From my perspective, what I get from this shaver is something approaching a 1 or 2PM shave. That is to say, when I&#x27;m done shaving, I look the way I would normally look early in the afternoon after having shaved with a real razor at 6AM. That means that when the early afternoon hours do arrive I look as if I have 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You wouldn&#x27;t want to use this before you head to the church to get hitched, nor would you use it before heading out on a date or any other important occasion where appearances are of the utmost importance - especially if photos will be taken. Seriously, thirty years from now do you want to look in someone&#x27;s wedding album and realize that the reason you looked haggard on a certain day was because you couldn&#x27;t be bothered take the time to shave properly?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what is it good for then? Well, as for myself, I value this purely for convenience. I use it when I&#x27;m rushed and don&#x27;t have the time (or patience) to do the shaving Full Monty. Used in that context, I&#x27;m okay with it. The motor seems anemic, but I can&#x27;t complain too much given what I paid.  I&#x27;m sure there are better shavers in this category, but they can only marginally mitigate the fundamental flaw that all of these devices share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this for the times you need it, but don&#x27;t throw away your razors.</li>
            <li> have not found deficits yet, i bought it two months ago</li>
            <li> Been using this for over a year I think.  I wish these reviews would tell me when I purchased it, but oh well.  Anyway, it works very well. You have to have a completely dry and clean face for optimal operation.  I used my last Norelco charger similar to this one for fifteen years I think without replacing blades or anything.  I replaced it because the battery just wouldn&#x27;t last very long.  Hopefully I get the same use out of this one.  This one has the ability to pop open the top and rinse the clippings out with water under the faucet.  I did that a few times, but prefer to just shake it out like my old razor.  I noticed a moldy/mildew smell when I used water because it didn&#x27;t have a chance to really dry out inside as the water drains down through the body and out the bottom trapping water inside.  I resolved this by pouring white vinegar down through it or maybe it was hydrogen peroxide.  I might have used both at different times. Since then I decided to just shake it out.  No real need to flush it with water.  The side burn trimmer is nice too.  Just for the record this is Maria&#x27;s husband.</li>
            <li> Works great, and great price</li>
            <li> Amazing machine.&lt;br /&gt;Very silent and very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended...&lt;br /&gt;Just had to buy an adapter because I live in Portugal. 5 stars but it works.</li>
            <li> Lady shavers are horrible and junky.  I read one review on one of them to give this a try and I&#x27;m glad i did.  I&#x27;ve had this razor longer than I&#x27;ve had others.  It&#x27;s dependable and does a good job at shaving.</li>
            <li> its a gift for a friend, he haven&#x27;t open it yet, but he said he like it and it looks good to me.</li>
            <li> I was tired of using a blade razor and opted for this Norelco.  It has met my expectations and then some, very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Great shaver, good price and it shaves as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  It is very quiet as well, very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> We have had a Norelco shaver for years. Sometimes it needs replacing. This was one of those times. Wouldn&#x27;t even look for another.</li>
            <li> I Love my Philips Norelco PT724/41 Philips Powertouch Electic Razor. Forget shaving in front of a mirror, instead i&#x27;m watching TV while I shave. No hair is ever on my shirts, it stays inside and it&#x27;s very easy to clean. I love the quick shave mode which is shaving while it&#x27;s plugged on. Only one charge 4 weeks ago and I barely had to charge it today and this reminded me about writing my review today. I will forever depend on my Norelco since you only need to change razors every year or so, depending on usage. I would highly recommend this product to others. A+</li>
            <li> Excellent, little noise</li>
            <li> Works well just as described, love the rechargeable feature and easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> after a year of use, it is still working. takes a while to cleanly shave your whole face but it is more convenient than a wet shave</li>
            <li> Gives a close shave. It Holds the charge well, and it is comfortable to hold. Good price.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this electric razor primarily to shave my head, it works fantastic and equally as well on my face.  Granted it does take a few seconds longer than a regular shave but you can shave while doing something else (watching TV, writing reviews on the computer etc.) I recommend this product without reserve.</li>
            <li> Nice shaver for the $$. Would be nice to have a stand but probably would cost us more. like the handle feel and looks sleek. Bought for my husband gives a close shave.</li>
            <li> I had been nursing my old Norelco along for years and finally decided to get a new one when the barber began cutting whiskers off my cheekbone.  The new one is fast, holds a charge for many days, cleans easily, and does a good job.</li>
            <li> Great shave, no irritations, close as a blade, in my opinion, battery lasts and lasts.  Quiet and comfortable.  Get one!</li>
            <li> Razor and trimmer work well. However, when you clean the head it is extremely difficult to reassemble as the heads fall out and are very difficult to align. In my opinion, the entire head assembly is poorly designed.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and on time. I gave it to my husband for Christmas and he was very pleased.  He said the blades were very sharp and he has a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I have ever used! Very close shave without irritation. I have very sensitive skin and have never been able to shave so close and not irritate my skin around the corners of my mouth and upper chin area. Great buy for an excellent product!</li>
            <li> I use this to shave my head. Works just fine. Just be sure to clean it, and wash the screen with mild soap and water to get the best results.</li>
            <li> great for the price- have used it for a month can&#x27;t ask for a closer shave (using it on head).&lt;br /&gt;if it lasts a year i will be happy and just buy a new one --- cheap enough.</li>
            <li> Well, there is nothing to complain about Philips Norelco at all. It is just great and durable. The battery lasts quite long and holds charge really wells. I often use for 2-3 times a week and don&#x27;t have to charge the battery for months.</li>
            <li> This razor works as advertised. It doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a razor and shaving cream, but it is fine for weekends, which is when I use it or when I am in a hurry. Battery life seems very good so far.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor works fine. This my third purchase of a Philips razor. Recommend highly. I gives a smooth shave and does not burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William Bryden</li>
            <li> Great razor,charges fast  cuts smooth and quickly,  very comfortable to hold well desighned can&#x27;t go wrong with a Philips/Norelco product</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it is the same quality as my previous Philips Electric Razor which lasted four years until the battery would no longer charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like and recommend them.</li>
            <li> It is a good razor.  I have only had the razor for 2 months so I am judging the razor on 2 months .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know much about it myself...but he says works very nice. He has been wanting an electric razor for awhile and says shave is nice.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my brother and he thinks is perfect, I like it too, if he has not complain that means it is good</li>
            <li> Purchased for my son.  Have one of my own and have been very pleased.  Close shave and mine has lasted a couple of years with only head/cutter replacement.</li>
            <li> Maybe because of my curly hair and sensitive face, I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding just the right razor. On the one hand I like my shave to be as fast as possible with as few passes (who doesn&#x27;t) but I also like the ability to use it in the shower (to cool it down) or with cream or some sort of lubricant. And for whatever reason all norelco&#x27;s fall one one side or the other of this divide for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razors like this seem to do a better job of catching my thick curly hairs. So I get the job done with less passes and faster. But on the other hand, by the time I get done the razor is getting pretty warm, and seems to be irritating my face a lil more, and I dont have the option to cool it off or to apply a cream to my face ahead of time. (Though I do use lectric shave if I need to get closer.) I assume these ones shave better because of a more open design, or sharper blades or some such since they dont have to be waterproofed. So in that sense for me, these cheaper Norelcos actually do work better. Especially at around $50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile my much more expensive fancy $200 Norelco has quit on me twice now and is just over a year old and therefore out of warranty. So in a lot of ways I think this is a superior choice especially in the value department. If you dont need some of the fancier features I think this is a solid choice.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd purchase.  Left the first one on a cruise ship.&lt;br /&gt;Love this razor, east to clean and use.  I have arthritic hands and this works great.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco 8240XL which was the worst razor ever and left me wondering how it ever got out of quality control.  A real 1st class dud.  I bought the PT724 to replace the razor the 8240XL replaced, which was the best Norelco I ever had.  I&#x27;m happy to report that this is it and the price was half the price of the 8240XL and less than the original one.  I wrote Norelco regarding this experience and like all modern day companies, they chose to ignore me.</li>
            <li> Nice product and met my requirement. I enjoy using this shaver.</li>
            <li> Xmas gift for my husband and after opening and charging the battery it didn&#x27;t work..Never again will I buy Norelco</li>
            <li> never thought electric would do so well will now be a faithful user&lt;br /&gt;will not go back to old way</li>
            <li> I Like it and the price was right!  It gives a smooth clean close shave. It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor to replace my ladies razor and it works fine for my purposes.  Not super energetic but it will do.</li>
            <li> Best razor I ever have owned, love that it is cordless and the charge lasts like a month! I would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is the 5 Norelco I have bought over the years.  Bought this for my son and he really likes it.  Package arrived quickly and everything was as expected.</li>
            <li> Great price! I had a norelco previously and it too was a great razor. My son broke it so i bought this one! Great shave and battery lasts a long time between charges.</li>
            <li> Meh... I had pretty high expectations when I bought this shaver and I&#x27;ve been somewhat let down... it worked really well for the first two shaves but now it barely shaves my stubble at all. I&#x27;ve tried cleaning it but it won&#x27;t make a difference. It&#x27;s only been a few weeks and the blades are supposed to last a year... The Phillips multigroom actually works better at this point (I have had the multigroom for 2 years without changing the blade, so that is saying something) and it&#x27;s much cheaper and comes with additional attachments.</li>
            <li> This thing works great for me. I suffered from razor bumps so badly and they have decreased about 93% after using this shaving product. If it goes out on me, I will re-buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Norelco electric razors. After my old one took an unfortunate trip down the stairs it was time for a new one. I did this with dread because as we&#x27;ve all experience &amp;#34;they just don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like they used to&amp;#34;. Well, that may be true to some extent like materials used but this razor is everything my 10+ year old one was. Close shave on normal growth, no issues with it pulling hair if I&#x27;m shaving my moustache, even the trimmer works well. I&#x27;m really happy with this. I bought a Braun for my son that costs twice as much as this and it is horrible! I&#x27;m going to buy him one of these for his birthday. That&#x27;s how happy I am with this.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor! Frankly, I was surprised that this one seems to shave better, and faster than my SpeedXL 8140. This razor has fewer openings in the heads, which I thought would lead to slower shaving but surprisingly it was the opposite. I know people reading this will think I&#x27;m comparing new to old, and obviously that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s a difference. However, the heads on my old razor were only a couple months old, and I keep them clean. These cut fast and clean from day one, even before the heads had time to \\&quot;break in\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that the charger plugs into it instead of having a stand (I could plug in my old one and not use the stand as well, but it&#x27;s nice not to have an extra item around). The smaller charger is also good. The rubberized grip I have grown to like. I thought it would collect hair and it does to a small degree, but I think that is offset by the better grip. This one doesn&#x27;t have a little travel case, which I would have liked but I can use the one from my other one. It lasts me a week on one charge for the most part, on par with the other but this one seems to take longer to charge, overnight for full. Made in Holland.</li>
            <li> My husband was in charge of reviewing this item, for obvious reasons.  He shaves every day and has used this model daily for about three weeks.  He charged it once, mainly to top it off since we were traveling.  He hasn&#x27;t had to charge it again.  It took eight hours to charge it fully to start with, and about four hours when he recharged.  Here is what he said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I have been using a Phillips Norelco 8240XL for several years, which costs more than this model.  The PT724 gave as good a shave as the more expensive shaver, although it is not as quiet as the 8240XL.  The PT724 has a lithium battery, a low battery indicator, charging and full charge indicator light.  The older model only has a charging and full charge light, no lithium battery and no way to tell if a charge is needed except by performance.  So the win goes to the PT724.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;There is no travel case with the PT724.  This isn&#x27;t a problem for me because it fits in the case that came with my previous 8240XL, but it&#x27;s something you might want to consider if you travel frequently.  Also, the PT724 has automatic worldwide voltage, something that is not on my older, more expensive model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Replacement heads are  roughly one half the cost of a new razor.  Since the PT724 costs less than the 8240XL, and its replacement heads also cost less than those for the 8240XL,  I would buy the PT724.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Good basic electric razor, no frills, but decent.  Could be useful for travel</li>
            <li> A nice razor for a nice price.  It doesn&#x27;t cut that fast so you&#x27;ll have to take it slow, but as long as you do you won&#x27;t get cut.  It works great, is hard to clean, because you have to disassemble the blade system.  These are the only downsides to owning this product.  It will be hard to find a razor for less than this costs.  If cost isn&#x27;t a factor by all means, but if you want to pay less and not sure which one to get, then this one will do nicely.  The battery life is good and if you use it once a day, you should charge it once every two weeks.  It also charges fast which is good also.  It does not come with a case but has a plastic cover for the blade part and is of average size.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco a few years back and switched to a blade razor. Thought I&#x27;d try it again, but after being used to a smooth shave this was a big disappointment. Anyway, I used it exclusively as directed for 4 weeks and am now looking for a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong - it shaves, but it takes so many passes to even get an acceptable result. Blade shaving was soooo much less work in less time. Sorry Norelco . . . just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: As I read in another review, I spend another $22.00 for an HQ8 blade set. What a difference!! You actually can get a reasonably close shave with these blades. It&#x27;s a damn shame they don&#x27;t come with the razor in the first place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certain that there are better shavers out there... but, in light of the price I paid (less than $40), it&#x27;s terrific.</li>
            <li> Slow and weak shaver.  I realize this is far from their top model, but even when fully charged and/or plugged in it is very sluggish, and takes twice the time to shave as most other shavers do.</li>
            <li> 2ND NORELCO. OLD ONE GREAT. HOPE THIS ONE WILL ALSO BE GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;JOHN</li>
            <li> Looking for a clean shave that lasts long? This is the product for you (men). My brother uses this everytime he feels a little stubble. He&#x27;s never looked so groomed lol.</li>
            <li> The best razor I have ever bought. Close shave, easy to clean and  has a long charge life .Great Razor.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.  It holds the charge for a long time and provides a great shave.  I would recommend it as a great deal.</li>
            <li> It is a gift for my father. I have not use it , but it looks good!</li>
            <li> The razor is perfect for what it is intended to do. It&#x27;s easy to hold and to operate. Good bargain.</li>
            <li> I have used a Shick Quattro 4 blade razor for years and liked it quite a bit. The blades cartridges are reasonable and even though single blade disposable razors tend to leave nicks, the I never had much problem with irritation with the Quattro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend is pretty sensitive to stubble though and I&#x27;ve started shaving more often. I decided to give this electric shaver a try and see if I couldn&#x27;t reduce some of the time and mess the whole process takes, especially since i&#x27;m prone to get zits if I don&#x27;t wash my face really thoroughly after using shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it&#x27;s been much better than I expected. My understanding was that it wouldn&#x27;t be as close as the regular razor and I&#x27;d have trouble getting all of the stubble off. It&#x27;s actually quite a close shave now that I&#x27;ve gotten the technique down, much closer in fact, than dull blades would give me and I don&#x27;t have to replace blades so often now. The only places it&#x27;s not quite as close as the Quattro are around my neck and close to my sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is fine. I&#x27;m accustomed to shaving by the sink/mirror anyway so I don&#x27;t need the cordless ability that much. It is nice to be able to move around though now. Cleanup is very easy. It&#x27;s MUCH easier than cleanup with my razor was- no rinsing the razor between strokes, washing the sink, washing my face, drying off.. I just pop it open and rinse it out and brush the remaining whiskers out.  Cleanup alone is reason enough to recommend it. It&#x27;s much quieter than I expected too. The pop up trimmer seemed like a nice extra when I bought it but it&#x27;s actually quite a bit more useful than I expected as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;there aren&#x27;t many downsides other than initial cost, which is easily offset even by the relatively cheap blade packs for the quattro and shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, I wish I&#x27;d switched a long time ago.</li>
            <li> This does an adequate (nothing to complain about) job of cleaning up around the lips, soul patch, and adam&#x27;s apple after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend a little bit of Nivea Balm before cleaning up your shave with this.</li>
            <li> Very good!&lt;br /&gt;I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;I hope the company provide the new products (the produced date) for us.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> The razor was as advertised and shipped very quickly. I am pleased with the close shave.</li>
            <li> I chose this brand because I had an old shaver from Philips and the experience was good.&lt;br /&gt;I like it because is rechargeable, the three blades give you a perfect smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Just what I was ordering.  Holds the charge long enough.  Easy to grip.  Speeding delivery.  Very easy to keep clean.  Not had to use the replacement heads yet.</li>
            <li> Got it for him as a gift and he loves not having to shave with a razor everytime. He likes that it will be convenient for traveling. It doesn&#x27;t get as close as  a razor but it definitely takes the pokey feeling away and leaves a clean shaven look. Saves him time in the morning before leaving for work.</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised that the speed for cutting was not more powerful and smoother cutting. I hate to have to use the power cord all the time.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco PowerTouch PT724 razor shaves well and is a good choice for anybody who doesn&#x27;t want a razor with a lot of extra features or accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like&lt;br /&gt;*Quiet and lightweight&lt;br /&gt;*Cut whiskers fall into the razor and are easy to clean out (I also have a Panasonic electric razor and it spews whiskers while shaving)&lt;br /&gt;*Can be used both plugged-in and cordless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like&lt;br /&gt;*A full charge takes 8 hours&lt;br /&gt;*The triangular razor head isn&#x27;t as precise as a straight edged head and the pop-up trimmer doesn&#x27;t work very well&lt;br /&gt;*It is impossible to tell how much battery charge is left until recharging is necessary&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This razor gives a decent shave and none of the things I dislike about it are show stoppers. If you&#x27;re looking for an electric razor that is simple to use and you don&#x27;t care about wet shaving, the PowerTouch should work for you. 3.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------&lt;br /&gt;Update (January 2014): No problems to report.</li>
            <li> My college son says the Philips Norelco PT724/41 Philips Powertouch Electric Razor feels comfortable on the skin and is a very smooth shave. It is much easier to grip as well than his old one, he says. He is very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This was the best $40 I have ever spent. It provides a smooth close shave, is very quiet and stays charged for about a week. I could not be happier.</li>
            <li> Best on the mrket for the price</li>
            <li> Met all my expectations. My husband really liked the shaver.</li>
            <li> all went well; thank you</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband but didn&#x27;t know he just got himself one. So I&#x27;ve been using it to shave my legs when short on time and I do like it quite a bit so far .&lt;br /&gt; Has a great battery life &amp; I love the fact it can be used while charging.  Obviously since this is not what it was designed for I don&#x27;t get the same silky smooth feeling like a razor , it&#x27;s more like the feel you get the morning after shaving.  Since thats pretty much the same you&#x27;d get from a women&#x27;s elec razor I&#x27;d say this product has been pretty great</li>
            <li> A razor is a subjective thing, I suppose.  Each face is different.  I have a fairly manly amount of growth.  Typically a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by 4 pm.  For me, my neck and my upper lip are very difficult for any shaver to cut.  I&#x27;m currently on the hunt for a great razor.  I so despise shaving.  This shaver seems weak the moment you pull it out of the packaging.  No weight at all to it.  Then you turn it on and hear a weak little motor purring inside.  No confidence here.  But the shaving confirms it.  After a 30 trial period with this shaver, I can say it&#x27;s not for my tough whiskers.  If you don&#x27;t have a lot of growth and only see a few light hairs coming in after 3 days, then this shaver might work for you.  I would give it only ONE star, but the Norelco customer service agent was SO kind and helpful when I called to return it.  We spoke for some time about the shaver she felt might work for me, based on her several conversations and feedback with other burly-bearded men.</li>
            <li> OK as far as Electric Shavers go, not the Closest shave out there.</li>
            <li> Amazing razor for the price!</li>
            <li> The shaver gives fairly smooth shave and I am satisfied with the same. I would recommend others for its use.</li>
            <li> Only one ring of blades that provide the cutting. It takes a little longer to get a close shave. Other than that it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This shaver does an excellent job. In fact, I have to be careful not to push too hard or it cuts too close. LOL! The only drawback I have found is that the cutting heads are a bit far from the edge, so I have to smush my nose to cut close to it. It&#x27;s no problem though. The trimmer works great too, and I love just opening it and rinsing it clean.</li>
            <li> After a month it still makes my neck sore. Can not get a clean shave on chin or upper lip.&lt;br /&gt; Trimmer does a poor job.&lt;br /&gt; I use it to save money on razor blades when I am not going out in public.</li>
            <li> just what i needed. Works as advertised. Good value.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the performance of this razor and with the speed of the shipping to get it to me. A two thumbs up all the way.</li>
            <li> Great product. Good for the price</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the sender and the razor thank you</li>
            <li> Bought this for my elderly father to replace an older model.  I would have done better to replace the blades in the older model as this does not shave well at all.  I have tried to use it while shaving my dad and it seems to miss entire sections no matter how many times I go over the area. My father has tried it as well with the same results.</li>
            <li> Philips has perfected entry level electric razor. From packaging to operation to cleanup, it&#x27;s very intuitive. The shave is very good.</li>
            <li> Very good unit and well priced.</li>
            <li> The shaver was quiet and smooth but was not as close of shave as expected.  I had hoped for better results.</li>
            <li> I have always used corded Razors growing up. I didn&#x27;t want to have to charge it all the time. This Razor changed my mind. You can use it with or without the cord. It holds a charge for over a week. I like how the head is part of the body so cleaning is easier just by flipping it open. Works great at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Been using this for several months and it seems to do the job reasonably well. I haven&#x27;t decided whether I like the way you clean it on not?  It&#x27;s not as easy as older models</li>
            <li> My last few cordless shavers have been Norelco brand and I&#x27;ve been satisfied with the ability of the blades to give me a smooth shave. The blades would last around 12-18 months. The blades on this shaver have gotten somewhat dull after only a few months. Kind of disappointing. I&#x27;m wondering if somebody did a cost reduction on the materials of construction.</li>
            <li> Certainly worth the $40 price. Comes with no protective case/ pouch,  and shaves moderately close,  but does the day to day job well. I like it!</li>
            <li> It is quiet, lightweight, and does a good job. I like the long interval between battery charges. It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is a great electric razor. It provides a comfortable and pretty close shave. I&#x27;m still on the first charge and it&#x27;s almost been two weeks so the battery life is really good as well.</li>
            <li> Shaves a little closer than my old Braun (which I had to abandon after 12 years due to the unavailability of foil/cutter assemblies). Much quieter, too. The battery seems to hold a decent charge; I get 9-10 good shaves between plugins. Early days, though: how well will the battery be doing six months from now? I have seen reviewers complaining about the lack of a stand for shavers of this style. To me, the lack of a stand is a plus (I don&#x27;t have a lot of room). I especially like the wash-to-clean feature; it&#x27;s a lot better than trying to brush stubble fragments out of the mechanism. Another reviewer of a similar product offered a caution which bears repeating: leave the unit open (both the head and the sideburn trimmer) after washing to let it dry thoroughly. If you close it up too soon, it&#x27;ll start to stink. On the basis of satisfaction per dollar, this product scores high for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an everyday use washable shaver with a not so effective trimmer. Good for its pricing but not a top notch shaver.</li>
            <li> I had purchased Norelco Razor many times before, and always have been satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent deal from Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must Buy Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> best shaver ive ever had, comfy and smooth</li>
            <li> My husband is very happy with his new razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Phillips/Norelco Speed XL for over 10 years. When I went on Amazon to get replacement blades, I saw this model on sale for $30 which was the same price as replacement blades for my more expensive ($150) old razor. I ordered the new razor for backup and to see how technology had come around in over 10 years. I was disappointed in my first use as the razor didn&#x27;t glide as smoothly on my skin compared to my old one, but the shave was really close compared to my old razor blades. It has a rubbery surface causing friction compared to the all metal one on my old razor. Not being happy with my purchase, I decided to read the instruction manual... To my surprise, they mention that it might take a few shaves to get your skin accustomed and if you&#x27;re not happy after 3 weeks, you can return the razor for full refund. So I stuck to it and after 5 days, I hardly noticed the difference with the old but better razor. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase, it&#x27;s an unbelievable price performer for a rechargeable razor (i&#x27;m over a dozen shaves without recharging) you can clean with water and the shave is the best.</li>
            <li> Does a good job, except for the neck area.</li>
            <li> Good razor for the price. Second purchase of this razor, the 1st razor stopped working..ordered another.  Discovered  heads on 1st razor were clogged underneath.  Ran heads under hot water with top open, added couple of drops of hand soap, used brush to help remove clog and to dissolve body oils and to remove any remaining hair. Voila!&lt;br /&gt;Works like brand new. Highly recommend using water to clean.  Now my husband has 2 dependable razors.</li>
            <li> very good razor easy to use and reuse when you are in a hurry very close shave</li>
            <li> I typically shave with a regular razor and shaving cream. I got this and expected to use it about 50% of the time because I thought it would be a convenient time saver. It works okay. It gets the job done but it&#x27;s not the best shave, and it&#x27;s really not much faster. I guess I&#x27;m moderately satisfied with this product, and only slightly disappointed. It&#x27;s probably good when it comes to electric razors, and the battery does last a long time.</li>
            <li> Good value for money .&lt;br /&gt;Good things like the price and performance .&lt;br /&gt;Low price good performance.&lt;br /&gt;Good value for money .&lt;br /&gt;Good things like the price and performance .&lt;br /&gt;Low price good performance.</li>
            <li> The best razor I&#x27;ve ever had. Also I got a great deal on the purchase. I would do it again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son. He likes it; says it works well and is easy to clean. My husband tried it and didn&#x27;t care for it; didn&#x27;t think it cut closely enough but he&#x27;s been using a straight razor for years so I doubt anything would cut as close as that. It&#x27;s quiet and keeps a charge for a long time. Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s great! Bought it for my husband for Fathers day and though he never really get&#x27;s excited about much he does use it every day and hasn&#x27;t complained. So a thumbs up for this product. The delivery was fast and packaging was great!</li>
            <li> Bought at walmart for $25, came with nose hair trimmer. Gave me mild irritation, shave is as close as when i shave with a razor. Expect to go over same spot multiple times to cut hairs(possibly in different directions), mirror is an absolute necessity when using this. Hairs seemed to be for the most part collected in the shaver head. Relatively noisy, pivots to contours of face nicely, no spots i was unable to get. will update on reliability.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good looking but it doesn&#x27;t provide a close shave.  Perhaps more expensive shavers provide a better experience.  Overall, it&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li> Betteer than anticipated and an excellent buy for the money. Very pleased with the purchase</li>
            <li> It arrived on time. It is very quiet. Now while shaving I can actually hear my wife when she talking.</li>
            <li> Norelco is the only razor my husband will use.  This was on sale at the time I purchased it which always helps.  Has been working great for him.  He has a very heavy beard and shaves daily (except on an occasional Saturday).  Thanks</li>
            <li> For the price it is very nice. If I used it every day I would recommend you buy a better Razor. But for occasional use it I&#x27;d fine</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a similar product which had died. It is a very good replacemnt for the original.</li>
            <li> The electric shavers good quality, origin of the Netherlands, arrived quickly, but the packaging is simple commodity intact, have been charged to use, my husband is very satisfied. Amazon offers so thanks to the quality of goods we use, thank you!</li>
            <li> What a great razor!  Got it for my dad in nursing home.  I give him a nice, close shave without cutting him.  Was so nervous about giving him a shave and this razor is a Godsend!</li>
            <li> This shaver exceeded my expectations, It quiet and gives a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Awesome electric razor.  Battery life is my favorite part of this razor, I only charge mine every 2 or 3 weeks, it lasts a very long time.  Gives a close shave and the price was low.</li>
            <li> Given as a gift for Christmas. He says it is excellent.</li>
            <li> I only buy this type of Norelco razor.  Tip: Buy the cheapest model and throw it away when the blades get dull.  You can buy a new razor for less than the cost of new blades and a battery.</li>
            <li> Good for the price and husband satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my old Norelco. I love it.</li>
            <li> Light and easy to pack, this razor gives a close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Great razor for the price.  Christmas gift for my teenager.  He&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Very happy husband bought this for xmas gift amozen very good company thanks</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get every single hair. So you have to go over it more than once. But it is smooth and comfortable.  The battery life is decent and it slows down when its on low battery so its obvious enough. Its a nice price for what you get.</li>
            <li> works great.On the first full charge i received 7 full shaves before the time to charge light came on.The shave was really close,better than expected.I would recommend this shaver to anyone.The price was right and amazon sent the shaver in a couple of days.Very pleased with both razor and time to receive it.</li>
            <li> Great shaver.  I tried several Norelco shavers in the past, including the old 8000 and 9000 series and the subsequent 3D-headed shavers (without the integrated trimmer).  Of those, I liked the 9000 series most.  But once I started buying replacement heads more recently, I found that they are no good, nowhere close to the quality of the original heads.  The poor quality of Norelco&#x27;s replacement heads seems to be a part of their business model.  So I ended up with a couple of formerly high-end shavers that I only can equip with terrible replacement heads.  Norelco essentially forced me to give up on my favorite model (9195XL) and buy a new unit.  Disappointed, I considered abandoning Norelco altogether, but I do like their rotary shavers.  I figured that if, from now on, I am going to need to buy a new shaver every couple of years, I&#x27;d try this basic model.  I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised.  This shaver works very nicely, much better than my 9195 with brand-new replacement heads.  The price also is more than fair.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My husband loves having it.  It cleans up easily; provides a good clean shave; holds the charge; and compact too.</li>
            <li> Meets all my expectations for this electric razor. Love that you clean with running hot water. Best shave ever and I have owned many electric razors through the years.</li>
            <li> This razor gives me the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve had in a long time. I am completely happy with it. I like the side burn shaver, too. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving since I was 17. And this is pretty much the same razor I used when I was in the hospital having my spine rebuilt in 1968. So, when my old one died about 2 years ago, I just became patient and waited until I could afford to get another one. It shaves close and is comfortable. Plus, it cleans up easily and lasts just about forever. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Works great, I shave my head with this and it&#x27;s a very clean smooth shave. I charge usually once a week.</li>
            <li> A replacement for a project</li>
            <li> But this one is effective and light weight (yeah who cares about weight) so it must be modern materials like space craft.</li>
            <li> Razor was fine and I give it a 5 star rating and I also saved a lot of money</li>
            <li> Shaves well. The run time is a little short.</li>
            <li> So, i am pretty picky about electric shavers. When I find one that works, I keep it for years. The model that this one replaced, I had for 10 years. I tried one of those fancy &amp;#34;self cleaning&amp;#34; &amp;#34;digital&amp;#34; ones, and they were terrible, in fact, I have no idea how they can sell them for $200 when they work worse than this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is by FAR the most efficient shaver for me. I would recommenced it to anyone considering a switch</li>
            <li> Does not cut very close and therefore the shaver has to be used almost twice a day.</li>
            <li> Very good , I still can&#x27;t figure l got in  prime account? I don&#x27;t recall been asked.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my father as a gift and he is well pleased with it!  And my dad is PICKY!! So this is no easy feat.  I&#x27;m impressed with most anything Phillips has to do with lately.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I have used ,I really like that you can rinse it under hot water to clean it .</li>
            <li> Not a very close shave</li>
            <li> ....inexpensive, uncomplicated, and provides a very close, comfortable shave, without irritating my sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;Had a Remington shaver before this, and was not satisfied with the way it shaved. It quit totally on me after about a month, so I bought the Philips Norelco instead.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing that could be better would be if it had a spring corded charger. The cord supplied with the charger is stiff and hard to manage. But that is a small inconvenience for an otherwise great rotary shaver. Highly recommended, let you know how it holds up longterm.</li>
            <li> I have returned this Item stuff just kept falling out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift for my father, have not used, it is packed very well.&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommended and I will come here again.</li>
            <li> shaver works as advertised,  I would recomend it to anyone looking for a inexpensive elec. shaver</li>
            <li> best electric shaver i;ve used</li>
            <li> Very nice Electric razor,  shaves very close good clean shave , fast shipping</li>
            <li> fast shipping / great price/ every thing as expected!</li>
            <li> It holds its charge for a decent time frame.&lt;br /&gt;The cut however leaves me feel like I still need a closer shave.....I&#x27;ve used it for quite some time now continuously like they suggest.</li>
            <li> Very good, bought for my father, he like it.</li>
            <li> This razor gives my husband a nice close shave. He has no complaints.</li>
            <li> Great price, delivery and product! I&#x27;ve owned 4 Norelco triple headers over the past 30 years and they are just great to shave with.</li>
            <li> PROS: Gives a decent, close shave, but you have to be careful using it. If you push it to your face to hard, it WILL scratch you! Ask me how I know! Just back off the pressure a bit and go back over the same areas for a clean shave. The battery last a long time. At least a week or more in my case. No big deal to recharge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; CONS: Feels very underpowered. Rotors spin real slow IMHO. Feels like when a battery is running down and the device is running out of power. It would be great if Philips up the Voltage to the motor to increase the rotor&#x27;s RPMs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The little green LED to signal Charging burned out on my razor after a couple weeks. I have no idea if it&#x27;s Charging or not now.</li>
            <li> Perfect razor, if I had a complaint I suppose it would be that what you see is what you get, razor and a cord, no stand.  But I like it and it does the job well.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a random gift for my boyfriend, hoping that he would like it. I haven&#x27;t heard anything bad about it! It does a great job and I love how quiet it is.</li>
            <li> Great shaver works well</li>
            <li> THE RAZOR IS WELL WORTH $34.95</li>
            <li> Fastest way to shave when you gotta go somewhere quick. Also great that I don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream. And the trimmer....takes care of other things. Best investment I&#x27;ve made in a while.</li>
            <li> j am not happy wlth thjs razor. it is not giving me a clean shave i dont want to go through the trouble to re furn it</li>
            <li> Got this because I needed a new razor and it was on sale with a coupon.  It has met all of my needs. Has decent battery power; I get almost 2 weeks out of each charge and teh shave has remained reasonable.</li>
            <li> I bought this new shaver to replace my old Philips Norelco that I had for many years, it finally gave up working, The new shaver works great, I love it.</li>
            <li> Great razor and got it here for only 39.99.</li>
            <li> My hubby is very pleased with this purchase.  Recently had to shave his beard for his C-pap machine.  Very surprised by how close a shave he can get.  Best ever with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Best shave I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li> Great gift to my professor.</li>
            <li> It is doing a very good job</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s excellent.  Tells you when it is going to need a chage, so you never run out of battery.  Good shave.</li>
            <li> my old norelco 10 yrs old shaved a little better but i replaced batterys 4 times. i like the lipo batts. more lets see how long they last.</li>
            <li> I tried, following the instructions for adapting from a blade to electric, but after I got razor burn 3 times, I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth it. Sent it back.</li>
            <li> Second one- just great. TKS</li>
            <li> Perfect.It  has  reached  my  expection.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful shaver! And the battery life is quite long, too.</li>
            <li> Nice shaver for the money.  Good value.  Perhaps there are others more powerful but this one is very good and does the job and costs quite a bit less.</li>
            <li> Good quality razor for my son. Rinsable</li>
            <li> perfect what I expect from Norelco</li>
            <li> This item was everything I expected in a razor.  An extremely smooth shave that lasts all day.  This razor cuts quickly and no drag.  Easy to hold in your hand...recharges quickly and stays charged up to three weeks.  I would highly recommend this razor to anyone wanting a clean shave at a low price.</li>
            <li> I have shaved four times and still on first charge. Works great, no problems!! Great Price!!!</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new razor - He has had electric shavers before that were not as comfortable and efficient as this Philips Norelco.  So we are very happy with his Father&#x27;s Day gift.</li>
            <li> For the price, I believe this product deserves five stars. It does everything it said it would do. It rinsed out well and trimer worked great. Because my husband normally like to use a disposable razor, I didn&#x27;t feel the need to pay a hundred plus dollars for one. So if he&#x27;s in a hurry, a few passes with this and he&#x27;s out the door. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Husband loves his razor!</li>
            <li> Gives a nice close shave. Just seems to work better with each use.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and sharp</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very experienced with electric shavers, but this one does the job and holds a charge in times of no use.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. Does not shave well. I own a different model of Philips Norelco that shave well, this one does not perform up to Norelco standard.</li>
            <li> I was an avid Norelco customer. I am returning this one. It&#x27;s cheap, it feels like I haven&#x27;t shaved with it no matter how hard I press!</li>
            <li> It was given as a gift to my husband. He travels to different states, islands, &amp; countries for work. So every job he goes to is different and at some jobs they require him to shave, so it so happened that he had to shave the following day &amp; he really liked it &amp; says it works really good.</li>
            <li> everything I thought it would be.  My grandson loves it and uses it daily.  It is saver and cleaner than using a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Very much, easy to use, frequency of use after charging too much, do not waste electricity, I feel very comfortable, reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of rechargeables but is nice not fighting plug-in wire.  So far, really is a good shaver and better than expected.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> the norelcoPT724/41 is really good and well worth the money. Great price, free shipping.  The product is really good, i have had norelco for about 20 yrs.  Has plenty of cordless power and takes about 6-8 hours to initially totally power-up.  I would definitely recommend this product to family and friends.  I do think if you have a really heavy, heavy beard, you might want to consider a different unit.</li>
            <li> Husband likes this one a lot! Replaced his old one, and he is happy.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco for several years. This latest model is great.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver, works as its supposed to and very reliable.</li>
            <li> It is very good, I like a lot, the shaver does not make noise, is fast, I recommend it hundred percent.</li>
            <li> long battery duration. it&#x27;s been 1.5 month i&#x27;m using this, and it works great</li>
            <li> I am a female and got to to shave my legs as I thought it would work with my hair which is NOT so condense and thick. I wonder why this product has 4.5/5 stars. I have had a Philips shaver before and it worked very well for me. This one irritates the skin and my skin was all red and itchy after the shave. it feels like there is no protection on the blades and it is directly in touch with the skin. I even did not put pressure on it or pressed it on my skin. will return it to amazon. I even could not finish shaving for the first time.</li>
            <li> I would like to see more moving parts with a stronger motor.  The price is a little high for the quality but it works well. I will upgrade to a better product next time.</li>
            <li> Not a close shave and irritates my neck. What a stupid invention. Switched to safety razor with proper shaving soap and brush and it hurts much less afterwards, no red bumps, and closer shaves. It&#x27;s a no brainer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Norelco rotary head razors for awhile.  This is yet another version which performs well and is affordable.  It is noticably quieter than other razors.  It gives me a smooth shave and has an attached trimmer that works fine for sideburns, etc.  The head is fully washable--I wash it under the sink about once a week.  The razor holds a change without a problem.  Not much else to say, there are so many different razor models out there, but this one is above average.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working fine for my Dad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this kind of razor before but tried a foil razor last time. Going back to this now has been a tremendous surprise.  Smooth,  fast, and quiet. After a month plus, best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 2 months and it gives me a close shave, maybe not razor close, but smooth enough for me without the hassle of shaving daily. I dont feel and pulling and have no skin irritation from this product. I have zero complaints, thus a 5 star rating. This is my second electric, this one much better than the first. The convienence of the electric, quality, and price have me never going back to razors again.</li>
            <li> My first shaver was a Philips Norelco and I&#x27;ve had it for maybe 8 years now, still works but doesn&#x27;t hold a charge so I got this one. It feels very familiar, lighter, better charging cable. Norelco has always been easy on my sensitive skin, way less irritated then a different brand I tried. Recommend.</li>
            <li> I got this shaver for my 82 year old father who was determined he would not like it. He not only likes it but he keeps it by his chair so he can use it anytime he is watching tv. I would say this was a very good purchase!!</li>
            <li> Motor sounds weak compared to the last one I had. Seems to hold a charge well; but does not do a good job to cut &amp;#34;thick, full&amp;#34; beard. Requires several passes to get that &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; shave feel.</li>
            <li> performed better than expected ...I am perfectly satisfied.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for an old one of the same that broke after 30 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought three of these now as gifts.  They are reliable, easy to use, and perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Nice razor. I decided to stay away from the least expensive model and buy this, the next up in the line. I&#x27;m glad I did. The razor replaces an older Norelco, so I already knew what to expect. No disappointments here. The shave is close, confortable, and fast. The razor is well constructed, and I expect to be using it for several years.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement unit for by old Philips shaver that was broken and needed new heads. At the price a great unit that give a close shave. I have used Philips shavers for years now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok shaver but the shaver heads are of the older variety. I had am older shaver with upgraded heads and replaced the new ones with the better quality using the new cutters and that did the trick</li>
            <li> The best shaver for $50 money can buy. My third one over the past decade. Superior design. Rinses in water so never gets dirty. Buy it.</li>
            <li> Best razor i&#x27;ve ever had. Better than expected.</li>
            <li> Express is very powerful, DHL need only three days arrived in China.  The product cheaper than buying more than $30 in China. The host is imported, the charger is Chinese manufacturing. I have been using Philips, more trust the quality.</li>
            <li> Broke after few use. But it worked great  when it  was working</li>
            <li> Blades dull quickly showing low quality.</li>
            <li> Amazing. I had used a different leading brand for many years. But shaving got to be such a chore, and not really very comfortable. After reading the good reviews on this shaver, I decided to try it. It feels so smooth on my face, yet it really shaves. It&#x27;s quiet and comfortable. It leaves my face smooth with less pressure, compared to brand B. I really like it. The flip out trimmer could work a little better, but all in all, it&#x27;s great. One reviewer noted how it&#x27;s a lot of plastic. It is. I wouldn&#x27;t want to drop it. But it was a very good price and does a great job. What more could you want?</li>
            <li> My Grandpa loves it, he uses it all the time</li>
            <li> Runs very slowly - spite giving it a 24 hr charge.  Also bought battery operated - 2 AAs - that runs much faster and is OK.  The big one may be - this particular one has some defect ?  Have bought Phillips or Norelco products over the past 40 years - have always been happy with them.</li>
            <li> Shipped great, was exactly as discribed and for the money was an excellent choice. Works very well and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had and used this razor about 2-3 weeks now, and I really like it. Good battery life, sharp blades, good shave, good value for the money. Of course it&#x27;s still new, but that&#x27;s it for now.  I would like to see more things made in America though. Sadly,this razor is not.</li>
            <li> Standard basic razor that works well. Charges quickly and runs all week on a single charge.  Can&#x27;t beat it for the price and much better than the previous model from about 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> Norelco keeps changing its models from year to year, but they are basically the same.  And they work well for me.  I buy a new razor rather than buy replacement blades - only costs a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> the recipient is very happy with this razor! Met all of his expectations and has no negative remarks regarding razor.</li>
            <li> My husband has wanted a new electric razor for a few years.  He was/is thrilled with this particular one.  Walks around the bedroom while he is shaving!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and wash. It is quiet and will not wake my roommates up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;The price is fair,</li>
            <li> Bought for a Christmas gift.  He really likes it and I would recommend it someone shopping for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Never had a cleaner shave. Never going back to old razors again</li>
            <li> This is the third Norelco electric razor I have had.  Cutting is excellent as always, Battery seems to hold charge longer than&lt;br /&gt;previous models.  That is very useful when traveling.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well. But it&#x27;s obviously the lass expensive of this line.  I have to go over my face several times to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son (15 years old) for Christmas. I took a chance because I didn&#x27;t really know if he would like it or not. He said he really likes it because it shaves him without breaking his face out. He was on accutane for six months so that&#x27;s a big deal to him. Great quality and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> Barely a three star item, but it does get the job done at a value. Flimsy and not of the quality this brand has come to represent.</li>
            <li> Great shave, improvement over my previous Norelco Rotary shaver. Happy with price &amp; service.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my 9160XL that, after years of service, broke a part for which I could not find a replacement.  The PT724 is a basic solid shaver in the Norelco tradition.  It includes the important washable feature but is minus a couple degrees of freedom in the head mounting that I always thought were of questionable value and don&#x27;t miss at all.  The only problem is that the heads were not giving me the same close shave I was used to from the 9160, but it turned out that the HQ9 heads I&#x27;d bought for the old model fit the new one.  Once the heads were swapped in, the usual closeness was back.  If you already have the better heads then this model is a great bargain.  If not, then factor in the worthwhile upgrade in the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, fair price and good delivery!</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my husband but it did not work as well as we would have liked. It left patches and not to mention it irritated his skin very bad. He does have sensitive skin so maybe that is a factor that lead to the irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Timely shipping, good shaver.im happy</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift to my husband. He has no complaints of performance. flip up trimmer at the back.  rechargeable, and it does seems to hold a charge for quite a few shaves.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had many electric razors, but this one works great and gives a clean shave.  The battery lasts for 15-20 shaves, so it&#x27;s a nice upgrade from my last one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 14 year old son and he loves it! He is in the acne stage of his life and this works out better for him than a razor. I bought one for my husband as well and he uses it on his whole head and face.</li>
            <li> Does a good job, especially when I haven&#x27;t shaved or a couple of days. A good choice for the money.</li>
            <li> Does not shave closely.</li>
            <li> Very good.&lt;br /&gt;Does a excellent job.</li>
            <li> Better than I thought.</li>
            <li> very nice for regular shaving.....</li>
            <li> It started. The peach fuzz. The dirty little smear that&#x27;s on top of his lip. It took him a while to realize that it was facial hair. Lol! It&#x27;s a great product and I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints.</li>
            <li> works ok , If I had it to do over I would spend a little more to get the better model</li>
            <li> My older Philips shaver needed new cutters, however this was on sale and cost me $10 more than a new set of cutters.  Shaves well but then again there are times when I get out the cream and blade.  Let&#x27;s face it, shaving (manual or electric) is a personal thing, so give it a try if you use electric razor.</li>
            <li> I do not speak English, but this good. Thank you</li>
            <li> Great for the price, with the added bonus of a liithium battery which hoipefully will last a long time. The heads and blades seem to me a bit slower and effective compared to the previous Norelco tgat I owned.</li>
            <li> but not necessarily thorough - this is a good first electric razor for someone frightened of skinning themselves in the process.  Philips is a Japanese company in case you are trying to buy American as much as possible.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a real winner.  Close shave, long charge.  I have had several Norelco shavers and this is of equal quality to those, which is quite high in my opinion.  Has a good feel in hand and gets job done quickly. Once you know your needs for features, you can buy this one with confidence.</li>
            <li> A nice step up from my old 7310 which I like a lot.  That was one of the cheapest models in the lineup at the time.  At the time I had just changed over from  a very good Braun that I had used for a number of years.  Aside from the charging I liked the Norelco much better. The Braun vibrates so much and while it gave a good shave for a while the head lost its edge after maybe 3 months. Even though I have fairly full hair growth I&#x27;d often go a day or sometimes two without a shave.  The Norelco handles the extra days of stubble much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that brings me to this model. I&#x27;ve had my previous Norelco for over a year now and the head is starting to show its age.  So I was contemplating buying a new head but this model also has an improved charging system so it just seemed to make sense to go with this one. The charging system uses a lithium ion battery so I&#x27;m less concerned with it dying prematurely.  And this model gives you a visible warning when there are still a few charges left.  I thought I could live without that, but I like the visible notification.  And since its lithium ion I&#x27;m not overly concerned now with charging before the the battery is drained.  Lithium ion doesn&#x27;t have memory like the other battery and won&#x27;t lose it capacity if charged when not fully drained.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving. Here&#x27;s what a typical shave looks like for me (I have a goatee, so bear that in mind), with one of those multi-bladed razors and foam from a can:&lt;br /&gt;1. Run the faucet water until the water is hot.&lt;br /&gt;2. Get a couple of hands full of water and splash my face to get it wet for the foam and to open the pores for closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;3. Pull the lever on the back of the faucet to close the stopper and let the hot water collect in the basin.&lt;br /&gt;4. Turn off the water and put the razor in the water so the blades and the anti-cut glide-strip get prepped.&lt;br /&gt;5. Put foam on my face and start shaving, rinsing the razor out in the hot water in the basin after every few swipes.&lt;br /&gt;6. After a few passes of rinsing the razor in the water, it gets gunked up so drain that out and fill-up again with fresh hot water. Repeat this a couple of times depending on how long its&#x27; been since last shave (so there&#x27;s more gunk to be cleared away).&lt;br /&gt;7. Finish up with shaving, drain the basin, rinse off razor and put it away.&lt;br /&gt;8. Run the water again and get some more hands full of water to the face to rinse off leftover foam.&lt;br /&gt;9. Get a towel, pat dry and apply some aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;10. Done.&lt;br /&gt;Overall time...Up to 15minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now here&#x27;s what it looks like with this new Powertouch Electric:&lt;br /&gt;1. Run the faucet water just until it&#x27;s hot.&lt;br /&gt;2. While the water is running, start dry shaving with the electric.&lt;br /&gt;3. By the time the water is hot (a minute or 2) I&#x27;m already close to done, going back over the under-chin and neck areas and pulling the skin tighter in the cheek areas for closer shave. Turn off the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;4. About another minute later and I&#x27;m done shaving.&lt;br /&gt;5. Pop the spring-hinged head of the razor open to expose the inside of the razor and the leftover shaved hair. Turn the hot water on and rinse out the razor. Set it aside to air dry.&lt;br /&gt;6. Done (sometimes I&#x27;ll put on some aftershave, but it&#x27;s optional).&lt;br /&gt;Overall time...Less than 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other advantages with the Electric:&lt;br /&gt;* Dry shaving with the electric means it can be done anywhere, no water or shaving foam/soap required&lt;br /&gt;* You can shave with an electric while wearing your full business attire or Sunday best or whatever clothes you don&#x27;t want to mess up, without worrying about getting water or foam or blood on it from regular shaving.&lt;br /&gt;* No nicks or cuts with electric.&lt;br /&gt;* The no-prep and no-mess of Electric means any last minute social or business situation that comes up, you can still have a clean looking face before having to run out...Try that with a regular shaver and not end up looking like Wolverine attacked your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some SPECIFIC advantages with this Powertouch Electric:&lt;br /&gt;* Uses Litium-Ion battery. No memory effect and a full charge lasts for about 45minutes of shaving time.&lt;br /&gt;* Can be used corded, for continuous power.&lt;br /&gt;* The \\&quot;Flex&amp;Float\\&quot; shaving heads do an excellent job of fitting the contours of your face for a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;* Easy to see and understand LED indicators. Flashes green when charging, solid green when done. Flashes orange when the battery is low.&lt;br /&gt;* Very light weight&lt;br /&gt;* Very quiet operation&lt;br /&gt;* Replacement heads (only needed once a year) about 25 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;* Cleaning is an absolute cinch. The razor head is on a spring-hinged pivot with a small button on the front. Click the button and the head pops open. Then you just run hot water in and around the chambers and through the razor head to clean it all out. Then just set it aside to air dry and no worries about built up gunk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair the downsides of Electric:&lt;br /&gt;* While the quality of an electric shave is at least \\&quot;business-ready\\&quot;, it&#x27;s not as close as you&#x27;d get with a standard razor.&lt;br /&gt;* For someone new to electric shaving, it can take up to 3 weeks for your skin to adjust to it. Even though the skin looks shaven, you can expect it to feel like rough goosebumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And SPECIFIC downsides of this Powertouch Electric:&lt;br /&gt;* 8 hours to charge for 45min of cordless shaving. But there&#x27;s an orange LED that blinks to warn you when the charge is getting low and this shaver can be used corded too, so it&#x27;s a very small downside.&lt;br /&gt;* The heft and feel of this razor is light and platic-y, which can tend to make me question the quality of the parts and hence the longevity before having to replace it. But thusfar it is working wonderfully and I imagine having the plastic is what makes it water-proof for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All said and done, for the price and getting something that works very well and is super easy to clean and maintain, I like this razor very much and wholeheartedly recommend it.umps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And SPECIFIC downsides of this Powertouch Electric:&lt;br /&gt;* 8 hours to charge for 45min of cordless shaving.

            <li> This is a good value cordless razor from Philips. It&#x27;s better than the Braun that I am replacing, but not quite as good as the $80-$100 models out there. I&#x27;m pretty tough on razors though since I have a beard to trim around. This razor does a fair job of trimming, but on my neck, it&#x27;s not as close of a shave as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, if you&#x27;re shaving your face and not trimming around a beard, I feel this would be easier to use. The three blade setup is nicer than the long blade kind that a few other electric razors use. It&#x27;s comfortable and easy to use. It holds a charge a decent while as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this if you are in the market for a $50 cordless electric razor. Otherwise get the Norelco AquaTec ($70-$90). It&#x27;s a little better and can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> Really good product, the first days you will have some iirritation, but after all ok. The shaver have an excellent battery.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price! Provides a nice close shave and fits comfortably to my hand - not heavy or bulky.</li>
            <li> So far this is the item I was looking for-I use it everyday and liking it more and more! Like the trimmer too.</li>
            <li> A motor is really weak and it takes so long time to shave my beard. Do NOT buy this. It&#x27;s waste of your money.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have much good to say about this razor.  It rips the hair from your face and feels worse than dry-shaving your face with a $0.50 motel razor.  I&#x27;ve never had an electric razor irritate my face the way this one does; stay away and actually spend the money to get something that will give you a nice, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> this is a good, but not great razor. It&#x27;s quiet, and smooth, but it doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as some I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> Good value. Does not hold its charge like expensive models of shavers.&lt;br /&gt;Heavier or thicker beards can order another blade set, but for me that hasn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;been necessary. Gives me a close shave.</li>
            <li> I have had a Norelco 7 series for a long time. Didn&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot of money.I was worried that i&#x27;d make a bad decision.So I purchased this after reading many reviews and am extremely happy with this shaver. Shaves my face So fast (takes me half the time as my older one) and I&#x27;m so glad i finally bought this new electric shaver. Much closer shave than what i was used to... Would Highly recommend this!!!!</li>
            <li> About 80 percent as close as Gillette&#x27;s PROGLIDE product, which is as close a shave as you will find. I use  the Norelco when I&#x27;m in a hurry.  Very satisfied and find I use the Norelco more and more. Good shave in about two minutes.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco that died after many years.  It was heavy and ran with a powerful motor.  This one is light and you hardly know its on.  I guess it is OK but not real impressed.  The ad talked about the blades wearing out.  Not something the other ever did.  Makes me think of one of those things from year ago that used to shave fuzz balls off clothers.</li>
            <li> It Was a gift to my husband and he love&#x27;s it</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift. He really liked ir</li>
            <li> Good Value!  Worked well and much better than my old worn out Norelco.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my 20 year old son and his first electric shaver. I wanted him to have a nice product for his first electric shaver but didn&#x27;t want to break the bank just in case an electric razor wasn&#x27;t his thing. He has done nothing but rave about this Norelco Shaver since he received it, loves the features, so I&#x27;d have to say for price and product it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> enjoy it best way to shave</li>
            <li> works well..  got more than we expected for an inexpensive price..</li>
            <li> This does an excellent job for me.  I get more than a week on a charge, and it works close without causing ingrown hair issues.  I really like the quiet of the rotary motor compared to reed motors.</li>
            <li> Runs very quietly.  Shaves great.  Only needs charged about every five days.  5 stars</li>
            <li> This shaver does not seem to be working right.  I don&#x27;t know if it is not charging right or what. But I throw package away right after I receive it so I don&#x27;t think I can send Back. It is a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Shaving was great.  I was happy with all aspects of the saver</li>
            <li> I have been using my new shaver for a few weeks now.  I am very satisfied with this purchase as my Norelco shaver works great and was priced at a bargain cost.</li>
            <li> Great!  My husband loves this!  He has a heavy beard and sensitive skin and has no problem with getting a close shave without irritation.</li>
            <li> Have always used Norelco. Good shave always</li>
            <li> Works really well. Charge lasts for several weeks. I have used Norelco shavers for many years and they have also been very reliable. Low cost, shaves well, well made for the price. My two sons and I use Norelco shavers.</li>
            <li> Great Product! My boyfriend loves it!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandson. His stubble is getting thick now and this works great. We tried foil shavers and they did absolutely nothing. So we went right back to this. Actually it looks almost exactly like his last one. He started his first shaving with a Phillips Norelco rotary and now several years later this kind is still the best. One thing I learned, with the help of my son, is that when these get dull I just throw it out and buy a new shaver. New blades cost almost as much as an entire new shaver, so he not only has sharp blades, but also a new motor. I tried other kinds and he said they don&#x27;t work like this, so next time, maybe in another 5 years, we will buy another exactly like this.</li>
            <li> It is an easy to use shaver. I have a lot of hair on my face and it grows fast but the shaver does a fairly good job. However I have to use a razor at the end for some difficult parts but I think this is common with electric shavers... and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical of the high ratings on this razor, but I&#x27;ve always preferred Norelcos over other brands so I decided to try this one. The 724 has a sturdy, if plastic, feel and heft. The unit cuts smoothly and uniformly despite other reviews that claim the two stage screens cut even better. I have a  set from my old unit and the new set cuts better than the fancier screens. The best part is that the lithium ion batteries are lasting longer per charge than the older batteries, and shouldn&#x27;t suffer from the charge memory that killed the batteries after a year or so use. Great razor, glad I got it to replace my older unit.&lt;br /&gt;Norelco...make your batteries REPLACEABLE, your razors will last for years if you do. Or is that your fear?</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco user all of my adult life and when the battery would not charge anymore, I had to look for another one and got the Philips Norelco PT724/41 Powertouch Electric Razor.  It is,  by far, the best one I have used yet - such a close shave, it is quiet and runs on battery or power.  Cleaning is the easiest ever and the shave head really removes the whiskers.Cleaning is a breeze.  The very modern design and the way it fits the hand is a plus for the talented people who designed it.  You will soon be a very proud and happy owner if you select this one and the PRICE IS RIGHT!  Keep up your great work, Norelco!  All the new Norelco models look super efficient and I am sure the review will be the same no matter which model you select.</li>
            <li> I use this to take off up to a 2 or 3 day growth. Any longer and it won&#x27;t be a close trim. Not as close a cut as with a razor, but much quicker and nearly as good. If I have a 5-6 day mess I use it as a prep for the razor, and it makes it very easy to shave the long growth.</li>
            <li> Purchased this razor from Amazon after seeing a competing razor on a Best Buy Daily Deal -- am very satisfied with this razor.  Clean cut, easy on the face, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;This razor has a pop-up side burn trimmer - the one advertised on that &amp;#34;Daily Deal&amp;#34; did not.  And the price was the same.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed and I think you will be as well.</li>
            <li> Great shaver! Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My father said it works great, THANKS</li>
            <li> Great Value, good shaver</li>
            <li> does not shave very closely. somewhat effective, especially considering the price. Worth a few more bucks to get a more effective shaver.</li>
            <li> I may have only needed new blades in my old razor, but this new one shaves much closer.</li>
            <li> My husband is very satisfied with his new Norelco shaver.  We had to prevent bleeding from a regular razor blade shaver and we&lt;br /&gt;went to this one.  He loves it.</li>
            <li> A good clean shave in a short period of time, and recharges fully in a few hours. I&#x27;d recommend and buy another when this quits.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver!  After years of using a foil, I decided to try a triple head shaver again, (not used one in 30 years).  I&#x27;m sold!  It&#x27;s light weight, easy to use and clean, and gets hair on my neck that my old Braun foil did not get easily.  An excellent buy!</li>
            <li> Very happy with it.  Never had an electric razor before, so I was skeptical.  This dude is great.  Norelco still stands for quality.</li>
            <li> A pretty good little electric razor does the job but it really could use bit just a little more power</li>
            <li> BECAUSE IT IS A NORELCO. WELL KNOWN TO BE THE BEST ELECTRIC RAZOR.&lt;br /&gt;I LIKE THE CLOSENESS OF THE SHAVE, THE EASE OF CLEANING, AND THE CONVIENENCE OF THE SHAVE. I AM 80 YEARS OLD AND DUE TO HEALTH ISSUES I CAN NOT STAND VERY LONG, AND THIS RAZOR ALLOWS ME TO SIT AND STILL GET A NICE CLOSE SHAVE. THANK YOU.&lt;br /&gt;  BOB PETERS</li>
            <li> An old but very practical shaver. I can shave in 2 minutes using it.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Very quiet. Easy to clean. Phillips can make it even better if they can design it to use standard charger, like USB or micro USB.</li>
            <li> Good shave for the money</li>
            <li> Does exactly was is expected and good value for the money... really like the indicator that the cutting heads need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive shaver.  Does the job.  Haven&#x27;t used a razor since.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband for Valentines day, he is very happy with it, he has sensetive skin and noe he can shave every other day instead of 2 days in between.</li>
            <li> Hard to use or I&#x27;m not used to the way the plates are placed.</li>
            <li> Works great. Good price.</li>
            <li> Very quiet. The only downside is slight pulling on whiskers when the razor is moved too fast, not allowing for the blades to fully cut. The rotary action works much better than other vibratory razors I have used.</li>
            <li> Works just as advertised, and the lithium batteries are a special pleasure.  Holds a charge for days on end (I have a light beard, so YMMV...), and gives as good a shave as one can expect with an electric.</li>
            <li> Okay for the price. clean shave. Would recommend to anyone looking for a low price electric razor name brand also.</li>
            <li> It is working well and my face is getting used to it.  I especially like the ability to wash it out which is a big improvement over having to brush it out which caau/sed me to wait too long and get the old model clogged up.</li>
            <li> its Norelco how could we go worng, in cuts great charges for ever and is a great prduct I like it</li>
            <li> Does exactly everything more expensive shaver do.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver so far. It is quiet, and gives a very close shave. It also glides across my face very easily. It works much better than the Remington shaver I used to use. Another good thing about it is that it works so well for a good price.</li>
            <li> Does not give a close shave.  I need to go over areas again and again. Not so good.</li>
            <li> full charge last only 1-2 dayes! I have only little beard.</li>
            <li> This one does the job. And instead of shaking the whiskers into the drain, I like to put them in my garden.</li>
            <li> The razor generally works well, and I appreciate the thoughtful charging lights. More hair falls out while I shave than on my previous electric razor, though.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor to replace my old Norelco which I thought was on it&#x27;s way out, it&#x27;s not holding it&#x27;s charge as long as it did when it was new (over 7 years ago ). How ever now I &#x27;am shaving with both razors ,the old one just won&#x27;t die.</li>
            <li> It works very well; &amp;#34;Like socks on a rooster&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Took the charger on a week trip and didn&#x27;t need it.  Shaves great.  Very comfortable and easy to use.  I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Gives me a nice shave, but some times i have to use the traditional shave because it can&#x27;t cut the smaller hairs</li>
            <li> What a nice razer.  Smooth, fast, quiet, and easy to clean.  Nice and a reasonable price as well I believe.</li>
            <li> My dad likes it. Not close enough for a fancy diner but it is good for daily use (especially at this price).</li>
            <li> Does a great job for the price. Very smooth shave. I was surprised for the money.</li>
            <li> A good machine, in my opinion is necessary for a good shave.</li>
            <li> If you have anything like sensitive skin, forget this shaver. I&#x27;ve used a panasonic (dry shave) for years. Never a problem. This thing left my neck chafed for 2 days!!</li>
            <li> I had higher expectation for this razor and it failed to measure up. This is quite big compare to my old Panasonic brand, and I&#x27;m alright with it. It doesn&#x27;t make a loud buzzing sound when it&#x27;s on. So that one is a plus. However, when it came down to cutting and cleaning, I was disappointed. This razor isn&#x27;t for people with sensitive skin. You will have to use it for weeks to get it to adjust to you. Probably not a good idea by the company to make it that way. If I didn&#x27;t read their manual, I would likely return it for poor performance. This razor doesn&#x27;t give you a smooth shaving if you have days of hair growing on your face. When it cuts, it doesn&#x27;t cut your hair to dust like my other razor. You can still still tiny strand of hair. This razor also required cleaning after each use. You will need to open it and wash it. The hair that&#x27;s left behind won&#x27;t wash out easily. The brush also doesn&#x27;t seem to clean it out completely. The way this thing is design made it hard to clean because there are holes and parts that will trap your hair. My older razor, you just have to open it and brush it and it&#x27;s fully clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only like this because it&#x27;s not loud. It does cut pretty good, but not completely. Getting used to using it might make you want to look for a different alternative.</li>
            <li> Getting a more expensive one would just be foolish. I love this razor and it works fine! I got one more expensive and took it back to get this one. Give it a week as the directions say for it to adjust to your skin.</li>
            <li> Got this for my fiancé for Christmas. Works great and he had no complaints. Battery holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor in November 2013 and is not working anymore. It is fully charged and the blades don&#x27;t move when I turn it on.</li>
            <li> I love it. It hits every spot and doesn&#x27;t leave annoying hairs behind.</li>
            <li> I have owned many Philips Norelco and Norelco shavers before, which have typically lasted anywhere from 7 - 10 years. I think that&#x27;s a long time.  I bought this to replace my old one, which needed replacing, after I dropped it on a tile floor.  It shaves me so close WITH comfort that I&#x27;d put it up against a blade anytime. I highly recommend Philips Norelco shavers.     It has a TWO year Warranty, but if you register it online, they add another 6 months to the Warranty!</li>
            <li> The closeness of the shave is okay and battery life is excellent. Shipping was very fast and arrived sooner than promised.</li>
            <li> Great product. Doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin after a shave.</li>
            <li> after 6 months, bf still happy :)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad. He says it works great and would definitely buy another one but this one has outlasted all the others he had bought through out the years.</li>
            <li> This razor works and feels great!</li>
            <li> Prevents skin irritation, even if you shave dry</li>
            <li> Good quality shave at very fair price.</li>
            <li> I love this type of Philips , just comfortable</li>
            <li> works fine on medium to heavy beard so far, but I don&#x27;t use it daily.  blade rotation speed seems a little slower than it should be with a full charge, but as long a blades are sharp, it is not a problem (so far)</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver and i am glad I got it! This item really gives a close shave and is easy to use and clean, I recommend everyone purchase this item.</li>
            <li> Excellent shave , great value</li>
            <li> the razor is dull does not shave close and does not hold charge as long as specified  in your add at time of purchase</li>
            <li> Great for the price.  Does a good job and I like the fact that it can be rinsed out.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelcos for 50 years and I still look as young as I did when I was shaving peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 17 year old son who&#x27;s not too hairy and he loves it! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> close shave. I have an older corded model.  this new one is so much better. now I can shave will watching tv.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this item.</li>
            <li> Was time for a new one.  Works great!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and thet loved it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage son. It&#x27;s perfect!  He loves the flip up trimmer for keeping his stuble in check. Works great!</li>
            <li> My grandfather always told me, have one shaver for your face and one for your balls. Which probably made a lot of sense, back when everything was so cheap. But in this economy? No way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, everyone knows ball cooties die at midnight, so if you do your face and then your balls, you&#x27;ll be good to go the next morning. High five!</li>
            <li> Gives a great  and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months and really like it.  It performs as described.  Being able to rinse it under hot water is a BIG plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there is a picture of the face cream next to the razor because it did not come with it.  However, I bought the razor for my son and he absolutely loves it!  Close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Overall:  Very pleased with the razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;+ Great Price&lt;br /&gt;+ Doesn&#x27;t pinch the skin&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;+ Water Resistant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- None really&lt;br /&gt;- Maybe include a stand or cradle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery stays charged and provides a good life.  Very happy with the razor.</li>
            <li> It has been everything that I hoped it would be.  Much smoother cut than my last model.</li>
            <li> not a very close shave</li>
            <li> Good electric razor for the price. Shop at your local stores and see if amazon can beat it. I&#x27;m sure they will. The product cuts facial hair in one or two passes it&#x27;s also energy efficient. I got it to hold a charge for a week.</li>
            <li> I bought this locally, but wish I had bought it here as it is $10 cheaper :(  I haven&#x27;t owned this long so I will update if my mind changes.  So far I love this.  I bought this because I was sick and tired of all the women&#x27;s electric razors having a similar design that didn&#x27;t conform to the shape of my leg and the curve of my knees.  They would chew up the inner thigh.  I thought a man&#x27;s electric razor was built for the sensitive skin for a face so it might be good for legs.  I was right.  This thing is much quieter than any past shavers I have owned, it is curved and glides smoothly over my skin.  It cuts nice and close without pulling or knicking my skin.  My husband borrowed it and he loved it too!</li>
            <li> Pretty darn good for the price!</li>
            <li> bought for my daddy, he said it&#x27;s too big</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve straight razor shaved all my life and thought I&#x27;d try this to speed things up and skip the step of lathering.  I still prefer razors, as this tends to leave my face dryer than normal even with applying lotion or after shave.  It&#x27;s handy to have, holds it&#x27;s charge for awhile and would recommend it for electric razor fans.  It really depends on your personal preference.</li>
            <li> I have had a Norelco shaver before and was very happy with their products which is why I bought another one. I am very happy with my pruchase</li>
            <li> This is my third Phillips Norelco with rotary heads.  All have performed flawlessly.  Factoring in the cost of replacement heads, I replace my shavers regularly.  I apply the head savings toward the cost of a new shaver.  New is always nicer, and is worth the extra cost.  As with printers and ink cost, I think the profit comes from the replacement heads, not the shavers.  This is a nice shaver for the price.  Not much profit there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use shave gel, and the shaver must be washable.  I rinse during the shave, whenever the speed slows.  Warm gel beats cold lotion hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a cord and should the battery not be charged, it can be used corded.  It should not be washed while corded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good choice, and good value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a pretty cheap (~$30) electric razor package I got at Walgreens, so this is my first experience with a decent electric razor ... and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.  Its light and small (good for travelling), shaves close, has no irritation when using it, and is still fairly cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that if you&#x27;re stubble is turning into a beard (say more than a cm in length) then this doesn&#x27;t really work for shaving it - you&#x27;ll need a separate beard trimmer.  It does have something similar built in, but its small and not really comfortable to use except in emergency/travel situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that I really don&#x27;t have anything negative to say.  The powertouch is just a really solid electric razor.</li>
            <li> Works great no issues to report. Good price point as well.</li>
            <li> Husband is loving this gift. It works so much better than his old model. He thinks it&#x27;s money well spent. I love how smooth his face is after an easy shave with this!</li>
            <li> For some of us Norelco users, the company reached some sort of peak in shavers with the original Quadra XL line. I bought mine over a decade ago and still use it replacing parts as they wear out. I got this in hopes that it&#x27;d be a good replacement because sooner or later, the motor in mine will fail which is a part I cannot replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver does work well, but when compared to my old classic Quadra, it fails aesthetically if not functionally. In fact, this shaver uses the superior lithium ion battery technology where the older ones use NiCad. However, this is clearly a shaver built for the value sensitive customer. For example, the part which holds the rotating blades is fastened by plastic &#x27;dog and house&#x27; rather than the positive metal of the older model. Due to this, the shaver emits a slight rattle as you draw it over your face. This does not affect the quality of the shave, but does damage the atheistic a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire affair is lighter and offers less a sense that you are holding a device machined out of a billet than the older models. The motor rotates at fewer RPM&#x27;s which has the bonus of making it quieter but also one gets the sense that it&#x27;s weaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent value shaver especially for one who is value minded or as a first shaver as a gift for that youngster just starting out in his shaving life. As for me, after using this for a bit, I returned to Amazon and ordered another set of batteries for my old Quadra. This is a fine shaver and a superb deal, but for me, I&#x27;ll stick to my almost ancient version of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a while since I purchased an electric razor. I believe, and still believe, even after using this one, that the best shaves come from a non-electric device, with a real razor blade. But, if you&#x27;re in a hurry or feeling lazy or there&#x27;s no water around, this thing works like a charm. It actually left my skin feeling really smooth and even worked well on my more difficult neck areas that other electrics in the past had trouble with. And it&#x27;s much quieter than the other electrics I&#x27;ve used. The fact that it&#x27;s easy to clean (you can detach the head and run the trio of rotating razors under the tap) makes it an even better investment. This one ticks all the boxes and works great.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and great quality.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great razor.  Close shave and does whats its supposed too.</li>
            <li> Nice close smooth shave.</li>
            <li> my husband loves his new razer</li>
            <li> a gift for my dad, not used yet, looks great!</li>
            <li> Husband has to take coumadin. Bleeds easily. THIS is much safer for him now. He does love it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband and he loves it.  He&#x27;s been using it every few days for the past year and it still runs great.  Smooth shave every time!</li>
            <li> Great razor! Been using for awhile, holds charge well, shaves well, overall very pleased.</li>
            <li> Just upgraded from an 11 year old Norelco that finally broke.  Compared to that dinosaur turd, this thing is amazing and I get a clean shave in 1/5 of the time.  Battery life seems good as well.</li>
            <li> This shaver is very quiet and the charge lasts a long time. I like that you can use it as a cordless or corded shaver. The 5 minute quick charge (for a single shave) is nice also. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the design of the rotary blades is slightly different than my previous Norelco, and you can&#x27;t see the sides as well when you&#x27;re shaving, so it&#x27;s not quite as easy to shave around the edges of my beard. I have to guess more as to where they are and sort of shave into my beard to make sure the blades are getting close the to edge of my beard.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the lithium ion battery performance.  An excellent shaver for the money.</li>
            <li> This shaver is excellent cuts very close and easy to use the floating heads work very well and the side cutter does it job good, and for forty dollars why spend more for the same shave</li>
            <li> Excellent razor, much better than my old one, quieter too!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Almost as inexpensive as purchasing the replacement heads, but decided to get the new one because will/should last longer!  My hubby likes and even uses it some times!!!</li>
            <li> Great razor for a great price</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time, well packaged, and as described.  Replacing a Norelco that is probably 10+ years old because the batteries will not longer hold a full charge / carry the charge as well.  Works well and uses the same replacemenrt blades as my prior razon.  Now I am not particular about how close a razor shaves.  As long as it does a reasonable job I am happy.  If you are meticulous about your groom please see oher reviews for additional information and opinioins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lithium ion battery is a nice touch. For the money....A good value.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good! I love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas and so far, so good. He tells me it is light in his hand and does a good job.</li>
            <li> Very nice razor! my son loves it!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the product. I love it~</li>
            <li> The  power  of  the razor  it s  to  low</li>
