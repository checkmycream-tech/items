            <li>Loved the color of it</li>
            <li>OPI is always good for that though.</li>

            <li>I love the color.  </li>
            <li>Cute color got lots and lots of compliments on my  nails with this</li>
            <li>I love the color, texture, and</li>
            <li>I tried this style of polish and found it not to be one of the better OPI products.  </li>
            <li>Liquid Sand is more costlier, so you want to wear it as advertised.  </li>
            <li>- I love the look of the liquid sand.  </li>
            <li>Get your number is an awesome shade of \\&quot;Cookie Monster Blue\\&quot; (as coined by my husband), with various sized sparkles.</li>
            <li>i absolutley love these :)</li>
            <li>I love how it feels like</li>
            <li>Love how it sparkles no matter</li>
            <li>It gets so many compliments.</li>
            <li>I used a gloss top coat on one finger (ring finger), matte on the rest.</li>
            <li>clean-up is more challenging with this polish than with a polish that has no glitter of course.</li>
            <li>LOVE this polish and will probably purchase the rest of the line after using this one.</li>
            <li>Speedy delivery, love the product</li>
            <li>You are not supposed to put a top layer on</li>
            <li>i love this color as well as OPI.</li>
            <li>The texture of the liquid sand is kind of unique.  </li>
            <li>This is far most beautiful color</li>
            <li>Zoya&#x27;s Pixie Dust polishes are amazing as well, and totally worth the buy</li>
            <li>it don&#x27;t come off so easy ethier</li>
            <li>Used a gel polish over it to get it to smooth out.</li>
            <li>mani shows 3 coats but each coat went on smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>Looks great, but don&#x27;t expect it to last.</li>
            <li>This is probably one of my favorite nail polishes that I have right now.  </li>
            <li>I truly wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like the \\&quot;textured polish\\&quot; fad that seems to be occuring right now, but I started with \\&quot;Stay</li>
            <li>I love this polish, but be aware that it is not that color.</li>
            <li>So fun!</li>
            <li>I love it, it looks really pretty</li>
            <li>I personally like the Tiffany Case color better, but this one is nice, too.</li>
            <li>they dont chip very easy and its not hard to take off either and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I had bright blue nails, but it had people looking, and asking to touch</li>
            <li>This is the most unusual polish I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Looks adorable on,  long wearing &amp; very easy to apply...</li>
            <li>It is super sparkly.  </li>
            <li>it shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>But it dried fairly fast and looks awesome after!</li>
            <li>so neat and very pretty</li>
            <li>, it is really easy to apply, and it dries super fast.</li>
            <li>Oh and the seller was kind enough to refund my money,</li>
            <li>The only time I haven&#x27;t liked it is when I was folding laundry and grabbed a microfiber towel -</li>
            <li>The liquid nail polishes are definitely one of a kind.</li>
            <li>(A week on, my toenails look as fresh as the day I applied the polish.)</li>
            <li>But for a fun weekend manicure, I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
            <li>other than that i loved my nails when i did them.</li>
            <li>It takes 2-3 layers to make it look right.</li>
            <li>I will not purchase anymore of this kind, but remain a life long OPI fan.</li>
            <li>It certainly could be!  </li>
            <li>love opi, only nail polish I use.</li>
            <li>I am going to buy another bottle soon just to have ready when this one runs out!</li>
            <li>the color is maybe a tiny bit darker but i love everything about it.</li>
            <li>From the first day I put it on my fingernails, people noticed.</li>
            <li>This nail polish really makes your nails stand out with shiny sparkly polish!  </li>
            <li>It took me nearly a minute per nail to get the polish off--but to its credit, the polish comes off cleanly and completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course my niece being younger, they enjoy the fun colors to wear.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little harder to take off, but that&#x27;s ok since it looks so good when it&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li>they wear very nicley</li>
            <li>the real kicker is it dries sooo fast</li>
            <li>Not what I thought it was - looks more solid color in the photo but has huge glitter sparkles in real life - very childish.</li>
            <li>Although the color is billed as a matte, I felt that the matte top coat made a difference; the polish was smoother looking and slightly darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does take a little more work to remove it all traces of this polish, but I personally think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I recommend combining your normal clean-up routine with an orange stick to grab errant pieces of glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blue is just the right intermediate shade.  </li>
            <li>this blue does take a few layers to get that color, there is a light blue that is really pretty also in the same OPI Mariah Carey Collection. :)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t chip easily and the texture doesn&#x27;t feel that odd.</li>
            <li>i got these in the blue and pink and all i can say is i love them there</li>
            <li>The only reason this product received a three was for the color, my package didn&#x27;t come the first time around...</li>
            <li>Such a pretty olor.</li>
            <li>and quickly jumped in with both feet - buying the remaining Mariah Carey liquid sand polishes (as well as her other shades in this collection</li>
            <li>i had to use the clear gel over the nail for the color wont chip.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a complete conversation starter.</li>
            <li>My 6yr old daughter picked it out,  insisting that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Frozen&amp;#34; nail polish...  </li>
            <li>You have to get used to the gritty feel, but you don&#x27;t notice it that much.</li>
            <li>I guess I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised</li>
            <li>And it stays on for pretty long.</li>
            <li>Fast shipper product just as described will definitely do business with this person again.</li>
            <li>Pretty polish, but dries rough, which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>However, I am knocking it down a star because it does not last long since you&#x27;re not supposed to put a top coat on it.</li>
            <li>I really like the feel of the sand polishes, but if you don&#x27;t like rough feeling polish, then it isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li>its rather dull and glittery with a texture of the name sand which is the only accurate thing in its description.</li>
            <li>Pretty color just a little darker than i was expecting but the color lasted a week .</li>
            <li>What I received is a few shades darker, but still a pretty color and received compliments at work regarding so.</li>
            <li>The first coat is very thin, but builds up quickly to opacity - I can get away with 2 coats and some touch ups in spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I apply two coats over a base coat and with some touch-ups (which are very easy with this texture), can make the polish last an entire work week.  </li>
            <li> I definitely want to purchase the other colors of the liquid sand.</li>
            <li> It does have a rough finish to it (why its called Sands).</li>
            <li> I am rough with my hands so we&#x27;ll see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that even without a top or base coat this polish can last for ages!</li>
            <li> I will say that minor chips are hard to notice because the color and sparkles are forgiving, but after several days it&#x27;ll have to come</li>
            <li> It feels rough like sand too!  </li>
            <li> At least it was not on me, it was a darker blue.</li>
            <li> And because of that, I think it lasts a little longer before the polish starts chipping.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot, but it is a little darker than the picture.  </li>
            <li> Once applied it can appear dull and adding a gloss to it, takes away from the idea of the polish and makes like any other.  </li>
            <li> I hate those things anyway, but the annoying feel just became more apparent as it rubbed against my nails.</li>
            <li> So when they call it liquid sand, they mean it.</li>
            <li> Hard to remove!</li>
            <li> for removing the polish, it was very hard.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with opi.</li>
            <li> texture isn&#x27;t weird or displeasing...</li>
            <li> It is horrible and not worth the money you spend for it.</li>
            <li> so all in all this wasn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> No one will be disappointed with this polish.</li>
            <li> You just apply the OPI base coat then two coats of this color.  </li>
            <li> One base coat and two of the sand polish.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with opi. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Pretty polish, but dries rough, which I don&#x27;t like. Used a gel polish over it to get it to smooth out.</li>
            <li> This is far most beautiful color</li>
            <li> All of my friend&#x27;s an coworkers love the color  I like my color its great it don&#x27;t chip and it don&#x27;t come off so easy ethier</li>
            <li> love opi, only nail polish I use.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of my favorite nail polishes that I have right now.  I love the color.  It is super sparkly.  The texture of the liquid sand is kind of unique.  Very different from Zoya&#x27;s Pixiedust polishes.  I find that even without a top or base coat this polish can last for ages!</li>
            <li> What I received is a few shades darker, but still a pretty color and received compliments at work regarding so.</li>
            <li> Cute color got lots and lots of compliments on my  nails with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great color for a fashion forward person</li>
            <li> I love it! However, I am knocking it down a star because it does not last long since you&#x27;re not supposed to put a top coat on it.</li>
            <li> I love the color, texture, and how well it stays on! I definitely recommend since it&#x27;s at such a low price!</li>
            <li> Of course my niece being younger, they enjoy the fun colors to wear.  They thought the texture of the nail polish was &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Pretty color just a little darker than i was expecting but the color lasted a week .</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t resist using this glittery nail polish on my toes for my wedding day &amp;#34;something blue.&amp;#34; It was perfect and everyone loved it!</li>
            <li> This color Is so beautiful!! Especially in the sunlight, or in the water while swimming.  It feels rough like sand too!  The color lasts about two weeks without chipping.  You just apply the OPI base coat then two coats of this color.  I am going to buy another bottle soon just to have ready when this one runs out!</li>
            <li> I tried this style of polish and found it not to be one of the better OPI products.  Once applied it can appear dull and adding a gloss to it, takes away from the idea of the polish and makes like any other.  In the stores Liquid Sand is more costlier, so you want to wear it as advertised.  I will not purchase anymore of this kind, but remain a life long OPI fan.</li>
            <li> The only reason this product received a three was for the color, my package didn&#x27;t come the first time around...I had to wait almost a month for it, however the color is awesome. Oh and the seller was kind enough to refund my money, so all in all this wasn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> This nail polish looks great - I love the look of the liquid sand.  The blue is just the right intermediate shade.  I really like the feel of the sand polishes, but if you don&#x27;t like rough feeling polish, then it isn&#x27;t for you.  I apply two coats over a base coat and with some touch-ups (which are very easy with this texture), can make the polish last an entire work week.  It does take a little more work to remove it all traces of this polish, but I personally think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I truly wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like the \\&quot;textured polish\\&quot; fad that seems to be occuring right now, but I started with \\&quot;Stay the Night\\&quot; and quickly jumped in with both feet - buying the remaining Mariah Carey liquid sand polishes (as well as her other shades in this collection - I just LOVE all of the colors!) Get your number is an awesome shade of \\&quot;Cookie Monster Blue\\&quot; (as coined by my husband), with various sized sparkles. The first coat is very thin, but builds up quickly to opacity - I can get away with 2 coats and some touch ups in spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture isn&#x27;t weird or displeasing... and it&#x27;s a complete conversation starter. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I had bright blue nails, but it had people looking, and asking to touch so they could see the texture themselves. The only time I haven&#x27;t liked it is when I was folding laundry and grabbed a microfiber towel - I hate those things anyway, but the annoying feel just became more apparent as it rubbed against my nails. Urgh. Because of this, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever put the textured polishes on my toes, to avoid the same feeling if I were wearing socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, I totally recommend getting any of the shiny textured polishes - I have all of the OPIs, and am chomping at the bit to get their next textured polish from the Oz collection. Zoya&#x27;s Pixie Dust polishes are amazing as well, and totally worth the buy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who enjoys experimenting with nail color, this polish is definitely for you!</li>
            <li> Hard to remove! Practically needed a chisel OMG</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it was - looks more solid color in the photo but has huge glitter sparkles in real life - very childish.</li>
            <li> Item arrived promptly and was as described.</li>
            <li> Very nice!  Love the sand effect!</li>
            <li> So when they call it liquid sand, they mean it. Loved the color of it but literally it&#x27;s like having sandpaper on your finger nails</li>
            <li> I love this polish, but be aware that it is not that color. At least it was not on me, it was a darker blue. The instructions say to add 3 coats. One base coat and two of the sand polish. I actually prefer the darker blue color over the lighter blue, so it works out for me!! I will be purchasing this polish again.</li>
            <li> i got these in the blue and pink and all i can say is i love them there so neat and very pretty they wear very nicley they dont chip very easy and its not hard to take off either and the real kicker is it dries sooo fast i absolutley love these :)</li>
            <li> this blue does take a few layers to get that color, there is a light blue that is really pretty also in the same OPI Mariah Carey Collection. :)</li>
            <li> I love how it feels like sand and the color is awesome, I&#x27;ve been getting compliments on this, Im very happy with this nail polish!</li>
            <li> Such a pretty olor. Love how it sparkles no matter what lighting youre in. And the matte finish is perfect. Have had it on for 5 days now &amp; still hasnt chipped!</li>
            <li> Love this!  My 6yr old daughter picked it out,  insisting that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Frozen&amp;#34; nail polish...  It certainly could be!  Looks adorable on,  long wearing &amp; very easy to apply...</li>
            <li> the color is maybe a tiny bit darker but i love everything about it. great purchase. beautiful color matte sand finish easy awesome application. best nail polish i own. OPI is always good for that though. but just beautiful very happy thank you.</li>
            <li> beautiful color i had to use the clear gel over the nail for the color wont chip. other than that i loved my nails when i did them.</li>
            <li> Love love love this nail polish! It gets so many compliments. The liquid nail polishes are definitely one of a kind. The matte with glittery polish looks fabulous!!! It wears for a long time too. Doesn&#x27;t chip easily and the texture doesn&#x27;t feel that odd. You have to get used to the gritty feel, but you don&#x27;t notice it that much. I definitely want to purchase the other colors of the liquid sand. &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> I bought this polish thinking it was going to be a bright popping blue its not so much bright and popping. its rather dull and glittery with a texture of the name sand which is the only accurate thing in its description. It may be worn once this year then put to the back of my non-wearing polishes</li>
            <li> I used a gloss top coat on one finger (ring finger), matte on the rest. Although the color is billed as a matte, I felt that the matte top coat made a difference; the polish was smoother looking and slightly darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mani shows 3 coats but each coat went on smoothly and evenly. I allowed extra drying time but nothing excessive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mani clean-up is more challenging with this polish than with a polish that has no glitter of course. I recommend combining your normal clean-up routine with an orange stick to grab errant pieces of glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this polish and will probably purchase the rest of the line after using this one.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and the polish is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Love the sparkle!!!  Great price &amp; it shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery, love the product</li>
            <li> I actually like this polish a lot! It does have a rough finish to it (why its called Sands). It seems as if the glossy polish just evaporates to leave the color and sparkles. You are not supposed to put a top layer on so we&#x27;ll see how well it lasts. I am rough with my hands so we&#x27;ll see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;So not even three days later and it has already started to chip. I guess I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised but I am disapointed. Was hoping it would actually stay longer. Oh well. Time for a re-do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all-if you work with your hands a lot expect this to chip fairly soon.</li>
            <li> This is the most unusual polish I have ever used. From the first day I put it on my fingernails, people noticed. So sparkly! So bright! So fun! But by the third day it started to chip, and by the sixth day the chipping had gotten out of control despite touchups. (A week on, my toenails look as fresh as the day I applied the polish.) I will say that minor chips are hard to notice because the color and sparkles are forgiving, but after several days it&#x27;ll have to come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for removing the polish, it was very hard. If you&#x27;ve ever used sparkle nail polish, you know what I&#x27;m talking about. Now multiply that tenfold. It took me nearly a minute per nail to get the polish off--but to its credit, the polish comes off cleanly and completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line: Looks great, but don&#x27;t expect it to last. But for a fun weekend manicure, I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
            <li> This nail polish really makes your nails stand out with shiny sparkly polish!  It&#x27;s a little harder to take off, but that&#x27;s ok since it looks so good when it&#x27;s on.  And because of that, I think it lasts a little longer before the polish starts chipping.</li>
            <li> I love it, it looks really pretty, it is really easy to apply, and it dries super fast. And it stays on for pretty long.</li>
            <li> It is nothing like what I thought it would be. I would never buy it again. It is horrible and not worth the money you spend for it.</li>
            <li> i love this color as well as OPI.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot, but it is a little darker than the picture.  I personally like the Tiffany Case color better, but this one is nice, too.</li>
            <li> It takes 2-3 layers to make it look right. But it dried fairly fast and looks awesome after! Your nails acquire sand paper texture, and it lasts for a 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> This is AWESOME! No chipping or flaking off. I now have every color! LOL! No one will be disappointed with this polish.</li>
            <li> Fast shipper product just as described will definitely do business with this person again. The product is just what I was looking for.</li>
