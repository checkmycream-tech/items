            <li>it&#x27;s own sometimes.</li>
            <li>and I just had to buy my own.</li>
            <li>Northern Lights has been my favorite topcoat for quite some time now, the sparkles are gorgeous and this topcoat keeps your mani protected and shines.</li>
            <li>Love love love it!!</li>
            <li>I love this top coat!</li>
            <li>I love this top coat!</li>
            <li>This top coat is amazing.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the gold, but this silver one is great, definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve got to shake it up, though, because the very fine glitter settles at the bottom.</li>
            <li>*love*</li>
            <li>The more coats you apply, the more glitter.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this top coat years ago.</li>
            <li>What I love about this is that when I don&#x27;t want the glitter, I don&#x27;t shake it and the glitter settles at the bottom</li>
            <li>I love the way this looks</li>
            <li>I picked up this top coat from Sally&#x27;s for significantly more than the price listed here</li>
            <li>Lights SAYS it&#x27;s a &#x27;top coat&#x27;, but I accidentally scraped my finger on the wall, and when I looked, sparkles had come off.</li>
            <li>I also like that it is a top coat.</li>
            <li>Not worry about another polish to put on top.</li>
            <li>This is one of my GO TO top</li>
            <li>Make sure to SHAKE IT to get all that shimmer into the top coat before applying.  </li>
            <li>but I might just have to go and try out the gold hologram top coat too.  </li>
            <li>But, what I didn&#x27;t realize it was a top coat polish.</li>
            <li>and then I used the Hologram top coat &amp; there was the sparkles on my nails.</li>
            <li>This dries my polish thoroughly in a couple of minutes, and adds the coolest holographic shimmer on top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through many bottles.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on the shimmer and shine.</li>
            <li>Its more like a glitter polish and</li>
            <li>I also awn the gold one which is just as stunning</li>
            <li>I love and will re-purchase both the silver and the gold when I run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Northerm Lights Hologram Top Coat.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this glitter polish.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff....</li>
            <li>And there acrilic powder and monimer are way better and easier on your nails</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tryed a lot of the products and they are all top notch.</li>
            <li>One more thing about this glitter topcoat</li>
            <li>so if you want it to look more glittery</li>
            <li>it looks very nice on top of any color it drys fast</li>
            <li>Luckily for me, I was able to find it online at the fraction of the cost I paid for it years ago!  </li>
            <li>I have not really used it as a top coat on its own, so I can not comment on how good of a job it does protecting the nail polish from chipping, but I have used it before using another top coat and it has even better shine than with just one top coat!</li>
            <li>Just like the original but with glitter!</li>
            <li>It is a top coat with sparse, fine glitter.</li>
            <li>Well, I very quickly learned that I put a color on my nails</li>
            <li>the self leveling glitter is like a fine dust it never looks chunky</li>
            <li>This nail polish is super sparkly and shiny!</li>
            <li>Super dissapointed!  </li>
            <li>Nothing like the fast drying top coat!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, perfect top coat, put on top of your nail polish, dries fast and hard.  </li>
            <li>It you are looking for a linear holo top coat (like Fairy Godmother by Fair Maiden) or not up to frakening the polish look for a different topcoat.</li>
            <li>I add this on most of my at home manicures, just because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>So pretty on colors and easy to remove!</li>
            <li>Very nice with a tiny bit of sparkle.</li>
            <li>I usually put on 2-3 light coats and it looks great!</li>
            <li>It does what it says, it dries super fast and looks amazing on whatever color (or none at all)</li>
            <li>but I was still upset, the store I had originally purchased it from was no longer in business.</li>
            <li>I was excited to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li>The glitter is super fine and tends to settle on the bottom so if it looks like regular clear topcoat when you get it make sure you give it a good shake!  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a special nail polish that I had gotten at a beauty school&#x27;s manicure &amp; pedicure.</li>
            <li>I love this polish so much.</li>
            <li>I have a soft spot for trying something I might not normally buy if it&#x27;s from a company that I know makes an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it and will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t like the super blingy glitter polishes this is for you.</li>
            <li>I live in AZ so its super sunny and just makes the color pop even more.</li>
            <li>You do have to shake it very well before using, but if you do, you&#x27;ll get a light and even glitter finish that dries quick.</li>
            <li>Maybe I didn&#x27;t read the product description thoroughly, but I assumed it would be a clear coat that can either be worn alone or on top of another color and would give a holographic illusion.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately most of there professional products you can&#x27;t buy unless your licensed.</li>
            <li>Now these top costs the northern lights are fabulous the only Glitter topcoat that is self leveling</li>
            <li>that is very important to them to have top quality way less damaging to your nails.</li>
            <li>Its stunning in the sunlight, I particularly love it over dark colors.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite glitter top coat.  </li>
            <li>It has fine glitter, not gritty, which is important to me.</li>
            <li>This holographic top coat is really stunning, it adds a little bit of sparkle to the mani without being in your face.  </li>
            <li>It dries super fast.</li>
            <li>my favorite top coat had dried up!  </li>
            <li>so you can use it as a regular top coat as well ;</li>
            <li>And before you say, nail polish collections are different than top coats.  </li>
            <li>I will clarify that I have NUMEROUS top coats and not all of them get my vote of approval.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Add pretty sparkle to any polish</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many Northern Lights Hologram Silver top coats in the past and just received mine in the mail today</li>
            <li>I have had the privilege of getting a chance to try a lot of the products and they are all of much higher quality</li>
            <li>Its also a fast drying top coat which actually works.  </li>
            <li>It is a lovely, subtle, super fine glitter.</li>
            <li>OPI is pretty much 100% lacquer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;**Don&#x27;t let the minimal appearance of the glitter in the bottle full you, this polish is packed of fine holographic glitter, JUST SHAKE IT</li>
            <li>It is great under solid black or cool-colored gradients.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of a night sky, as the glitter is fine and sparkly and reminiscent of star dust.</li>
            <li>I love using this as a little extra detail on top of my polish.  </li>
            <li>If you want your nails to sparkle, I highly recommend giving this a try!</li>
            <li>Fast forward to about a week ago, I pulled out my nail polishes to discover</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have much gold in my collection</li>
            <li>I really like the way it shows up on my nails.</li>
            <li>very misleading</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for any laquerista!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty pricy in the local stores but still worth it if you can find it.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure to shake it up really well before each use as all the sparkle settles down to the bottom</li>
            <li>Not very much of the holo, had to let it settle and pour all holo pearls in a 4mL bottle and even then it takes 2-3 coats to give a good scattered holo effect, goes on grainy and rough as well.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for anyone who wants a little bling without blowing your eyes out :)</li>
            <li>so I love out the door topcoats from inm super shiny wet look when dry.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but I wish it was a little more glittery.</li>
            <li>It looks clear, since all of the glitter falls to the bottom of the bottle, so you have to shake it up really well.</li>
            <li>but it sinks on your nails giving you a smooth shinny finish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it over clear polish, as well as various shades of pink, rose, and mauve</li>
            <li>It dries quick and the clear polish itself doesn&#x27;t shrink or yellow the nails.</li>
            <li>Outside in the sun is where this baby really shines.  </li>
            <li>It really does sparkle and it dries my polish instantly.  </li>
            <li>It dries really fast and makes my nail polish last longer.</li>
            <li>When I run low on the gold or the silver, I mix them together for a totally new effect!</li>
            <li>I LOVE the subtle shine it gives.  </li>
            <li>This polish is super watery and has half the amount of glitter.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a topcoat that will make any polish holographic, this is not it.this is a cheap basecoat with very little glitter in itand</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for, even though I was unsure initially, and it got here long before the estimated time!</li>
            <li>It dries pretty quick too, as long as you don&#x27;t put it on too thick.</li>
            <li>I saw that someone had posted it barely had any sparkles in it compared to the one her nail tech used, but went ahead and ordered it anyway...</li>
            <li>So far I have only used it alone and applied two coats...</li>
            <li>I put on 2 or 3 layers of a really good base coat first.</li>
            <li>I personally prefer Seche Vite for base &amp; topcoats - they&#x27;re made for nail laquers, which is mostly what I have, and are fantastic with regular nail polish (The bottles will say &#x27;polish&#x27; or &#x27;laquer.&#x27;)</li>
            <li>Because the product settles upon shipment or in between use, it really does look like you are getting ripped off, but I promise a little shake will had a TON of sparkle to your nails.</li>
            <li>Really adds tiny little sparkles to your mani.  </li>

            <li> It does what it says, it dries super fast and looks amazing on whatever color (or none at all)</li>
            <li> but I was still upset, the store I had originally purchased it from was no longer in business.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li> The glitter is super fine and tends to settle on the bottom so if it looks like regular clear topcoat when you get it make sure you give it a good shake!  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a special nail polish that I had gotten at a beauty school&#x27;s manicure &amp; pedicure.</li>
            <li> I love this polish so much.</li>
            <li> I have a soft spot for trying something I might not normally buy if it&#x27;s from a company that I know makes an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it and will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t like the super blingy glitter polishes this is for you.</li>
            <li> I live in AZ so its super sunny and just makes the color pop even more.</li>
            <li> You do have to shake it very well before using, but if you do, you&#x27;ll get a light and even glitter finish that dries quick.</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t read the product description thoroughly, but I assumed it would be a clear coat that can either be worn alone or on top of another color and would give a holographic illusion.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately most of there professional products you can&#x27;t buy unless your licensed.</li>
            <li> Now these top costs the northern lights are fabulous the only Glitter topcoat that is self leveling</li>
            <li> that is very important to them to have top quality way less damaging to your nails.</li>
            <li> Its stunning in the sunlight, I particularly love it over dark colors.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite glitter top coat.  </li>
            <li> It has fine glitter, not gritty, which is important to me.</li>
            <li> This holographic top coat is really stunning, it adds a little bit of sparkle to the mani without being in your face.  </li>
            <li> It dries super fast.</li>
            <li> my favorite top coat had dried up!  </li>
            <li> so you can use it as a regular top coat as well ;</li>
            <li> And before you say, nail polish collections are different than top coats.  </li>
            <li> I will clarify that I have NUMEROUS top coats and not all of them get my vote of approval.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Add pretty sparkle to any polish</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many Northern Lights Hologram Silver top coats in the past and just received mine in the mail today</li>
            <li> I have had the privilege of getting a chance to try a lot of the products and they are all of much higher quality</li>
            <li> Its also a fast drying top coat which actually works.  </li>
            <li> It is a lovely, subtle, super fine glitter.</li>
            <li> OPI is pretty much 100% lacquer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;**Don&#x27;t let the minimal appearance of the glitter in the bottle full you, this polish is packed of fine holographic glitter, JUST SHAKE IT</li>
            <li> It is great under solid black or cool-colored gradients.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of a night sky, as the glitter is fine and sparkly and reminiscent of star dust.</li>
            <li> I love using this as a little extra detail on top of my polish.  </li>
            <li> If you want your nails to sparkle, I highly recommend giving this a try!</li>
            <li> Fast forward to about a week ago, I pulled out my nail polishes to discover</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have much gold in my collection</li>
            <li> I really like the way it shows up on my nails.</li>
            <li> very misleading</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for any laquerista!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty pricy in the local stores but still worth it if you can find it.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure to shake it up really well before each use as all the sparkle settles down to the bottom</li>
            <li> Not very much of the holo, had to let it settle and pour all holo pearls in a 4mL bottle and even then it takes 2-3 coats to give a good scattered holo effect, goes on grainy and rough as well.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for anyone who wants a little bling without blowing your eyes out :)</li>
            <li> so I love out the door topcoats from inm super shiny wet look when dry.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> but I wish it was a little more glittery.</li>
            <li> It looks clear, since all of the glitter falls to the bottom of the bottle, so you have to shake it up really well.</li>
            <li> but it sinks on your nails giving you a smooth shinny finish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it over clear polish, as well as various shades of pink, rose, and mauve</li>
            <li> It dries quick and the clear polish itself doesn&#x27;t shrink or yellow the nails.</li>
            <li> Outside in the sun is where this baby really shines.  </li>
            <li> It really does sparkle and it dries my polish instantly.  </li>
            <li> It dries really fast and makes my nail polish last longer.</li>
            <li> When I run low on the gold or the silver, I mix them together for a totally new effect!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the subtle shine it gives.  </li>
            <li> This polish is super watery and has half the amount of glitter.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a topcoat that will make any polish holographic, this is not it.this is a cheap basecoat with very little glitter in itand</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for, even though I was unsure initially, and it got here long before the estimated time!</li>
            <li> It dries pretty quick too, as long as you don&#x27;t put it on too thick.</li>
            <li> I saw that someone had posted it barely had any sparkles in it compared to the one her nail tech used, but went ahead and ordered it anyway...</li>
            <li> So far I have only used it alone and applied two coats...</li>
            <li> I put on 2 or 3 layers of a really good base coat first.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer Seche Vite for base &amp; topcoats - they&#x27;re made for nail laquers, which is mostly what I have, and are fantastic with regular nail polish (The bottles will say &#x27;polish&#x27; or &#x27;laquer.&#x27;)</li>
            <li> Because the product settles upon shipment or in between use, it really does look like you are getting ripped off, but I promise a little shake will had a TON of sparkle to your nails.</li>
            <li> Really adds tiny little sparkles to your mani.  </li>
            <li> Northern Lights goes on just like a top coat, but gives your polish a beautiful shimmer, holographic effect, with none of the annoying gritty, glitter that&#x27;s impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> So pretty and subtle.</li>
            <li> It really does remind me of a northern lights type of deal but in a subtle way.</li>
            <li> and it gives a little extra interest and sparkle to my nails.</li>
            <li> So with that in mind, it takes me quite some time to empty a bottle.  </li>
            <li> I love that as I hate waiting for my nails to dry</li>
            <li> As long as I have a few things I can switch around.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have to go to the local beauty supply store with small kids with me.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Hi everyone I would like to start off by saying my brother-in-law owns this company his late grandfather started it long ago they have been around for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I love the glitter in it as it is very subtle and isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34; and flashy...  </li>
            <li> Pale pink nails with Northern Lights over</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle, not too obvious.</li>
            <li> it is lovely, put it over a shocking OPI \\&quot;I&#x27;m Not A Waitress\\&quot; Red, or over black, which just POPs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And there monimer is way less stinky and not harch smelling.</li>
            <li> I always mess them up because I start doing stuff to</li>
            <li> My little girls always ask for SPARKLES on their nails...</li>
            <li> I have 3 little girls and myself</li>
            <li> but it adds just a little bit of sparkle to any finished nail.</li>
            <li> this is NOT like heavy holograms!</li>
            <li> use this over Zoya top coat because zoya&#x27;s drying time is outrageously LOOOONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nothing like the ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li> I adore this in both silver and gold, although for some reason the gold is hard to find.</li>
            <li> what you get is a subtle sparkle that has a hard finish...</li>
            <li> Indoors, the glitter is noticeable but subtle.  </li>
            <li> Not good for a topcoat.</li>
            <li> THEN start your build up - from whatever back ground color you&#x27;re using to another coat of base coat, THEN the Northern Lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am not happy</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not happy with it at all.</li>
            <li> The glitter is VERY subtle so if you want that disco ball look, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> Was thick I was so mad</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit tedious to get off, but that&#x27;s the case for ANY glitter gloss.</li>
            <li> At leasrt it wasn &#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> but it sucks so bad!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad batch or</li>
            <li> and I promise, you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This top coat is amazing. It reminds me of a night sky, as the glitter is fine and sparkly and reminiscent of star dust. Do not buy this and expect a holographic polish. It is a top coat with sparse, fine glitter. It is great under solid black or cool-colored gradients. It dries quick and the clear polish itself doesn&#x27;t shrink or yellow the nails. I love it and will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> My nail tech and I *love* this product. If you want your nails to sparkle, I highly recommend giving this a try!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I think I have ordered about three bottles altogether! It looks clear, since all of the glitter falls to the bottom of the bottle, so you have to shake it up really well. It has fine glitter, not gritty, which is important to me. The more coats you apply, the more glitter. It looks great as a top coat, or even by itself! It dries pretty quick too, as long as you don&#x27;t put it on too thick. I usually put on 2-3 light coats and it looks great! I haven&#x27;t tried the gold, but this silver one is great, definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this top coat years ago. It does what it says, it dries super fast and looks amazing on whatever color (or none at all) you chose to paint your nails. It&#x27;s pretty pricy in the local stores but still worth it if you can find it. Fast forward to about a week ago, I pulled out my nail polishes to discover my favorite top coat had dried up!  There wasn&#x27;t much left in the bottle but I was still upset, the store I had originally purchased it from was no longer in business. Luckily for me, I was able to find it online at the fraction of the cost I paid for it years ago!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier, looking forward to using it again once I have the time to paint my nails.</li>
            <li> I love this! I use it over Zoya polishes and on it&#x27;s own sometimes. The glitter is VERY subtle so if you want that disco ball look, this is not for you. It really does remind me of a northern lights type of deal but in a subtle way. You can also shake it up for extra glitter. this is NOT like heavy holograms! What I love about this is that when I don&#x27;t want the glitter, I don&#x27;t shake it and the glitter settles at the bottom so you can use it as a regular top coat as well ;O)&lt;br /&gt;I use this over Zoya top coat because zoya&#x27;s drying time is outrageously LOOOONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;8/27/16~ I love the way this looks but it sucks so bad! Nothing like the fast drying top coat!</li>
            <li> This polish adds some extra sparkle to your manicure. I&#x27;ve used it over clear polish, as well as various shades of pink, rose, and mauve and it gives a little extra interest and sparkle to my nails. It&#x27;s subtle, not too obvious.</li>
            <li> I picked up this top coat from Sally&#x27;s for significantly more than the price listed here and I&#x27;d do it again.  This is hands down my favorite glitter top coat.  I use it on almost everything.  The glitter is super fine and tends to settle on the bottom so if it looks like regular clear topcoat when you get it make sure you give it a good shake!  Indoors, the glitter is noticeable but subtle.  Outside in the sun is where this baby really shines.  I think the glitter distribution is perfect and it dries fast too!</li>
            <li> This top coat is perfect. I saw that someone had posted it barely had any sparkles in it compared to the one her nail tech used, but went ahead and ordered it anyway... As soon as I pulled it out of the package, I thought &amp;#34;OH dang, that review was right&amp;#34;, but then I did a simple thing..... I shook it and there all the sparkle was. Because the product settles upon shipment or in between use, it really does look like you are getting ripped off, but I promise a little shake will had a TON of sparkle to your nails. I love this top coat!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind repetition. As long as I have a few things I can switch around. Pale pink nails with Northern Lights over it is lovely, put it over a shocking OPI \\&quot;I&#x27;m Not A Waitress\\&quot; Red, or over black, which just POPs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit tedious to get off, but that&#x27;s the case for ANY glitter gloss. I put on 2 or 3 layers of a really good base coat first. THEN start your build up - from whatever back ground color you&#x27;re using to another coat of base coat, THEN the Northern Lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Northern Lights SAYS it&#x27;s a &#x27;top coat&#x27;, but I accidentally scraped my finger on the wall, and when I looked, sparkles had come off. Hmmm. Not good for a topcoat. I personally prefer Seche Vite for base &amp; topcoats - they&#x27;re made for nail laquers, which is mostly what I have, and are fantastic with regular nail polish (The bottles will say &#x27;polish&#x27; or &#x27;laquer.&#x27;) OPI is pretty much 100% lacquer. China Glaze, some are. Nail POLISH is Sally Hansen, &amp; the &#x27;coordinating colors&#x27; under a given manufacturer, such as Maybelline or Olay, those are polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love them all!!!</li>
            <li> This is GREAT stuff!  I use about 3-4 coats and what you get is a subtle sparkle that has a hard finish...doesn&#x27;t chip....looks GREAT!  I bought THREE so I don&#x27;t run out.  I recommend this for anyone who wants a little bling without blowing your eyes out :)</li>
            <li> I love this polish so much. It has the smallest glitter and is incredible in the sun. I also like that it is a top coat. So you can this and be done. Not worry about another polish to put on top. I actually bough 2 of these as well. I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is one of my GO TO top coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a sparkle top coat person like I am, this is for you!  I LOVE the subtle shine it gives.  Make sure to SHAKE IT to get all that shimmer into the top coat before applying.  My little girls always ask for SPARKLES on their nails... so this is also one of their favorites!  I have 3 little girls and myself and I have a vast collection of nail polishes.  So with that in mind, it takes me quite some time to empty a bottle.  But I have actually used this bottle up numerous times.  I was excited to find it on Amazon so I didn&#x27;t have to go to the local beauty supply store with small kids with me.  And before you say, nail polish collections are different than top coats.  I will clarify that I have NUMEROUS top coats and not all of them get my vote of approval.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have much gold in my collection but I might just have to go and try out the gold hologram top coat too.  I have a soft spot for trying something I might not normally buy if it&#x27;s from a company that I know makes an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this to anyone...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I already have recommended this product to NUMEROUS friends!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a special nail polish that I had gotten at a beauty school&#x27;s manicure &amp; pedicure. When this Hologram polish arrived I didn&#x27;t think there was enough sparkles in the bottle. But, what I didn&#x27;t realize it was a top coat polish. Well, I very quickly learned that I put a color on my nails and then I used the Hologram top coat &amp; there was the sparkles on my nails. I really like the way it shows up on my nails. I am happy that I purchased it.</li>
            <li> makes all nail polish look like shimmer</li>
            <li> I love using this as a little extra detail on top of my polish.  You have to make sure to shake it up really well before each use as all the sparkle settles down to the bottom but it adds just a little bit of sparkle to any finished nail.</li>
            <li> I adore this in both silver and gold, although for some reason the gold is hard to find. This dries my polish thoroughly in a couple of minutes, and adds the coolest holographic shimmer on top. You&#x27;ve got to shake it up, though, because the very fine glitter settles at the bottom. I&#x27;ve gone through many bottles. The only downside is the price. Back in the 90&#x27;s I could get this for $4.99 for a .5 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the best glitter I have ever found. So pretty and subtle. Love love love it!!</li>
            <li> Just like the original but with glitter!</li>
            <li> I always use this polish as my topcoat.  It really does sparkle and it dries my polish instantly.  It&#x27;s great when you need to do a touch-up on your way out!  I love the glitter in it as it is very subtle and isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34; and flashy...  This is the best top coat on the market!</li>
            <li> love it. you have to try it.</li>
            <li> This polish is awesome. Really adds tiny little sparkles to your mani.  I want to put it on every one I do!</li>
            <li> Love it but I wish it was a little more glittery. Other than that if you even count that I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it I put it over relvon parfumerie beachy it&#x27;s a gold polish and all my goodness I love it.</li>
            <li> Glow!! Glossy, Glossy, Glossy!!!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is super sparkly and shiny! INM is a great brand and anything sparkly makes it even better (:</li>
            <li> I love this top coat! I get so many compliments on the shimmer and shine. It dries really fast and makes my nail polish last longer. I live in AZ so its super sunny and just makes the color pop even more.</li>
            <li> Add pretty sparkle to any polish</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t read the product description thoroughly, but I assumed it would be a clear coat that can either be worn alone or on top of another color and would give a holographic illusion. Its more like a glitter polish and the hologram isn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li> Very nice with a tiny bit of sparkle.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for, even though I was unsure initially, and it got here long before the estimated time!</li>
            <li> This holographic top coat is really stunning, it adds a little bit of sparkle to the mani without being in your face.  Its stunning in the sunlight, I particularly love it over dark colors.  I also awn the gold one which is just as stunning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Northern-Lights-Hologram-Coat-Gold/dp/B000PZ8DK4/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1410107488&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;Northern+Lights+Hologram+gold+Top+Coat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just shack it thoroughly before you start to evenly distribute the gorgeousness and I promise, you will not be disappointed.  ;) Its also a fast drying top coat which actually works.  I love and will re-purchase both the silver and the gold when I run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Don&#x27;t let the minimal appearance of the glitter in the bottle full you, this polish is packed of fine holographic glitter, JUST SHAKE IT WELL AND YOU WILL BE AMAZED, JUST GORGEOUS.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a topcoat that will make any polish holographic, this is not it.this is a cheap basecoat with very little glitter in itand while it is holographic glitter, it is not linear holographic like say, halo hues by color club. very misleading and I am not happy</li>
            <li> Northern Lights goes on just like a top coat, but gives your polish a beautiful shimmer, holographic effect, with none of the annoying gritty, glitter that&#x27;s impossible to remove. When I run low on the gold or the silver, I mix them together for a totally new effect! Highly recommended for any laquerista!</li>
            <li> I love Northerm Lights Hologram Top Coat.  I have purchase it before &amp; will only use this now!!  Love, Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Was thick I was so mad</li>
            <li> Great effect, love it!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Super dissapointed!  I&#x27;ve purchased many Northern Lights Hologram Silver top coats in the past and just received mine in the mail today and it&#x27;s nothing like the ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.  This polish is super watery and has half the amount of glitter.  When I put it on my nail I have about 10 pieces of glitter and on it and thats about it.  I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad batch or what but I&#x27;m not happy with it at all.</li>
            <li> Not very much of the holo, had to let it settle and pour all holo pearls in a 4mL bottle and even then it takes 2-3 coats to give a good scattered holo effect, goes on grainy and rough as well. It you are looking for a linear holo top coat (like Fairy Godmother by Fair Maiden) or not up to frakening the polish look for a different topcoat.</li>
            <li> Love this polish! So pretty on colors and easy to remove! The best yet!</li>
            <li> This will NOT give your polish a &amp;#34;holographic&amp;#34; effect. If that&#x27;s what you want, look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT It is a lovely, subtle, super fine glitter. You do have to shake it very well before using, but if you do, you&#x27;ll get a light and even glitter finish that dries quick.</li>
            <li> Love love love this glitter polish. My nail lady used it on me once and I just had to buy my own. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff....I now use it as my top-coat over any and every color I paint my nails/toes with!!!</li>
            <li> DIdn&#x27;t look like Hologram polish on my nails. Wouldn&#x27;t order it again. I was disappointed in the product. At leasrt it wasn &#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> Hi everyone I would like to start off by saying my brother-in-law owns this company his late grandfather started it long ago they have been around for a very long time. I have had the privilege of getting a chance to try a lot of the products and they are all of much higher quality then they use in nail salons. Unfortunately most of there professional products you can&#x27;t buy unless your licensed. Now these top costs the northern lights are fabulous the only Glitter topcoat that is self leveling that&#x27;s why you have to shake it up every time you use it but it sinks on your nails giving you a smooth shinny finish. No need for additional topcoat over it. And there acrilic powder and monimer are way better and easier on your nails that is very important to them to have top quality way less damaging to your nails. And there monimer is way less stinky and not harch smelling. I do my nails in my house all the time and no one complains about the smell I actually like it :) the out the door line is so great it drys in 45sec I love that as I hate waiting for my nails to dry I always mess them up because I start doing stuff to soon you guys know lol :D so I love out the door topcoats from inm super shiny wet look when dry. I&#x27;m not just saying this because the owner is my bro in law I&#x27;ve tryed a lot of the products and they are all top notch. I hope this has been helpful to you guys. One more thing about this glitter topcoat the self leveling glitter is like a fine dust it never looks chunky it looks very nice on top of any color it drys fast so if you want it to look more glittery you don&#x27;t have to wait for ever to do a 2nd coat.</li>
            <li> This polish is great! It dries super fast. So far I have only used it alone and applied two coats...if you don&#x27;t like the super blingy glitter polishes this is for you. I just love glitter polish period!!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Have been using it forever!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this and uses it often. Gets many compliments and they want to know where to buy it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, perfect top coat, put on top of your nail polish, dries fast and hard.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice top coat if you like some shimmer! I add this on most of my at home manicures, just because I love it so much. I have not really used it as a top coat on its own, so I can not comment on how good of a job it does protecting the nail polish from chipping, but I have used it before using another top coat and it has even better shine than with just one top coat!</li>
            <li> Northern Lights has been my favorite topcoat for quite some time now, the sparkles are gorgeous and this topcoat keeps your mani protected and shines. Highly recommended!</li>
