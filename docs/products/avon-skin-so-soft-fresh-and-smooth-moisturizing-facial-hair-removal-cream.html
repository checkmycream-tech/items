            <li>This is wonderful cream that really works.</li>
            <li>I found that the product was most effective when a liberal amount of cream was used.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll stick to Veet just for the convenience of up to seven days and the more affordable price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has happened to me that after several months I have to replace it because it stops working perfectly.</li>

            <li>Make sure to moisturize afterwards.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t experience this with Veet, where I could enjoy smooth skin for up to seven days.</li>
            <li>I left it on for five and experienced no burning sensation or breaking out</li>
            <li>It really works!!!</li>
            <li>it is very effective for me especially because I am Dominican</li>
            <li>Love it so much and smells great and not nasty like other creams!</li>
            <li>Removes any unwanted hair quickly.</li>
            <li>This easily takes off all the peach fuzz on face and upper lip just make sure you don&#x27;t leave on longer than it says I did that</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth it to me to bother with it.</li>
            <li>I only leave it on for 2-3 minutes then wipe off with a warm washcloth.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed how soft my skin was after using this product, but I seemed to have more hair immediately the following 24-48 hours.</li>
            <li>But better yet, it removed all of my facial hair easily (which is not usually the case for me with these types of products).  </li>
            <li>and you smell good while doing it.perfect for the little ones in  my house things like off</li>
            <li>This is my favorite facial removal hair because it does not burn my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was the first time I bought avon from amazon</li>
            <li>It works great on my soft dark hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the only hair removal cream I&#x27;ve used that actually smelled good.  </li>
            <li>This product removes facial hair easily.  </li>
            <li>It removed the fine hairs from my upper lip.</li>
            <li>didnt like product but got here fast</li>
            <li>The applicator is very convenient.</li>
            <li>this is so gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>and my skin was really irritated.  </li>
            <li>It absolutely helped me regain my confidence.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well for me.</li>
            <li>and it is so much cheaper than getting it  from Avon.</li>
            <li>I had tears in my eyes because I was so happy that something had finally worked plan on buying the bigger one next</li>
            <li>While applying it to my upper lip, it had a very strong odor and instantly burned.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very bearable, unlike older Nair.</li>
            <li>Worked great on upper lip, follow directions though and do not leave on past 8 minutes!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>So soft and doesn&#x27;t hyrn my face!!</li>
            <li>The first time i used it i left it on for the 2 1/2 minutes like it says but all the hair wasn&#x27;t gone</li>
            <li>Nice product did the job, but left my skin red, I only left it on 2 minutes!!</li>
            <li>I have coarse, Italian hair and am anxious to see if this product will gradually thin the hair overtime, or how quickly the hair returns, but was very happy with the results after two uses.</li>
            <li>So far I like it</li>
            <li>This was old tube of cream, the tube was cracked and not usable.</li>
            <li>AND I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been so embarrassed about my chin and upper lip hair and this makes my skin baby soft!!!</li>
            <li>The cream removes the light colored hair but not the coarse dark hair.  </li>
            <li>and I will now only buy from avon directly.</li>
            <li>Although it is less smelly than their first products.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical based on the mixed reviews and the brief set of instructions provided on the packaging, but I was happy that it worked with minimal redness afterwards.</li>
            <li>The smell of this cream is strong and not pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Giving three stars because it works for my mum, but if you have dry sensitive skin I would forego this product...</li>

            <li> Other brands tend to leave lots of hair or make my sensitive skin red for hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough, I suppose.</li>
            <li> and it won&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I never have any kind of bad reaction to it</li>
            <li> so long I can&#x27;t even pronounce them.</li>
            <li> there was absolutely no stubble left</li>
            <li> Seriously a miracle worker I receiver it just in time for school to start back up in the places I put it completely removed the hair</li>
            <li> so i left it on for 4 minutes and it took a little rubbing</li>
            <li> It might be a little red for an hour or so, but the hair is GONE.</li>
            <li> I left it on for 10 and ended up with a few burn marks.</li>
            <li> removes the hair as expected but burns my skin</li>
            <li> After use, I applied a facial moisturizer, and the redness was gone within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> When I was younger I used to use it a lot, but now, idk if they changed the formula or not but it is really harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> Took some hair off lip and chin but certainly not all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, not certain I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I also had absolutely no irritation,  redness, or other problems.  </li>
            <li> Worked no better than several other brands of the same type of product that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Nair and other products do not pick up all of my whiskers, but this does.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product even though it is a small amount ( it does last though).</li>
            <li> Cover all areas thick enough so that you cannot see through it and wait 3 minutes, and wipe off with a towel or tissue, then rinse and moisturize the area.</li>
            <li> but when I pluck it and then apply it for maximum time, it slows down regrowth.  </li>
            <li> But it hurts a little, so just test an area before you put it all</li>
            <li> This is AMAZING the smell isn&#x27;t completely awful like veet or nair</li>
            <li> tooo harsh for my skin</li>
            <li> I have tried lazer treatment but being blond it has done no good.  </li>
            <li> and so I get facial hair a lot :(</li>
            <li> but seriously that makes me feel like a man, YUCK!</li>
            <li> it has a slight odor but the lotion scent takes over and makes it not so bad</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had to use a lot of it to take the hair off, so that&#x27;s a bad thing because it&#x27;s a small tube</li>
            <li> Out of all of the facial hair removal creams that I have tried, this one was the worst!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> allergic reaction, smells bad, nasty itchy painful bumps...</li>
            <li> My skin was very badly irritated and has been irritated for 3 days since I used it.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful, and burned my skin terribly.</li>
            <li> ya the awful type.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> works just great for me removed hair like it said</li>
            <li> didnt like product but got here fast</li>
            <li> This review will be short and to the point.  The smell of this cream is strong and not pleasant.  The cream removes the light colored hair but not the coarse dark hair.  It isn&#x27;t worth it to me to bother with it.</li>
            <li> I am actually impressed with the results of this product, i was not expecting it to work but it does a good job. The first time i used it i left it on for the 2 1/2 minutes like it says but all the hair wasn&#x27;t gone so i left it on for 4 minutes and it took a little rubbing but then it all came off, it did irritate my skin leaving it red and burning for about an hour. The second time I used it i washed my face with soap and water and then put lotion on my face which helped a lot. i would recommend!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn your skin like some here removals do. So far I like it but I&#x27;ve had to use a lot of it to take the hair off, so that&#x27;s a bad thing because it&#x27;s a small tube and it won&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. It remove all my upper lip hair. But it hurts a little, so just test an area before you put it all cover your upper lip.</li>
            <li> The smell is very bearable, unlike older Nair. The applicator is very convenient. I enjoyed how soft my skin was after using this product, but I seemed to have more hair immediately the following 24-48 hours. I didn&#x27;t experience this with Veet, where I could enjoy smooth skin for up to seven days. It&#x27;s possible I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough, I suppose. I think I&#x27;ll stick to Veet just for the convenience of up to seven days and the more affordable price.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite facial removal hair because it does not burn my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has happened to me that after several months I have to replace it because it stops working perfectly. But it is great and always choose to buy it.</li>
            <li> Out of all of the facial hair removal creams that I have tried, this one was the worst!  While applying it to my upper lip, it had a very strong odor and instantly burned.  After only 2 minutes, I removed it.  My skin was very badly irritated and has been irritated for 3 days since I used it.  I promptly threw it away and will never use it again.</li>
            <li> does not work well at all</li>
            <li> Worked great on upper lip, follow directions though and do not leave on past 8 minutes! I left it on for 10 and ended up with a few burn marks.</li>
            <li> Works as well as anything I&#x27;ve tried.I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is AMAZING the smell isn&#x27;t completely awful like veet or nair it has a slight odor but the lotion scent takes over and makes it not so bad it says to leave it on for two to three minutes I left it on for five and experienced no burning sensation or breaking out this is so gentle on the skin and I love it is very effective for me especially because I am Dominican and we tend to have a lot of hair</li>
            <li> This was old tube of cream, the tube was cracked and not usable. Very disappointing. It was the first time I bought avon from amazon and I will now only buy from avon directly.</li>
            <li> This easily takes off all the peach fuzz on face and upper lip just make sure you don&#x27;t leave on longer than it says I did that and my skin was really irritated.  I accidentally left on20 minutes longer than u are suppose to.  Probably doesn&#x27;t work for anything thicker than peach fuzz though.</li>
            <li> This product removes facial hair easily.  I followed directions and had no problems or any discomfort what so ever! Will use again!</li>
            <li> removes the hair as expected but burns my skin</li>
            <li> I am so impressed!  This is the only hair removal cream I&#x27;ve used that actually smelled good.  But better yet, it removed all of my facial hair easily (which is not usually the case for me with these types of products).  I also had absolutely no irritation,  redness, or other problems.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Nice product did the job, but left my skin red, I only left it on 2 minutes!!</li>
            <li> Love it ! Does what it&#x27;s suppose to!</li>
            <li> Took some hair off lip and chin but certainly not all. Still had to use tweezers. Worked no better than several other brands of the same type of product that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this product.</li>
            <li> I have PCOS and so I get facial hair a lot :( But I have been using this for years and it works so great! I never have any kind of bad reaction to it AND I have sensitive skin. I would recommend this to anyone trying to get rid of that pesky hair!!!</li>
            <li> Works well, just don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> allergic reaction, smells bad, nasty itchy painful bumps...</li>
            <li> It really works!!! I&#x27;ve been so embarrassed about my chin and upper lip hair and this makes my skin baby soft!!!</li>
            <li> ...It does the job, I just don&#x27;t like the smell. Although it is less smelly than their first products.</li>
            <li> Gave a chemical burn just from test area and I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin. Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical based on the mixed reviews and the brief set of instructions provided on the packaging, but I was happy that it worked with minimal redness afterwards. I found that the product was most effective when a liberal amount of cream was used. After use, I applied a facial moisturizer, and the redness was gone within a few minutes. I have coarse, Italian hair and am anxious to see if this product will gradually thin the hair overtime, or how quickly the hair returns, but was very happy with the results after two uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything like this. I don&#x27;t have a lot of body hair to begin with, but just wanted to get rid of any fuzz, as blonde as it may have been.&lt;br /&gt;2 mins did nothing. 4 minutes worked for me, but only a bit. I had to wait two days and apply it again for 5 mins before it all came off.&lt;br /&gt;Still, not certain I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> tooo harsh for my skin</li>
            <li> This is wonderful cream that really works. It absolutely helped me regain my confidence. It removed the fine hairs from my upper lip. I tried waxing but it didn&#x27;t work. I feel so much better looking in the mirror to see my face again.</li>
            <li> I recently moved and lost my avon lady. This stuff works really well for me. Other brands tend to leave lots of hair or make my sensitive skin red for hours. This stuff is awesome! I&#x27;m very glad I found it on amazon and would be happy to recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful, and burned my skin terribly. I would give it 0 stars if I could. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many products for my fuzz on my chin and lip and this one works the best. This is my second time buying it and it is so much cheaper than getting it  from Avon. Cover all areas thick enough so that you cannot see through it and wait 3 minutes, and wipe off with a towel or tissue, then rinse and moisturize the area. It might be a little red for an hour or so, but the hair is GONE. Nair and other products do not pick up all of my whiskers, but this does. I will continue to buy this product even though it is a small amount ( it does last though). I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love this! So soft and doesn&#x27;t hyrn my face!! Love it so much and smells great and not nasty like other creams!</li>
            <li> My mother loves this stuff, so I bought two. When I was younger I used to use it a lot, but now, idk if they changed the formula or not but it is really harsh on my skin. Giving three stars because it works for my mum, but if you have dry sensitive skin I would forego this product...</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin. Removes any unwanted hair quickly. I only leave it on for 2-3 minutes then wipe off with a warm washcloth. Make sure to moisturize afterwards.</li>
            <li> Works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> great to keep the bug away and you smell good while doing it.perfect for the little ones in  my house things like off have chemicles in them so long I can&#x27;t even pronounce them.</li>
            <li> It works great on my soft dark hair.  I do have some seriously coarse hair on my chin, ya the awful type.  I have tried lazer treatment but being blond it has done no good.  I was hopeful about this product.  The hair showed up after child birth, twice.  It multiplied with each birth.  This product does NOT get rid of the hair but when I pluck it and then apply it for maximum time, it slows down regrowth.  However if I shave it off, it does not help.  The lazer technician said to shave not pluck but seriously that makes me feel like a man, YUCK!</li>
            <li> Seriously a miracle worker I receiver it just in time for school to start back up in the places I put it completely removed the hair there was absolutely no stubble left I had tears in my eyes because I was so happy that something had finally worked plan on buying the bigger one next</li>
