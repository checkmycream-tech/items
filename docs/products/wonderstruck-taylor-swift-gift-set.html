            <li>I also like supporting Taylor Swift since she is a great role model for this generation.</li>
            <li>my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume</li>
            <li>Got a set for each of my daughters, they love it too.</li>
            <li>Hopefully we don&#x27;t have too many boys knocking our front door.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this more than once as a gift for others.  </li>
            <li>Bought for my niece then got more for me.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>My daughter wanted this for Christmas, She was so pleased on Christmas morning to find that she received it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to any and everyone:)</li>
            <li>It smells more like a dessert than anything, but it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>The smell is very sweet, maybe a touch of \\&quot;floral\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It also also an attractive smell for adult women.</li>
            <li>Luckily I found it for $40 at TJ-Maxx :)</li>
            <li>But overall great perfume.</li>
            <li>It has a sweet scene, but it doesn&#x27;t smell too strong.</li>
            <li>Sweet and cheerful.</li>
            <li>although the smell doesn&#x27;t last too much once you wear it, anyway, the smell is delicious and my daughter really like it.</li>
            <li>Giant bottle of Taylor Swift Wonderstruck perfume and good sized lotion and shower gel...</li>
            <li>never again it looks like a free sample however not 27.00 worth......</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve gotten compliments during school on how good I smell, I do wish the scent would last longer.</li>
            <li>For me, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;ll probably last a good 2 - 2 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>It is a very pretty set.</li>
            <li>This box set has the large bottle with the all important to a &amp;#34;swiftie&amp;#34; metal charms on it.</li>
            <li>But the price for these three items ($55) is definitely the best price around, as this is usually what it costs for one perfume bottle.</li>
            <li>I have the Enchanted Wonderstruck (red box), which I love.</li>
            <li>I guess I was expecting more when I opened the box--as in more quantity of the perfume and lotion, but the items seem very small for the size of the box.</li>
            <li>It was delivered pretty fast</li>
            <li>so I guess I should&#x27;ve looked more carefully.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>And sooooo much cheaper than in the stores....</li>
            <li>The smaller bottles we have gotten did not have those special charms that are shown in advertisements.  </li>
            <li>This box is very pretty, comes with a medium sized perfume bottle, a tiny perfume bottle, and some body lotion.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my 17 year old cousin who loves Taylor Swift.</li>
            <li>cause the smell does not last too much</li>
            <li>Yeah, so my 23 year-old daughter got me hooked on Taylor Swift&#x27;s perfume at nearly 50.  </li>
            <li>This was a christmas present for our 9 year old.  </li>

            <li> my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume</li>
            <li> Meet my expectations.  Delivered on time, before Xmas.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my 17 year old cousin who loves Taylor Swift. This box is very pretty, comes with a medium sized perfume bottle, a tiny perfume bottle, and some body lotion. I guess I was expecting more when I opened the box--as in more quantity of the perfume and lotion, but the items seem very small for the size of the box. But the measurements are on here so I guess I should&#x27;ve looked more carefully. But the price for these three items ($55) is definitely the best price around, as this is usually what it costs for one perfume bottle. The smell is very sweet, maybe a touch of \\&quot;floral\\&quot;. It smells more like a dessert than anything, but it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> Bought as gift, very happy with my purchase. Thanks</li>
            <li> My daughter really liked this product, the presentation was excellent and the service too, although the smell doesn&#x27;t last too much once you wear it, anyway, the smell is delicious and my daughter really like it. I gave it 4 stars cause the smell does not last too much, everything else is perfect.</li>
            <li> Treat yourself to this gift set.  Everything from the packaging to the product draws you in.  The fragrance is subtle yet distinct.  I also like supporting Taylor Swift since she is a great role model for this generation.</li>
            <li> Gift that was well-received.She squealed so it was a hit.I assume it got a great rating, she took itt with her.</li>
            <li> This box set has the large bottle with the all important to a &amp;#34;swiftie&amp;#34; metal charms on it. The smaller bottles we have gotten did not have those special charms that are shown in advertisements.  The bottle almost 5&amp;#34; tall. The body lotion and scented bath gel are both just under 6&amp;#34; tall. The price I paid was a bargain. Could have never paid what they were asking at department stores for the same. The Taylor Swift fan in my life is absolutely thrilled. It is a very pretty set.</li>
            <li> Gift set is great, scent is fabulous &amp; stays with you. Got a set for each of my daughters, they love it too.</li>
            <li> This is great! Giant bottle of Taylor Swift Wonderstruck perfume and good sized lotion and shower gel... And sooooo much cheaper than in the stores.... This is my favorite scent!!</li>
            <li> I thought for the price of the perfume I would have received a larger amount for that reason never again it looks like a free sample however not 27.00 worth......</li>
            <li> This was a christmas present for our 9 year old.  She no longer trys to sneak my wife&#x27;s perfume as she loves this stuff.  I think it smells nice too.  Hopefully we don&#x27;t have too many boys knocking our front door.  It might be time to mount my shotgun above the door.</li>
            <li> Yeah, so my 23 year-old daughter got me hooked on Taylor Swift&#x27;s perfume at nearly 50.  This stuff smells terrific!  I use it almost every day.  :-D</li>
            <li> Delicious fragrance. Wear it almost every day. For women of all ages, in my opinion. Taylor is WONDERSTRUCK personified.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this more than once as a gift for others.  It&#x27;s both a good value, and the scent is nice.  Everyone I have given this to has liked it and was happy to receive it.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it! It was a great price for the size of the perfume plus it came with a lotion and body wash.  It was delivered pretty fast it wa a good gift.</li>
            <li> I smelled this perfume at Macy&#x27;s. It has a sweet scene, but it doesn&#x27;t smell too strong. but I refused to pay $60.00 for it. Luckily I found it for $40 at TJ-Maxx :)</li>
            <li> I want to start off by saying this perfume smells great. I would say it&#x27;s best for preteens and teens because of the sweet scent. Although I&#x27;ve gotten compliments during school on how good I smell, I do wish the scent would last longer. For me, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;ll probably last a good 2 - 2 1/2 hours. But overall great perfume.</li>
            <li> Smells way off. I have the Enchanted Wonderstruck (red box), which I love. This, not so much :(</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this perfume! It shipped very quickly!</li>
            <li> My niece thanked me twice for the gift.  She loved it.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. Bought for my niece then got more for me.  Sweet and cheerful.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful. I love it. It was in a beautiful bottle, and a beautiful box. My semi hoarder self can&#x27;t throw the box away even though it is empty.</li>
            <li> the smell is so good, and it&#x27;s really in a very good price. Maybe next time I‘ll by for my friend.  I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this for Christmas, She was so pleased on Christmas morning to find that she received it. It also also an attractive smell for adult women.</li>
            <li> Beautiful box and product smells great! I would recommend it to any and everyone:) shipping wasn&#x27;t to bad either.</li>
            <li> My sister was really happy with it</li>
