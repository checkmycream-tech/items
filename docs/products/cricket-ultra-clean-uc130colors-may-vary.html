            <li>I wonder if the reason for all the good ratings has something to do with the way this seller keeps emailing and pressuring buyers to review the product?  </li>

            <li>Love these combs...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products to that.  </li>
            <li>Most of these reviews were from women with curly hair.</li>
            <li>The combs are well made, durable - mine has fallen in the shower many times and survived a rabbit chewing.</li>
            <li>These are ok.</li>
            <li>I can confidently untangle my hair without feeling like I&#x27;m breaking my strands.</li>

            <li>:)</li>

            <li>Love love love.  </li>
            <li>I love these combs.</li>
            <li>Perfect for mixed hair.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found these Cricket combs instead.</li>
            <li>I love this comb.  </li>
            <li>The larger comb is awesome for when I have rinsed and let my hair stay covered in a towel with leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li>They are sturdy, fit well in the hand, and make de-tangling very easy.</li>
            <li>My hair is not ethnic, but still very curly, and many comb teeth have been sacrificed in fighting the good fight against my tangles.  </li>
            <li>There is a very cool groove in the &amp;#34;handle.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>The smaller comb is very good for detangling hair after a shampoo.  </li>
            <li>so a wide tooth comb is perfect.</li>
            <li>Great for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>It has widely spaced teeth that are perfect for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>They comb through hair easily.</li>
            <li>These are great for detangling my hair &amp; I love having the smaller one for my overnight bag.</li>
            <li>They are strong and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold.</li>
            <li>It is easy to handle, fits well in your hand.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold.</li>
            <li>and it is easy to get through the tangles.</li>
            <li>Also, the way they are shaped makes them easy to hold when wet/slippery.</li>
            <li>It is easy to untangle your hair with these and minimize split ends and breakage.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Gets tangles out easy for her.</li>
            <li>This has been great, and  I love that it comes with a smaller one for travel or your purse.</li>
            <li>After the shower, a brush easily goes through my hair for styling.</li>
            <li>The tines are strong as well</li>
            <li>The larger one I use for styling after blow-drying and straightening for a beautiful textured style.</li>
            <li>Nice combs but be aware that you may not get the color pictured.</li>
            <li>What seemed like a huge amount of plastic handle turned out making them easy to get a grip on.  </li>
            <li>I also have fine hair.</li>
            <li>The Untra Clean comb is much rougher than the Ultra Smooth and does not feel as good to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The comb is made to fit your hand so it makes it easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, easy to use</li>
            <li>the best comb to use with wet hair!!!</li>
            <li>smaller comb is great for in the shower, if you&#x27;re a curly girl like me, and removing tangles or distributing conditioner with your fingers just isn&#x27;t doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A happy surprise, and they will last forever.</li>
            <li>They have a molded handle which makes it fit in your hand</li>
            <li>but they are fantastic.</li>
            <li>These are great for my coarse, 4c hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically, I recommend the Ultra Smooth -</li>
            <li>(Cricket Ultra Smooth Hair Detangler Comb infused with Argan Oil)</li>
            <li>Great combs- mine came in different colors from the picture-</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really well-made and smooth for use in de-tangling hair.</li>
            <li>And the material is totally smooth, so it won&#x27;t ever snag my hair.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>However they are nice, heavy-duty, and very wide-toothed combs.</li>
            <li>very compact and handy when I need to comb my hair when I am out.</li>
            <li>I put the smaller comb in the shower, once I put conditioner in, I use it to comb it through and it works great.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and just the right size!</li>
            <li>and I have super fine hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li>They somehow detangle every knot known to man in my straight, fine hair that tangles very easily.</li>
            <li>The smaller one is very handy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a good wide-toothed comb for several years, and I&#x27;ve found it in the Cricket Ultra Clean!</li>
            <li>light, ergonomically perfect to hold when your hand is already slick with conditioner and basically brings order to chaos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The larger one I received was not quite as smooth as I would have liked but ok.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I was heartbroken when my original Matrix broke...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great for those of us with long and/or coarser hair.</li>
            <li>And the travel comb is perfect for small purses.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced the 5-star reviews were just excited that there are two travel combs.</li>
            <li>I am then able to more easily comb my hair with a regular comb.  </li>
            <li>and both combs go right through without damaging my hair.!</li>
            <li>The larger of the two combs is excellent for general combing.</li>
            <li>These are my wet hair combs - they&#x27;re great for in the shower with conditioner, and for combing through after towel drying to detangle without pulling on the hair.</li>
            <li>Great for getting tangles out of wet hair without damaging it.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for my thick, textured hair.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for coming conditioner through your hair, or combing thick hair.</li>
            <li>They are very sturdy and I love the colors</li>
            <li>The large comb is huge but fits comfortably in my hand.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are just super combs.</li>
            <li>Super sturdy.</li>
            <li>Got through my nearly waist length, wavy, color treated hair very easily while wet!&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>Based on the product reviews, I thought it&#x27;d be God&#x27;s gift to hair, but it is more like putting an electric mixer in my hair and turning it on high.</li>
            <li>My old one looks as good as my new one!</li>
            <li>These combs are SUPER wide tooth (more than anticipated), but my kids love to play with them.  </li>
            <li>The little one is great for purses</li>
            <li>I needed to replace an old comb and thought it was cute that it came with a travel sized one and in such nice colors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it comes with an extra mini brush however, it does nothing for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>The larger comb is ideal to use in the shower and the smaller one to use while conditioning.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for my thin hair.</li>
            <li>There are good quality combs, but it was my fault that I didn&#x27;t look at the dimensions carefully before I buy it.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best at getting through my 2 yr old&#x27;s curls with minimal complaining.  </li>
            <li>This comb is the secret to having gorgeous hair like the Wen girls or in the VS fashion shows!!</li>
            <li>Fun colors too--</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a good deal to get the normal comb with the mini one too!</li>
            <li>I use this right out of the shower to take the knots out of my hair without pulling a lot of hair out.  </li>
            <li>i have very fine hair which is easily damaged by other brushes and combs.</li>
            <li>The material is very durable and stays clean.  </li>
            <li>They keep clean and don&#x27;t stain, plus there is no dumb logo that will rub off in my hair/hand.</li>
            <li>And the distance between the teeth of the comb is large!</li>
            <li>The large comb is great quality as well but is a little too large.</li>
            <li>The combs are sturdy, breeze through very curly hair easily, and are overall fantastic.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the tag explaining that they&#x27;re treated to resist bacteria.  </li>
            <li>Soap and hot water takes care of comb bacteria without the need for infused bactericides.  </li>
            <li>Love the way these quickly detangle my dry hair!</li>
            <li>and I can get a better grip, but not enough to brush the tangles out.</li>
            <li>These combs work really well!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed - I was using a brush to comb out my tangles</li>
            <li>I love putting the smaller comb in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just got it this morning and instantly fell in love it.</li>
            <li>I love that this set comes with a big one and a mini size one.</li>
            <li>These combs work VERY well on damp, tangled hair!  </li>
            <li>I still have my first set from over 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>I got a pretty blue/purple combo for colors</li>
            <li>These are good heavy duty combs that come in snappy colors.  </li>
            <li>Despite not really knowing much about the product I liked the anti-bacterial qualities advertised.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and will literally stretch and snap if I use anything else on it when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t strung a string/rope to hang the smaller comb, but it could easily be done and added to a shower caddy.</li>
            <li>so I hang it on a hook next to my dresser where I can grab it easily.</li>
            <li>I have no idea why this is, but it certainly makes me happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even care about the large comb.</li>
            <li>I use the large comb after showering.  </li>
            <li>These combs are large and have real presence.</li>
            <li>They are quite flat and slide easily into any handbag.</li>
            <li>Durable and work really well.</li>
            <li>Trying to get rid of my knots hurts just as much (if not worse)</li>
            <li>Both are very sturdy, well made.</li>
            <li>Both combs also seem very durable.</li>
            <li>reasonable price</li>
            <li>But, it will comb  your hair straight and pull curls out.  </li>
            <li>The cricket comb works really well for me.</li>
            <li>It also came in really fast, I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li>They are very well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li>I really like these Combs.</li>
            <li>They are very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any cracks or damage to them though, so they seem to be very sturdy</li>
            <li>No build up, very reliable combs.</li>
            <li>They are just ok .Not better or worse than many other ones on the market.</li>
            <li>I have long hair that tangles easily, so I needed a comb that would untangle my hair without breaking it off.</li>
            <li>Purchased this product mainly for the smaller comb, and it is a good to use to work conditioner through wet hair.</li>
            <li>For color reference, I got a large clear comb, and the mini was bright green!</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and long</li>
            <li>The wide grip is actually curved a little on both sides which makes it fit very nicely in my palm.</li>
            <li>The teeth are pretty far apart.</li>
            <li>They are very smooth and outperformed by more expensive combs.</li>
            <li>Slight contour to fit Bette in your hand!  </li>
            <li>Even though the smaller comb is a \\&quot;travel\\&quot; comb, I actually like it much better.</li>
            <li>It is a decent comb,  seems well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it is about the smaller comb, but it combs through the most tangled wet hair like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these combs.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these combs.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>High quality combs.</li>
            <li>I love the little one for the shower (I hung it on the shower rack with a piece of ribbon through the hole).</li>
            <li>Love that I have one for home and a little one for travel.</li>
            <li>(first set I ordered was a clear large comb and orange small comb, and the second set was a beautiful blue large comb and lilac/purple smaller comb).</li>
            <li>I got a large clear comb--gave it to my Nana--and a small purple comb; they are very sturdy and I love purple</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy with the random picking.</li>
            <li>Not too heavy of a plastic and not too light either!</li>
            <li>Thick plastic with a nice groove for your hands/fingers.</li>
            <li>Also, the Cricket comb has a nice thick area by which to hold it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly why because they don&#x27;t look much different from other combs, but there is something very special about the design.</li>
            <li>I have lots of fine hair that gets easily tangled (is is wavy and down to my mid back)</li>
            <li>I find that with the large comb I am able to get through my thick curly hair with just conditioner in.  </li>
            <li>I keep the smaller one in my purse, mainly because it IS small and flat, although it&#x27;s not the greatest for combing dry hair.  </li>
            <li>melted a little bit, but I just filed it down with a nail file and it is still as good as new!</li>
            <li>used the big one that comes with it very much.</li>
            <li>Well, first of all there are actually two.</li>
            <li>Between the two, I do prefer the small one because it fits in my hand better</li>
            <li>Love the small comb.</li>
            <li>I like the small one better</li>
            <li>I really love the small comb.</li>
            <li>I was just expecting these to be normal cheap plastic combs, but these are VERY well made for the price and are actually bigger than I expected!</li>
            <li>Both combs have a little bit of a lip on one side of the handle part which makes them easy to hold.</li>
            <li>The small comb, or free one, is what I really wanted.  </li>
            <li>The brushes gently untangle my wet hair and that is exactly the reason why I bought them.</li>
            <li>Not only does my hair fall out less, but my hair actually felt softer!&lt;br /&gt;Honestly a magic comb!</li>
            <li>(The large one is enormous.  </li>
            <li>Great for brushing wet hair, hair that&#x27;s been loosely curled, &amp; wavy hair that has air dried.</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair and can&#x27;t use just any kind of comb.</li>
            <li>They are awesome little combs and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these combs to anyone who normally hears several &amp;#34;pops&amp;#34; when coming or brushing through hair.</li>
            <li>However, every time I shower with this thing (an Aveda worker instructed me to only comb my hair thoroughly when wet), I end up pulling huge clumps of hair out.</li>
            <li>The ends of the brush are not smooth so the brush doesn&#x27;t feel smooth at all on my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>I always break combs with my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitatant to spend a little more than usual on a comb, but I am so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>I have massive hair (really like the of four people)</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and can&#x27;t use a bristle brush.  </li>
            <li>I already had an old old set of them that I don&#x27;t even remember where or when I bought them</li>
            <li>Cheap combs that catch in  my hair because the plastic is not completely smooth.</li>
            <li>The green comb&#x27;s tines are really too close together to be as useful for a curly-haired girl.</li>
            <li>The larger comb is a nice, thick and durable plastic.  </li>
            <li>I got bright green (small) and purpleish blue (large).</li>
            <li>- works great or dry or wet hair - thick and wavy/curly is what I have and these are now my go to combs.  </li>
            <li>you can definitely feel the seems, but they are a decent quality construction and don&#x27;t catch on my hair or cause any issues so I don&#x27;t see an issue with that.</li>
            <li>High quality combs &amp; I expect them to last for quite a while!</li>
            <li>The only downside I have found is that they are a little bit difficult to hold while you&#x27;re combing, but once you get used to it they work great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a wide tooth comb that I could carry in my purse and this was exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not afraid that my knotted hair will break them like they did on my previous brush.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no sharp plastic from the manufacturing process.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not sharp, which means it doesn&#x27;t snag and break your hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine, but has thick, wavy volume, so I need a wider comb.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one thing to have a wide tooth comb, but this was a bit much.  </li>
            <li>Because my hair is so curly, it&#x27;s the only thing I can use that doesn&#x27;t pull out my soft curls and turn them to frizz.</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower with conditioner in my hair to try to minimize the damage of brushing your hair when it&#x27;s wet, and then it&#x27;s much easier to brush when I get out.</li>
            <li>These are thick and sturdy and in no way feel cheap to me.</li>
            <li>The wet brush is fantastic if your hair is just super hard to brush/comb when wet.  </li>
            <li>One lives in my purse (the larger blue one pictured here) and two live in my house.</li>
            <li>I received the small orange comb, but the large comb was white and not that pretty blue.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many people actually tried the product before leaving so many 5-star reviews, but I&#x27;m horribly disappointed, and I just went back to my former brush.</li>
            <li>I love combing my hair so when my old Conair comb got too dirty, I searched for a new one but came across this one.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend these combs enough, especially if you have naturally curly hair that doesn&#x27;t do well with a brush.</li>
            <li>Super wide teeth help keep down the frizzies.  </li>
            <li>Mine weren&#x27;t in the advertised colors (I received them in purple and green) but they&#x27;re pretty.</li>
            <li>Great little wide toothed combs for shower, travel, and for brushing delicate wet hair!</li>
            <li>Within a few days of using them, I went right back on Amazon to buy another set to leave in different bathrooms around my home and in various purses and backpacks.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast (less than a week)</li>
            <li>I bought these to get the tangles out of my fine, thin hair when I wash it.</li>

            <li> fine hair&#x27;s dream!</li>

            <li> Love these combs...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products to that.  </li>
            <li> Most of these reviews were from women with curly hair.</li>
            <li> The combs are well made, durable - mine has fallen in the shower many times and survived a rabbit chewing.</li>
            <li> These are ok.</li>
            <li> I can confidently untangle my hair without feeling like I&#x27;m breaking my strands.</li>

            <li> Love love love.  </li>
            <li> I love these combs.</li>

            <li> I am so glad I found these Cricket combs instead.</li>
            <li> I love this comb.  </li>
            <li> The larger comb is awesome for when I have rinsed and let my hair stay covered in a towel with leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li> They are sturdy, fit well in the hand, and make de-tangling very easy.</li>
            <li> My hair is not ethnic, but still very curly, and many comb teeth have been sacrificed in fighting the good fight against my tangles.  </li>
            <li> There is a very cool groove in the &amp;#34;handle.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> The smaller comb is very good for detangling hair after a shampoo.  </li>
            <li> so a wide tooth comb is perfect.</li>
            <li> Great for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> It has widely spaced teeth that are perfect for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> They comb through hair easily.</li>
            <li> These are great for detangling my hair &amp; I love having the smaller one for my overnight bag.</li>

            <li> Easy to hold.</li>
            <li> It is easy to handle, fits well in your hand.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold.</li>
            <li> and it is easy to get through the tangles.</li>
            <li> Also, the way they are shaped makes them easy to hold when wet/slippery.</li>
            <li> It is easy to untangle your hair with these and minimize split ends and breakage.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Gets tangles out easy for her.</li>
            <li> This has been great, and  I love that it comes with a smaller one for travel or your purse.</li>
            <li> After the shower, a brush easily goes through my hair for styling.</li>
            <li> The tines are strong as well</li>
            <li> The larger one I use for styling after blow-drying and straightening for a beautiful textured style.</li>
            <li> Nice combs but be aware that you may not get the color pictured.</li>
            <li> What seemed like a huge amount of plastic handle turned out making them easy to get a grip on.  </li>
            <li> I also have fine hair.</li>
            <li> The Untra Clean comb is much rougher than the Ultra Smooth and does not feel as good to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The comb is made to fit your hand so it makes it easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, easy to use</li>
            <li> the best comb to use with wet hair!!!</li>
            <li> smaller comb is great for in the shower, if you&#x27;re a curly girl like me, and removing tangles or distributing conditioner with your fingers just isn&#x27;t doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A happy surprise, and they will last forever.</li>
            <li> They have a molded handle which makes it fit in your hand</li>
            <li> but they are fantastic.</li>
            <li> These are great for my coarse, 4c hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, I recommend the Ultra Smooth -</li>
            <li> (Cricket Ultra Smooth Hair Detangler Comb infused with Argan Oil)</li>
            <li> Great combs- mine came in different colors from the picture-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really well-made and smooth for use in de-tangling hair.</li>
            <li> And the material is totally smooth, so it won&#x27;t ever snag my hair.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> However they are nice, heavy-duty, and very wide-toothed combs.</li>
            <li> very compact and handy when I need to comb my hair when I am out.</li>
            <li> I put the smaller comb in the shower, once I put conditioner in, I use it to comb it through and it works great.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and just the right size!</li>
            <li> and I have super fine hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li> They somehow detangle every knot known to man in my straight, fine hair that tangles very easily.</li>
            <li> The smaller one is very handy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good wide-toothed comb for several years, and I&#x27;ve found it in the Cricket Ultra Clean!</li>
            <li> light, ergonomically perfect to hold when your hand is already slick with conditioner and basically brings order to chaos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The larger one I received was not quite as smooth as I would have liked but ok.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I was heartbroken when my original Matrix broke...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great for those of us with long and/or coarser hair.</li>
            <li> And the travel comb is perfect for small purses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced the 5-star reviews were just excited that there are two travel combs.</li>
            <li> I am then able to more easily comb my hair with a regular comb.  </li>
            <li> and both combs go right through without damaging my hair.!</li>
            <li> The larger of the two combs is excellent for general combing.</li>
            <li> These are my wet hair combs - they&#x27;re great for in the shower with conditioner, and for combing through after towel drying to detangle without pulling on the hair.</li>
            <li> Great for getting tangles out of wet hair without damaging it.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for my thick, textured hair.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for coming conditioner through your hair, or combing thick hair.</li>
            <li> They are very sturdy and I love the colors</li>
            <li> The large comb is huge but fits comfortably in my hand.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are just super combs.</li>
            <li> Super sturdy.</li>
            <li> Got through my nearly waist length, wavy, color treated hair very easily while wet!&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Based on the product reviews, I thought it&#x27;d be God&#x27;s gift to hair, but it is more like putting an electric mixer in my hair and turning it on high.</li>
            <li> My old one looks as good as my new one!</li>
            <li> These combs are SUPER wide tooth (more than anticipated), but my kids love to play with them.  </li>
            <li> The little one is great for purses</li>
            <li> I needed to replace an old comb and thought it was cute that it came with a travel sized one and in such nice colors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it comes with an extra mini brush however, it does nothing for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> The larger comb is ideal to use in the shower and the smaller one to use while conditioning.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> There are good quality combs, but it was my fault that I didn&#x27;t look at the dimensions carefully before I buy it.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best at getting through my 2 yr old&#x27;s curls with minimal complaining.  </li>
            <li> This comb is the secret to having gorgeous hair like the Wen girls or in the VS fashion shows!!</li>
            <li> Fun colors too--</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a good deal to get the normal comb with the mini one too!</li>
            <li> I use this right out of the shower to take the knots out of my hair without pulling a lot of hair out.  </li>
            <li> i have very fine hair which is easily damaged by other brushes and combs.</li>
            <li> The material is very durable and stays clean.  </li>
            <li> They keep clean and don&#x27;t stain, plus there is no dumb logo that will rub off in my hair/hand.</li>
            <li> And the distance between the teeth of the comb is large!</li>
            <li> The large comb is great quality as well but is a little too large.</li>
            <li> The combs are sturdy, breeze through very curly hair easily, and are overall fantastic.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the tag explaining that they&#x27;re treated to resist bacteria.  </li>
            <li> Soap and hot water takes care of comb bacteria without the need for infused bactericides.  </li>
            <li> Love the way these quickly detangle my dry hair!</li>
            <li> and I can get a better grip, but not enough to brush the tangles out.</li>
            <li> These combs work really well!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed - I was using a brush to comb out my tangles</li>
            <li> I love putting the smaller comb in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just got it this morning and instantly fell in love it.</li>
            <li> I love that this set comes with a big one and a mini size one.</li>
            <li> These combs work VERY well on damp, tangled hair!  </li>
            <li> I still have my first set from over 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> I got a pretty blue/purple combo for colors</li>
            <li> These are good heavy duty combs that come in snappy colors.  </li>
            <li> Despite not really knowing much about the product I liked the anti-bacterial qualities advertised.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and will literally stretch and snap if I use anything else on it when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t strung a string/rope to hang the smaller comb, but it could easily be done and added to a shower caddy.</li>
            <li> so I hang it on a hook next to my dresser where I can grab it easily.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why this is, but it certainly makes me happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even care about the large comb.</li>
            <li> I use the large comb after showering.  </li>
            <li> These combs are large and have real presence.</li>
            <li> They are quite flat and slide easily into any handbag.</li>
            <li> Durable and work really well.</li>
            <li> Trying to get rid of my knots hurts just as much (if not worse)</li>
            <li> Both are very sturdy, well made.</li>
            <li> Both combs also seem very durable.</li>
            <li> reasonable price</li>
            <li> But, it will comb  your hair straight and pull curls out.  </li>
            <li> The cricket comb works really well for me.</li>
            <li> It also came in really fast, I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> They are very well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I really like these Combs.</li>
            <li> They are very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any cracks or damage to them though, so they seem to be very sturdy</li>
            <li> No build up, very reliable combs.</li>
            <li> They are just ok .Not better or worse than many other ones on the market.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that tangles easily, so I needed a comb that would untangle my hair without breaking it off.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product mainly for the smaller comb, and it is a good to use to work conditioner through wet hair.</li>
            <li> For color reference, I got a large clear comb, and the mini was bright green!</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and long</li>
            <li> The wide grip is actually curved a little on both sides which makes it fit very nicely in my palm.</li>
            <li> The teeth are pretty far apart.</li>
            <li> They are very smooth and outperformed by more expensive combs.</li>
            <li> Slight contour to fit Bette in your hand!  </li>
            <li> Even though the smaller comb is a \\&quot;travel\\&quot; comb, I actually like it much better.</li>
            <li> It is a decent comb,  seems well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about the smaller comb, but it combs through the most tangled wet hair like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these combs.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these combs.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> High quality combs.</li>
            <li> I love the little one for the shower (I hung it on the shower rack with a piece of ribbon through the hole).</li>
            <li> Love that I have one for home and a little one for travel.</li>
            <li> (first set I ordered was a clear large comb and orange small comb, and the second set was a beautiful blue large comb and lilac/purple smaller comb).</li>
            <li> I got a large clear comb--gave it to my Nana--and a small purple comb; they are very sturdy and I love purple</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m happy with the random picking.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy of a plastic and not too light either!</li>
            <li> Thick plastic with a nice groove for your hands/fingers.</li>
            <li> Also, the Cricket comb has a nice thick area by which to hold it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly why because they don&#x27;t look much different from other combs, but there is something very special about the design.</li>
            <li> I have lots of fine hair that gets easily tangled (is is wavy and down to my mid back)</li>
            <li> I find that with the large comb I am able to get through my thick curly hair with just conditioner in.  </li>
            <li> I keep the smaller one in my purse, mainly because it IS small and flat, although it&#x27;s not the greatest for combing dry hair.  </li>
            <li> melted a little bit, but I just filed it down with a nail file and it is still as good as new!</li>
            <li> used the big one that comes with it very much.</li>
            <li> Well, first of all there are actually two.</li>
            <li> Between the two, I do prefer the small one because it fits in my hand better</li>
            <li> Love the small comb.</li>
            <li> I like the small one better</li>
            <li> I really love the small comb.</li>
            <li> I was just expecting these to be normal cheap plastic combs, but these are VERY well made for the price and are actually bigger than I expected!</li>
            <li> Both combs have a little bit of a lip on one side of the handle part which makes them easy to hold.</li>
            <li> The small comb, or free one, is what I really wanted.  </li>
            <li> The brushes gently untangle my wet hair and that is exactly the reason why I bought them.</li>
            <li> Not only does my hair fall out less, but my hair actually felt softer!&lt;br /&gt;Honestly a magic comb!</li>
            <li> (The large one is enormous.  </li>
            <li> Great for brushing wet hair, hair that&#x27;s been loosely curled, &amp; wavy hair that has air dried.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and can&#x27;t use just any kind of comb.</li>
            <li> They are awesome little combs and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these combs to anyone who normally hears several &amp;#34;pops&amp;#34; when coming or brushing through hair.</li>
            <li> However, every time I shower with this thing (an Aveda worker instructed me to only comb my hair thoroughly when wet), I end up pulling huge clumps of hair out.</li>
            <li> The ends of the brush are not smooth so the brush doesn&#x27;t feel smooth at all on my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> I always break combs with my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitatant to spend a little more than usual on a comb, but I am so glad I did!  </li>
            <li> I have massive hair (really like the of four people)</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and can&#x27;t use a bristle brush.  </li>
            <li> I already had an old old set of them that I don&#x27;t even remember where or when I bought them</li>
            <li> Cheap combs that catch in  my hair because the plastic is not completely smooth.</li>
            <li> The green comb&#x27;s tines are really too close together to be as useful for a curly-haired girl.</li>
            <li> The larger comb is a nice, thick and durable plastic.  </li>
            <li> I got bright green (small) and purpleish blue (large).</li>
            <li> - works great or dry or wet hair - thick and wavy/curly is what I have and these are now my go to combs.  </li>
            <li> you can definitely feel the seems, but they are a decent quality construction and don&#x27;t catch on my hair or cause any issues so I don&#x27;t see an issue with that.</li>
            <li> High quality combs &amp; I expect them to last for quite a while!</li>
            <li> The only downside I have found is that they are a little bit difficult to hold while you&#x27;re combing, but once you get used to it they work great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a wide tooth comb that I could carry in my purse and this was exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not afraid that my knotted hair will break them like they did on my previous brush.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no sharp plastic from the manufacturing process.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not sharp, which means it doesn&#x27;t snag and break your hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine, but has thick, wavy volume, so I need a wider comb.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one thing to have a wide tooth comb, but this was a bit much.  </li>
            <li> Because my hair is so curly, it&#x27;s the only thing I can use that doesn&#x27;t pull out my soft curls and turn them to frizz.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower with conditioner in my hair to try to minimize the damage of brushing your hair when it&#x27;s wet, and then it&#x27;s much easier to brush when I get out.</li>
            <li> These are thick and sturdy and in no way feel cheap to me.</li>
            <li> The wet brush is fantastic if your hair is just super hard to brush/comb when wet.  </li>
            <li> One lives in my purse (the larger blue one pictured here) and two live in my house.</li>
            <li> I received the small orange comb, but the large comb was white and not that pretty blue.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many people actually tried the product before leaving so many 5-star reviews, but I&#x27;m horribly disappointed, and I just went back to my former brush.</li>
            <li> I love combing my hair so when my old Conair comb got too dirty, I searched for a new one but came across this one.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend these combs enough, especially if you have naturally curly hair that doesn&#x27;t do well with a brush.</li>
            <li> Super wide teeth help keep down the frizzies.  </li>
            <li> Mine weren&#x27;t in the advertised colors (I received them in purple and green) but they&#x27;re pretty.</li>
            <li> Great little wide toothed combs for shower, travel, and for brushing delicate wet hair!</li>
            <li> Within a few days of using them, I went right back on Amazon to buy another set to leave in different bathrooms around my home and in various purses and backpacks.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast (less than a week)</li>
            <li> I bought these to get the tangles out of my fine, thin hair when I wash it.</li>
            <li> They glide right through my thick hair.</li>
            <li> It is small enough to really help me maneuver my curls through the detangling process.</li>
            <li> The big comb--don&#x27;t really use or care...but the SMALL one...</li>
            <li> I keep the small one in my purse and the large one at home.  </li>
            <li> I use the small on in the shower when I put conditioner in my hair, and the large one after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> (I have long but thin, straight hair)  but these have become my cream-rinse-in shower comb (the smaller) and my wet hair after shower comb (large one.)  </li>
            <li> I use the larger comb every single day--it is essential for detangling my tresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have LONG HAIR, so maybe women&#x27;s hair is different or something</li>
            <li> Usually when I comb my hair there is always a small snag from the tangles or some shedding because my hair is so fine.</li>
            <li> The tines of the small comb are a little to widely spaced for fine styling, but I have another comb for that.</li>
            <li> Even though the combs aren&#x27;t very slippery when they&#x27;re wet, I have dropped them a few times because I tend to drop everything.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and find it difficult to find combs that do not damage my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this mainly for the small one.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a lot larger than I expected though.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser scolds me for brushing my wet hair with a regular brush.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair, but still feel it&#x27;s too much comb.)</li>
            <li> I threw all of my other combs away as I find I only use these.</li>
            <li> I walked into my local sallys the other day and bought a few of these combs in different colors since they were only 2.99.</li>
            <li> I had been using conair combs for a very long time until my puppy chewed it up.</li>
            <li> even though I tried it in the shower, damp and dry.</li>
            <li> I received the bigger one in purple and smaller one in green color.....</li>
            <li> The mold of how these brushes were put together left a very sharp ridge.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to use the small comb, but it is made of the same materials and will likely perform just as well.</li>
            <li> I can remember getting my hair combed as a little girl and crying loudly because it hurt.</li>
            <li> Not the same colors as pictured - the mint green ended up being on the little size, and the bigger size was a frosted white/clear -</li>
            <li> A lot bulkier than I expected them to be.  </li>
            <li> But the tines of the comb are too wide for me.</li>
            <li> Minimal shedding of hair even after removal of extensions.</li>
            <li> It feels rough, pulls hair, I did not like these at all</li>
            <li> I had one of these wide tooth combs in the travel size that I was guarding with my life</li>
            <li> Not really complaining</li>
            <li> Have to be careful with that one</li>
            <li> Thus I decided to purchase a wide tooth comb for the shower.</li>
            <li> so the combs won&#x27;t catch your hair (a major problem with a ton of thick combs)</li>
            <li> previously used a paddle brush (on wet hair) and found these wide combs to preserve my curls and reduce frizz.</li>
            <li> I ordered two pairs, due to the ratings.  </li>
            <li> I guess I have to stick to my other brushes while I look for another one.</li>
            <li> so I can now stop my hair breakage by other combs.</li>
            <li> The teeth are too sharp.</li>
            <li> I know that seems weird, but I live in a small house with very little storage space, so I have to hang things on my walls and they&#x27;re very visible.</li>
            <li> Both combs have curved, wide teeth, so there&#x27;s little to no tangling.</li>
            <li> I thought the teeth would be too far apart for my thin hair, but just not so.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair, and I was hoping this comb would be the winner to get through it at last.</li>
            <li> I have straight but very thick hair that is also difficult to comb, especially when wet.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on other brushes.</li>
            <li> My hair also has less shedding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed less breakage.</li>
            <li> I have long thick course hair</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using these I&#x27;ve noticed less hair is falling out.</li>
            <li> The little one rocks.</li>
            <li> The little one fits well in my purse.</li>
            <li> My hair does fall out when I use it, but no more than any other comb I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I use the little one.  </li>
            <li> These combs are so tall, with such a wide gap between the teeth, that I was actually rather shocked when I took them out of the package.  </li>
            <li> This comb gets through my hair w/o destroying my curls.</li>
            <li> My wife bought these for her curly hair and she uses them everyday.</li>
            <li> I no longer have half of my hair in the comb instead of in my head!</li>
            <li> and it takes a lot to tame it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but it works for me!), and the other the usual sized comb.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it is about this comb</li>
            <li> and I kept the small one for my travel bag.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser gave me a small Cricket comb years ago</li>
            <li> I keep the small one in the shower</li>
            <li> a small comb to carry in your purse or travel kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do just what you want de tangling + no static.</li>
            <li> I wish you could just get the small comb and maybe pick the color you receive</li>
            <li> I carry the small one in my organizer bag.</li>
            <li> but I would prefer two of the small size.</li>
            <li> Like another customer wrote, it somehow is less painful and removes less hair when you use it than regular brushes.</li>
            <li> Hardly any hair comes out on the comb, which I still marvel at.</li>
            <li> Just really disappointed because I had high hopes for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the Navy Seal of combs when you need to bring clarity, competence and focus to a complex situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Made from a really durable plastic, smoothed even where the prongs meet the base of the brush.</li>
            <li> Note to self - people with thick hair should not have tender heads.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> But this is the closest replacement I can find--it even has the same number of teeth!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, don&#x27;t even bother with any other combs or brushes no matter how expensive!!</li>
            <li> And I gotta say I have bought other expensive combs that  don&#x27;t measure up to this.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> It works when my hair is wet, it works when it&#x27;s dry, and miraculously seems repellent to product build-up.</li>
            <li> not the same colors, so a bit disappointed by that</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve often had to throw away the ones that break and those that are tough to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are very thick and durable combs.</li>
            <li> They were a little awkward to hold as well, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This, my friends, is another unnecessary dose of chemical toxins.  </li>
            <li> I was heart broken and panicked.</li>
            <li> This little baby is the HG for curly/wavy hair!!!!</li>
            <li> I intended to keep my disappointment to myself, until annoyed again with another email.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given it plenty of chances, but at this point, I think it&#x27;s going in the trash sadly.</li>
            <li> Hopefully someone out there, though, will be spared the disappointment I feel.  </li>
            <li> I was always afraid of losing it though.</li>
            <li> I tried this, as advertised, and my thin hair was immediately turned into a knot, and it was awful!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this type of comb for my curly hair, and it has changed the way I view the act of taming it from painful balding process</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a FANTASTIC comb! Getting one for my daughter too!</li>
            <li> I wonder if the reason for all the good ratings has something to do with the way this seller keeps emailing and pressuring buyers to review the product?  I intended to keep my disappointment to myself, until annoyed again with another email.  So here&#x27;s what I think of these combs.  I ordered two pairs, due to the ratings.  The first thing I noticed was the tag explaining that they&#x27;re treated to resist bacteria.  This, my friends, is another unnecessary dose of chemical toxins.  Soap and hot water takes care of comb bacteria without the need for infused bactericides.  These combs are so tall, with such a wide gap between the teeth, that I was actually rather shocked when I took them out of the package.  Forget carrying it in your purse, unless your bag is ample-size.  Even worse, these combs do not leave my hair smooth at all.  My hair is fine, but has thick, wavy volume, so I need a wider comb.  Yet the space between the teeth is still twice the ideal width.  As another reviewer suggested, it may be suitable for your horse&#x27;s tail.  Some people might also like it in the shower.  Hopefully someone out there, though, will be spared the disappointment I feel.  If you buy this comb set, just know what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> Great combs. Love these. They comb through hair easily. I use conditioner and tangle spray before using combs but it works great</li>
            <li> These are the best!  Thick plastic with a nice groove for your hands/fingers. My best friend got them and I couldn&#x27;t not get them.  There are no seems so the combs won&#x27;t catch your hair (a major problem with a ton of thick combs) - works great or dry or wet hair - thick and wavy/curly is what I have and these are now my go to combs.  The little one is great for purses</li>
            <li> This is one of the best combs I have ever gotten for my curly (3c) hair. I do not regret the purchase, even though it was not a prime purchase. Even though the smaller comb is a \\&quot;travel\\&quot; comb, I actually like it much better. It is small enough to really help me maneuver my curls through the detangling process. I also appreciate the antimicrobial technology since I wash my hair so often.</li>
            <li> I bought this same set of combs over fifteen years ago and I still use them today!  The smaller comb is perfect for curly or permed hair and for travel.  I use the larger comb every single day--it is essential for detangling my tresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I left it too close to my curling iron and the tip of the end prong melted a little bit, but I just filed it down with a nail file and it is still as good as new!</li>
            <li> I used this brush to detangle my damp hair (the larger one) and it took out a lot of my hair. The ends of the brush are not smooth so the brush doesn&#x27;t feel smooth at all on my scalp and hair. It tangles the hair instead of detangling it. I will look for another one.</li>
            <li> These combs actually detangle without getting stuck or ripping my hair out so I actually use them every time after I wash my hair. Great product!</li>
            <li> A lot bulkier than I expected them to be.  It&#x27;s one thing to have a wide tooth comb, but this was a bit much.  Would not recommend unless you have a horses mane.</li>
            <li> Fantastic detangling combs!  Made out of a sturdy plastic with a textured matte finish, looks and feels like they cost more than they did!  My hair is not ethnic, but still very curly, and many comb teeth have been sacrificed in fighting the good fight against my tangles.  These combs seem to take a beating in style.  Lovely colors.  Slight contour to fit Bette in your hand!  Would buy as gifts for others!</li>
            <li> The larger of the two combs is excellent for general combing. Hardly any hair comes out on the comb, which I still marvel at. I have no idea why this is, but it certainly makes me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller comb is great for in the shower, if you&#x27;re a curly girl like me, and removing tangles or distributing conditioner with your fingers just isn&#x27;t doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are just super combs. I don&#x27;t know why, I don&#x27;t know how. They just are. I wish this company made a fine-toothed rat-tail comb for styling, as I&#x27;d buy that, too.</li>
            <li> These are great for detangling my hair &amp; I love having the smaller one for my overnight bag. High quality combs &amp; I expect them to last for quite a while!</li>
            <li> fine hair&#x27;s dream! I no longer have half of my hair in the comb instead of in my head!</li>
            <li> When I saw how big they were I thought I had made a mistake (I have long but thin, straight hair)  but these have become my cream-rinse-in shower comb (the smaller) and my wet hair after shower comb (large one.)  What seemed like a huge amount of plastic handle turned out making them easy to get a grip on.  I thought the teeth would be too far apart for my thin hair, but just not so.  A happy surprise, and they will last forever.</li>
            <li> I also have fine hair. Usually when I comb my hair there is always a small snag from the tangles or some shedding because my hair is so fine. Not sure what it is about this comb but my hair has no snag in my tangles. My hair also has less shedding. Wish I could have found this comb years ago.</li>
            <li> These are very thick and durable combs. I bought them as they are supposedly good for the hair and my mom, sister and I have thinning hair as we age. These were nice stocking stuffers and I kept the small one for my travel bag.</li>
            <li> I have lots of fine hair that gets easily tangled (is is wavy and down to my mid back) so a wide tooth comb is perfect. Why do I love this one? Well, first of all there are actually two. One is perfect for traveling (did they cut the holes out of it to make it lighter for backing packing? I&#x27;m not sure, but it works for me!), and the other the usual sized comb. They are strong and easy to hold. The wide grip is actually curved a little on both sides which makes it fit very nicely in my palm. I didn&#x27;t even know how nice of a feature this was until I got these. They keep clean and don&#x27;t stain, plus there is no dumb logo that will rub off in my hair/hand. The icing on the cake: love the bright colors!</li>
            <li> Use them daily in addition to Suave Kids Detangler. Great for straight hair as well as Curly</li>
            <li> These combs are great!!  They have a molded handle which makes it fit in your hand so well and makes combing very easy.  The bristles feel great against my scalp and I just love the way they make my hair feel.  This is a great product at a great price!!</li>
            <li> Love the way these quickly detangle my dry hair!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why these combs are so great but they are fantastic. Durable and work really well. I like the way they feel in my hands, especially because of the holding groove and the material. The smaller size is perfect for taking to the gym or when I travel! Detangle away, people.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser gave me a small Cricket comb years ago and I love it. I was always afraid of losing it though. Because my hair is so curly, it&#x27;s the only thing I can use that doesn&#x27;t pull out my soft curls and turn them to frizz. I was thrilled to find them on Amazon. The plastic is so durable too. My old one looks as good as my new one! And I wound up liking the bigger one as well. I can&#x27;t recommend these combs enough, especially if you have naturally curly hair that doesn&#x27;t do well with a brush.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair, and I was hoping this comb would be the winner to get through it at last. However, every time I shower with this thing (an Aveda worker instructed me to only comb my hair thoroughly when wet), I end up pulling huge clumps of hair out. I&#x27;ve given it plenty of chances, but at this point, I think it&#x27;s going in the trash sadly.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace an old comb and thought it was cute that it came with a travel sized one and in such nice colors. Despite not really knowing much about the product I liked the anti-bacterial qualities advertised. Good comb set, no qualms at all!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it comes with an extra mini brush however, it does nothing for my curly hair. Trying to get rid of my knots hurts just as much (if not worse) even though I tried it in the shower, damp and dry. Between the two, I do prefer the small one because it fits in my hand better and I can get a better grip, but not enough to brush the tangles out. I guess I have to stick to my other brushes while I look for another one.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mainly for the small one. I have curly hair and my stylist asked me to use the widest comb on just washed hair.Perfect for travel too.Both are very sturdy, well made.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product mainly for the smaller comb, and it is a good to use to work conditioner through wet hair. Both have a &#x27;grip&#x27; handle, to hold in my palm. I haven&#x27;t strung a string/rope to hang the smaller comb, but it could easily be done and added to a shower caddy.</li>
            <li> Nice combs. Arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> It is a decent comb,  seems well made and sturdy. Easy to hold. But the tines of the comb are too wide for me. I like the width between them, but because of the width between them it doesn&#x27;t comb my hair to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Great combs. It is nonbreakable plastic. I always break combs with my natural hair. Love love love it!!!!</li>
            <li> The mold of how these brushes were put together left a very sharp ridge.  These combs scratch my head when I tried to use them.  They were a little awkward to hold as well, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no sharp plastic from the manufacturing process.  I also like that there&#x27;s two so I can keep one in the shower.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for my thick, textured hair. Both combs have curved, wide teeth, so there&#x27;s little to no tangling. Great for the price!</li>
            <li> They are my favorite combs! Love the bright colors.</li>
            <li> Not the quality product for the money they took.</li>
            <li> Good combs to carry in my luggage. Always available and effective on my shoulder-length curly hair without breakage.</li>
            <li> Best hair combs ever! My daughter lets me comb her hair without a problem</li>
            <li> Worked great got the girls hair</li>
            <li> They are great. The larger one I received was not quite as smooth as I would have liked but ok. The little one rocks. They should make that one longer with that distance between the teeth.</li>
            <li> This comb is amazing! It gets out the tangles and doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp. I can even use it to massage my scalp and it feels good. The colors are great. They are the semi see through colors that almost look frosty. I love it. Mine came purple as described and my mini comb is the blue one. The shipping was fast (less than a week) and when I opened it I got a $10 off coupon. Score! After a few weeks of using these I&#x27;ve noticed less hair is falling out. Great bonus! I definitely recommend these. They are awesome little combs and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. Amazing!</li>
            <li> I use this right out of the shower to take the knots out of my hair without pulling a lot of hair out.  I am then able to more easily comb my hair with a regular comb.  Nice quality.</li>
            <li> These combs feel so nice on my scalp.  They are designed beautifully.  The material is very durable and stays clean.  The larger comb is ideal to use in the shower and the smaller one to use while conditioning.  The large comb is huge but fits comfortably in my hand.  There is a very cool groove in the &amp;#34;handle.&amp;#34;  I love the colors too!  I highly recommend these combs.</li>
            <li> not the same colors, so a bit disappointed by that but the brush feels great and I have super fine hair that tangles easily and both combs go right through without damaging my hair.! Would buy again instantly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the thicker edge along the handle but I love these combs. Perfect for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> These are great for my coarse, 4c hair. Minimal shedding of hair even after removal of extensions. Both combs also seem very durable. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> i have very fine hair which is easily damaged by other brushes and combs. these work well for detangling and styling. reasonable price</li>
            <li> Love the small comb. I don&#x27;t even care about the large comb. I have had one of the smaller ones for YEARS and just lost it. I was heart broken and panicked. Then I found it here!!! I am soooo happy. I have curly/wavy hair that tends to friz. This comb is perfect, it does not pull out all the curl and is a great for detangling. It is the ONLY comb I use. It is easy to handle, fits well in your hand. I recommend this to anyone with curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Love these combs... They work great with my curly hair both in the shower and out. They don&#x27;t disrupt my curl pattern. Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitatant to spend a little more than usual on a comb, but I am so glad I did!  The larger comb is a nice, thick and durable plastic.  It&#x27;s also not sharp, which means it doesn&#x27;t snag and break your hair.  It also makes your detangling time easier.  I have yet to use the small comb, but it is made of the same materials and will likely perform just as well.</li>
            <li> It feels rough, pulls hair, I did not like these at all</li>
            <li> I tried the Tangle Teaser to get comb my curly hair in the shower with no luck.  I find that with the large comb I am able to get through my thick curly hair with just conditioner in.  I&#x27;ve tried many products to that.  This comb is the best as it doesn&#x27;t ruin my curl.  The wet brush is fantastic if your hair is just super hard to brush/comb when wet.  But, it will comb  your hair straight and pull curls out.  This comb gets through my hair w/o destroying my curls.</li>
            <li> There are good quality combs, but it was my fault that I didn&#x27;t look at the dimensions carefully before I buy it. I thought they are palm sized but... they are really BIG. And the distance between the teeth of the comb is large!</li>
            <li> This set of combs is perfect.  One for travel and one for home.  They are very smooth and outperformed by more expensive combs.</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair. Excellent quality.</li>
            <li> I keep the small one in my purse and the large one at home.  They work great to comb through my wigs without pulling out hair.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best at getting through my 2 yr old&#x27;s curls with minimal complaining.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The big comb--don&#x27;t really use or care...but the SMALL one...OMG!!!!! It&#x27;s a replacement for a Matrix comb I had forever--until it finally broke. I even wrote to the company trying to get another but they were clueless... I think they might have the Matrix version at Walgreens but I haven&#x27;t bothered to check since I found this!!&lt;br /&gt;It goes through wavy/curly hair like a dream but doesn&#x27;t disturb your curl!! That&#x27;s why I was heartbroken when my original Matrix broke...But this is the closest replacement I can find--it even has the same number of teeth!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, don&#x27;t even bother with any other combs or brushes no matter how expensive!! This little baby is the HG for curly/wavy hair!!!! This comb is the secret to having gorgeous hair like the Wen girls or in the VS fashion shows!! It loosens your curls and waves but doesn&#x27;t wreck them...A godsend!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand.. why aren&#x27;t these combs raved about??? I walked into my local sallys the other day and bought a few of these combs in different colors since they were only 2.99. And I gotta say I have bought other expensive combs that  don&#x27;t measure up to this. Love love love these combs!!! Unbelievable! My hair is fine and long but I have a lot of hair though and this comb works wonders. Highly recommend these combs.</li>
            <li> The teeth on the combs are perfect for my hair because It doesn&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li> Most of these reviews were from women with curly hair. I have straight but very thick hair that is also difficult to comb, especially when wet. These combs work really well! I don&#x27;t know exactly why because they don&#x27;t look much different from other combs, but there is something very special about the design. They are sturdy, fit well in the hand, and make de-tangling very easy. The little one fits well in my purse. The tines of the small comb are a little to widely spaced for fine styling, but I have another comb for that.</li>
            <li> My child has curly hair and this is a perfect comb for getting out the snarls.</li>
            <li> just what i needed! perfect for curly hair, good quality material</li>
            <li> Awesome for curly hair and having two combs is quite handy. I keep the small one in the shower so I can detangle my hair to get all the conditioner in.&lt;br /&gt;I previously used a paddle brush (on wet hair) and found these wide combs to preserve my curls and reduce frizz. I&#x27;ve noticed less breakage. The combs are well made, durable - mine has fallen in the shower many times and survived a rabbit chewing.</li>
            <li> The Untra Clean comb is much rougher than the Ultra Smooth and does not feel as good to use.&lt;br /&gt;It has disinfectant in it, which is really not necessary. The best part about buying this is that you&lt;br /&gt;get a small comb to carry in your purse or travel kit.&lt;br /&gt;Basically, I recommend the Ultra Smooth - I have bought several for myself and friends and I really&lt;br /&gt;love them!&lt;br /&gt;CKFLA</li>
            <li> These are ok. I recieved 2 blue ones not the orange and blue as pictured but that&#x27;s not why I&#x27;m giving them 3 stars. They are just ok .Not better or worse than many other ones on the market.</li>
            <li> Do just what you want de tangling + no static. Easy to hold. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> Everything was great.</li>
            <li> I have 3 of these combs now. One lives in my purse (the larger blue one pictured here) and two live in my house. The smaller one has holes so I hang it on a hook next to my dresser where I can grab it easily. The third is a brown one with a handle. (Cricket Ultra Smooth Hair Detangler Comb infused with Argan Oil) It hangs on a hook in my bathroom. These combs are large and have real presence. I know that seems weird, but I live in a small house with very little storage space, so I have to hang things on my walls and they&#x27;re very visible. These combs are like art.</li>
            <li> Love it these combs are unbreakable! Great volume to hair. Ordered two sets!</li>
            <li> I wish you could just get the small comb and maybe pick the color you receive but I am very happy with both of these. I have massive hair (really like the of four people) and it takes a lot to tame it. These combs work great in the shower and out.</li>
            <li> The brushes gently untangle my wet hair and that is exactly the reason why I bought them. I can confidently untangle my hair without feeling like I&#x27;m breaking my strands.</li>
            <li> I love these combs.  I have very fine hair that tangles easily and this comb is the best!  I had one for years, and was devastated when I lost it.  I&#x27;m so glad to have found these on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Wow. These are seriously awesome. If you have curly/wavy hair, you have found the brushes you need. Mine weren&#x27;t in the advertised colors (I received them in purple and green) but they&#x27;re pretty. I use the big one in the shower (us curly haired ladies aren&#x27;t supposed to brush our hair unless it&#x27;s in the shower with lots of conditioner!) and it&#x27;s perfect. Like another customer wrote, it somehow is less painful and removes less hair when you use it than regular brushes. The tines are strong as well and I&#x27;m not afraid that my knotted hair will break them like they did on my previous brush. So go ahead and get this one. Don&#x27;t waste your time on other brushes.</li>
            <li> These combs are very good so happy I found them so I can now stop my hair breakage by other combs. :)</li>
            <li> I love combing my hair so when my old Conair comb got too dirty, I searched for a new one but came across this one. It&#x27;s such a good deal to get the normal comb with the mini one too! It&#x27;s a sturdy comb and I truly am so happy I came across this brand! For color reference, I got a large clear comb, and the mini was bright green!</li>
            <li> Made from a really durable plastic, smoothed even where the prongs meet the base of the brush. So it doesnt snag my hair. The comb is made to fit your hand so it makes it easy and comfortable to use. I was really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed - I was using a brush to comb out my tangles - this works way better and is better for preventing breakage of hair!</li>
            <li> My wife bought these for her curly hair and she uses them everyday.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve bought a lot of wide-tooth combs in my house and these are my favorites. There are lots of advantages to having a wide-tooth comb and it&#x27;s great for those of us with long and/or coarser hair. They are great to detangle and separate hair and you can do so without doing any damage and causing breakage.  We&#x27;ve often had to throw away the ones that break and those that are tough to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These combs are sturdy and just glide through hair. They have a *great* grip to them and you can comb close to the scalp. I love putting the smaller comb in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. Easy to clean, easy to use and they slide through my hair without any damage or breakage.</li>
            <li> The small comb, or free one, is what I really wanted.  It&#x27;s the perfect size and a sturdy smooth plastic.  Just what I wanted.  (The large one is enormous.  I have long thick hair, but still feel it&#x27;s too much comb.)</li>
            <li> These are perfect for coming conditioner through your hair, or combing thick hair. Lightweight, sturdy. Gave as gifts too already.</li>
            <li> The smaller comb is very good for detangling hair after a shampoo.  The larger one I use for styling after blow-drying and straightening for a beautiful textured style.</li>
            <li> Great detangler for varying textures of hair. Great grip. Super sturdy.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and can&#x27;t use just any kind of comb. The cricket comb works really well for me. I can remember getting my hair combed as a little girl and crying loudly because it hurt. I guess we didn&#x27;t have combs like this &#x27;way back then&#x27;. I surely am glad that we have them now. I can use this comb without pulling my hair or hurting my tender head. Note to self - people with thick hair should not have tender heads. I like this comb a lot. I like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to hurt myself when I comb my hair.</li>
            <li> These combs are SUPER wide tooth (more than anticipated), but my kids love to play with them.  :)</li>
            <li> This set of combs de-tangles hair instantly without damage. They are quite flat and slide easily into any handbag. I carry the small one in my organizer bag.</li>
            <li> Great combs- mine came in different colors from the picture- a nice lavender color.&lt;br /&gt;Really well-made and smooth for use in de-tangling hair. They look like they will last for years.</li>
            <li> These are great combs. Got through my nearly waist length, wavy, color treated hair very easily while wet!&lt;br /&gt; And the travel comb is perfect for small purses.</li>
            <li> These combs rock! I have long thick course hair and I like to comb my hair in the shower after I put my conditioner in my hair! they work so great!!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re combs. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to. My hair does fall out when I use it, but no more than any other comb I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Very cute. Not the same colors though. Mine were both purple. Work nice. The smaller one is very handy. They&#x27;re a lot larger than I expected though.</li>
            <li> I love these! Simply perfect for my and my daughters curly hair. Used every morning.</li>
            <li> Great combs!  I use the little one.  I love them - they don&#x27;t pull on my hair at all and it is easy to get through the tangles.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have kept the plastic so I could return this set. Based on the product reviews, I thought it&#x27;d be God&#x27;s gift to hair, but it is more like putting an electric mixer in my hair and turning it on high. I tried this, as advertised, and my thin hair was immediately turned into a knot, and it was awful! I don&#x27;t know how many people actually tried the product before leaving so many 5-star reviews, but I&#x27;m horribly disappointed, and I just went back to my former brush. I&#x27;m convinced the 5-star reviews were just excited that there are two travel combs. I am a MALE and I have LONG HAIR, so maybe women&#x27;s hair is different or something but I can&#x27;t recommend NOT buying this product enough. Just really disappointed because I had high hopes for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a wide tooth comb that I could carry in my purse and this was exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I just got it this morning and instantly fell in love it. It also came in really fast, I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and can&#x27;t use a bristle brush.  I had one of these wide tooth combs in the travel size that I was guarding with my life so it was time to get more.  Great for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Love love love.  Super wide teeth help keep down the frizzies.  I like the small one better, it&#x27;s wider.  Using it every day even though it&#x27;s smaller.</li>
            <li> I bought these as stocking stuffers for a friend that only uses hair picks.  She just loves them.</li>
            <li> I really love the small comb. It is perfect and fits easily into a purse of beach bag. The large comb is great quality as well but is a little too large. Not really complaining but I would prefer two of the small size. I threw all of my other combs away as I find I only use these.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and find it difficult to find combs that do not damage my fine hair.  These combs are great and the small one is perfect for my purse.</li>
            <li> I love these combs. They are very well made and sturdy. They have a nice curve at the handle which makes them easy to hold. I love that this set comes with a big one and a mini size one. I keep the mini one in my purse for on the go and the big one for my bathroom.</li>
            <li> The combs are very well made, no light weight , flexible junk here. They are ideal for combing through curls without separation on the curl style. Love them!</li>
            <li> These combs will likely last a lifetime! I already had an old old set of them that I don&#x27;t even remember where or when I bought them and I have used them religiously for years. I wanted another set to take when I travel so I can just keep one packed with my toiletries all the time. These are my wet hair combs - they&#x27;re great for in the shower with conditioner, and for combing through after towel drying to detangle without pulling on the hair. My hair is very fine and will literally stretch and snap if I use anything else on it when it&#x27;s wet. Also, the way they are shaped makes them easy to hold when wet/slippery.</li>
            <li> I really like these Combs. They are very sturdy. It is easy to untangle your hair with these and minimize split ends and breakage.</li>
            <li> I got a large clear comb--gave it to my Nana--and a small purple comb; they are very sturdy and I love purple so I&#x27;m happy with the random picking.</li>
            <li> the best comb to use with wet hair!!!</li>
            <li> Not the same colors as pictured - the mint green ended up being on the little size, and the bigger size was a frosted white/clear - I love the lip they put on it to help hold it!</li>
            <li> The combs are sturdy, breeze through very curly hair easily, and are overall fantastic. I would highly recommend these combs to anyone who normally hears several &amp;#34;pops&amp;#34; when coming or brushing through hair. I&#x27;ve found that these combs don&#x27;t do that to my hair. The only downside I have found is that they are a little bit difficult to hold while you&#x27;re combing, but once you get used to it they work great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good wide-toothed comb for several years, and I&#x27;ve found it in the Cricket Ultra Clean! I have long hair that tangles easily, so I needed a comb that would untangle my hair without breaking it off. This comb does so excellently. Also, the Cricket comb has a nice thick area by which to hold it. And the material is totally smooth, so it won&#x27;t ever snag my hair. Great product!</li>
            <li> I bought these to get the tangles out of my fine, thin hair when I wash it. I use the small on in the shower when I put conditioner in my hair, and the large one after I get out of the shower. The do an awesome job of getting the tangles out without pulling out much hair.</li>
            <li> I use these in the shower to comb conditioner and color glaze through my hair. They glide right through my thick hair. Even though the combs aren&#x27;t very slippery when they&#x27;re wet, I have dropped them a few times because I tend to drop everything. I haven&#x27;t noticed any cracks or damage to them though, so they seem to be very sturdy</li>
            <li> These are holding up well!</li>
            <li> Really nice brushes! I love the little one for the shower (I hung it on the shower rack with a piece of ribbon through the hole). I use it in the shower with conditioner in my hair to try to minimize the damage of brushing your hair when it&#x27;s wet, and then it&#x27;s much easier to brush when I get out. It fits really nicely in the palm of your hand. I wouldn&#x27;t say the teeth are perfectly seemless...it is plastic after all...you can definitely feel the seems, but they are a decent quality construction and don&#x27;t catch on my hair or cause any issues so I don&#x27;t see an issue with that. Great little wide toothed combs for shower, travel, and for brushing delicate wet hair! Fun colors too--I got bright green (small) and purpleish blue (large).</li>
            <li> These are good heavy duty combs that come in snappy colors.  I use the large comb after showering.  It has widely spaced teeth that are perfect for that purpose.  I keep the smaller one in my purse, mainly because it IS small and flat, although it&#x27;s not the greatest for combing dry hair.  Both combs have a little bit of a lip on one side of the handle part which makes them easy to hold.</li>
            <li> These combs work VERY well on damp, tangled hair!  Easy to use and just the right size!</li>
            <li> Functional, wide-toothed combs. That&#x27;s all there is to it. The teeth are pretty far apart. The ones I got were both a sort of transparent lavender color. I bought this basically so I could keep a comb in my purse, and the mini one is great for that. No problems at all. Easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Absolutely AMAZING quality! I was just expecting these to be normal cheap plastic combs, but these are VERY well made for the price and are actually bigger than I expected! &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> Great for brushing wet hair, hair that&#x27;s been loosely curled, &amp; wavy hair that has air dried.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Not too heavy of a plastic and not too light either! A handy comb for someone in need of one just exiting the shower.</li>
            <li> Works great for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my niece and she loves them. Gets tangles out easy for her.</li>
            <li> Perfect for mixed hair. Highly recommended. I still have my first set from over 10 years ago. No build up, very reliable combs.</li>
            <li> Perfect shower combs. Doesn&#x27;t get caught up in my hair and gets the tangles out with ease.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about the smaller comb, but it combs through the most tangled wet hair like a hot knife through butter. It&#x27;s the Navy Seal of combs when you need to bring clarity, competence and focus to a complex situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light, ergonomically perfect to hold when your hand is already slick with conditioner and basically brings order to chaos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used the big one that comes with it very much. The teeth are too sharp. Have to be careful with that one so you don&#x27;t scratch your scalp.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser scolds me for brushing my wet hair with a regular brush. It breaks the hair. Thus I decided to purchase a wide tooth comb for the shower. This has been great, and  I love that it comes with a smaller one for travel or your purse. These are thick and sturdy and in no way feel cheap to me. I got a pretty blue/purple combo for colors and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I received the bigger one in purple and smaller one in green color.....both look very cute and they are functional as well. will recommend.</li>
            <li> These are the best combs I have ever used in my life. Within a few days of using them, I went right back on Amazon to buy another set to leave in different bathrooms around my home and in various purses and backpacks. I had been using conair combs for a very long time until my puppy chewed it up. I am so glad I found these Cricket combs instead. They somehow detangle every knot known to man in my straight, fine hair that tangles very easily. It works when my hair is wet, it works when it&#x27;s dry, and miraculously seems repellent to product build-up. They are very sturdy and I love the colors (first set I ordered was a clear large comb and orange small comb, and the second set was a beautiful blue large comb and lilac/purple smaller comb). The price is just icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> The green comb&#x27;s tines are really too close together to be as useful for a curly-haired girl.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and easy to keep clean. My hairdresser recommended this type of comb for my curly hair, and it has changed the way I view the act of taming it from painful balding process (brushes pulled out a lot of hair) to painless styling process. Stylist recommended keeping in the shower to comb after conditioning. Works like a dream. After the shower, a brush easily goes through my hair for styling.</li>
            <li> Nice combs but be aware that you may not get the color pictured. I received the small orange comb, but the large comb was white and not that pretty blue. However they are nice, heavy-duty, and very wide-toothed combs. I have thick wavy hair and they work just great, but the feel of them takes some getting used to because they are so large.</li>
            <li> Cheap combs that catch in  my hair because the plastic is not completely smooth. C&#x27;mon Cricket, get it together!</li>
            <li> I love this comb.  Great for getting tangles out of wet hair without damaging it.</li>
            <li> High quality combs. Love that I have one for home and a little one for travel.</li>
            <li> I like these combs...very compact and handy when I need to comb my hair when I am out.</li>
            <li> Love these combs!!!!  I put the smaller comb in the shower, once I put conditioner in, I use it to comb it through and it works great. The larger comb is awesome for when I have rinsed and let my hair stay covered in a towel with leave in conditioner.  These are so great, I would order again.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Not only does my hair fall out less, but my hair actually felt softer!&lt;br /&gt;Honestly a magic comb!</li>
