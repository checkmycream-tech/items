            <li>I much prefer the Repair version of this shampoo, but the conditioner is great.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>Satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I love this product but both bottles arrived with pumps that don&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m here smells and feels so clean and looks healthy and shiny</li>
            <li>The conditioner was fine.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product for the price.  </li>
            <li>Was not the original Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s rich and luxurious.  </li>
            <li>but it smells wonderful and works well on thick hair.</li>
            <li>It is fair enough.</li>
            <li>This is not the real thing !!</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t need to use very much</li>
            <li>Love my moroccan can&#x27;t get enough</li>
            <li>The product did not ahve any plastic wrap on it to guarantee this was unopened/not used and the conditioner is not as nice as the moroccan oil hydrating that I have previously bought in the smaller size bottles.</li>
            <li>Not so sure it&#x27;s the real thing, looks and smells a little different than what I bought at the salon, but it seems to be doing the trick.</li>
            <li>I had to pour the contents into my old bottle.</li>
            <li>Keeps ;my hair soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a very long time - this is the first time I have ordered it in this size.  </li>
            <li>However the pumps that come with this particular set don&#x27;t work very well, and one of them actually snapped off while trying to open it.  </li>
            <li>Putting the two next to each other confirmed it.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner, but the ones I ordered came in with a broken top/pump</li>
            <li>Top of the conditioner bottle was completely broken off and inside of package was covered with conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick, so others may not have the same experience, but I definitely need to use a greater amount of this as compared to other shampoos.</li>

            <li> so I know what to expect, but this shampoo was much thicker than usual, and it wouldn&#x27;t lather  up.  </li>
            <li> Pump on bottles don&#x27;t give out much and is hard to pump</li>
            <li> I compared the liquid side by side with the leftover of my previous bottle, BOTH shampoo and condition are different.  </li>
            <li> Yes I was my hair a lot (every other day)</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the shampoo bottle is hard to pump.</li>
            <li> Would mind less if it wasn&#x27;t so spendy...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this seller sent me some bootleg or extremely old product...</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> immediately re send them when I checked on missing order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shampoo bottle pump was also &amp;#34;clogged&amp;#34; because the consistency of the shampoo was so thick.  </li>
            <li> And tue lid came broken</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed!  </li>

            <li> This is not the real thing !! Don&#x27;t buy it! And tue lid came broken</li>
            <li> The bottles were delivered and the shampoo and conditioner spilled everywhere. Also, the pump did not work correctly. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Was not the original Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li> I have had this shampoo for a year, Yes I was my hair a lot (every other day) but you don&#x27;t need to use very much and it&#x27;s rich and luxurious.  Fantastic product for the price.  Way better then Wen</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law just loves this product</li>
            <li> I much prefer the Repair version of this shampoo, but the conditioner is great.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I was told or thought. Pump on bottles don&#x27;t give out much and is hard to pump</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell and my hair feels amazing. The only thing is that the shampoo bottle is hard to pump.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a very long time - this is the first time I have ordered it in this size.  The product itself is great, no complaints.  However the pumps that come with this particular set don&#x27;t work very well, and one of them actually snapped off while trying to open it.  I had to pour the contents into my old bottle.</li>

            <li> This is a really nice priduct the pumps aren&#x27;t the greatest but it smells wonderful and works well on thick hair.</li>
            <li> love this product. Smells soooo gooood</li>
            <li> Satisfied.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I have used Moroccan Oil for several years and this is not it!  I compared the liquid side by side with the leftover of my previous bottle, BOTH shampoo and condition are different.  Different texture, smell, color, everything.  It was completely obvious to me as soon as I put it in my hand that it is not legitimate.  Putting the two next to each other confirmed it.  I am very disappointed!  $50 for a counterfeit product should not happen!!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, but the ones I ordered came in with a broken top/pump</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Morocanoil, but these two things are different from malls.</li>
            <li> Love the product and the price!</li>
            <li> wonderful seller. immediately re send them when I checked on missing order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;like them both, smell good and hair looks better than before</li>
            <li> Package arrived damaged. Top of the conditioner bottle was completely broken off and inside of package was covered with conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love that Moroccanoil!</li>
            <li> Exactly what was ordered, happy customer.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t seem to be the same quality as I have bought at my local salon</li>
            <li> Love my moroccan can&#x27;t get enough</li>
            <li> The product did not ahve any plastic wrap on it to guarantee this was unopened/not used and the conditioner is not as nice as the moroccan oil hydrating that I have previously bought in the smaller size bottles. I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I love this product but both bottles arrived with pumps that don&#x27;t work well.  It is a two-handed job just to  get shampoo.</li>
            <li> Keeps ;my hair soft and not greasy. No build up.</li>
            <li> I find I need to use a fair amount of the shampoo to get the job done. My hair is thick, so others may not have the same experience, but I definitely need to use a greater amount of this as compared to other shampoos. Would mind less if it wasn&#x27;t so spendy...</li>
            <li> There was something off about the shampoo they sent me.  I&#x27;ve used Moroccanoil products before so I know what to expect, but this shampoo was much thicker than usual, and it wouldn&#x27;t lather  up.  The shampoo bottle pump was also &amp;#34;clogged&amp;#34; because the consistency of the shampoo was so thick.  This is not how Moroccanoil products are supposed to be.  The conditioner was fine.  I&#x27;m not sure if this seller sent me some bootleg or extremely old product...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m here smells and feels so clean and looks healthy and shiny</li>
            <li> It is fair enough. Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> Smells and works wonderfully!</li>
