            <li>Remington is always a great name for shavers.  </li>
            <li>My son is really happy with it, although he says it doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as the rotary head razor he was using before this Remington.  </li>
            <li>think this is a great shaver for the price, and I do recommend it.</li>
            <li>My husband can&#x27;t believe how great this razor works.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this shaver.</li>
            <li>This razor is very nice looking and has a good weight to it.  </li>
            <li>and perhaps it was just not installed good.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be good to go.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using a three-head rotary shaver which did a fair job.</li>
            <li>figured it would be good for some days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never had an electric razor this good.</li>
            <li>feel I gave it a fair shot.</li>
            <li>three stars because I think it&#x27;s a good product that just didn&#x27;t work for me for the stated purpose.</li>
            <li>This is a good dependable razor.</li>
            <li>course, it doesn&#x27;t do as good as job as a razor, but no electric razors do.</li>
            <li>All of these in this line are a good value and provide a close shave</li>
            <li>In that case, I&#x27;m just trimming and I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s a super close shave or perfect.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate to pick this up if you&#x27;re in need of a good, nicely priced electric razor.</li>
            <li>It fits well in the hand and has a nice sleek look.</li>
            <li>It can also be plugged in and used which is handy if you forget to charge</li>
            <li>The picture shows some kind of stand to hold the shaver, but I did not get anything like that with my shaver.  </li>
            <li>This shaver has worked out nicely for me to date.</li>
            <li>It cuts well, holds a good charge and is easy to keep clean.happy with this shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also faster and easier to use for a quick shave that doesn&#x27;t need to be super close.o use, but darn it all, it gives a great shave for an electric razor!</li>
            <li>So easy!</li>
            <li>The convenience is nice, and I love being able to just rinse it out with water afterwards.</li>
            <li>easy to clean - this Remington does a great job on them.  </li>
            <li>It also has a pop up trimmer that is good for making clean lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, the shave is very smooth and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Lithium battery holds a charge for 60 minutes and it also has a 5 minute quick charge that is supposed to work in a pinch which I didn&#x27;t test.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from giving a nice close shave with no detectable stubble, it trims nicely around the neck and sideburns.</li>
            <li>That goes for electric razors for sure.</li>
            <li>I selected F5 model as it hold a charge for an hour which will be more than sufficient for his needs.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice pivot which makes it easier to hold as well as making it more comfortable at shaving time.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;m glad I picked this up.</li>
            <li>Technology has improved over years, and I&#x27;m glad to see that has occurred with razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d get easier and faster, but I don&#x27;t see the benefit.</li>
            <li>It does recommend to soap them and do a more thorough cleaning once a month, but even that isn&#x27;t too vigorous or time</li>
            <li>It cuts well, holds a good charge and is easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>but this is an outstanding value.</li>
            <li>I am told that this is a smooth shave and very comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>Now to be fair, my Norelco blades had been used more, and the Remington was brand new, but I could feel and see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That said, I won&#x27;t be getting rid of my old razor, as the Norelco is fully wet/dry, and that is very handy at times.</li>
            <li>That said, I won&#x27;t be getting rid of my old razor, as the Norelco is fully wet/dry, and that is very handy at times.</li>
            <li>Easy to use,</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this isn&#x27;t a high end shaver, it is a good entry level one.</li>
            <li>It worked just fine in all cases.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the rectangle shape of the razor head on this unit.</li>
            <li>I find that it is easy to use and clean and is cost competitive with a manual razor if you figure in shave cream and blades purchased over a year or two.</li>
            <li>I was able to get a good enough shave where I looked presentable, without having to worry about getting bumps.  </li>
            <li>It remains to be seen how well the blades and the foil will hold up over time, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>Now, the 20ish year old loved it.</li>
            <li>I opened it to clean it and inspect it and everything seemed fine.</li>
            <li>It was a quick cut, and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>When I removed the foil to clean the blades, both blades fell out.</li>
            <li>whatever issue that was causing it to vibrate and rattle, this was a good shaver for the 3 weeks that it actually worked.</li>
            <li>The shaver wasn&#x27;t something the 40ish year old liked.</li>
            <li>The battery charge remained consistent but you can also use this corded if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Clean-up is easy as this can be cleaned under water but swishing the shaving head under water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I miss my old Remington which cost three times as much 12 years ago and sat in its own cradle, but it is nice to have a razor that doesn&#x27;t require as much counter space either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also faster and easier to use for a quick shave that doesn&#x27;t need to be super close.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, the retractable trimmer made quick work of them, so this wasn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He said he thought it shaved close and was easy to handle even for his large hands.</li>
            <li>It actually did a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>There is also a quick charge feature which promises one shave worth of power after a 5 min charge.</li>
            <li>This is a nice basic shaver.  </li>
            <li>(If you like electric shavers and have used them for years, this is review is probably not going to be useful to you)</li>
            <li>And plus 1/2 a star for being useful for body hair.</li>
            <li>I own another Remington foil shaver that looks very similar to this</li>
            <li>so provides even more shaving surface and a closer/finer outcome, battery life is longer (about double) and the overall feel is one of more weight and better quality build.</li>
            <li>Being battery operated is nice, since the last electric razor I owned had a cord, which got in the way.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is okay for a reasonably priced tool but offers nothing special to the user.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, a replacement head is available from Remington for the PF7400, which may fit.  </li>
            <li>The older one also had a coiled cord that didn&#x27;t look so cheap in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I first used it, I had about three days of scruff.</li>
            <li>When I first began shaving as a teenager, my father bought me an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used razors for 25 years and never used an electric, so I&#x27;m aware that I&#x27;m a newbie when it comes to electrics.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different types and even though they all claim they do, none of them come close to a razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very much recommend it!</li>
            <li>- haven&#x27;t had it long enough or put it through the ringer yet to find out - for now, it&#x27;s performing well and doing a very nice job as a starter for the boys.</li>
            <li>This razor is very reasonably priced and performs very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that you pretty much get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Later on, I received a free Gillette Mach 3, and began using a more traditional razor for shaving my face.</li>
            <li>but the older one had a much better pop-up trimmer that actually trimmed.</li>
            <li>like that the foils can be rinsed directly under running water, which makes cleaning a quick and painless task.</li>
            <li>My first impression was that it was much quieter than my older Remington and seemed to shave closer.</li>
            <li>It is light yet substantial enough to offer a reasonable life span and it lives up to the manufacturer&#x27;s promises.</li>
            <li>It cut really close to my skin making it look as smooth as if I had taken a traditional razorblade to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so the razor can be charged while upright and not having to be on its side, but it is very lightweight plastic</li>
            <li>As he is planning on driving straight through for 2 days, trading off driving.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*It also has a pop up trimmer which works very well</li>
            <li>To be honest, I was not liking the experience and expected the shave to be about the same, only with more work to get there.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It is an awkward razor to use, but darn it all, it gives a great shave for an electric razor!</li>
            <li>this is really a 3.5 star review.</li>
            <li>charges very quickly and the charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>It felt boxy and is not nearly as well designed and does not feel comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First is the texturized grip which is nicer than the smooth surface of the other.</li>
            <li>I let my facial hair grow out to about 0.5 centimeters (0.2\\&quot;) and gave it a full cut with the Remington PF7500.</li>
            <li>He has many much more expensive electric razors.  </li>
            <li>This one gives a closer shave, and seems to be of decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and it does a decent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a decent razor, as electric razors go.</li>
            <li>I also recommend keeping your original sales receipt as the limited two-year warranty requires it as proof of purchase.</li>
            <li>I still use an old fashioned straight razor for date</li>
            <li>I am going to try a Braun next, just because I don&#x27;t think it is worth the cost to replace the blades as another reviewer noted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to be faster or easier than what I currently do ( I shave in the shower, which makes for a pretty fast, close shave.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as messy as the Gillette, and may save some clean-up time, but I value the closer shave more.</li>
            <li>so it is not hard to plug it in each day after using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>seemed fine for the next two weeks with daily use and cleaning.</li>
            <li>I am lazy and this electric razor does a fine job of making me ready for work!  </li>
            <li>What I do not like about it is the new style trimmer.</li>
            <li>My old triple foil Remington 400 with 2 year old replacement blades shaves much closer than my new F5 PF7500.</li>
            <li>This is particularly noticeable on the &amp;#34;corners&amp;#34;, i.e. around the chin and near the sideburns.</li>
            <li>This shaver was comfortable to hold in my hands, and did a good job cutting my facial hair.  </li>
            <li>It might give a pretty close one if I stayed at the mirror an extra 5 minutes</li>
            <li>I remember being able to shave faster and, obviously, it&#x27;s easier to shave in other locations as you&#x27;re doing things.</li>
            <li>so thought this would basically be the exact same thing with a longer life battery</li>
            <li>While the initial time it probably took as long as it would with my Fusion, I was very surprised by how smooth my face felt.</li>
            <li>I did not perform any pre-shaving steps, just went right in to see how well the Remington would cut hair that long.</li>
            <li>I opened it again to clean it and one of the blades fell out again, this time falling in the bathroom sink and going down the drain.</li>
            <li>I turned it on, I was surprised how loud it was.</li>
            <li>and I never could quite figure out how to completely shave the area under my chin.</li>
            <li>The manual says to stretch the skin with your free hand so that the hairs stand upright, but I still came across a few rebels.</li>
            <li>The biggest fault I&#x27;ve found is that this razor doesn&#x27;t give me as close a shave as my old reliable Gillette Track II.</li>
            <li>Its poor ergonomics and straight foil made it tricky, and it required much more re-positioning to get my neck.</li>
            <li>I have a similar, but older Remington shaver</li>
            <li>The Remington did a much better job at getting the longer scruff that I&#x27;d usually have to get with a regular razor.</li>
            <li>Overall, for the price, this is a decent razor and I will use it until it dies, too.</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t expect much when he used this razor however Mr. &amp;#34;I only will shave with Mach 3 sensitive blades&amp;#34; actually said he would use this razor as an every day razor.  </li>
            <li>It is small, and light.  </li>
            <li>those who had issues after using this device, keep in mind that the manufacturer recommends using it daily for three weeks to allow time for your hair and skin to become accustomed to the new shaving system.</li>
            <li>I actually got this for my legs since my older Remington shaver has bitten the dust after 12 years (and several blade changes).</li>
            <li>As time has gone on, as expected, I&#x27;ve been able to shave faster than I usually did.</li>
            <li>I purchased as a replacement for 3  year old Remington that was similar</li>
            <li>I went back to using my old Remington triple foil.</li>
            <li>Having recently tried out another Remington shaver by comparison this shaver offers more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>; instead, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that this is a substantial upgrade for a not so very substantial slight price increase.</li>
            <li>This is a very low cost electric (not sure why people would want to replace parts) razor that is just adequate.</li>
            <li>The other big pro is that the sideburn shaver gives a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>It simply doesn&#x27;t trim very well and is awkwardly attached to the shaver at a right angle and it doesn&#x27;t trim very well.</li>
            <li>I have two teenage boys who are just beginning to shave - thought this would be a great starter shaver for them and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;While this isn&#x27;t a high end shaver, it is a good entry level one.</li>
            <li> It worked just fine in all cases.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the rectangle shape of the razor head on this unit.</li>
            <li> I find that it is easy to use and clean and is cost competitive with a manual razor if you figure in shave cream and blades purchased over a year or two.</li>
            <li> I was able to get a good enough shave where I looked presentable, without having to worry about getting bumps.  </li>
            <li> It remains to be seen how well the blades and the foil will hold up over time, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Now, the 20ish year old loved it.</li>
            <li> I opened it to clean it and inspect it and everything seemed fine.</li>
            <li> It was a quick cut, and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> When I removed the foil to clean the blades, both blades fell out.</li>
            <li> whatever issue that was causing it to vibrate and rattle, this was a good shaver for the 3 weeks that it actually worked.</li>
            <li> The shaver wasn&#x27;t something the 40ish year old liked.</li>
            <li> The battery charge remained consistent but you can also use this corded if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Clean-up is easy as this can be cleaned under water but swishing the shaving head under water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I miss my old Remington which cost three times as much 12 years ago and sat in its own cradle, but it is nice to have a razor that doesn&#x27;t require as much counter space either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also faster and easier to use for a quick shave that doesn&#x27;t need to be super close.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, the retractable trimmer made quick work of them, so this wasn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He said he thought it shaved close and was easy to handle even for his large hands.</li>
            <li> It actually did a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> There is also a quick charge feature which promises one shave worth of power after a 5 min charge.</li>
            <li> This is a nice basic shaver.  </li>
            <li> (If you like electric shavers and have used them for years, this is review is probably not going to be useful to you)</li>
            <li> And plus 1/2 a star for being useful for body hair.</li>
            <li> I own another Remington foil shaver that looks very similar to this</li>
            <li> so provides even more shaving surface and a closer/finer outcome, battery life is longer (about double) and the overall feel is one of more weight and better quality build.</li>
            <li> Being battery operated is nice, since the last electric razor I owned had a cord, which got in the way.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is okay for a reasonably priced tool but offers nothing special to the user.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, a replacement head is available from Remington for the PF7400, which may fit.  </li>
            <li> The older one also had a coiled cord that didn&#x27;t look so cheap in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I first used it, I had about three days of scruff.</li>
            <li> When I first began shaving as a teenager, my father bought me an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used razors for 25 years and never used an electric, so I&#x27;m aware that I&#x27;m a newbie when it comes to electrics.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different types and even though they all claim they do, none of them come close to a razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very much recommend it!</li>
            <li> - haven&#x27;t had it long enough or put it through the ringer yet to find out - for now, it&#x27;s performing well and doing a very nice job as a starter for the boys.</li>
            <li> This razor is very reasonably priced and performs very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that you pretty much get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Later on, I received a free Gillette Mach 3, and began using a more traditional razor for shaving my face.</li>
            <li> but the older one had a much better pop-up trimmer that actually trimmed.</li>
            <li> like that the foils can be rinsed directly under running water, which makes cleaning a quick and painless task.</li>
            <li> My first impression was that it was much quieter than my older Remington and seemed to shave closer.</li>
            <li> It is light yet substantial enough to offer a reasonable life span and it lives up to the manufacturer&#x27;s promises.</li>
            <li> It cut really close to my skin making it look as smooth as if I had taken a traditional razorblade to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so the razor can be charged while upright and not having to be on its side, but it is very lightweight plastic</li>
            <li> As he is planning on driving straight through for 2 days, trading off driving.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*It also has a pop up trimmer which works very well</li>
            <li> To be honest, I was not liking the experience and expected the shave to be about the same, only with more work to get there.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It is an awkward razor to use, but darn it all, it gives a great shave for an electric razor!</li>
            <li> this is really a 3.5 star review.</li>
            <li> charges very quickly and the charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> It felt boxy and is not nearly as well designed and does not feel comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First is the texturized grip which is nicer than the smooth surface of the other.</li>
            <li> I let my facial hair grow out to about 0.5 centimeters (0.2\\&quot;) and gave it a full cut with the Remington PF7500.</li>
            <li> He has many much more expensive electric razors.  </li>
            <li> This one gives a closer shave, and seems to be of decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and it does a decent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a decent razor, as electric razors go.</li>
            <li> I also recommend keeping your original sales receipt as the limited two-year warranty requires it as proof of purchase.</li>
            <li> I still use an old fashioned straight razor for date</li>
            <li> I am going to try a Braun next, just because I don&#x27;t think it is worth the cost to replace the blades as another reviewer noted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to be faster or easier than what I currently do ( I shave in the shower, which makes for a pretty fast, close shave.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as messy as the Gillette, and may save some clean-up time, but I value the closer shave more.</li>
            <li> so it is not hard to plug it in each day after using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> seemed fine for the next two weeks with daily use and cleaning.</li>
            <li> I am lazy and this electric razor does a fine job of making me ready for work!  </li>
            <li> What I do not like about it is the new style trimmer.</li>
            <li> My old triple foil Remington 400 with 2 year old replacement blades shaves much closer than my new F5 PF7500.</li>
            <li> This is particularly noticeable on the &amp;#34;corners&amp;#34;, i.e. around the chin and near the sideburns.</li>
            <li> This shaver was comfortable to hold in my hands, and did a good job cutting my facial hair.  </li>
            <li> It might give a pretty close one if I stayed at the mirror an extra 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I remember being able to shave faster and, obviously, it&#x27;s easier to shave in other locations as you&#x27;re doing things.</li>
            <li> so thought this would basically be the exact same thing with a longer life battery</li>
            <li> While the initial time it probably took as long as it would with my Fusion, I was very surprised by how smooth my face felt.</li>
            <li> I did not perform any pre-shaving steps, just went right in to see how well the Remington would cut hair that long.</li>
            <li> I opened it again to clean it and one of the blades fell out again, this time falling in the bathroom sink and going down the drain.</li>
            <li> I turned it on, I was surprised how loud it was.</li>
            <li> and I never could quite figure out how to completely shave the area under my chin.</li>
            <li> The manual says to stretch the skin with your free hand so that the hairs stand upright, but I still came across a few rebels.</li>
            <li> The biggest fault I&#x27;ve found is that this razor doesn&#x27;t give me as close a shave as my old reliable Gillette Track II.</li>
            <li> Its poor ergonomics and straight foil made it tricky, and it required much more re-positioning to get my neck.</li>
            <li> I have a similar, but older Remington shaver</li>
            <li> The Remington did a much better job at getting the longer scruff that I&#x27;d usually have to get with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Overall, for the price, this is a decent razor and I will use it until it dies, too.</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t expect much when he used this razor however Mr. &amp;#34;I only will shave with Mach 3 sensitive blades&amp;#34; actually said he would use this razor as an every day razor.  </li>
            <li> It is small, and light.  </li>
            <li> those who had issues after using this device, keep in mind that the manufacturer recommends using it daily for three weeks to allow time for your hair and skin to become accustomed to the new shaving system.</li>
            <li> I actually got this for my legs since my older Remington shaver has bitten the dust after 12 years (and several blade changes).</li>
            <li> As time has gone on, as expected, I&#x27;ve been able to shave faster than I usually did.</li>
            <li> I purchased as a replacement for 3  year old Remington that was similar</li>
            <li> I went back to using my old Remington triple foil.</li>
            <li> Having recently tried out another Remington shaver by comparison this shaver offers more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; instead, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that this is a substantial upgrade for a not so very substantial slight price increase.</li>
            <li> This is a very low cost electric (not sure why people would want to replace parts) razor that is just adequate.</li>
            <li> The other big pro is that the sideburn shaver gives a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> It simply doesn&#x27;t trim very well and is awkwardly attached to the shaver at a right angle and it doesn&#x27;t trim very well.</li>
            <li> I have two teenage boys who are just beginning to shave - thought this would be a great starter shaver for them and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>
            <li> We have a 40ish male, with thicker facial hair and a 20ish year old with much less, finer facial hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this long enough to know if the battery will last for months or even years before not keeping a charge anymore.</li>
            <li> That said, if you want to shave in the shower or with gels, you&#x27;ll need to buy the PF7600 since both the PF7500 and PF7400 only support a dry shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 60 Day Money Back Guarantee along with a 2 yr Limited Warranty</li>
            <li> Overall, the shaver was fast enough to keep up with cutting to avoid too much pain.</li>
            <li> that weren&#x27;t amazing, but they weren&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> It comes with a Lithium battery for long use.  </li>
            <li> I felt it took too long to get anything resembling a close shave.</li>
            <li> thought is the hair on my husband is too thick, and there is too much for this shaver and my sons hair is thinner and easier to shave for this &amp;#34;economical&amp;#34; priced shaver.</li>
            <li> I know that foil shavers overall aren&#x27;t as close as electric triple head or manual shavers, but I prefer them for my legs since I can zip them along without issues when I need them outside the shower without any mess or pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried shaving dry with it, with a pre-shave, and in the shower.</li>
            <li> Although some may find that it irritates their face, I have had no problems with this, even shaving completely dry.</li>
            <li> initial use was after not shaving in nearly a week (I usually shave every other day).</li>
            <li> I bought this same exact model razor, sorry to say from a department store.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when shaving my burns, the whole thing is even more awkward to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only have to shave every few days.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It provides a closer shave with minimal passes.</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time switching it on and off with the large flat sliding button across the width of the device.  </li>
            <li> I selected this for my husband who is on a very tight schedule, driving cross country to attend a convention with one of my sons.</li>
            <li> Other than the blades falling out and</li>
            <li> My other one was $30</li>
            <li> I never even considered using an electric razor after that, and used the Fusion and other razors that Gilette introduced.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve continued to use it almost every other day since (now about two weeks).</li>
            <li> had previously gotten the $20 F2 model for my college aged son and he likes his shaver a lot.</li>
            <li> I also came across a few places where the razor had trouble clipping the hairs, especially on my neck.</li>
            <li> This Remington electric razor gives a closer, smoother shave than my Norelco, but it&#x27;s difficult to maneuver around curves of the face and feels awkward in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Right out of its package, the Remington did not feel as good in my hand as my Norelco.</li>
            <li> The shave is a little rough, so I would consider others instead of this model.</li>
            <li> Just not worth it in my opinion for a $40 shaver...still using the DE.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
            <li> The head moves too much and can make it difficult to shave when in a hurry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There was a few places where the device tugged, causing me to flinch, but that was expected with hair at that length.</li>
            <li> a test, I shaved half my face with the Remington and the other half with the Norelco.</li>
            <li> However, as the other reviewer pointed out, no replacement parts exist for this model!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some of the other reviews about how quickly the screen goes bad</li>
            <li> I thought it was odd</li>
            <li> and this one $40 with less capability.</li>
            <li> On the third week of use, the shaver started to rattle and vibrate pretty violently.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, with tax and shipping, the cost to fix is nearly $30.  </li>
            <li> This has a bare-bones narrow wire charger.</li>
            <li> The Remington PF7500 electric razor is average and not much more.  </li>
            <li> There were a few spots afterwards</li>
            <li> advantage with this PF7500 over the PF7400 is that you can shave with the cord attached should the battery go dead before you finish.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> He complained it didn&#x27;t get as close to hard to get places, around the nose.</li>
            <li> Seems they keep the prices low by cutting corners.</li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer is a little awkward to use, but otherwise does its job.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver about two months ago and one of the cutting blades already became dislodged, hitting the foil screen and splitting it.  </li>
            <li> Shaving with the Remington was a bit awkward.</li>

            <li> I purchased this shaver about two months ago and one of the cutting blades already became dislodged, hitting the foil screen and splitting it.  &amp;#34;No big deal,&amp;#34; I thought.  &amp;#34;I&#x27;ll just buy a replacement foil.&amp;#34;  However, as the other reviewer pointed out, no replacement parts exist for this model!  Now I have to wrap tape around the foil to prevent the shaver from gouging my face.  I would not recommend this model for anyone at any price.  I will now be replacing this piece of junk with a Braun or returning to my DE blade.  UPDATE: Apparently, a replacement head is available from Remington for the PF7400, which may fit.  Unfortunately, with tax and shipping, the cost to fix is nearly $30.  Just not worth it in my opinion for a $40 shaver...still using the DE.</li>
            <li> I think there is a defect with this shaver. I have a similar, but older Remington shaver and I have not had any issues with it. I decided to &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; to this one because of the lithium battery. Battery life is great. It lasted 3 weeks on a charge with daily use. I purchased it locally because it was cheaper than Amazon. My first impression was that it was much quieter than my older Remington and seemed to shave closer. When I removed the foil to clean the blades, both blades fell out. I thought it was odd and perhaps it was just not installed good. I re-installed the blades and everything seemed fine for the next two weeks with daily use and cleaning. On the third week of use, the shaver started to rattle and vibrate pretty violently. I opened it to clean it and inspect it and everything seemed fine. I used it the next day and it was still rattling and vibrating. I opened it again to clean it and one of the blades fell out again, this time falling in the bathroom sink and going down the drain. Other than the blades falling out and whatever issue that was causing it to vibrate and rattle, this was a good shaver for the 3 weeks that it actually worked. I am going to try a Braun next, just because I don&#x27;t think it is worth the cost to replace the blades as another reviewer noted.</li>
            <li> This is a nice basic shaver.  Remington is always a great name for shavers.  I am told that this is a smooth shave and very comfortable to use.  It comes with a Lithium battery for long use.  It fits well in the hand and has a nice sleek look. Recommend!</li>
            <li> This razor is very nice looking and has a good weight to it.  My son is really happy with it, although he says it doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as the rotary head razor he was using before this Remington.  If he shaves in the morning and then needs to go out in the evening, he will sometimes need to shave again.  However, the shave is very smooth and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It charges very quickly and the charge lasts a long time.  It can also be plugged in and used which is handy if you forget to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He hasn&#x27;t had any problems with the foil or blades when cleaning it like some reviewers have noted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great shaver for the price, and I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> It shaves and that&#x27;s it.  I purchased as a replacement for 3  year old Remington that was similar but the older one had a much better pop-up trimmer that actually trimmed. The older one also had a coiled cord that didn&#x27;t look so cheap in the bathroom. This has a bare-bones narrow wire charger. What I do not like about it is the new style trimmer. It simply doesn&#x27;t trim very well and is awkwardly attached to the shaver at a right angle and it doesn&#x27;t trim very well. I&#x27;ll just go buy a mustache/beard trimmer with a close setting and I&#x27;ll be good to go.  Seems they keep the prices low by cutting corners. As an example: crappy trimmer and crappy cord. My other one was $30 and this one $40 with less capability.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that you pretty much get what you pay for. That goes for electric razors for sure. This is a very low cost electric (not sure why people would want to replace parts) razor that is just adequate. I wanted to try this pivoting foil head over my current Remington Rotary. It doesn&#x27;t give as close a shave as I&#x27;m used to with the rotary. It might give a pretty close one if I stayed at the mirror an extra 5 minutes but that&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
            <li> The Remington PF7500 electric razor is average and not much more.  I have a difficult time switching it on and off with the large flat sliding button across the width of the device.  The clipper button is snappy and the blade pops up like a jack in the box.  It is simple, having a cover for the head that functions as a stand so the razor can be charged while upright and not having to be on its side, but it is very lightweight plastic and I don&#x27;t expect it to survive regular use.  All in all, this is okay for a reasonably priced tool but offers nothing special to the user.  The shave is a little rough, so I would consider others instead of this model.</li>
            <li> My husband can&#x27;t believe how great this razor works.  He has many much more expensive electric razors.  He didn&#x27;t expect much when he used this razor however Mr. &amp;#34;I only will shave with Mach 3 sensitive blades&amp;#34; actually said he would use this razor as an every day razor.  Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair.  I only have to shave every few days.  This shaver was comfortable to hold in my hands, and did a good job cutting my facial hair.  It doesn&#x27;t get close like my Mach 3 razor, but it also did not agitate my skin either.  I was able to get a good enough shave where I looked presentable, without having to worry about getting bumps.  It definitely helps using shaving cream.  It was a quick cut, and easy to clean.  You just run it under water and you are done.  The picture shows some kind of stand to hold the shaver, but I did not get anything like that with my shaver.  It is small, and light.  Worked great, and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This shaver has worked out nicely for me to date. I&#x27;d been using a three-head rotary shaver which did a fair job. This one gives a closer shave, and seems to be of decent quality for the price. I&#x27;ve tried shaving dry with it, with a pre-shave, and in the shower. It worked just fine in all cases. The pop-up trimmer is a little awkward to use, but otherwise does its job. It remains to be seen how well the blades and the foil will hold up over time, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> I bought this same exact model razor, sorry to say from a department store.  My old triple foil Remington 400 with 2 year old replacement blades shaves much closer than my new F5 PF7500. I do not get a close shave with this razor. I would not recommend this razor. I went back to using my old Remington triple foil. I can shave with the F5 but its not close at all. It was a mistake for me to buy this model.</li>
            <li> I selected this for my husband who is on a very tight schedule, driving cross country to attend a convention with one of my sons. As he is planning on driving straight through for 2 days, trading off driving.  I selected F5 model as it hold a charge for an hour which will be more than sufficient for his needs. No losing time or arriving unkept because he didn&#x27;t stop at a motel to shave. He will be presentable  the minute he steps out of the van.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had previously gotten the $20 F2 model for my college aged son and he likes his shaver a lot. I upgraded to this one for my husband as ths F5 model only takes 2 hours to charge whereas the F2 needed to chrge overnight which wasn&#x27;t a problem as he lives at home so it is not hard to plug it in each day after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It also has a pop up trimmer which works very well and it has a Manufacturer 60 Day Money Back Guarantee along with a 2 yr Limited Warranty and it has a LED Charge indicator jthe same as the F2 model does and like that one, I am saving LOTS of $$ by not having to pay for all those refill blades anymore!</li>
            <li> We have a 40ish male, with thicker facial hair and a 20ish year old with much less, finer facial hair. The shaver wasn&#x27;t something the 40ish year old liked. He said the shaver did not allow for a close shave that he prefers. He complained it didn&#x27;t get as close to hard to get places, around the nose. But he did say this is why he never uses electric shavers, this is no different. Now, the 20ish year old loved it. He said he thought it shaved close and was easy to handle even for his large hands. The shave was close for him and it allowed him to shave in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thought is the hair on my husband is too thick, and there is too much for this shaver and my sons hair is thinner and easier to shave for this &amp;#34;economical&amp;#34; priced shaver. I think my husband would need a heavier duty shaver for him to be happier.</li>
            <li> Having recently tried out another Remington shaver by comparison this shaver offers more.&lt;br /&gt;It provides a closer shave with minimal passes. It also has a nice pivot which makes it easier to hold as well as making it more comfortable at shaving time.&lt;br /&gt;Its Lithium battery holds a charge for 60 minutes and it also has a 5 minute quick charge that is supposed to work in a pinch which I didn&#x27;t test.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from giving a nice close shave with no detectable stubble, it trims nicely around the neck and sideburns. The battery charge remained consistent but you can also use this corded if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Clean-up is easy as this can be cleaned under water but swishing the shaving head under water.&lt;br /&gt;While this isn&#x27;t a high end shaver, it is a good entry level one. It is light yet substantial enough to offer a reasonable life span and it lives up to the manufacturer&#x27;s promises.</li>
            <li> I have had a Philips Norelco electric razor for several years. I use it several times a month, use a Gillette Mach 3 manual razor often, and, the rest of the time, I let the scruff grow. This Remington electric razor gives a closer, smoother shave than my Norelco, but it&#x27;s difficult to maneuver around curves of the face and feels awkward in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Right out of its package, the Remington did not feel as good in my hand as my Norelco. It felt boxy and is not nearly as well designed and does not feel comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I turned it on, I was surprised how loud it was. This is likely a result of how the blades move under the foil, but it was a surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used it, I had about three days of scruff. For me, this is just about at the limit of an electric razor for me; with hair longer than this, I have to go to my Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a test, I shaved half my face with the Remington and the other half with the Norelco. Shaving with the Remington was a bit awkward. Its poor ergonomics and straight foil made it tricky, and it required much more re-positioning to get my neck. To be honest, I was not liking the experience and expected the shave to be about the same, only with more work to get there. However ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big Pros&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, I had my unbiased wife feel both sides and give her thoughts. Without hesitation, she chose the Remington side! The Remington did a much better job at getting the longer scruff that I&#x27;d usually have to get with a regular razor. Now to be fair, my Norelco blades had been used more, and the Remington was brand new, but I could feel and see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have both razors side by side in my bathroom, and I keep picking up the Remington to get a closer shave. The other big pro is that the sideburn shaver gives a much closer shave. Unfortunately, when shaving my burns, the whole thing is even more awkward to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;It is an awkward razor to use, but darn it all, it gives a great shave for an electric razor! That said, I won&#x27;t be getting rid of my old razor, as the Norelco is fully wet/dry, and that is very handy at times. It&#x27;s also faster and easier to use for a quick shave that doesn&#x27;t need to be super close.o use, but darn it all, it gives a great shave for an electric razor!

            <li> When I first began shaving as a teenager, my father bought me an electric shaver. It was a Remington, and one that I used for years. Later on, I received a free Gillette Mach 3, and began using a more traditional razor for shaving my face. I never even considered using an electric razor after that, and used the Fusion and other razors that Gilette introduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time went on, and I remembered the benefit of using an electric razor. I remember being able to shave faster and, obviously, it&#x27;s easier to shave in other locations as you&#x27;re doing things. I remember never having as close of a shave, but figured it would be good for some days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial use was after not shaving in nearly a week (I usually shave every other day). I applied some electric pre-shave to my face and went to work. While the initial time it probably took as long as it would with my Fusion, I was very surprised by how smooth my face felt. I&#x27;d never had an electric razor this good. There were a few spots afterwards that weren&#x27;t amazing, but they weren&#x27;t bad. I could deal with them. Sometimes I run into that with the Gillette anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve continued to use it almost every other day since (now about two weeks). I&#x27;ve been impressed. As time has gone on, as expected, I&#x27;ve been able to shave faster than I usually did. The convenience is nice, and I love being able to just rinse it out with water afterwards. So easy! I&#x27;ve yet to have had to charge it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I&#x27;m glad I picked this up. Technology has improved over years, and I&#x27;m glad to see that has occurred with razors. It&#x27;s exactly what I was hoping for. Don&#x27;t hesitate to pick this up if you&#x27;re in need of a good, nicely priced electric razor.</li>
            <li> My son is using this. He said it is easier to use disposables. The head moves too much and can make it difficult to shave when in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I have two teenage boys who are just beginning to shave - thought this would be a great starter shaver for them and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed.  Easy to use, easy to clean - this Remington does a great job on them.  I&#x27;ve read some of the other reviews about how quickly the screen goes bad - haven&#x27;t had it long enough or put it through the ringer yet to find out - for now, it&#x27;s performing well and doing a very nice job as a starter for the boys.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used razors for 25 years and never used an electric, so I&#x27;m aware that I&#x27;m a newbie when it comes to electrics. So consider that when reading the review. That said, I wasn&#x27;t impressed and I think I&#x27;ll stick to razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel I gave it a fair shot. I tried using it for a week. Read the manual, read articles online and watched a couple videos on how to use an electric. I felt it took too long to get anything resembling a close shave. The shave was definitely not as close as a razor and I never could quite figure out how to completely shave the area under my chin. Granted, with practice I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d get easier and faster, but I don&#x27;t see the benefit. It&#x27;s not going to be faster or easier than what I currently do ( I shave in the shower, which makes for a pretty fast, close shave.) and it&#x27;s not going to be as close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for non-facial hair (under arm and whatnot), I did find it to be easier than a razor. In that case, I&#x27;m just trimming and I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s a super close shave or perfect. So I will be using it for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is really a 3.5 star review. three stars because I think it&#x27;s a good product that just didn&#x27;t work for me for the stated purpose. (If you like electric shavers and have used them for years, this is review is probably not going to be useful to you) And plus 1/2 a star for being useful for body hair.</li>
            <li> I let my facial hair grow out to about 0.5 centimeters (0.2\\&quot;) and gave it a full cut with the Remington PF7500. I did not perform any pre-shaving steps, just went right in to see how well the Remington would cut hair that long. It actually did a pretty good job. It cut really close to my skin making it look as smooth as if I had taken a traditional razorblade to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a few places where the device tugged, causing me to flinch, but that was expected with hair at that length. Overall, the shaver was fast enough to keep up with cutting to avoid too much pain. I also came across a few places where the razor had trouble clipping the hairs, especially on my neck. The manual says to stretch the skin with your free hand so that the hairs stand upright, but I still came across a few rebels. Thankfully, the retractable trimmer made quick work of them, so this wasn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the foils can be rinsed directly under running water, which makes cleaning a quick and painless task. It does recommend to soap them and do a more thorough cleaning once a month, but even that isn&#x27;t too vigorous or time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An advantage with this PF7500 over the PF7400 is that you can shave with the cord attached should the battery go dead before you finish. There is also a quick charge feature which promises one shave worth of power after a 5 min charge. That said, if you want to shave in the shower or with gels, you&#x27;ll need to buy the PF7600 since both the PF7500 and PF7400 only support a dry shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who had issues after using this device, keep in mind that the manufacturer recommends using it daily for three weeks to allow time for your hair and skin to become accustomed to the new shaving system. I also recommend keeping your original sales receipt as the limited two-year warranty requires it as proof of purchase. Of course, if you buy this online through Amazon, you can always print it off later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this shaver. It cuts well, holds a good charge and is easy to keep clean.happy with this shaver. It cuts well, holds a good charge and is easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> This is a good dependable razor. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and it does a decent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, it doesn&#x27;t do as good as job as a razor, but no electric razors do. I&#x27;ve used many different types and even though they all claim they do, none of them come close to a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I am lazy and this electric razor does a fine job of making me ready for work!  I still use an old fashioned straight razor for date nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last electric razor was rotary. I really enjoy the rectangle shape of the razor head on this unit. It allows me to get in close around my beard without worrying about shaving off something I don&#x27;t want to shave off.  It also has a pop up trimmer that is good for making clean lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This electric razor has replaced the much more expensive electric razor I had been using. This razor is very reasonably priced and performs very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very much recommend it!</li>
            <li> I own another Remington foil shaver that looks very similar to this so thought this would basically be the exact same thing with a longer life battery; instead, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that this is a substantial upgrade for a not so very substantial slight price increase. The look is similar but the quality of materials, battery life and function is enhanced. First is the texturized grip which is nicer than the smooth surface of the other. Next is that this has three heads rather than two so provides even more shaving surface and a closer/finer outcome, battery life is longer (about double) and the overall feel is one of more weight and better quality build. All of these in this line are a good value and provide a close shave but this is an outstanding value.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this long enough to know if the battery will last for months or even years before not keeping a charge anymore. I actually got this for my legs since my older Remington shaver has bitten the dust after 12 years (and several blade changes). I know that foil shavers overall aren&#x27;t as close as electric triple head or manual shavers, but I prefer them for my legs since I can zip them along without issues when I need them outside the shower without any mess or pain. Overall, for the price, this is a decent razor and I will use it until it dies, too. I miss my old Remington which cost three times as much 12 years ago and sat in its own cradle, but it is nice to have a razor that doesn&#x27;t require as much counter space either.</li>
            <li> what EVER you do, do not buy this shaver!...impossible to find replacement parts!..tried walmart, target, sears, ebay, amazon, AND REMINGTON!!..when shaver blades and screen no longer functional, will simply have to toss shaver in trash.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I have ever had.  Does a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This is a decent razor, as electric razors go. I find that it is easy to use and clean and is cost competitive with a manual razor if you figure in shave cream and blades purchased over a year or two. Being battery operated is nice, since the last electric razor I owned had a cord, which got in the way. Although some may find that it irritates their face, I have had no problems with this, even shaving completely dry. The biggest fault I&#x27;ve found is that this razor doesn&#x27;t give me as close a shave as my old reliable Gillette Track II. This is particularly noticeable on the &amp;#34;corners&amp;#34;, i.e. around the chin and near the sideburns. It&#x27;s not as messy as the Gillette, and may save some clean-up time, but I value the closer shave more.</li>
