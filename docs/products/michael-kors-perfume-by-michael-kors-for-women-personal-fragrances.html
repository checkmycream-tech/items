            <li>so my scent memory remains strong.</li>
            <li>Strong not overpowering smell.</li>
            <li>I try to get people to describe scents for me but in general people aren&#x27;t great at this</li>
            <li>I have always made sure I had an adequate supply since.</li>
            <li>Unique scent, can&#x27;t find anything close to it.</li>

            <li>My absolute favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>Since perfume is so personal, I will just say that I love the light scent, and although light, it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This is a great professional or personal scent.</li>
            <li>Not too strong for the office and just right for an identifiably sensual scent on a date.</li>
            <li>My favorite and only perfume I wear</li>
            <li>I first ordered this, I liked that it was described as fresh and long lasting but from the first time I wore it</li>

            <li>(which was my late husband&#x27;s name, so it seemed extra special:)  </li>
            <li>this is a very soft smell</li>
            <li>it is pretty powerful, I typically spray my perfume on my chest and both wrists then rub.  </li>
            <li>But, strangely, it doesn&#x27;t start leaking right away...</li>
            <li>It feels modern and vintage at the same time...</li>
            <li>(I sprayed it on some really nice false flowers.)  </li>

            <li> One spray goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT for hot days, you may choke yourself or worse your friends</li>
            <li> I have ordered several bottles of perfume from Amazon, and this is the first fake one that I have received.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that sadly, I have NO sense of smell at all</li>
            <li> , no kidding!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other scents but always seem to return to Michael.  </li>
            <li> I have worn the fragrance for years, and this is a fake not the real fragrance at all.</li>
            <li> Bottle typically lasts a year.</li>
            <li> The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because there seems to be a serious design flaw in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> She uses it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> it takes a few dozen uses before it happens.  </li>
            <li> Very very disappointed, and I love this scent..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really difficult to get off, not that you&#x27;d want to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Disappointed that every time I spray it, it leaks.</li>
            <li> It pairs well with Bath and Body Works&#x27; Velvet Tuberose shower gel and lotion as they both have tuberose in the base.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>

            <li> This cologne smells terrific. My sister loves MK and was very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new scent, this one is wonderful!  Highly recommend!  Since perfume is so personal, I will just say that I love the light scent, and although light, it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> A gift and she loved it</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle on the bottle is defective. It leaks over the bottle when pumped. For the price of this, I would think the quality of the spray nozzle would be better.</li>
            <li> 2 thumbs up,, and it&#x27;s the Real deal. ..</li>
            <li> IT the real deal Love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the fragrance, that is why I purchased it.  The bottle came defective and leaks all over.  Disappointed that every time I spray it, it leaks.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that sadly, I have NO sense of smell at all so I have no idea what this perfume smells like!! I try to get people to describe scents for me but in general people aren&#x27;t great at this and so I have to rely on descriptions or reviews on Amazon or such sites.&lt;br /&gt;When I first ordered this, I liked that it was described as fresh and long lasting but from the first time I wore it I have received compliments from men and women and many write down the name there and then !&lt;br /&gt;I wear it throughout the year and it definitely has staying power- I spray it on in the morning and people are still commenting on it by the afternoon .&lt;br /&gt;If anyone out there can describe it for me I would be truly grateful. Btw, I used to have a sense of smell so my scent memory remains strong.</li>
            <li> This is a great professional or personal scent. Not too strong for the office and just right for an identifiably sensual scent on a date.</li>
            <li> Excellent price, fast shipping. Strong not overpowering smell. Loving my perfume.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this scent by an ex-boyfriend in 2007. I have always made sure I had an adequate supply since. It pairs well with Bath and Body Works&#x27; Velvet Tuberose shower gel and lotion as they both have tuberose in the base. I would highly recommend this fragrance because it is not common at all.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite perfume. I get compliments every time I wear it. Unique scent, can&#x27;t find anything close to it. Long lasting, one. Bottle typically lasts a year. One spray goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love thus perfume and have used it for about 15 years, no kidding!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other scents but always seem to return to Michael.  I receive compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances from Michael Kors!</li>
            <li> It was a birthday gift and she loved it. She uses it almost everyday. I may buy another one for a &amp;#34;just because&amp;#34; gift.</li>
            <li> This was an &amp;#34;asked for&amp;#34; Christmas gift, and I hope she likes it!</li>
            <li> got this for my mother. She loves it. It is the best price around and comes right to your door</li>
            <li> I smelled this on one of my co workers and I was hooked! Very light, sweet fragrance, so it&#x27;s perfect work/daytime wear.</li>
            <li> My favorite and only perfume I wear</li>
            <li> One of my favorites!!!</li>
            <li> I HAVE ORDERED THIS PERFUME BEFORE, A VERY NICE SCENT.</li>
            <li> Musky smell. Over all it last all day.</li>
            <li> Michael Kors perfume has been my favorite fragrance since it as launched.  A beautiful creamy floral with tuberose...I fell in love with it the first time I smelled it.  It feels modern and vintage at the same time... Back then it was just called &amp;#34;Michael&amp;#34; (which was my late husband&#x27;s name, so it seemed extra special:)  The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because there seems to be a serious design flaw in the bottle.  Every bottle I&#x27;ve purchased (department stores, online, etc.) leaks.  It drips out in the area where the metal portion meets the glass.  But, strangely, it doesn&#x27;t start leaking right away...it takes a few dozen uses before it happens.  I&#x27;ve read the same thing in some of Amazon&#x27;s reviews.</li>
            <li> I love the perfume its fragrance ,it is sexy !! arrive when it was supposed to and I will recommend the seller</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed. I have worn the fragrance for years, and this is a fake not the real fragrance at all. I have ordered several bottles of perfume from Amazon, and this is the first fake one that I have received. Very very disappointed, and I love this scent..</li>
            <li> Love Michael Kors fragrance this is a very soft smell and I get compliments on it all the time people wants to know what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> the bottle leaks when u spray it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to buy this perfume ever since I first smelt it in the Michael Kors store, I fell in love!! I&#x27;m so happy I found it on here for such a great price.</li>
            <li> love the parfum..was so easy and being delivered to my door was awesome</li>
            <li> The fragrant was sdifferent than what I experience from a dept store...</li>
            <li> If you like the scent in the Michael Kors store, you&#x27;ll like this.  Warning it is pretty powerful, I typically spray my perfume on my chest and both wrists then rub.  Not this one though, ONE spritz on one wrist is enough for all day and then some.  LOL! It&#x27;s really difficult to get off, not that you&#x27;d want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also makes a nice scent for the home, it has some warm undertones and lingers for days.  (I sprayed it on some really nice false flowers.)  I&#x27;d consider it a winter scent or breezy spring day scent.  Definitely NOT for hot days, you may choke yourself or worse your friends/date, for some reason it seems to get stronger (heat activated?).</li>
