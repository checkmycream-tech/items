            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try more colors ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>So glad I found it.</li>
            <li>It is a great one i like it so much</li>
            <li>Ok so I was debating on buying this for about two months...</li>
            <li>Will keep checking nyx website to see if its ever in stock, BTW I love this shade</li>
            <li>I like the product will buy more of them.</li>
            <li>It seems more appropriate for Halloween as costume make-up.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>So many compliments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This color is not only flawless, but it makes your teeth look whiter.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>SURE YOU PUT ON CHAPSTICK BEFORE APPLYING ANY OF THE MATTE LIP CREMES</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I came up here to order me some some more, but I am not going to pay 42.00 for something that was 7.00 in March.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Really love.</li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>Can be controlled better with another lipstick or gloss on top.</li>
            <li>The formula is creamy and it does set nicely, but once it does set you&#x27;ll be lucky to find a way to fix any mistakes you may have made without ruining the makeup around your mouth.</li>
            <li>Beautiful on fair skin for those of us who want a dark vampy look!</li>
            <li>I loved this color so much, that I just ordered another tube because I do not want to run out.  </li>
            <li>Stunning color and definitely worth the price though!</li>
            <li>This is so creamy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s dark and beautiful and the longevity is also amazing.</li>
            <li>, definitely will be buying 3 more of this color lol</li>
            <li>Love it, prefect for my full lips</li>
            <li>A purse/ makeup bag should be fine.</li>
            <li>I never thought I could wear colors so bold before, but Nyx made me fall in love with color for my lips.</li>
            <li>Love it but ran out so quickly</li>
            <li>It was the precise colour I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth</li>
            <li>Has decent coverage, needs to be layered on for the color to be even but a nice choice for people who desire a vampy colored lip.</li>
            <li>I love the color , but it comes off very easily, fast shipping though!</li>
            <li>Love the color, but has to be applied a lot, looks funny if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Love it so much!</li>
            <li>I love this color so much, I always get a compliment whenever I wear it!</li>
            <li>Love this color came in the mail so fast!</li>
            <li>I stand by original review, but can anyone tell me why something i paid 6.94 (including tax) is now 42.00????</li>
            <li>Glides on smoothly but kind of leaves bare spots on your lips.maybe</li>
            <li>Oh sweet jesus awsome lip color&lt;</li>
            <li>I would suggest looking at youtube videos or photo to get a good sense of the color on human skin before purchasing.</li>
            <li>would be a bit more reasonable.</li>
            <li>The other matte lip colors by NYX are excellent, however this particular shade is rare.</li>
            <li>Love my new nyx matte lip!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly and is very purply</li>
            <li>For reference, I have light hair, green eyes and fair skin.</li>
            <li>Love the girl and arrived early</li>
            <li>The color is highly pigmented and the matte is beautifully smooth and powdery.</li>
            <li>These are special and the color really lasts.</li>
            <li>It was shipped on time and its all i wanted, im very pleased and will buy other colors soon.</li>
            <li>Package arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>actually got my first tube in the color London from my local beauty supply store, after seeing the wonderful matte quality, I decided to come to Amazon and see what other colors were available.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li>When i spread it on it turned out lighter than what it first looks like.</li>
            <li>However, when I got it, it wasn&#x27;t much in it!</li>
            <li>Always make sure to wear lip liner when using this product to make it last a lot longer</li>
            <li>I love how deep in color this lip cream is.</li>
            <li>i think... thought it would b more red ...</li>
            <li>I reccomend fast shipping !</li>
            <li>Anyways, thanks again!</li>
            <li>I mix w a litte smash box gloss and looks really pretty.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous colour for black skin!</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something new and found Nyx Lip products to be very user friendly.  </li>
            <li>but i expected it to be darker, but overall this product is easy to apply and its amazing</li>
            <li>Super dark violet color, smells lovely.</li>
            <li>thanks so much !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a WONDERFUL DEEP DEEP DARK Burgundy.</li>
            <li>I really like</li>
            <li>Not sticky at all and dries fast.</li>
            <li>It shipped hella fast, too.</li>
            <li>However, that is expected with most matte lipsticks.</li>
            <li>NYX is much cheaper from its website.</li>
            <li>shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented.</li>
            <li>Very awsesome.</li>
            <li>Would have cost too much to return.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you keep it in a safe place where it on&#x27;t get broken.</li>
            <li>Using a lip liner like MAC&#x27;s Nightmoth with it helps tremendously and because this can be a tiny bit patchy, you may want to fill your whole lip in with the liner.</li>
            <li>Her complexion is more caramel with dark hair and eyes.</li>
            <li>I love how dark it is and the matte look is too cute!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>So glad I got this before it became so popular, paying 8 USD compared to the crazy prices it going at now..</li>
            <li>My new FAVORITE dark lip color.</li>
            <li>The color is highly pigmented and pops on my lips.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>ordered several more.but not from here but only if i half to.i found ut cheaper on the site &amp;one shipping cost if i needed more.other than that ,great product awsome delivery</li>
            <li>This matte long lasting and very light, you often forget you put anything on your lips.</li>
            <li>She bought hers from sephora which was a little more.</li>
            <li>So far, my absolute favorites in this Matte Lip Cream line are London and Copenhagen.</li>
            <li>would have been worth the price if it stayed on longer than ten minutes or till you eat something</li>
            <li>I really love the color, but there are a few problems...</li>
            <li>Looks better after a few layers get out on though.</li>
            <li>Matte, strong color, it doesn&#x27;t bleed down my face</li>
            <li>It looks very pretty on, and delivers a bold and edgy look.</li>
            <li>Second a little better.</li>
            <li>I love this color, it&#x27;s very very dark but still remains purplish red.</li>
            <li>Stays on all day, unless you eat something, which is common with many lip products.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>OH WOW</li>
            <li>OH WOW</li>
            <li>OH WOW OH WOW</li>
            <li>Worked better for me to use a single coat rubbed into lip balm to make a dark stain.</li>
            <li>Just remember to use a matching Nyx lip liner and let the first layer of lip cream dry in between applications.</li>
            <li>If left alone, it tends to come off quick and dries a little fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely streaky and the color isn&#x27;t consistent.</li>
            <li>I expected I dark purple, but it came out looking more red on my deeper skin tone.</li>
            <li>It is a super dark purple-y red.</li>
            <li>First application is a mixture of dark and light, very messy.</li>
            <li>Worth the price, but take a minute to do it, or it&#x27;ll look like a hot mess for the average user.</li>
            <li>Hard to use at first, very creamy and pigmented.</li>
            <li>Nice color love matte only problem hated the stickiness and would clump up</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the same consistency as the soft matte cream I purchased at ulta.</li>
            <li>Very seperated &amp; water not much pigmentation</li>
            <li>When I put it on it felt super cheap, maybe a fake nyx product!</li>
            <li>This is a dark purple, very punk rock-esc colour.</li>
            <li>It sticks to certain parts of my lips oddly and creates the illusion of a different colored splotches.</li>

            <li> Smooth and smells good.</li>
            <li> The package was very secure and had the paper with my order on it inside.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t drying the way most matte lipsticks tend to be.</li>
            <li> and so glad I took the recc.</li>
            <li> Love it though its a bit drying</li>
            <li> Love this matte color...got a lot of  compliments</li>
            <li> Otherwise lovely lip product.</li>
            <li> would definitely love to shop again.thanks abunch.</li>
            <li> You need more than one coat to achieve it.</li>
            <li> It stayed on for most of the day without reapplication.</li>
            <li> Love this color.</li>
            <li> I love my NYX cosmetics.</li>
            <li> i love the color</li>
            <li> Love love love, this matte lip cream is better than macs lipstick...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try more colors ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> It is a great one i like it so much</li>
            <li> Ok so I was debating on buying this for about two months...</li>
            <li> Will keep checking nyx website to see if its ever in stock, BTW I love this shade</li>
            <li> I like the product will buy more of them.</li>
            <li> It seems more appropriate for Halloween as costume make-up.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> So many compliments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This color is not only flawless, but it makes your teeth look whiter.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> SURE YOU PUT ON CHAPSTICK BEFORE APPLYING ANY OF THE MATTE LIP CREMES</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I came up here to order me some some more, but I am not going to pay 42.00 for something that was 7.00 in March.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Really love.</li>
            <li> I love this color.</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> Can be controlled better with another lipstick or gloss on top.</li>
            <li> The formula is creamy and it does set nicely, but once it does set you&#x27;ll be lucky to find a way to fix any mistakes you may have made without ruining the makeup around your mouth.</li>
            <li> Beautiful on fair skin for those of us who want a dark vampy look!</li>
            <li> I loved this color so much, that I just ordered another tube because I do not want to run out.  </li>
            <li> Stunning color and definitely worth the price though!</li>
            <li> This is so creamy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s dark and beautiful and the longevity is also amazing.</li>
            <li> , definitely will be buying 3 more of this color lol</li>
            <li> Love it, prefect for my full lips</li>
            <li> A purse/ makeup bag should be fine.</li>
            <li> I never thought I could wear colors so bold before, but Nyx made me fall in love with color for my lips.</li>
            <li> Love it but ran out so quickly</li>
            <li> It was the precise colour I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth</li>
            <li> Has decent coverage, needs to be layered on for the color to be even but a nice choice for people who desire a vampy colored lip.</li>
            <li> I love the color , but it comes off very easily, fast shipping though!</li>
            <li> Love the color, but has to be applied a lot, looks funny if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Love it so much!</li>
            <li> I love this color so much, I always get a compliment whenever I wear it!</li>
            <li> Love this color came in the mail so fast!</li>
            <li> I stand by original review, but can anyone tell me why something i paid 6.94 (including tax) is now 42.00????</li>
            <li> Glides on smoothly but kind of leaves bare spots on your lips.maybe</li>
            <li> Oh sweet jesus awsome lip color&lt;</li>
            <li> I would suggest looking at youtube videos or photo to get a good sense of the color on human skin before purchasing.</li>
            <li> would be a bit more reasonable.</li>
            <li> The other matte lip colors by NYX are excellent, however this particular shade is rare.</li>
            <li> Love my new nyx matte lip!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly and is very purply</li>
            <li> For reference, I have light hair, green eyes and fair skin.</li>
            <li> Love the girl and arrived early</li>
            <li> The color is highly pigmented and the matte is beautifully smooth and powdery.</li>
            <li> These are special and the color really lasts.</li>
            <li> It was shipped on time and its all i wanted, im very pleased and will buy other colors soon.</li>
            <li> Package arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> actually got my first tube in the color London from my local beauty supply store, after seeing the wonderful matte quality, I decided to come to Amazon and see what other colors were available.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li> When i spread it on it turned out lighter than what it first looks like.</li>
            <li> However, when I got it, it wasn&#x27;t much in it!</li>
            <li> Always make sure to wear lip liner when using this product to make it last a lot longer</li>
            <li> I love how deep in color this lip cream is.</li>
            <li> i think... thought it would b more red ...</li>
            <li> I reccomend fast shipping !</li>
            <li> Anyways, thanks again!</li>
            <li> I mix w a litte smash box gloss and looks really pretty.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous colour for black skin!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new and found Nyx Lip products to be very user friendly.  </li>
            <li> but i expected it to be darker, but overall this product is easy to apply and its amazing</li>
            <li> Super dark violet color, smells lovely.</li>
            <li> thanks so much !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a WONDERFUL DEEP DEEP DARK Burgundy.</li>
            <li> I really like</li>
            <li> Not sticky at all and dries fast.</li>
            <li> It shipped hella fast, too.</li>
            <li> However, that is expected with most matte lipsticks.</li>
            <li> NYX is much cheaper from its website.</li>
            <li> shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented.</li>
            <li> Very awsesome.</li>
            <li> Would have cost too much to return.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you keep it in a safe place where it on&#x27;t get broken.</li>
            <li> Using a lip liner like MAC&#x27;s Nightmoth with it helps tremendously and because this can be a tiny bit patchy, you may want to fill your whole lip in with the liner.</li>
            <li> Her complexion is more caramel with dark hair and eyes.</li>
            <li> I love how dark it is and the matte look is too cute!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> So glad I got this before it became so popular, paying 8 USD compared to the crazy prices it going at now..</li>
            <li> My new FAVORITE dark lip color.</li>
            <li> The color is highly pigmented and pops on my lips.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> ordered several more.but not from here but only if i half to.i found ut cheaper on the site &amp;one shipping cost if i needed more.other than that ,great product awsome delivery</li>
            <li> This matte long lasting and very light, you often forget you put anything on your lips.</li>
            <li> She bought hers from sephora which was a little more.</li>
            <li> So far, my absolute favorites in this Matte Lip Cream line are London and Copenhagen.</li>
            <li> would have been worth the price if it stayed on longer than ten minutes or till you eat something</li>
            <li> I really love the color, but there are a few problems...</li>
            <li> Looks better after a few layers get out on though.</li>
            <li> Matte, strong color, it doesn&#x27;t bleed down my face</li>
            <li> It looks very pretty on, and delivers a bold and edgy look.</li>
            <li> Second a little better.</li>
            <li> I love this color, it&#x27;s very very dark but still remains purplish red.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day, unless you eat something, which is common with many lip products.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> OH WOW</li>
            <li> OH WOW</li>
            <li> OH WOW OH WOW</li>
            <li> Worked better for me to use a single coat rubbed into lip balm to make a dark stain.</li>
            <li> Just remember to use a matching Nyx lip liner and let the first layer of lip cream dry in between applications.</li>
            <li> If left alone, it tends to come off quick and dries a little fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely streaky and the color isn&#x27;t consistent.</li>
            <li> I expected I dark purple, but it came out looking more red on my deeper skin tone.</li>
            <li> It is a super dark purple-y red.</li>
            <li> First application is a mixture of dark and light, very messy.</li>
            <li> Worth the price, but take a minute to do it, or it&#x27;ll look like a hot mess for the average user.</li>
            <li> Hard to use at first, very creamy and pigmented.</li>
            <li> Nice color love matte only problem hated the stickiness and would clump up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same consistency as the soft matte cream I purchased at ulta.</li>
            <li> Very seperated &amp; water not much pigmentation</li>
            <li> When I put it on it felt super cheap, maybe a fake nyx product!</li>
            <li> This is a dark purple, very punk rock-esc colour.</li>
            <li> It sticks to certain parts of my lips oddly and creates the illusion of a different colored splotches.</li>
            <li> I applied 2 coatings (I let the first coat dry before I applied the second)with a little lipliner</li>
            <li> This flat out sucked.</li>
            <li> non drying long lasting</li>
            <li> She has been searching for it for a long time and finally found it.</li>
            <li> Only thing is it don&#x27;t last very long and by the time of your 3rd or 4th use it seems empty..</li>
            <li> Also remember to keep your lips moisturized because this emphasizes dry lips and definitely makes it even drier.</li>
            <li> Also the lip cream is very hard to get out of the tube, like it is only half full.  </li>
            <li> The only problems are; 1) It is lighter than expected.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t stay on for long every two hours i have to reapply.hope</li>
            <li> Stays on for a long time and does not look glossy.</li>
            <li> I have medium brown skin, somewhere around Nia Long&#x27;s color.</li>
            <li> It acts as a stain and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perfect color, even application and the matte dry is</li>
            <li> matte brands dry out your lips or start to crumble over time but not this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> OR IT WILL DRY YOUR LIPS OUT.</li>
            <li> way tooo dark for my skin, not the same color I saw online.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s dark, it&#x27;s longn lasting, it&#x27;s not patchy at all.</li>
            <li> It is really difficult to get a full application on your lips.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I needed about three and it was still patchy in some parts. :(</li>
            <li> it looks black red.</li>
            <li> Dries very dry.</li>
            <li> If you have very dry lips</li>
            <li> This is a matte lip cream very dark almost like a black but with a clear lip gloss</li>
            <li> wasnt worth it too expensive  </li>
            <li> Tube seemed rather empty for $12....</li>
            <li> there was alot of reapplying throughout the day, and that&#x27;s not really something</li>
            <li> BUT I absolutely do not like the way it&#x27;s goes on</li>
            <li> The color is a lot darker than I expected.</li>
            <li> Darker than i expected</li>
            <li> application, you don&#x27;t even need to apply heavily, dries to a matte that actually makes your lips extremely soft!&lt;br</li>
            <li> the dark lip creams are not very pigmented</li>
            <li> Which is sad because I was really looking forward to this color!</li>
            <li> It does dry well though...very matte but put on a few coats.</li>
            <li> Dark just as expected, almost black.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dark plum, almost onyx blood color.</li>
            <li> I use a dark lip liner and use this to fill it in.</li>
            <li> too dark</li>
            <li> too dark wish i wld get the pne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to use it over quality lipstick to add a dark tone.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this lip cream&#x27;s a-ok!</li>
            <li> Had a slightly sticky consistency though upon arrival.</li>
            <li> It was half gone.</li>
            <li> It is a black purple.</li>
            <li> I have black hair, brown skin, and this color is a very dark purple that makes my features pop when my makeup is done</li>
            <li> Basically to get a streak less look you need to glob it on a few times.</li>
            <li> It always appears a little to shear in some places and to opaque in others.</li>
            <li> I hunted this down!</li>
            <li> This color is VERY, VERY, VERY dark.</li>
            <li> Had to apply a few coats.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone looking for a dark color for winter season (or all year round, dare to be daring!)</li>
            <li> The product seems dried out and all the way at the bottom.</li>
            <li> It is not easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and unlike other matte lip creams, it doesn&#x27;t have a weird dry sticky feeling!</li>
            <li> It is very dark, so beware!</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions for these as they don&#x27;t go on like ordinary lip gloss.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is the product or because of the heat while being shipped</li>
            <li> When spreading it, it bleeds very easily past your lip lines.</li>
            <li> I am not pleased with this product..</li>
            <li> Its usually sold out in stores.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money!</li>
            <li> The formula is so patchy and it&#x27;s not as longwearing as I thought it would be :/</li>
            <li> but the pricing is a little ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin</li>
            <li> I am slowly working my way into every shade in this collection of Matte Lip Creams.</li>
            <li> I myself didn&#x27;t have either at the time and carried it in my pocket- not a good idea.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these tubes are small so there isn&#x27;t a lot of product inside.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been addicted to throwing it on when I want to spice up a look.</li>
            <li> Applied very badly on my lips and did not last.</li>
            <li> It was sad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m applying it wrong idk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin and greasy.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed...</li>
            <li> I had to use another matte lipstick as a base just to make this one stay on...</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Horrible color.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am in love with Nyx Lip products! The feel is creamy and glides on effortlessly. It isn&#x27;t drying the way most matte lipsticks tend to be. The color is highly pigmented and pops on my lips. I am slowly working my way into every shade in this collection of Matte Lip Creams. You will definitely want to double the layer. Just remember to use a matching Nyx lip liner and let the first layer of lip cream dry in between applications. Don&#x27;t touch your lips together until you are finished and your results should be beautiful. So far, my absolute favorites in this Matte Lip Cream line are London and Copenhagen. These two mix well with a lip brush too, for a beautiful &amp;#34;bitten berry&amp;#34; type shade. I bought Transylvania for my daughter and she wears it beautifully. Her complexion is more caramel with dark hair and eyes. For reference, I have light hair, green eyes and fair skin. And have always worn nude type shades on my lips. I wanted to try something new and found Nyx Lip products to be very user friendly.  I never thought I could wear colors so bold before, but Nyx made me fall in love with color for my lips. Follow the instructions for these as they don&#x27;t go on like ordinary lip gloss. These are special and the color really lasts. I love them!</li>
            <li> way tooo dark for my skin, not the same color I saw online. It doesn&#x27;t even look red it looks black red.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous colour for black skin!</li>
            <li> wasnt worth it too expensive  would have been worth the price if it stayed on longer than ten minutes or till you eat something</li>
            <li> THE perfect vampy shade - this was recc&#x27;ed from a friend and so glad I took the recc. It was the precise colour I was looking for. Deep purple.</li>
            <li> Love it though its a bit drying</li>
            <li> Love these! Matte, strong color, it doesn&#x27;t bleed down my face</li>
            <li> Love this matte color...got a lot of  compliments</li>
            <li> Nice color love matte only problem hated the stickiness and would clump up</li>
            <li> I like this product quite a lot. It is a super dark purple-y red. The formula is creamy and it does set nicely, but once it does set you&#x27;ll be lucky to find a way to fix any mistakes you may have made without ruining the makeup around your mouth. Using a lip liner like MAC&#x27;s Nightmoth with it helps tremendously and because this can be a tiny bit patchy, you may want to fill your whole lip in with the liner. Stunning color and definitely worth the price though! After you use it a couple of times, it will be a breeze. Overall I&#x27;d definitely recommend this brand, product line and color!</li>
            <li> Love my new nyx matte lip! It&#x27;s a great color for cheap price</li>
            <li> Love it! Great lipstick</li>
            <li> Amazing colour and application. Unfortunately these tubes are small so there isn&#x27;t a lot of product inside.</li>
            <li> Worked better for me to use a single coat rubbed into lip balm to make a dark stain. When I tried to do multiple coats to make it look matte, it flaked off on the inside edge of my mouth. :/ Dries very dry.</li>
            <li> I received this product within 3-4 days which is absolutely amazing! The package was very secure and had the paper with my order on it inside. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> It is really difficult to get a full application on your lips. It always appears a little to shear in some places and to opaque in others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is the product or because of the heat while being shipped but it is a bit chunky when applied. After being smoothed out though, it looks great.</li>
            <li> I love the color , but it comes off very easily, fast shipping though!</li>
            <li> Had to apply a few coats. Tube seemed rather empty for $12....</li>
            <li> This is a dark purple, very punk rock-esc colour. I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore this while i ate and it wore off.  It was sad. Otherwise lovely lip product.</li>
            <li> Amazing color! love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright, it&#x27;s was see through when I used it by itself so I mix it with the nude color I have (both the same brand) to do like a ombre look. Also it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long there was alot of reapplying throughout the day, and that&#x27;s not really something I wanna do all day. Overall though, &amp;#34;Ehh,&amp;#34; I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Oh sweet jesus awsome lip color&lt;br /&gt;Every woman ask where from.this looks so good on me.i ordered several more.but not from here but only if i half to.i found ut cheaper on the site &amp;one shipping cost if i needed more.other than that ,great product awsome delivery,i also loved how the shipper wrote on my package,so it can be handled with care.i would definitely love to shop again.thanks abunch.</li>
            <li> LOVE! I get so many compliments on it!! I love how dark it is and the matte look is too cute!&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that it is a lil flaky after awhile and I have to reapply. Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li> Love the girl and arrived early</li>
            <li> I really love the color, but there are a few problems... You need more than one coat to achieve it. Honestly, I needed about three and it was still patchy in some parts. :( I do like the way it feels and it smells good too. It&#x27;s very light. Not sticky at all and dries fast. It stayed on for most of the day without reapplication. It shipped hella fast, too. I ordered it three days ago and just received it.</li>
            <li> Love the color, but has to be applied a lot, looks funny if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love the lipstick, it&#x27;s great. The only problems are; 1) It is lighter than expected. When i spread it on it turned out lighter than what it first looks like. I figured out that you have to dab it on to get the desired color. 2) It is not easy to apply. Like i said, I had to dab it on, but not only for the color. When spreading it, it bleeds very easily past your lip lines. Dabbing is the best way to apply. 3) The tube is very easily breakable. Make sure you keep it in a safe place where it on&#x27;t get broken. A purse/ makeup bag should be fine. I myself didn&#x27;t have either at the time and carried it in my pocket- not a good idea.</li>
            <li> Love this color. Had a slightly sticky consistency though upon arrival. Looks better after a few layers get out on though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same consistency as the soft matte cream I purchased at ulta. It&#x27;s very thin and greasy. Also the lip cream is very hard to get out of the tube, like it is only half full.  Will not purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> My new FAVORITE dark lip color. I have black hair, brown skin, and this color is a very dark purple that makes my features pop when my makeup is done and I love it! Will be stocking up on this matte lip color! Would recommend to anyone looking for a dark color for winter season (or all year round, dare to be daring!)</li>
            <li> I am not pleased with this product.. The shipping was great and the color is pretty! However, when I got it, it wasn&#x27;t much in it! It was half gone. I could only use it 4 days and that was it.</li>
            <li> Not same color I want</li>
            <li> This is a matte lip cream very dark almost like a black but with a clear lip gloss it look good.  I love my NYX cosmetics.</li>
            <li> i love the color but it doesn&#x27;t stay on for long every two hours i have to reapply.hope the company will do something about it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lipstick! It was shipped on time and its all i wanted, im very pleased and will buy other colors soon.</li>
            <li> Love it so much! It lasts all day and unlike other matte lip creams, it doesn&#x27;t have a weird dry sticky feeling!</li>
            <li> Very seperated &amp; water not much pigmentation</li>
            <li> I love this color so much, I always get a compliment whenever I wear it! Always make sure to wear lip liner when using this product to make it last a lot longer and so it won&#x27;t feather. Also remember to keep your lips moisturized because this emphasizes dry lips and definitely makes it even drier.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;You need to get some it&#x27;s feels Wonderful on your lips.&lt;br /&gt;Can feel the wonderfulness. I didn&#x27;t believe it till till I got some</li>
            <li> Love love love, this matte lip cream is better than macs lipstick... You won&#x27;t be disappointed... Can&#x27;t wait to try more colors ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> Love this color came in the mail so fast!</li>
            <li> very happy with my purchase ðŸ˜Š,  the color came out really nice. This product makes my lips feels so smooth!!! And it smells amazing</li>
            <li> I love this shade! So glad I found it. It&#x27;s a dark plum, almost onyx blood color. Beautiful on fair skin for those of us who want a dark vampy look!</li>
            <li> It is a great one i like it so much</li>
            <li> Looks great just put liquid foundation or the stick foundation on your lips underneath and it will go on very smooth while also giving you the perfect color</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this to me. She bought hers from sephora which was a little more. I love it! I use a dark lip liner and use this to fill it in. I would recommend NYX cosmetics to anyone who loves make-up</li>
            <li> Ok so I was debating on buying this for about two months...then I just gave in and brought it. It came a day before time which is good BUT I absolutely do not like the way it&#x27;s goes on I had to use another matte lipstick as a base just to make this one stay on...but I guess I can deal with it...ðŸ˜©</li>
            <li> the dark lip creams are not very pigmented</li>
            <li> So glad I got this before it became so popular, paying 8 USD compared to the crazy prices it going at now.. Will keep checking nyx website to see if its ever in stock, BTW I love this shade</li>
            <li> This is so creamy and easy to apply. I loooove the color. I have very pale skin and this looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Smooth and smells good. Lasts too.</li>
            <li> I like the product will buy more of them. Very nice color and for a good price.</li>
            <li> I love how deep in color this lip cream is. This is a nice lip cream that you don&#x27;t have to worry about smearing everywhere once it dries. Also I don&#x27;t know if this is my sense of smell or not, but once I opened it up I smelled birthday cake. So you get a beautiful color and you&#x27;ll love smelling it once you put it on!</li>
            <li> Love the color! I hunted this down! Its usually sold out in stores. It does need to be reapplied because it gets splotchy. It does dry well though...very matte but put on a few coats.</li>
            <li> too dark i think... thought it would b more red ...</li>
            <li> I thought i order cophegon n recived transalvania.. too dark wish i wld get the pne i wantd</li>
            <li> Love it, prefect for my full lips</li>
            <li> The color is a lot darker than I expected. It seems more appropriate for Halloween as costume make-up. Plus it dries my lips out. However, that is expected with most matte lipsticks. I would suggest looking at youtube videos or photo to get a good sense of the color on human skin before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I love it. I reccomend fast shipping !</li>
            <li> So many compliments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect color, even application and the matte dry is perfection!&lt;br /&gt;Most matte brands dry out your lips or start to crumble over time but not this.&lt;br /&gt;One application, you don&#x27;t even need to apply heavily, dries to a matte that actually makes your lips extremely soft!&lt;br /&gt;10/10 WILL purchase from again.</li>
            <li> Super dark violet color, smells lovely. Has decent coverage, needs to be layered on for the color to be even but a nice choice for people who desire a vampy colored lip.</li>
            <li> Would have maybe loved it. But It never was delivered. Which is sad because I was really looking forward to this color!</li>
            <li> This color is beautiful! It goes on smooth, it&#x27;s dark, it&#x27;s longn lasting, it&#x27;s not patchy at all. It&#x27;s $6.99 at nyx.com. Don&#x27;t order it on amazon if you want to save money.</li>
            <li> This flat out sucked. Waste of my money! Didn&#x27;t end up how I wanted, and came exploded in my bag.</li>
            <li> Love the color! Stays on for a long time and does not look glossy. Package arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely streaky and the color isn&#x27;t consistent. It sticks to certain parts of my lips oddly and creates the illusion of a different colored splotches. I was very disappointed with the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> just be sure to exfoliate and moisturizer your lips!</li>
            <li> This stuff won&#x27;t go on evenly and has NO red to it. NYX is much cheaper from its website.</li>
            <li> This color is not only flawless, but it makes your teeth look whiter. I have extremely fair and I&#x27;ve been told countless times this product makes me resemble Morticia Adams. Love it. Stays on all day, unless you eat something, which is common with many lip products.</li>
            <li> Hard to use at first, very creamy and pigmented. Worth the price, but take a minute to do it, or it&#x27;ll look like a hot mess for the average user. I also might get a lip pencil to line my lips before I use it to make the application easier.</li>
            <li> Great Dupe for Nars Train Bleu. Stays put!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color for fall season... It&#x27;s also great for a night out! It dries my lips out so I always use a lip balm before applying it on. Other than that, this lip cream&#x27;s a-ok!</li>
            <li> Darker than i expected</li>
            <li> Girlfriend LOVES this. says it is perfect! Smells like vanilla.</li>
            <li> Great products, beautiful color for fall/winter</li>
            <li> I expected I dark purple, but it came out looking more red on my deeper skin tone. I have medium brown skin, somewhere around Nia Long&#x27;s color. However it looks very beautiful and I&#x27;ve been addicted to throwing it on when I want to spice up a look. MAKE SURE YOU PUT ON CHAPSTICK BEFORE APPLYING ANY OF THE MATTE LIP CREMES OR IT WILL DRY YOUR LIPS OUT. I can&#x27;t stress that enough.</li>
            <li> love it. thats all and thank you</li>
            <li> I love this color, it&#x27;s very very dark but still remains purplish red.</li>
            <li> shipped fast. Love it. The color i have to get used to. Anyways, thanks again!</li>
            <li> Must hve!! all i can say</li>
            <li> WOW OH WOW OH WOW OH WOW OH WOW</li>
            <li> I stand by original review, but can anyone tell me why something i paid 6.94 (including tax) is now 42.00???? I came up here to order me some some more, but I am not going to pay 42.00 for something that was 7.00 in March. Is this even legal????????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually got my first tube in the color London from my local beauty supply store, after seeing the wonderful matte quality, I decided to come to Amazon and see what other colors were available.  I immediately fell in love with this color ( I love darker colors), and this did not disappoint! The color is highly pigmented and the matte is beautifully smooth and powdery. I loved this color so much, that I just ordered another tube because I do not want to run out.  NOTE:  This color is VERY, VERY, VERY dark. It&#x27;s a WONDERFUL DEEP DEEP DARK Burgundy.</li>
            <li> When I put it on it felt super cheap, maybe a fake nyx product!</li>
            <li> Horrible color. It is a black purple. Only used it once for Halloween. Applied very badly on my lips and did not last.</li>
            <li> Love it but ran out so quickly</li>
            <li> Glides on smoothly but kind of leaves bare spots on your lips.maybe I&#x27;m applying it wrong idk.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and vampy, just like i&#x27;ve always wanted. The lip cream color of my dreams, it&#x27;s dark and beautiful and the longevity is also amazing. I&#x27;d recommend this in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> Love this. Very pigmented. non drying long lasting</li>
            <li> Fast shipping love the color perfect !</li>
            <li> Great coverage and stayed on a while.</li>
            <li> Really love. I mix w a litte smash box gloss and looks really pretty. Was perfect with a great for night out.</li>
            <li> Love, love this lip color! It is very dark, so beware! If you are going for that deeper wine look, I would suggest going for the Copenhagen if you are unsure about this one! But I love it! Great color for the fall!</li>
            <li> The formula is so patchy and it&#x27;s not as longwearing as I thought it would be :/</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, product was all dried up when I recieved it... Dissapointed</li>
            <li> thanks so much ! Very good!</li>
            <li> I love this color. The other matte lip colors by NYX are excellent, however this particular shade is rare. It looks very pretty on, and delivers a bold and edgy look. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this product but i expected it to be darker, but overall this product is easy to apply and its amazing</li>
            <li> WIFE LOVES THIS BRANDS AND THIS COLOR. She has been searching for it for a long time and finally found it. Looks great on fair skinned people.</li>
            <li> Perfect matte, perfect purple blackish color.. Only thing is it don&#x27;t last very long and by the time of your 3rd or 4th use it seems empty.. But the color is BEAUTIFUL  and it don&#x27;t come off while eating or kissing my boyfriend LOVES the color, not enough lip cream but it is addictive, definitely will be buying 3 more of this color lol</li>
            <li> I had to say it twice.  Great scent.  Lasting color.  I applied 2 coatings (I let the first coat dry before I applied the second)with a little lipliner and it lasted ALL DAY even after eating and drinking.  I already have another tube in my wishlist for this Fall and Winter because this will be my go to color.  I think I&#x27;ll purchase Copenhagen as well.</li>
            <li> Very awsesome. Dark just as expected, almost black. Can be controlled better with another lipstick or gloss on top. If left alone, it tends to come off quick and dries a little fast.</li>
            <li> I Received Lip Gloss Opened! Not Sealed, Not Shrink Wrapped, Not Boxed.  It was opened. Because of this I threw it out.  Would have cost too much to return.  I will no longer order makeup from this Vendor!</li>
            <li> This matte long lasting and very light, you often forget you put anything on your lips. It acts as a stain and lasts all day long. If you have very dry lips I do suggest wearing Chapstick bef</li>
            <li> I would give this thing 5 â˜…s but the pricing is a little ridiculous. I bought this at Ulta for around maybe $7. I get thats its a good/popular product and all but $10 or even just $12 would be a bit more reasonable.</li>
            <li> The product seems dried out and all the way at the bottom. First application is a mixture of dark and light, very messy. Second a little better. Then you keep going. Basically to get a streak less look you need to glob it on a few times. I&#x27;m just going to use it over quality lipstick to add a dark tone. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly and is very purply</li>
            <li> Love this!! Thought I was ordering Copenhagen, but I accidentally ordered Transylvania. It was a great mix up!! Love the color!!</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations</li>
    </ol>
