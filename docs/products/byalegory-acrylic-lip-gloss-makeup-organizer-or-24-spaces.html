            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>This is one of those items that some companies are charging $60 or more for the quality of the acrylic, I love that this is affordable and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>This beauty is just fantastic and also at a great price.</li>
            <li>The acrylic is nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li>I own two now.</li>
            <li>This is very well made and looks great on the vanity!</li>
            <li>A nice way to organize lip glosses.  </li>
            <li>Looks nice and keeps my glosses organized.</li>
            <li>Love love love this!!  </li>
            <li>This organizer is a perfect size for lip glosses and normal sized lip sticks.</li>
            <li>great quality, it&#x27;s very strong and sturdy and doesn&#x27;t look cheaply made like most lip organizers.</li>
            <li>Very good quality, I was surprised how nice it was.</li>
            <li>Great investment and fast shipment!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I did NOT want my cats to be able to knock lip glosses into the litter</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely glad I got this.  </li>
            <li>I use it to hold makeup brushes :).</li>
            <li>Such great quality!</li>
            <li>If, you are a lip liner person, you will love this because you can put 2 to 3 or more lip liners in each section.  </li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re more than able to see the colors of your lip glosses through the sides.</li>
            <li>So, since most of us girls eventually end up getting Mac lipsticks anyway</li>
            <li>Love these organizers.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying the items sold by Byalegory.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this lip gloss holder.</li>

            <li>all except real techniques)&lt;br /&gt;I am ordering more!!</li>
            <li>Perfect for storing lipgloss and super classy too!</li>
            <li>It is the perfect depth for lipstick and lip gloss organizers like this, with the caveat that I keep a litter box for my cats between the vanity and the toilet.  </li>
            <li>Rich, sturdy construction!</li>
            <li>Super nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Sure, unless you are like me and enjoy staring at your organized makeup collection while mumbling to yourself how lovely your &amp;#34;pretties&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Colorful glosses look amazing displayed like this</li>
            <li>Keeps everything organized, easy to see, and easy to access.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to find things.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong and sturdy and I use it for my growing collection of lip glosses.</li>
            <li>Easy to fit the color</li>
            <li>The MAC lipsticks fit perfectly upside down so the name are expose.</li>
            <li>All of my mascaras fit just fine.</li>
            <li>A little pricy but great quality, perfect for tall and short glosses plus also works for lip/eye liners will definately order another one.</li>
            <li>While I did not attempt to store lip liner pencils in this, I think you could easily fit 2-3 of them in a slot.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic organizer.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this purchase and will absolutely purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li>heavy construction &amp; fits glosses perfect!</li>
            <li>I am pretty impressed since it arrived so quickly and is such high-quality.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I am also excited to see the upcoming eyeshadow, liner and paint pot organizers.</li>
            <li>I am also excited to see the upcoming eyeshadow, liner and paint pot organizers.</li>
            <li>Enter these handy new lip gloss holders.</li>
            <li>The lipstick holder version I saw at the container store was nice but the holders were too short for most of my products.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my dressing table looking much more organised than it really is.</li>
            <li>Love this product - it is well made, the slots are tall enough to securely hold my taller products including lip glosses, lip and eye crayons and liners, eye primer and even my lipsticks (although I will put an item on the bottom of the slot and then put my shorter lipsticks on top if that makes sense).  </li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>This is particularly true if you have shorter lip glosses like MAC Lipglass.</li>
            <li>Very strong and clear...</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pretty much every product I tried to put in here, fit easily, even glosses and stains in large, square-bottomed tubes.  </li>
            <li>They are such an amazing quality i am shocked!&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>I was able to fit 7 Mac lipsticks, 2 NYX lipsticks, 3 Urban Decay lipsticks, 4 Mac lipglosses, 3 NYX Butter glosses,</li>
            <li>This is totally worth the price because of the quality of the acrylic.</li>
            <li>This is just an acrylic holder, right?</li>
            <li>The colors are right there in front of me.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>and you can tell right away which color you&#x27;re grabbing.</li>
            <li>I contacted alegory and they refunded me the amount right away.</li>
            <li>It should fit into pretty much any decor scheme.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>So when I saw the &amp;#34;coming soon&amp;#34; announcement for this product I became far more excited than seems normal.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and makes all ur lipglosses look so pretty in your vanity, organized and easy to pick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I am really quite pleased with my purchase and am stoked to be able to fit so many glosses in an organizer that takes up the same amount of space as two of my old organizers, which combined only held fewer glosses.</li>

            <li>This is the only holder suitable for matte liquid lipsticks that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Great lipgloss container and can even be used to store regular lipsticks upside down for easy display of color names.</li>
            <li>After reading most of the reviews on this item before I purchased it, I knew I did not have to look any further.  </li>
            <li>*), I&#x27;m just here to say that I love this acrylic lip gloss holder because it not only serves one function, it also serves 2!</li>
            <li>I actually use this for my makeup brushes and I love it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely!</li>
            <li>Absolutely!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>is worth it if you are trying to get really organized as I am.</li>
            <li>~)&lt;br /&gt;Awesome Organizer I Highly Recommend !!</li>
            <li>so far I don&#x27;t have any lip gloss that won&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>If I need more acrylic storage this brand is definitely one that I will use again.</li>
            <li>I love this organizer so much that I just ordered my 2nd one..</li>
            <li>The acrylic is very classy and feels super sturdy.</li>
            <li>How cool is that to be able to see all of your eye make up brushes by style(type) or brand at a glance and not have them in a round container where you have to hunt and fish for the one you want to use.  </li>
            <li>My company is releasing 15 new shades of lipstick - I&#x27;m going to have to order another!!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s because while my home may be a mess, my makeup is always organized and treated with loving care.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s because while my home may be a mess, my makeup is always organized and treated with loving care.</li>
            <li>This one is fine for glosses, liners and tools, but certainly too tall for regular lipsticks.</li>
            <li>The slots are large enough to fit a variety of lip glosses, including Butter London.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>Very well made, sturdy.</li>
            <li>This is definitely made for glosses, lip liners and even the fat lip crayons fit in it with room to spare.  </li>
            <li>They not only fit my wand lipglosses</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and well made cases.</li>
            <li>This is a very sturdy, acrylic lipstick/gloss organizer.  </li>
            <li>itself is a very durable, thick-walled acrylic.</li>
            <li>This makes putting all my lip glosses so much easier</li>
            <li>It is taller than lipstick holders so lip glosses stand up straight in this organizer.</li>
            <li>Heavy, sturdy acrylic, not the cheapo kind.  </li>
            <li>The plastic is made of good thick quality.</li>
            <li>I was able to put 2 to 3 eyeliner brushes in each section and other types of eye</li>
            <li>So I wanted to make sure that whatever holder I put my lip gloss in was secure for longer, thinner tubes such as glosses typically are packaged in.  </li>
            <li>And last, but not least, all of the eye brushes you have will fit in this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a minor thing, but why ruin a lovely piece of clear acrylic with an overly adhesive sticker on the bottom?</li>
            <li>so you can tell what shade it is - its tall enough that they stick straight up - most lipstick organizers are too short and makes them tip sideways if you store them upsidedown.</li>
            <li>Nice thick plastic, very sturdy.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very sturdy and very clear.</li>
            <li>A single compartment can fit: four UD 24/7 eye pencils, or a MAC Shadestick and NYX Jumbo eye pencil, or a US 24/7 liquid liner and a MUFE Aqua Liner.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product without any hesitation.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>due to the fact that one reviewers mentioned how easy it was to see all of the colors you have stacked in this organizer instead of having to lift each one out to see what color it is.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I got the clear instead of the black</li>
            <li>I tested the holder with some other items to see how well they fit.</li>
            <li>so I can live with it.</li>
            <li>I hate those cheap organizers that everyone seems to be selling now and was so happy that this is not one of them.  </li>
            <li>but I do know that the plastic is very clear</li>
            <li>Some of them range from super skinny to a little bit on the wide side and they still fit.  </li>
            <li>My MAC 187 easily fit and multiple skinnier brushes can share a single compartment.</li>
            <li>Every single lipgloss i have fit including babylips, nix lipgloss, NYC big lipgloss and milani.</li>
            <li>2 Urban Decay High Gloss Lip pencils (in one slot), 2 travel sized Nars Velvet Matte Pencils (in one slot-they are the Sephora free birthday gift), 7 assorted lip liners (in two slots), and a lip brush in the final slot.&lt;br /&gt;The only tube that doesn&#x27;t fit is my Buxom lipstick, which is too tall for the regular lipstick holder but too wide for this lipgloss holder.</li>
            <li>do* end up needing a second one, I would certainly go for this product again.</li>
            <li>I asked for and received the clear 24-space lip gloss organizer as a holiday gift.  </li>
            <li>Because the organizer is clear acrylic, it&#x27;s easier to see what&#x27;s inside.  </li>
            <li>I got in in clear so as to show off the colors of my products.</li>
            <li>I order the clear one.</li>
            <li>each section has enough space to hold even very bulky lip products like abh liquid lipstick.</li>
            <li>The quality of the acrylic is phenomenal, its so thick and sturdy that i know that i will never damage it in any way even if it somehow fell from my vanity.</li>
            <li>I initially bought the lip gloss holder so that I could store my long lip glosses, however; I found a different use for them that makes these lip gloss holders and even greater purchase than I initially realized!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I was planning on placing it directly behind my lipstick holder on top of my new acrylic makeup organizer from D&#x27;eco thinking they would fit next to each other.  </li>
            <li>The depth of them will definitely hold your lip glosses up straight and its wide enough to hold most wand type lip glosses and even some wider ones as long as it&#x27;s not the ones that are relatively flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>worth spending a little extra!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I only ordered the clear ones</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are only two cons that I&#x27;ve seen thus far: 1)</li>
            <li>It is heavy and sturdy and definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Like so many other makeup addicts I have long found lipstick holders to be frustratingly inadequate for many of my lip glosses as well as some oddly shaped lipsticks.</li>
            <li>but they allow my Mac lipsticks to stand straight up and down</li>
            <li>It seems like a silly little thing, but it is a remarkable product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Previously I had been keeping my glosses in a particular type of acrylic cubes which had deeper than average compartments, but were taking up a lot of space since each only held 9 items.</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> This is one of those items that some companies are charging $60 or more for the quality of the acrylic, I love that this is affordable and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> This beauty is just fantastic and also at a great price.</li>
            <li> The acrylic is nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I own two now.</li>
            <li> This is very well made and looks great on the vanity!</li>
            <li> A nice way to organize lip glosses.  </li>
            <li> Looks nice and keeps my glosses organized.</li>
            <li> Love love love this!!  </li>
            <li> This organizer is a perfect size for lip glosses and normal sized lip sticks.</li>
            <li> great quality, it&#x27;s very strong and sturdy and doesn&#x27;t look cheaply made like most lip organizers.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, I was surprised how nice it was.</li>
            <li> Great investment and fast shipment!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I did NOT want my cats to be able to knock lip glosses into the litter</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely glad I got this.  </li>
            <li> I use it to hold makeup brushes :).</li>
            <li> Such great quality!</li>
            <li> If, you are a lip liner person, you will love this because you can put 2 to 3 or more lip liners in each section.  </li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re more than able to see the colors of your lip glosses through the sides.</li>
            <li> So, since most of us girls eventually end up getting Mac lipsticks anyway</li>
            <li> Love these organizers.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying the items sold by Byalegory.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lip gloss holder.</li>

            <li> all except real techniques)&lt;br /&gt;I am ordering more!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for storing lipgloss and super classy too!</li>
            <li> It is the perfect depth for lipstick and lip gloss organizers like this, with the caveat that I keep a litter box for my cats between the vanity and the toilet.  </li>
            <li> Rich, sturdy construction!</li>
            <li> Super nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Sure, unless you are like me and enjoy staring at your organized makeup collection while mumbling to yourself how lovely your &amp;#34;pretties&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Colorful glosses look amazing displayed like this</li>
            <li> Keeps everything organized, easy to see, and easy to access.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to find things.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong and sturdy and I use it for my growing collection of lip glosses.</li>
            <li> Easy to fit the color</li>
            <li> The MAC lipsticks fit perfectly upside down so the name are expose.</li>
            <li> All of my mascaras fit just fine.</li>
            <li> A little pricy but great quality, perfect for tall and short glosses plus also works for lip/eye liners will definately order another one.</li>
            <li> While I did not attempt to store lip liner pencils in this, I think you could easily fit 2-3 of them in a slot.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic organizer.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this purchase and will absolutely purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> heavy construction &amp; fits glosses perfect!</li>
            <li> I am pretty impressed since it arrived so quickly and is such high-quality.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I am also excited to see the upcoming eyeshadow, liner and paint pot organizers.</li>
            <li> I am also excited to see the upcoming eyeshadow, liner and paint pot organizers.</li>
            <li> Enter these handy new lip gloss holders.</li>
            <li> The lipstick holder version I saw at the container store was nice but the holders were too short for most of my products.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my dressing table looking much more organised than it really is.</li>
            <li> Love this product - it is well made, the slots are tall enough to securely hold my taller products including lip glosses, lip and eye crayons and liners, eye primer and even my lipsticks (although I will put an item on the bottom of the slot and then put my shorter lipsticks on top if that makes sense).  </li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> This is particularly true if you have shorter lip glosses like MAC Lipglass.</li>
            <li> Very strong and clear...</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pretty much every product I tried to put in here, fit easily, even glosses and stains in large, square-bottomed tubes.  </li>
            <li> They are such an amazing quality i am shocked!&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> I was able to fit 7 Mac lipsticks, 2 NYX lipsticks, 3 Urban Decay lipsticks, 4 Mac lipglosses, 3 NYX Butter glosses,</li>
            <li> This is totally worth the price because of the quality of the acrylic.</li>
            <li> This is just an acrylic holder, right?</li>
            <li> The colors are right there in front of me.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and you can tell right away which color you&#x27;re grabbing.</li>
            <li> I contacted alegory and they refunded me the amount right away.</li>
            <li> It should fit into pretty much any decor scheme.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> So when I saw the &amp;#34;coming soon&amp;#34; announcement for this product I became far more excited than seems normal.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and makes all ur lipglosses look so pretty in your vanity, organized and easy to pick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I am really quite pleased with my purchase and am stoked to be able to fit so many glosses in an organizer that takes up the same amount of space as two of my old organizers, which combined only held fewer glosses.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I am really quite pleased with my purchase and am stoked to be able to fit so many glosses in an organizer that takes up the same amount of space as two of my old organizers, which combined only held fewer glosses.</li>
            <li> This is the only holder suitable for matte liquid lipsticks that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Great lipgloss container and can even be used to store regular lipsticks upside down for easy display of color names.</li>
            <li> After reading most of the reviews on this item before I purchased it, I knew I did not have to look any further.  </li>
            <li> *), I&#x27;m just here to say that I love this acrylic lip gloss holder because it not only serves one function, it also serves 2!</li>
            <li> I actually use this for my makeup brushes and I love it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely!</li>
            <li> Absolutely!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> is worth it if you are trying to get really organized as I am.</li>
            <li> ~)&lt;br /&gt;Awesome Organizer I Highly Recommend !!</li>
            <li> so far I don&#x27;t have any lip gloss that won&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li> If I need more acrylic storage this brand is definitely one that I will use again.</li>
            <li> I love this organizer so much that I just ordered my 2nd one..</li>
            <li> The acrylic is very classy and feels super sturdy.</li>
            <li> How cool is that to be able to see all of your eye make up brushes by style(type) or brand at a glance and not have them in a round container where you have to hunt and fish for the one you want to use.  </li>
            <li> My company is releasing 15 new shades of lipstick - I&#x27;m going to have to order another!!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s because while my home may be a mess, my makeup is always organized and treated with loving care.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s because while my home may be a mess, my makeup is always organized and treated with loving care.</li>
            <li> This one is fine for glosses, liners and tools, but certainly too tall for regular lipsticks.</li>
            <li> The slots are large enough to fit a variety of lip glosses, including Butter London.</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> Very well made, sturdy.</li>
            <li> This is definitely made for glosses, lip liners and even the fat lip crayons fit in it with room to spare.  </li>
            <li> They not only fit my wand lipglosses</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and well made cases.</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy, acrylic lipstick/gloss organizer.  </li>
            <li> itself is a very durable, thick-walled acrylic.</li>
            <li> This makes putting all my lip glosses so much easier</li>
            <li> It is taller than lipstick holders so lip glosses stand up straight in this organizer.</li>
            <li> Heavy, sturdy acrylic, not the cheapo kind.  </li>
            <li> The plastic is made of good thick quality.</li>
            <li> I was able to put 2 to 3 eyeliner brushes in each section and other types of eye</li>
            <li> So I wanted to make sure that whatever holder I put my lip gloss in was secure for longer, thinner tubes such as glosses typically are packaged in.  </li>
            <li> And last, but not least, all of the eye brushes you have will fit in this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a minor thing, but why ruin a lovely piece of clear acrylic with an overly adhesive sticker on the bottom?</li>
            <li> so you can tell what shade it is - its tall enough that they stick straight up - most lipstick organizers are too short and makes them tip sideways if you store them upsidedown.</li>
            <li> Nice thick plastic, very sturdy.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very sturdy and very clear.</li>
            <li> A single compartment can fit: four UD 24/7 eye pencils, or a MAC Shadestick and NYX Jumbo eye pencil, or a US 24/7 liquid liner and a MUFE Aqua Liner.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product without any hesitation.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> due to the fact that one reviewers mentioned how easy it was to see all of the colors you have stacked in this organizer instead of having to lift each one out to see what color it is.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I got the clear instead of the black</li>
            <li> I tested the holder with some other items to see how well they fit.</li>
            <li> so I can live with it.</li>
            <li> I hate those cheap organizers that everyone seems to be selling now and was so happy that this is not one of them.  </li>
            <li> but I do know that the plastic is very clear</li>
            <li> Some of them range from super skinny to a little bit on the wide side and they still fit.  </li>
            <li> My MAC 187 easily fit and multiple skinnier brushes can share a single compartment.</li>
            <li> Every single lipgloss i have fit including babylips, nix lipgloss, NYC big lipgloss and milani.</li>
            <li> 2 Urban Decay High Gloss Lip pencils (in one slot), 2 travel sized Nars Velvet Matte Pencils (in one slot-they are the Sephora free birthday gift), 7 assorted lip liners (in two slots), and a lip brush in the final slot.&lt;br /&gt;The only tube that doesn&#x27;t fit is my Buxom lipstick, which is too tall for the regular lipstick holder but too wide for this lipgloss holder.</li>
            <li> do* end up needing a second one, I would certainly go for this product again.</li>
            <li> I asked for and received the clear 24-space lip gloss organizer as a holiday gift.  </li>
            <li> Because the organizer is clear acrylic, it&#x27;s easier to see what&#x27;s inside.  </li>
            <li> I got in in clear so as to show off the colors of my products.</li>
            <li> I order the clear one.</li>
            <li> each section has enough space to hold even very bulky lip products like abh liquid lipstick.</li>
            <li> The quality of the acrylic is phenomenal, its so thick and sturdy that i know that i will never damage it in any way even if it somehow fell from my vanity.</li>
            <li> I initially bought the lip gloss holder so that I could store my long lip glosses, however; I found a different use for them that makes these lip gloss holders and even greater purchase than I initially realized!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I was planning on placing it directly behind my lipstick holder on top of my new acrylic makeup organizer from D&#x27;eco thinking they would fit next to each other.  </li>
            <li> The depth of them will definitely hold your lip glosses up straight and its wide enough to hold most wand type lip glosses and even some wider ones as long as it&#x27;s not the ones that are relatively flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> worth spending a little extra!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I only ordered the clear ones</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are only two cons that I&#x27;ve seen thus far: 1)</li>
            <li> It is heavy and sturdy and definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Like so many other makeup addicts I have long found lipstick holders to be frustratingly inadequate for many of my lip glosses as well as some oddly shaped lipsticks.</li>
            <li> but they allow my Mac lipsticks to stand straight up and down</li>
            <li> It seems like a silly little thing, but it is a remarkable product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Previously I had been keeping my glosses in a particular type of acrylic cubes which had deeper than average compartments, but were taking up a lot of space since each only held 9 items.</li>
            <li> (Also, being clear acrylic, it matches my other cosmetic organizers.  </li>
            <li> (Very thin items such as Stila lip glazes also felt secure.  </li>
            <li> They are slightly too big to fit on top together because the bottom has a bit extra off the edges (excuse my terrible description</li>
            <li> exellent for lip stick and mascaras, have enought spaces and is wide is not simple</li>
            <li> Very heavy duty and high quality acrylic.  </li>
            <li> The reason why is because the Mac lipsticks are shaped like bullets so so you can&#x27;t turn them upside down and put them in a regular lipstick holder without them they wobbling back and forth on their bullet shaped tops.</li>
            <li> I was iffy due to the price, but I definitely do not regret the splurge!</li>
            <li> Can be used for various things other than l gloss as well!</li>
            <li> This organizer maybe is a little larger than I would like</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I think it should be priced a little lower, like at $15.</li>
            <li> Even a few weirdly shaped lip glosses (Butter London) fit in the compartments as well.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> so you may have some trouble seeing the colors of the items in the middle row.</li>
            <li> The way my bathroom is laid out, there is a narrow strip of counter between the sink, running across and over the toilet tank.  </li>
            <li> I use it for mascaras, concealer and other wand type cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> Fits smaller brushes, concealers, lip glosses, small eye cream tubes.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know the proper word to describe the small but around the edges of the bottom of the holder).</li>
            <li> my  lip gloss  collection , but I  find  it  pretty  expensive .</li>
            <li> I use my holder for not only my lipgloss but also my perfume rollerballs and a few small makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> The openings are also a little less wide than the typical lipstick holder ones</li>
            <li> I do not recommend storing glosses upside down as a solution because eventually the gloss will make its way through the cap threads and leak out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know there others out there who understand.not recommend storing glosses upside down as a solution because eventually the gloss will make its way through the cap threads and leak out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered lipstick holders before, but they&#x27;re too shallow, and this one is too deep (need one in between).  </li>
            <li> It is heavy and made quite well.  </li>
            <li> but then I noticed that I had these MAC lipsticks that never fit into any of my lipstick holders.</li>
            <li> Not cheap at all.</li>
            <li> so square lipsticks like Maybelline and others will not fit.</li>
            <li> that  are round topped.  </li>
            <li> This is sorta heavy</li>
            <li> Thick and heavy plastic.</li>
            <li> The compartments are quite deep so even your tallest glosses are unlikely to fall over.</li>
            <li> It arrived scratch-free, though I could have done without the insanely hard to remove barcode sticker on the bottom.</li>
            <li> It is heavier acrylic than I expected and it fits everything from my tubes of lip gloss from Victoria&#x27;s Secret to my thick square Lorac glosses!</li>
            <li> The acrylic is thick and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Thick plastic.</li>
            <li> The acrylic is satisfyingly thick and heavy which makes them feel expensive and well made.</li>
            <li> I definitely think that if you have a crazy amount of glosses, chubby sticks, mascara, or liners this will be an asset not to mention it got here in two days with prime!</li>
            <li> almost feel like glass (they are a very thick acrylic) without being too heavy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taller than any of my lipstick organizers, so tall items, even when they are thin, can&#x27;t get knocked out.  </li>

            <li> Love this product!  Heavy, sturdy acrylic, not the cheapo kind.  I use it for mascaras, concealer and other wand type cosmetics.  Keeps everything organized, easy to see, and easy to access.</li>
            <li> Fits smaller brushes, concealers, lip glosses, small eye cream tubes.  Sturdy acrylic. Makes it easy to find things.</li>
            <li> Great organizer. Very well made. Thick and heavy plastic. Everything I expected. Love it.</li>
            <li> Solved my lipstick organizational problems.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this for my lip gloss organizer.  Just wish it held more!</li>
            <li> I asked for and received the clear 24-space lip gloss organizer as a holiday gift.  It definitely fulfills a need I had.  The way my bathroom is laid out, there is a narrow strip of counter between the sink, running across and over the toilet tank.  It is the perfect depth for lipstick and lip gloss organizers like this, with the caveat that I keep a litter box for my cats between the vanity and the toilet.  So I wanted to make sure that whatever holder I put my lip gloss in was secure for longer, thinner tubes such as glosses typically are packaged in.  I did NOT want my cats to be able to knock lip glosses into the litter box!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This organizer was perfect for my purposes.  It&#x27;s taller than any of my lipstick organizers, so tall items, even when they are thin, can&#x27;t get knocked out.  Because the organizer is clear acrylic, it&#x27;s easier to see what&#x27;s inside.  (Also, being clear acrylic, it matches my other cosmetic organizers.  It should fit into pretty much any decor scheme.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty much every product I tried to put in here, fit easily, even glosses and stains in large, square-bottomed tubes.  (Very thin items such as Stila lip glazes also felt secure.  While I did not attempt to store lip liner pencils in this, I think you could easily fit 2-3 of them in a slot.  This would also work for brushes with narrow-to-medium width handles.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely glad I got this.  Am trying to cut back on cosmetic purchases so I hope I don&#x27;t need another one, but if I *do* end up needing a second one, I would certainly go for this product again.</li>
            <li> The acrylic is nice and sturdy. I will definitely be ordering another one as my makeup collection expands.</li>
            <li> I love it! Great for organizing my lip glosses and liquid lipsticks. Would definetly recommend this to a girl who is just as obsessed with make up as I am!</li>
            <li> Perfect! Worth every penny! I&#x27;m ordering another &amp; using it as a brush holder.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic organizer. It seems like a silly little thing, but it is a remarkable product. The tubes do not knock around like they do in regular organizers. I was able to fit 7 Mac lipsticks, 2 NYX lipsticks, 3 Urban Decay lipsticks, 4 Mac lipglosses, 3 NYX Butter glosses, 2 Urban Decay High Gloss Lip pencils (in one slot), 2 travel sized Nars Velvet Matte Pencils (in one slot-they are the Sephora free birthday gift), 7 assorted lip liners (in two slots), and a lip brush in the final slot.&lt;br /&gt;The only tube that doesn&#x27;t fit is my Buxom lipstick, which is too tall for the regular lipstick holder but too wide for this lipgloss holder.</li>
            <li> A little pricy but great quality, perfect for tall and short glosses plus also works for lip/eye liners will definately order another one. Shipping arrive on time and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Nice thick plastic, very sturdy. I use it to hold makeup brushes :). Works a treat.</li>
            <li> So handy! I use it to store lip crayons, brushes, eyeliners, etc. Keeps my dressing table looking much more organised than it really is.</li>
            <li> Best lipstick organizer ever!!!!!  The MAC lipsticks fit perfectly upside down so the name are expose. Easy to fit the color your looking for.</li>
            <li> Such great quality! It is heavy and sturdy and definitely worth the price. I was planning on placing it directly behind my lipstick holder on top of my new acrylic makeup organizer from D&#x27;eco thinking they would fit next to each other.  They are slightly too big to fit on top together because the bottom has a bit extra off the edges (excuse my terrible description but I don&#x27;t know the proper word to describe the small but around the edges of the bottom of the holder). Anyway, if you are looking for a lipgloss organizer, but not sure of the splurge on price of this one, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I was iffy due to the price, but I definitely do not regret the splurge!</li>
            <li> great quality, it&#x27;s very strong and sturdy and doesn&#x27;t look cheaply made like most lip organizers. each section has enough space to hold even very bulky lip products like abh liquid lipstick. This is also great for storing lipsticks like MAC upsidedown so you can tell what shade it is - its tall enough that they stick straight up - most lipstick organizers are too short and makes them tip sideways if you store them upsidedown. Only con is that it&#x27;s a bit overpriced.</li>
            <li> my second time buying...love it</li>
            <li> This organizer is a perfect size for lip glosses and normal sized lip sticks. I actually prefer it to the byAlegory lip stick holder. I own two now. It&#x27;s very nice quality as well.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. Very well made, sturdy. The slots are large enough to fit a variety of lip glosses, including Butter London.</li>
            <li> OMG this Lip Gloss Organizer is beautiful!!!  It looks like glass instead of plastic.  You will want to have this displayed out and not in your make-up drawers.  It is heavy and made quite well.  After reading most of the reviews on this item before I purchased it, I knew I did not have to look any further.  I am so glad I got the clear instead of the black due to the fact that one reviewers mentioned how easy it was to see all of the colors you have stacked in this organizer instead of having to lift each one out to see what color it is.  This is definitely made for glosses, lip liners and even the fat lip crayons fit in it with room to spare.  I tried a tube of lipstick and almost could not get it out.  I would look for an organizer that is made just for tube lipsticks.  If, you are a lip liner person, you will love this because you can put 2 to 3 or more lip liners in each section.  Also, talk about putting eyeliner pencils in this OMG what a space saver this organizer is.  And last, but not least, all of the eye brushes you have will fit in this.  I was able to put 2 to 3 eyeliner brushes in each section and other types of eye make up brushes as well. Some of them range from super skinny to a little bit on the wide side and they still fit.  How cool is that to be able to see all of your eye make up brushes by style(type) or brand at a glance and not have them in a round container where you have to hunt and fish for the one you want to use.  I have to quit with this review so I can go and order some more of these!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I initially bought the lip gloss holder so that I could store my long lip glosses, however; I found a different use for them that makes these lip gloss holders and even greater purchase than I initially realized!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But 1st - the lip gloss holders. They&#x27;re very sturdy and very clear. I only ordered the clear ones so I don&#x27;t know what the colored ones look like but I do know that the plastic is very clear so you&#x27;re more than able to see the colors of your lip glosses through the sides. The depth of them will definitely hold your lip glosses up straight and its wide enough to hold most wand type lip glosses and even some wider ones as long as it&#x27;s not the ones that are relatively flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay so I bought the 1st acrylic holder because I needed them for my lip glosses but then I noticed that I had these MAC lipsticks that never fit into any of my lipstick holders. The reason why is because the Mac lipsticks are shaped like bullets so so you can&#x27;t turn them upside down and put them in a regular lipstick holder without them they wobbling back and forth on their bullet shaped tops. So instead I dropped one of my Mac lipsticks headfirst into the lip gloss holder and VOILA! They not only fit my wand lipglosses but they allow my Mac lipsticks to stand straight up and down and I can see the names of each one of them without them wobbling back and fort!! So, since most of us girls eventually end up getting Mac lipsticks anyway (*LOL!!!*), I&#x27;m just here to say that I love this acrylic lip gloss holder because it not only serves one function, it also serves 2! Hope this was helpful! Take care!</li>
            <li> Love these organizers. Really brilliant!</li>
            <li> This is very well made and looks great on the vanity! I just love it!</li>
            <li> I actually use this for my makeup brushes and I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect solution to neatly storing lipgloss AND being able to find the one you want easily. The acrylic is thick and sturdy. I am really enjoying the items sold by Byalegory. I&#x27;m looking forward to the next one!</li>
            <li> I love this organizer so much that I just ordered my 2nd one.. the height is perfect for tall glosses &amp; the width can fit most any size!! If you&#x27;re hesitant, don&#x27;t be.. it&#x27;s awesome!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lip gloss holder. It looks so sleek on my vanity. It&#x27;s tall and deep enough so my glosses and liquid lipsticks don&#x27;t move at all!</li>
            <li> Good quality acrylic, it was not flimsy. I use my holder for not only my lipgloss but also my perfume rollerballs and a few small makeup brushes. I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Love this product - it is well made, the slots are tall enough to securely hold my taller products including lip glosses, lip and eye crayons and liners, eye primer and even my lipsticks (although I will put an item on the bottom of the slot and then put my shorter lipsticks on top if that makes sense).  The lipstick holder version I saw at the container store was nice but the holders were too short for most of my products.  This is wonderful because it works for my taller products and can jury rig for my shorter products.  I got in in clear so as to show off the colors of my products.</li>
            <li> This beauty is just fantastic and also at a great price. This organizer maybe is a little larger than I would like but it also hold a lot of products so I can live with it. It is currently sitting on my vanity holding all my chubby sticks and some lip glosses. I also have the lipstick holder by Alegoy and they look just lovely together. I definitely think that if you have a crazy amount of glosses, chubby sticks, mascara, or liners this will be an asset not to mention it got here in two days with prime!</li>
            <li> THIS THING IS FREAKING AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love it so much, i have a lot of lip glosses and i don&#x27;t know why no one has ever thought of this before. The quality of the acrylic is phenomenal, its so thick and sturdy that i know that i will never damage it in any way even if it somehow fell from my vanity. I cant wait to get their Compact Organizer.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these organizers!!! They are such an amazing quality i am shocked!&lt;br /&gt;They almost feel like glass (they are a very thick acrylic) without being too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;They are perfect for glosses, but also for mascaras, and i found that i can even fit most makeup brushes in here (all except real techniques)&lt;br /&gt;I am ordering more!!</li>
            <li> This item was perfect for all my lipstays and lip glosses.  I wish they&#x27;d come out with one for tubes of lipstick.  I&#x27;m using this one for tubes of lipstick as well, but have to build up the slot with cotton so I can remove the tube of lipstick.  I&#x27;ve ordered lipstick holders before, but they&#x27;re too shallow, and this one is too deep (need one in between).  For now, I can make it work for tubes of lipstick as well by stuffing the bottom with cotton.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and well made cases. Not cheap at all. Will buy more!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong and sturdy and I use it for my growing collection of lip glosses. I&#x27;ll have to buy another one. Recommend to buy</li>
            <li> Like so many other makeup addicts I have long found lipstick holders to be frustratingly inadequate for many of my lip glosses as well as some oddly shaped lipsticks. So when I saw the &amp;#34;coming soon&amp;#34; announcement for this product I became far more excited than seems normal. This is just an acrylic holder, right? Sure, unless you are like me and enjoy staring at your organized makeup collection while mumbling to yourself how lovely your &amp;#34;pretties&amp;#34; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously I had been keeping my glosses in a particular type of acrylic cubes which had deeper than average compartments, but were taking up a lot of space since each only held 9 items. They worked well for some shorter glosses but the taller ones were always falling to the side if I bumped into the table. Enter these handy new lip gloss holders. The acrylic is satisfyingly thick and heavy which makes them feel expensive and well made. It arrived scratch-free, though I could have done without the insanely hard to remove barcode sticker on the bottom. The compartments are quite deep so even your tallest glosses are unlikely to fall over. I tested the holder with some other items to see how well they fit. A single compartment can fit: four UD 24/7 eye pencils, or a MAC Shadestick and NYX Jumbo eye pencil, or a US 24/7 liquid liner and a MUFE Aqua Liner. All of my mascaras fit just fine. This also makes a great makeup brush holder. My MAC 187 easily fit and multiple skinnier brushes can share a single compartment. Unfortunately there&#x27;s no link to upload a photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only two cons that I&#x27;ve seen thus far: 1) It&#x27;s a minor thing, but why ruin a lovely piece of clear acrylic with an overly adhesive sticker on the bottom? I&#x27;ve had acrylic nails that were easier to remove than that sticker. 2) Everything is on the same level so you may have some trouble seeing the colors of the items in the middle row. This is particularly true if you have shorter lip glosses like MAC Lipglass. I do not recommend storing glosses upside down as a solution because eventually the gloss will make its way through the cap threads and leak out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I am really quite pleased with my purchase and am stoked to be able to fit so many glosses in an organizer that takes up the same amount of space as two of my old organizers, which combined only held fewer glosses. Would I buy this again? Absolutely! I am also excited to see the upcoming eyeshadow, liner and paint pot organizers. If I sound like an overly enthusiastic makeup-loving Billy Mays it&#x27;s because while my home may be a mess, my makeup is always organized and treated with loving care. I know there others out there who understand.not recommend storing glosses upside down as a solution because eventually the gloss will make its way through the cap threads and leak out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I am really quite pleased with my purchase and am stoked to be able to fit so many glosses in an organizer that takes up the same amount of space as two of my old organizers, which combined only held fewer glosses.

            <li> This are the best acrylic organizer I ever bought!! Excellent quality and price of course I will buy again from byalegory!!</li>
            <li> I love this lip gloss organizer/holder; it fits my glosses perfectly. I would not use this for regular lipsticks though because the slots are too tall and the lipsticks get lost in them. The openings are also a little less wide than the typical lipstick holder ones so square lipsticks like Maybelline and others will not fit. Instead, use this one for your glosses and purchase a regular lipstick holder for your lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Love it! I order the clear one. Every single lipgloss i have fit including babylips, nix lipgloss, NYC big lipgloss and milani. Highly recommended and makes all ur lipglosses look so pretty in your vanity, organized and easy to pick.</li>
            <li> I have bought two of these and absolutely love them. They are excellent quality.</li>
            <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li> Love love love this!!  My company is releasing 15 new shades of lipstick - I&#x27;m going to have to order another!!  This is no lightweight piece of plastic. This is a very sturdy, acrylic lipstick/gloss organizer.  I am thrilled with this purchase and will absolutely purchase from this seller again. It arrived on time and in good order.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would hold my ABH liquid lipsticks as well as chubby lip pencils. This is perfect for both of those things! Even a few weirdly shaped lip glosses (Butter London) fit in the compartments as well. 10/10 would recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this. Great or lip glosses and lipsticks and liners. Want another one! Great quality. Thick plastic.</li>
            <li> Love it And I will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my growing liquid lipstick collection...may need another. Rich, sturdy construction!</li>
            <li> Great lipgloss container and can even be used to store regular lipsticks upside down for easy display of color names. The plastic is made of good thick quality. Great investment all around!</li>
            <li> Favorite acrylic organized by ByAlegory. Super nice and sturdy. Nothing like the flimsy ones you find at your local Ross or Marshalls.</li>
            <li> Great product! Very strong and clear...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth spending a little extra!&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for!!!</li>
            <li> I bought the lip gloss organizer as opposed to the lipstick one because I wanted to store both types in one and was concerned about the height of the lipstick organizer. Turns out the ideal option is somewhere in between. This one is fine for glosses, liners and tools, but certainly too tall for regular lipsticks. I got around it by dropping a cotton ball in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Material itself is a very durable, thick-walled acrylic. I never realized I had so many lip things before!</li>
            <li> exellent for lip stick and mascaras, have enought spaces and is wide is not simple i love it</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. Very nice looking...no scratches.</li>
            <li> Love it! Holds all my lipglosses. Definitely recommend it to everyone that is a makeup lover!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!  Arrived on time!  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Great storage and organization look. Can be used for various things other than l gloss as well!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and attractive....exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> heavy construction &amp; fits glosses perfect!</li>
            <li> Great and well made.  I would order this again.</li>
            <li> Great for battle liquid lipstick addicts like me. This is the only holder suitable for matte liquid lipsticks that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> This makes putting all my lip glosses so much easier and I don&#x27;t have to go searching for any of them. The colors are right there in front of me.&lt;br /&gt;This is worth it if you are trying to get really organized as I am. I loved this product.&lt;br /&gt;The product came on time and had no problems with this seller.</li>
            <li> 5 Star Organizer !!&lt;br /&gt;Not only did I Buy 1 for Myself I bought 1 for my Daughter  :~)&lt;br /&gt;Awesome Organizer I Highly Recommend !!</li>
            <li> Perfect for storing lipgloss and super classy too!</li>
            <li> Really great product for the price. The acrylic is very classy and feels super sturdy. Colorful glosses look amazing displayed like this and you can tell right away which color you&#x27;re grabbing. I am pretty impressed since it arrived so quickly and is such high-quality.</li>
            <li> Finally a container for my lip glosses. The container is sturdy, compact, and functional. It is taller than lipstick holders so lip glosses stand up straight in this organizer. This is totally worth the price because of the quality of the acrylic. I purchased 4 of them. This will make a great gift for a lippy addict, a teenager, make-up blogger, make-up artist, an organization nut (me), anyone with a lot of lip glosses. I highly recommend this product without any hesitation. Your satisfaction is a guarantee.</li>
            <li> Very  good  quality , I  would need  3 more  for  my  lip gloss  collection , but I  find  it  pretty  expensive .</li>
            <li> High quality. Perfect for talk glosses or even make up brushes</li>
            <li> This is my third time ordering from Alegory. There products are amazing and great quality. But when I ordered the gloss i received it with a crack in the corner. I contacted alegory and they refunded me the amount right away. Great customer service and will definitely be purchasing again</li>
            <li> Very heavy duty and high quality acrylic.  I hate those cheap organizers that everyone seems to be selling now and was so happy that this is not one of them.  I purchased the oversized lipstick holder and regular lipstick holder as well.  I have the alex series in my makeup room and this looks so beautiful on my desk.  This is tall enough to even hold eyeliners and so far I don&#x27;t have any lip gloss that won&#x27;t fit.  The price is great as well.  This is one of those items that some companies are charging $60 or more for the quality of the acrylic, I love that this is affordable and beautiful.  If I need more acrylic storage this brand is definitely one that I will use again.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! It is heavier acrylic than I expected and it fits everything from my tubes of lip gloss from Victoria&#x27;s Secret to my thick square Lorac glosses! After this one arrived, I immediately ordered another. Very impressed!</li>
            <li> Very good quality, I was surprised how nice it was.</li>
            <li> Does the job as advertised.  A nice way to organize lip glosses.  i also use it for lipsticks like gerard cosmetics and mac that  are round topped.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I think it should be priced a little lower, like at $15.</li>
            <li> Looks nice and keeps my glosses organized.</li>
            <li> Happy with this product definitely what i needed to store my lipgloss collection</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! Great investment and fast shipment!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Perfect and organized, this isn&#x27;t Cheap quality! You will love it</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for your lip glosses. Very good quality</li>
            <li> This is sorta heavy but I love it!!</li>
            <li> Great quality, perfect fit!</li>
