            <li>Your house will have a lovely aroma.</li>
            <li>Much better than the stuff I bought in the stores around town.</li>
            <li>some smells are too overwhelming but not this one.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>it better buy some odor absorber at Walmart.</li>
            <li>could be better.</li>
            <li>Made the basement smell better as well.</li>
            <li>Really love this product.</li>
            <li>Better than candles.</li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;ve ordered 2 more</li>
            <li>The scent is very rich.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a more strong lavender scent.  </li>
            <li>I was worried about purchasing them without smelling them first but was very pleased with the scent.</li>
            <li>The scent is very mild.  </li>
            <li>just wasn&#x27;t as strong a smell as some others</li>
            <li>and it is nice pure lavender.</li>
            <li>Otherwise these do make our bedroom smell fantastic when it&#x27;s time to relax.</li>
            <li>lovely lavender fragrance, one of my absolute favs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been burning the same square for about 2 weeks and it still smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Scent burned off very quickly, and some didn&#x27;t even have a strong enough scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very relaxing scent and helps calm you after a hectic day!</li>
            <li>I would buy again only if the scent lasted more than an hour or so per block.</li>
            <li>Smells great and is way easier to get out of the container than the other major brand.</li>
            <li>Once again, this brand is true and natural smelling.</li>
            <li>Of the changes made, removing harmful chemicals and scents that are not from a natural source has been one of the most beneficial and most difficult as I LOVE candles and air fresheners.  </li>
            <li>I would rate this higher since the smell is wonderful but it does not last long enough - a few hours at most.</li>
            <li>it is a very calming scent.</li>
            <li>Unless it was much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I saw some cheap ones at Wal-Mart for about $1-2, I will pick some up next time and compare.</li>
            <li>These are very nice burning tarts the first use, but I have found that there is very little aroma if you melt them a second time.  </li>
            <li>The lavender scent is true (not perfumey), but it is short lived.</li>
            <li>The blocks run out of scent pretty easily since I have no prior experience with different kinds of scents, it is all a speculation.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the soy lavender but the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as the wax/soy in the warmer does.  </li>
            <li>As for the reviews that say the smell doesn&#x27;t last, I can only assume they are used to the unnaturally strong scents created with chemicals.</li>
            <li>Hardly lasts the duration of a tea light.</li>

            <li> The scent does not last very long and is not strong.</li>
            <li> I just drop in a few drops of essential oils into the wax whenever I want to use it.</li>
            <li> Not much of a problem for me as I simply add a few drops of lavender oil.</li>
            <li> I agree with other buyers.</li>

            <li> All of these products are excellent !</li>
            <li> Your house will have a lovely aroma. Plus, the soy candle does not pollute the air in your house.</li>
            <li> These smell great!  Much better than the stuff I bought in the stores around town.</li>
            <li> very pleased with this product. some smells are too overwhelming but not this one. it is a very calming scent. great to use after a stress filled day.</li>
            <li> These are very nice burning tarts the first use, but I have found that there is very little aroma if you melt them a second time.  Not much of a problem for me as I simply add a few drops of lavender oil.</li>
            <li> it smelled good when I took it out of the package, heated once and now it just smells like wax</li>
            <li> Very disappointing. The cubes smell good, yes and it is nice pure lavender. But when used as intended, doesn&#x27;t emit aroma except for the immediate area around the burner.</li>
            <li> Scent burned off very quickly, and some didn&#x27;t even have a strong enough scent. Won&#x27;t be buying then again :/</li>
            <li> I love it&#x27;s lavender scent but it doesn&#x27;t last longer. It&#x27;s not worth it better buy some odor absorber at Walmart.</li>
            <li> The lavender scent is true (not perfumey), but it is short lived. I would buy again only if the scent lasted more than an hour or so per block.</li>
            <li> wish the fragrance lasted longer</li>
            <li> The scent does not last very long and is not strong. Hardly lasts the duration of a tea light. could be better. weak scent</li>
            <li> Smells great and is way easier to get out of the container than the other major brand. Doesnt seem to last long though. I put it in a nightlight wax warmer and it helped me fall asleep and I like to think it calmed the cats down. Made the basement smell better as well.</li>
            <li> The fragrance on this was really nice but it doesn&#x27;t last very long. So I doubt if I purchase it again. Unless it was much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the soy lavender but the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as the wax/soy in the warmer does.  I have added lavender oil to the left over but it too doesn&#x27;t last long with the soy.  Otherwise these do make our bedroom smell fantastic when it&#x27;s time to relax.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a more strong lavender scent.  The scent is very mild.  Don&#x27;t think they will last very long.</li>
            <li> The scent is fairly weak. I can only smell it for about a five foot radius. Not worth getting again.</li>
            <li> The blocks run out of scent pretty easily since I have no prior experience with different kinds of scents, it is all a speculation. I saw some cheap ones at Wal-Mart for about $1-2, I will pick some up next time and compare.</li>
            <li> I bought this because we adopted two cats.  I heard that using lavender scents can aid in calming them.  Rather than pay an insane amount for the sprays, I tried this.  Seemed to work.</li>
            <li> These smell really nice. I was worried about purchasing them without smelling them first but was very pleased with the scent.</li>
            <li> i liked it. just wasn&#x27;t as strong a smell as some others but it was not too bad. buy it</li>
            <li> The scent is very rich. Really love this product. Better than candles.I recommend this item. The product which I purchased is great.</li>
            <li> I agree with other buyers. The scent doesn&#x27;t last very long. But this is the only version that I can find anywhere that smells like essential oils. Other lavender melts that I&#x27;ve purchased smell like some perfumy-artificial scent. I just drop in a few drops of essential oils into the wax whenever I want to use it.</li>
            <li> Aroma is nice, after a day, I can no longer smell it. Was hoping it would last longer.</li>
            <li> lovely lavender fragrance, one of my absolute favs.</li>
            <li> added some Lavender essential oil too!</li>
            <li> I burn this in my wax warmer for about an hour before I go to bed then turn it off.  It&#x27;s a very relaxing scent and helps calm you after a hectic day!</li>
            <li> Once again, this brand is true and natural smelling. The lavender is from essential oil not a synthetic fragrance. I have switched to these from candles because of my concern with chemicals in my home. They last longer than candles too!</li>
            <li> A couple years ago I started taking steps to make our home a healthier one.  Of the changes made, removing harmful chemicals and scents that are not from a natural source has been one of the most beneficial and most difficult as I LOVE candles and air fresheners.  Within a couple months I noticed that colognes and perfumes (on other people) smelled terrible and just walking down the laundry and cleaner aisles gave me headaches.  To make my house smell nice I started simmering cinnamon and apples in a small saucepan but it is messy and you have to keep a close eye on the water level.&lt;br /&gt;Then a friend posted about these on facebook and I immediately ordered a couple different scents.  I love them both, great smells in the convenience of melties!  Since then I&#x27;ve ordered 2 more and I anxiously await their arrival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been burning the same square for about 2 weeks and it still smells nice.  As for the reviews that say the smell doesn&#x27;t last, I can only assume they are used to the unnaturally strong scents created with chemicals.</li>
