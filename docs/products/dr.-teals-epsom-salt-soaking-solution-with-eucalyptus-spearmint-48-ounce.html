            <li>MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM this smells SOOOOO good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s another good after gym or post-work soak.</li>
            <li>Good value for the money, too.  </li>
            <li>It smells so good</li>
            <li>The aroma fills the room, and imbues good feeling all around.</li>
            <li>This soaking solution was pretty good, but not the best.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice for when your muscles are sore and smells good to inhale too.  </li>
            <li>I love how my body responds to this salt - my muscles relax very nicely in matter of minutes and my skin is glowing afterwards.</li>

            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this bath salt!</li>
            <li>Refreshing yet relaxing!</li>
            <li>Wonderful to just take a little time for myself with this wonderful bath product.  </li>
            <li>The soaps and pillow sprays are amazing</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing</li>
            <li>The scent is so relaxing and soothing and after shoveling snow all day the benefits of soaking in a tub of Dr. Teal&#x27;s was amazing.</li>
            <li>and it both feels and smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>Dr. Teal&#x27;s scented epsom salt is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I can add my own scents.</li>
            <li>This product is so wonderful, combined with Dr. Teal&#x27;s foaming bath and you have a very relaxing soak.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t give any guarantees, but this really works for me and seems to be especially nice when soaking in the tub.</li>
            <li>The menthol has a warm calming effect on my body, feet &amp; hands.</li>
            <li>so I used one of my own.</li>
            <li>Using it as recommended, I found I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>The smell was nice for Dr. Teals which I also purchased at walmart for around 5 bucks.</li>
            <li>and I give my honest opinion 100% mine.</li>
            <li>I tried it 3x a week in a warm bath.</li>
            <li>I play tennis and am a FT working mom, so this is a nice treat.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this smelled NOTHING like either of the two or the two together.</li>
            <li>an Effective Treatment for Running Injuries?</li>
            <li>Nice salt for the bath.  </li>
            <li>Now that shes a toddler the bumps and bruises of falling are nicely soaked away in a soothing scented epsom salt bath.</li>
            <li>Kind of makes me itch.</li>
            <li>I got this as a free sample from Smiley 360  and love it!!  </li>
            <li>It has a strong but pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Strong and powerful but a great scent!!</li>
            <li>This scent is amazingly clean!!</li>
            <li>I am super happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a very strong smell, but I like it.  </li>
            <li>My most favorite Epsom salt!</li>
            <li>I started using Dr. Teal&#x27;s and have found it to be a fine product at what I think is a fair price.  </li>
            <li>Great smell and stays fresh in the resealable bag.</li>
            <li>But it will give temporary relief with a nice scent as a bonus i love the feel of skin after bath.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I can find something better - effective but with a lighter fragrance.</li>
            <li>And by far the best price per pound.</li>
            <li>However, relief md was MUCH more effective at relaxing my muscles.</li>
            <li>Wow, was I impressed with this soaking solution!</li>
            <li>All my sore aching muscles were soothed, my skin was soft as silk, and the aromatherapy provided a wonderful experience!</li>
            <li>:always leaves our bathroom  and nearby hallway smelling like a nice spa :-)</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but I would like more spearmint.</li>
            <li>Love the lavender fragrance and the salts dissolve quickly in the bath; muscles and mind both relax: great before bed.</li>
            <li>The scent is so strong I can TASTE it!  </li>
            <li>Love LOVE love this product!</li>
            <li>I always sleep better after a warm bath, but I sleep even better when using any of Dr. Teal&#x27;s salts.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the aroma and the relaxing benefits.</li>
            <li>If I had a list of my favorite things, this would make it on there for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Eucalyptus Spearmint scent is my favorite as well.  </li>
            <li>The product has been so enjoyably relaxing that we&#x27;ve purchased additional scents.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Dr. Teals, so no complaints.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I was gifted this a couple of years ago and now image sure to always stock it in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>On top of that, I put in a 19&#x27;x11&#x27; sandset stone patio, digging up the area by hand - back-breaking work.</li>
            <li>Teal&#x27;s lavender Epsom salts and fell in love.</li>
            <li>I love bath and body works line of  stress relief eucalyptus and spearmint.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many others just for comparison.</li>
            <li>Dr. Teals is at the top of the top.</li>
            <li>I really love the smell of this scent of Epsom Salt.  </li>
            <li>but this is much better.</li>
            <li>this being said I buy \\&quot; regular\\&quot; unscented most Lo</li>
            <li>but this brand I buy all scents, most people review the lavender nighttime sleepy one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased it from Amazon many times</li>
            <li>This is my favorite bath salt that I have come across in the market.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness someone out there understands more</li>
            <li>is not always better where fragrance is concerned.</li>
            <li>my allergies are so much better.</li>
            <li>The scent gives your bath a much more relaxing ambiance.</li>
            <li>OK...  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>excruciating muscle and even bone aches for 2 weeks or more after the impact.</li>
            <li>and hey, take more bath salts in the winter.</li>
            <li>I need a more words...</li>
            <li>I enjoyed free shipping!</li>
            <li>In addition I used bubble bath soap to make sitting in the tub relaxing (and the more cleansing products the better...</li>
            <li>In addition I used my fingers to open/massage the folds and creases in my vagina to make sure water traveled everywhere and then cleaned myself with a washrag while bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It still looks like I should continue for an additional week my bath-salt ritual to make sure no traces of infection exists, but the bubble inside my vagina has disappeared.  </li>
            <li>: We all have sexual organs that have creases and folds we can miss while cleansing.</li>
            <li>This product is a preventative of the many skin conditions out there</li>
            <li>I love this bath salt.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done my research/reading on what&#x27;s better for eczema treatment</li>
            <li>This scent is an all time favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love this product but not THIS price.</li>
            <li>Jet tub baths are one of my favorite leisure activities.....</li>
            <li>I have tried many salts/bubble baths.</li>
            <li>and I also slept better.</li>
            <li>It leads me to wonder if this is not in fact authentic epsom salt, but rather scented table salt.</li>
            <li>I like this one (Eucalyptus and Spearmint) more.</li>
            <li>I love to use epsom salt after working out or to soak during the winter and used to put oils in with it.</li>
            <li>It seems to me she sleeps better and feels better.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I use to buy it at Walgreens or Walmart, but it is cheaper on line and they have a lot more options.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and place the salts in a bowl by the tub</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice way to pamper yourself to get smooth feeling skin.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and how it feels.</li>
            <li>I love the way this product makes my room smell after using it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of these epsom salts.</li>
            <li>Also I cannot smell any eucalyptus or spearmint because the added fragrance is so overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this.</li>
            <li>One cup full is all you need to make the bath feel amazing.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the perfect thing after a long day.</li>
            <li>However, the strong sort-of-cheap fragrance is simply overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I highly recommend this product for a nice Soak!</li>
            <li>Love the price and free Prime shopping.</li>
            <li>As far as I am concerned both formulations are great and enhance the effectiveness of Epsom Salts.</li>
            <li>You get free shipping with any order of $50 or more.  </li>
            <li>I loved it so much, it sucked all my worries away within 10 minutes of soaking.  </li>
            <li>but this was a wonderful experience,  unlike any other.</li>
            <li>Not an easy item to find in store and</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s strong though in intensity), but the scent lightens up on your skin so you can wear perfume and whatnot without feeling overpowered by the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is strong, but not overpowering..</li>
            <li>It is soothing and has a great clean fresh crisp scent.</li>
            <li>The scent was amazing and very relaxing!</li>
            <li>Smells good, and is very soft.</li>
            <li>This one seemed to fit the bill with eucalyptus which is supposed to have a gentle smell, but is still considered effective for massage purposes.</li>
            <li>Compared to buying locally this is a great deal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried Walgreen&#x27;s generic brand of Eucalyptus Epsom Salts and was not as happy.</li>
            <li>The dense smell lingered all night, smelt like a cheap salon</li>
            <li>When staying at a rental house on vacation, this was available and I took a soothing bath and recalled the name in order to find some for home.</li>
            <li>shipping is free with both</li>
            <li>To Women of All Kind (Even Men):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning this review may seem like too much information (regarding a health condition) so please take caution before reading.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(amount of water doesn&#x27;t matter I filled up to my hips or up to my ribcage....</li>
            <li>The salt smells like light cologne for men</li>
            <li>I got my product for free at smiley360.com for just a review on the product</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I received this as a free sample from smiley 360.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t smell like eucalyptus or spearmint, just cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>Your bath will smell like a spa, light your candles and relax.</li>
            <li>Maybe I am a cheap perfume type of girl</li>
            <li>Great lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li>One of the things my cranky old joints enjoy is a good soak in the Jacuzzi tub.  </li>
            <li>The smell was strong at first, but I acclimated to it and found myself really enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this as an effective, affordable way to ease aches and pains.</li>
            <li>I finally have a wonderful soaking tub, and purchased this product to use in my new home.</li>
            <li>so I was excited when I found Dr. Teals eucalyptus salts.</li>
            <li>Wow, this was great and far better than the product I&#x27;ve used forever.</li>
            <li>I bought four bags because I love it so much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great gentle exfoliation and naturally hydrates.</li>
            <li>After workouts or long days at work I truly enjoy soaking in a nice bubble bath where I also add this product!</li>
            <li>You can use my review as an example when you don&#x27;t properly clean yourself.</li>
            <li>Salt kills many infectious bacteria that cannot survive, and is a perfect remedy for mild or temporary external bodily issues we can come across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I will most certainly will purchase The Dr. Teal&#x27;s variety of soaking solutions again.</li>
            <li>It was packed full of salt</li>
            <li>really wanted to like this product but given the overwhelming smell, I will probably not be using it again.</li>
            <li>These are very affordable and make your feet feel better.  </li>
            <li>and I can breath with ease at night and after an hour or so let the water out after it cools and the house smells so good and calming while we sleep, since I started using this several years ago</li>
            <li>(hence a bath with the true oil/scent is one variation).</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend for anyone into aroma therapy or just needs a good soaking.</li>
            <li>I should also have known better as plastic bags can not contain products with any significant amount of essential oils as the oils will eat through most plastics.  </li>
            <li>I happen to be very sensitive to overpowering fragrances and often have to use fragrance free versions of most things.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because of the therapeutic qualities and the smell is very nice, not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>, I simply folded the bag from the top and pressed it against the wall so that the top part wouldn&#x27;t rise.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would go into the bath with aches and pains and strange sensations - thanks to my car wreck - and emerge healed and pain-free and fell into a beautiful sleep.</li>
            <li>I am 34 weeks pregnant and have used both this stuff and relief md salts.</li>
            <li>It is very refreshing and if put in an open jar or container, it can be used as an air freshener too.  </li>
            <li>I see that Dr. Teal&#x27;s makes a bubble bath with that same scent, so if bubbles are your thing, that would be nice.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing like a good soak after a rough workout and this product delivers.</li>
            <li>I tossed on soft white socks, went to bed, and felt great in the a.m.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>The are few things better than taking a nice scented bath at end of</li>
            <li>I take a quick shower first with soap and shampoo my hair, then draw the bath with salts.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I loved it and whenever I have money to spare, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>...unless you enjoy the overwhelmingly pungent smell of cheap cologne.&lt;br /&gt;I used half the recommended amount, but had to stop after five minutes because the added \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; gave me headaches and nausea.  </li>
            <li>This is good enough to keep water out from the bag, leaving the salt dry and good for subsequent uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this and enjoy, relax and get soft skin too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only that, but the Epsom salts took the sting out of all the fresh mosquito bites I got working outside, so I was able to sleep without scratching them, allowing them to heal better.</li>
            <li>If you are worried about the salt price, mix 1 cup of dr teals and 1 cup of regular Epsom salt that is VERY cheap.</li>
            <li>I should have known better as these essential oils are not mentioned in the ingredients, but just lumped in with \\&quot;fragrance.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>The product works well but the aroma is much better suited to the female gender.</li>
            <li>A bit overwhelming for the male gender.</li>
            <li>After Epsom salt, the first ingredient is &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>ritual baths help me feel better and sleep better, I discovered Epsom salts only last year</li>
            <li>Did allot of research before leaping to use in our $12k hot tub...very hesitant.  </li>
            <li>Well, I have been taking hot baths religiously - 1 to 2 per day and using Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt soaking solution with Eucalyptus and I am blown away by the magical healing effects of these salts.</li>
            <li>so I picked them up at a local store, but I&#x27;ll be getting more</li>
            <li>I love to soak my feet in Dr. Teal&#x27;s epsom salt prior to doing my pedicure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no doctor (yet applying to medical school soon though :-),</li>
            <li>once in morning and once at night) I poured ~1cup of the Dr. Teal salt into my hot bath water</li>
            <li>Although I have used epsom salts for decades, this is my first experience using Dr. Teal&#x27;s</li>
            <li>This is one of the best but price is totally unfair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty off-putting.</li>
            <li>though if you&#x27;re simply looking for a pleasant scent and not the benefits of the above mentioned.</li>
            <li>What you will smell is a fragrance more akin to cheap soap such as Irish Spring or Dove;</li>
            <li>Nothing relaxes me more than the Dr. Teal&#x27;s Eucalyptus Spearmint bath salt at the end of a long day.</li>
            <li>This is full of perfume, smells like old men&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product, it smells good, the scent last the entire time at bath time, and is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, is relaxing, and you get the exposure to the epsom salts through using it in the bath.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone wanting to have a relaxing and therapeutic soak after a hard workout, long day, or just being stressed out should consider this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Would be nice if a bit less pricey though</li>
            <li>I used 4 to 5 large scoops for each bath and soaked about 30 to 45 minutes each time.</li>
            <li>The eucalyptus scent is not overwhelming, it actually smells really good!</li>
            <li>So I combined what soap I would normally use and added the salt, and the salt does a great job dissolving as the crystals are very small.</li>
            <li>put a bit in warm water and dip my doggies paws  It after a walk to prevent itching bt their little \\&quot; toes\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s crazy how awesome it works!  </li>
            <li>The epsom salt really helps with sore muscles and I find it helps with my migraines....</li>
            <li>I really like this fragrance and wasn&#x27;t put off by it at all.</li>
            <li>I have been using this as a foot soak and it works very well to soften my feet.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li>The price went up way too much.</li>
            <li>It smells very therapeutic, which I like.  </li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s my fault for not shopping around, but really?</li>
            <li>(if I don&#x27;t follow with a shower).&lt;br /&gt;The price is extremely reasonable.</li>
            <li>The scents are very pleasing and help me to relax....     </li>
            <li>Just took a 40 minute bath and feel very relaxed now.  </li>
            <li>It softens my feet and the scent of eucalyptus spearmint is very soothing.</li>
            <li>the amount was much more than expected.</li>
            <li>It has a very overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>found Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt Soaking Solution with Eucalyptus Spearmint and bought it originally to soak my overworked muscles after physical labor.</li>
            <li>I have tried some of Dr. Teal&#x27;s other scents (Milk &amp; Honey, Lavender, Rosemary Mint) and the Eucalyptus Spearmint is my favorite by far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And while I also love Amazon, I must tell you that you can order it and all the other Dr.</li>
            <li>It smells heavenly, beyond reasonable price and smells better than any of the redicuously priced beads and other products at the pool supply store!</li>
            <li>Before entering my first bath with this, I had a killer migraine and was sore as can be from an intensive work week and stressin&#x27; with school, and after a 40 minute bath with this stuff the migraine was nearly nonexistent</li>
            <li>Before you buy, please read the full following articles:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Expensive but great smell and very soothing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a steady customer.</li>
            <li>Warm water always helps, but the addition of these epsom salts to a hot bath is not only relaxing due to the aromatherapy nature of the ingredients, but also increases the effectiveness of a hot bath for my back and joint issues.</li>
            <li>10lb bucket for a little more than 3lbs of this.</li>
            <li>I use it for detox (or just normal) baths.</li>
            <li>Although they felt good and worked, there is something in that brand that leaves an oily film on my skin, where Dr. Teal&#x27;s leaves nothing behind but a hint of the eucalyptus and spearmint scents.</li>
            <li>do believe that plain old-fashioned Epsom Salts would work well for all of these needs, but I have to say that the Eucalyptus Spearmint scent was lovely aromatherapy.</li>
            <li>We purchased a new home this spring, after living in one home for 30 years.</li>
            <li>Angel, from New York.</li>
            <li>If I want fragrance, I will stick with adding  a few drops of my own essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>funny thing about this was the next morning when my husband came into the bathroom, he said \\&quot;What smells like men&#x27;s cologne?\\</li>
            <li>I mixed it with salt that does not have smell, works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I take a hot bath w Epsom salts daily for the relaxing, restortive \\&quot;</li>
            <li>I first picked this up in Walmart--it was the last one on the shelf.  </li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel soft and your mind relaxed!</li>
            <li>but in reading and comparing the severity of my situation with those who had to see a medical professional, I decided to try a home remedy method first (and to save money).</li>
            <li>I would highly discourage anyone from buying this product (or any other Dr Teal&#x27;s epsom salt solutions with added fragrance) especially if you enjoy a non-toxic lifestyle, as \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; has hundreds of toxic compounds that do not need to be listed according to the fda.</li>
            <li>While a hot bath or shower alone may help my back for a couple of hours, this extends that out-- sometimes to a full day with little or no pain.</li>
            <li>Plus everyone in my house kept commenting on the amazing scent of the eucalyptus and spearmint wafting throughout my house as I soaked my poor foot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great idea I just wish they made a natural product instead of artificial scents .</li>
            <li>, my body was completely relaxed, and this stuff does wonders for my eczema.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the bag&#x27;s &amp;#34;sealing&amp;#34; feature is very faulty, nothing a rubber band or a clip of some sort can&#x27;t fix, and I personally like the smell.</li>
            <li>a scent far from relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It relaxes and refreshes me, my aches from standing on my feet as a young nurse ease up, my skin is softer and it detoxes me.</li>
            <li>My entire house absolutely reeks of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I am a 51 yr old woman who is going thru menopause-</li>
            <li>This is the way to make a long day end peacefully - a hot soak in a relaxing tub of Epsom salts.  </li>
            <li>Baths should be taken at least 1 a week with this salt to guarantee we are making sure germs don&#x27;t linger on our skin.</li>
            <li>buy low, sell high!).</li>
            <li>Though Epsom salt is dirt-cheap, no research supports any direct effect on injury recovery, and none of the theories forwarded about how Epsom salt might help in indirect ways</li>
            <li>If you like natural scents this is not for you.</li>
            <li>when I got the bag that I bought too much but am now convinced I did not buy enough!</li>
            <li>I literally had to wash my skin with natural soap to get the smell off me.  </li>
            <li>I have not experienced any kind of irritation from using this product.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend them, next time I&#x27;m getting plain old unscented epsom salts and will add my own essential oils.</li>
            <li>In the future, I will buy plain epsom salts and essential oils and concoct my own.</li>
            <li>While a bath with these salts certainly helped me with some aching bones, I&#x27;ve had better results with the more generic and less expensive epsom salts.  </li>
            <li>Folk remedies are often generally neglected by researchers, but not usually so completely.&amp;#34; -- Paul Ingraham</li>
            <li>I mainly started using this because i read Epsom salt can help with back pain.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first bag at a local retail store and used it in the bath, Ladies I can not use bubble bath so this is very different.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to much of either, so it can go a long way.</li>
            <li>Unlike the product description, this Epsom salt is NOT delicately fragranced with essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Salt is a hostile environment for many common external pathogens (germs) that live outside of our body.</li>
            <li>After working all day, then going to the old home to pack up more boxes, I would be tired to the bone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased a few Dr. Teal&#x27;s products from my local Walgreen&#x27;s, so I was excited to try the Eucalyptus Spearmint Epsom Salt Soaking Solution.  </li>
            <li>AFter a hard and tiring workout, I enjoy my nightly bath with Dr. Teals Epsom Salts.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is, where is jus tplain old Epsom Salts?</li>
            <li>I am not usually such an emotional reviewer but this product has really effected me and I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone else to suffer the same fate based on the glowing reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting harder to find, which is a real bummer.</li>
            <li>I suggest be careful when pouring so you dont use too much of it.</li>
            <li>Used this after a half marathon and it really took away the aches and pains!</li>
            <li>This stuff sells out fast compared to the other Dr. Teal&#x27;s scented bath salts I have noticed.</li>
            <li>The older bag used to just have a ziplock type closure which did not work in keeping the bag closed.</li>
            <li>it really helps to relax my muscles and clears up various skin issues or other irritations.</li>
            <li>You just need to use at least 2 cups in the bath to get the full treatment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a difficult decision between this and my other dr teals scents, BUT dr teal&#x27;s is always good product.</li>
            <li>I take a small dixie cup (the bathroom sized ones) and fill it with the epsom salt and pour it right into the spout of running water.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hands down my favorite and hard to find in Wal mart.</li>

            <li> The soaps and pillow sprays are amazing</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing</li>
            <li> The scent is so relaxing and soothing and after shoveling snow all day the benefits of soaking in a tub of Dr. Teal&#x27;s was amazing.</li>
            <li> and it both feels and smells amazing.  </li>
            <li> Dr. Teal&#x27;s scented epsom salt is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I can add my own scents.</li>
            <li> This product is so wonderful, combined with Dr. Teal&#x27;s foaming bath and you have a very relaxing soak.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t give any guarantees, but this really works for me and seems to be especially nice when soaking in the tub.</li>
            <li> The menthol has a warm calming effect on my body, feet &amp; hands.</li>
            <li> so I used one of my own.</li>
            <li> Using it as recommended, I found I really liked it.  </li>
            <li> The smell was nice for Dr. Teals which I also purchased at walmart for around 5 bucks.</li>
            <li> and I give my honest opinion 100% mine.</li>
            <li> I tried it 3x a week in a warm bath.</li>
            <li> I play tennis and am a FT working mom, so this is a nice treat.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this smelled NOTHING like either of the two or the two together.</li>
            <li> an Effective Treatment for Running Injuries?</li>
            <li> Nice salt for the bath.  </li>
            <li> Now that shes a toddler the bumps and bruises of falling are nicely soaked away in a soothing scented epsom salt bath.</li>
            <li> Kind of makes me itch.</li>
            <li> I got this as a free sample from Smiley 360  and love it!!  </li>
            <li> It has a strong but pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Strong and powerful but a great scent!!</li>
            <li> This scent is amazingly clean!!</li>
            <li> I am super happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a very strong smell, but I like it.  </li>
            <li> My most favorite Epsom salt!</li>
            <li> I started using Dr. Teal&#x27;s and have found it to be a fine product at what I think is a fair price.  </li>
            <li> Great smell and stays fresh in the resealable bag.</li>
            <li> But it will give temporary relief with a nice scent as a bonus i love the feel of skin after bath.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I can find something better - effective but with a lighter fragrance.</li>
            <li> And by far the best price per pound.</li>
            <li> However, relief md was MUCH more effective at relaxing my muscles.</li>
            <li> Wow, was I impressed with this soaking solution!</li>
            <li> All my sore aching muscles were soothed, my skin was soft as silk, and the aromatherapy provided a wonderful experience!</li>
            <li> :always leaves our bathroom  and nearby hallway smelling like a nice spa :-)</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but I would like more spearmint.</li>
            <li> Love the lavender fragrance and the salts dissolve quickly in the bath; muscles and mind both relax: great before bed.</li>
            <li> The scent is so strong I can TASTE it!  </li>
            <li> Love LOVE love this product!</li>
            <li> I always sleep better after a warm bath, but I sleep even better when using any of Dr. Teal&#x27;s salts.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the aroma and the relaxing benefits.</li>
            <li> If I had a list of my favorite things, this would make it on there for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Eucalyptus Spearmint scent is my favorite as well.  </li>
            <li> The product has been so enjoyably relaxing that we&#x27;ve purchased additional scents.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Dr. Teals, so no complaints.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I was gifted this a couple of years ago and now image sure to always stock it in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> On top of that, I put in a 19&#x27;x11&#x27; sandset stone patio, digging up the area by hand - back-breaking work.</li>
            <li> Teal&#x27;s lavender Epsom salts and fell in love.</li>
            <li> I love bath and body works line of  stress relief eucalyptus and spearmint.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many others just for comparison.</li>
            <li> Dr. Teals is at the top of the top.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this scent of Epsom Salt.  </li>
            <li> but this is much better.</li>
            <li> this being said I buy \\&quot; regular\\&quot; unscented most Lo</li>
            <li> but this brand I buy all scents, most people review the lavender nighttime sleepy one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased it from Amazon many times</li>
            <li> This is my favorite bath salt that I have come across in the market.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness someone out there understands more</li>
            <li> is not always better where fragrance is concerned.</li>
            <li> my allergies are so much better.</li>
            <li> The scent gives your bath a much more relaxing ambiance.</li>
            <li> OK...  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> excruciating muscle and even bone aches for 2 weeks or more after the impact.</li>
            <li> and hey, take more bath salts in the winter.</li>
            <li> I need a more words...</li>
            <li> I enjoyed free shipping!</li>
            <li> In addition I used bubble bath soap to make sitting in the tub relaxing (and the more cleansing products the better...</li>
            <li> In addition I used my fingers to open/massage the folds and creases in my vagina to make sure water traveled everywhere and then cleaned myself with a washrag while bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It still looks like I should continue for an additional week my bath-salt ritual to make sure no traces of infection exists, but the bubble inside my vagina has disappeared.  </li>
            <li> : We all have sexual organs that have creases and folds we can miss while cleansing.</li>
            <li> This product is a preventative of the many skin conditions out there</li>
            <li> I love this bath salt.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done my research/reading on what&#x27;s better for eczema treatment</li>
            <li> This scent is an all time favorite.  </li>
            <li> I love this product but not THIS price.</li>
            <li> Jet tub baths are one of my favorite leisure activities.....</li>
            <li> I have tried many salts/bubble baths.</li>
            <li> and I also slept better.</li>
            <li> It leads me to wonder if this is not in fact authentic epsom salt, but rather scented table salt.</li>
            <li> I like this one (Eucalyptus and Spearmint) more.</li>
            <li> I love to use epsom salt after working out or to soak during the winter and used to put oils in with it.</li>
            <li> It seems to me she sleeps better and feels better.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I use to buy it at Walgreens or Walmart, but it is cheaper on line and they have a lot more options.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff and place the salts in a bowl by the tub</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice way to pamper yourself to get smooth feeling skin.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and how it feels.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my room smell after using it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of these epsom salts.</li>
            <li> Also I cannot smell any eucalyptus or spearmint because the added fragrance is so overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this.</li>
            <li> One cup full is all you need to make the bath feel amazing.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the perfect thing after a long day.</li>
            <li> However, the strong sort-of-cheap fragrance is simply overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I highly recommend this product for a nice Soak!</li>
            <li> Love the price and free Prime shopping.</li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned both formulations are great and enhance the effectiveness of Epsom Salts.</li>
            <li> You get free shipping with any order of $50 or more.  </li>
            <li> I loved it so much, it sucked all my worries away within 10 minutes of soaking.  </li>
            <li> but this was a wonderful experience,  unlike any other.</li>
            <li> Not an easy item to find in store and</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s strong though in intensity), but the scent lightens up on your skin so you can wear perfume and whatnot without feeling overpowered by the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is strong, but not overpowering..</li>
            <li> It is soothing and has a great clean fresh crisp scent.</li>
            <li> The scent was amazing and very relaxing!</li>
            <li> Smells good, and is very soft.</li>
            <li> This one seemed to fit the bill with eucalyptus which is supposed to have a gentle smell, but is still considered effective for massage purposes.</li>
            <li> Compared to buying locally this is a great deal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried Walgreen&#x27;s generic brand of Eucalyptus Epsom Salts and was not as happy.</li>
            <li> The dense smell lingered all night, smelt like a cheap salon</li>
            <li> When staying at a rental house on vacation, this was available and I took a soothing bath and recalled the name in order to find some for home.</li>
            <li> shipping is free with both</li>
            <li> To Women of All Kind (Even Men):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning this review may seem like too much information (regarding a health condition) so please take caution before reading.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (amount of water doesn&#x27;t matter I filled up to my hips or up to my ribcage....</li>
            <li> The salt smells like light cologne for men</li>
            <li> I got my product for free at smiley360.com for just a review on the product</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample from smiley 360.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell like eucalyptus or spearmint, just cheap perfume.</li>
            <li> Your bath will smell like a spa, light your candles and relax.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am a cheap perfume type of girl</li>
            <li> Great lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> One of the things my cranky old joints enjoy is a good soak in the Jacuzzi tub.  </li>
            <li> The smell was strong at first, but I acclimated to it and found myself really enjoying it.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this as an effective, affordable way to ease aches and pains.</li>
            <li> I finally have a wonderful soaking tub, and purchased this product to use in my new home.</li>
            <li> so I was excited when I found Dr. Teals eucalyptus salts.</li>
            <li> Wow, this was great and far better than the product I&#x27;ve used forever.</li>
            <li> I bought four bags because I love it so much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great gentle exfoliation and naturally hydrates.</li>
            <li> After workouts or long days at work I truly enjoy soaking in a nice bubble bath where I also add this product!</li>
            <li> You can use my review as an example when you don&#x27;t properly clean yourself.</li>
            <li> Salt kills many infectious bacteria that cannot survive, and is a perfect remedy for mild or temporary external bodily issues we can come across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I will most certainly will purchase The Dr. Teal&#x27;s variety of soaking solutions again.</li>
            <li> It was packed full of salt</li>
            <li> really wanted to like this product but given the overwhelming smell, I will probably not be using it again.</li>
            <li> These are very affordable and make your feet feel better.  </li>
            <li> and I can breath with ease at night and after an hour or so let the water out after it cools and the house smells so good and calming while we sleep, since I started using this several years ago</li>
            <li> (hence a bath with the true oil/scent is one variation).</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend for anyone into aroma therapy or just needs a good soaking.</li>
            <li> I should also have known better as plastic bags can not contain products with any significant amount of essential oils as the oils will eat through most plastics.  </li>
            <li> I happen to be very sensitive to overpowering fragrances and often have to use fragrance free versions of most things.  </li>
            <li> I love this product because of the therapeutic qualities and the smell is very nice, not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> , I simply folded the bag from the top and pressed it against the wall so that the top part wouldn&#x27;t rise.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would go into the bath with aches and pains and strange sensations - thanks to my car wreck - and emerge healed and pain-free and fell into a beautiful sleep.</li>
            <li> I am 34 weeks pregnant and have used both this stuff and relief md salts.</li>
            <li> It is very refreshing and if put in an open jar or container, it can be used as an air freshener too.  </li>
            <li> I see that Dr. Teal&#x27;s makes a bubble bath with that same scent, so if bubbles are your thing, that would be nice.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing like a good soak after a rough workout and this product delivers.</li>
            <li> I tossed on soft white socks, went to bed, and felt great in the a.m.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> The are few things better than taking a nice scented bath at end of</li>
            <li> I take a quick shower first with soap and shampoo my hair, then draw the bath with salts.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I loved it and whenever I have money to spare, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> ...unless you enjoy the overwhelmingly pungent smell of cheap cologne.&lt;br /&gt;I used half the recommended amount, but had to stop after five minutes because the added \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; gave me headaches and nausea.  </li>
            <li> This is good enough to keep water out from the bag, leaving the salt dry and good for subsequent uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this and enjoy, relax and get soft skin too!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only that, but the Epsom salts took the sting out of all the fresh mosquito bites I got working outside, so I was able to sleep without scratching them, allowing them to heal better.</li>
            <li> If you are worried about the salt price, mix 1 cup of dr teals and 1 cup of regular Epsom salt that is VERY cheap.</li>
            <li> I should have known better as these essential oils are not mentioned in the ingredients, but just lumped in with \\&quot;fragrance.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> The product works well but the aroma is much better suited to the female gender.</li>
            <li> A bit overwhelming for the male gender.</li>
            <li> After Epsom salt, the first ingredient is &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> ritual baths help me feel better and sleep better, I discovered Epsom salts only last year</li>
            <li> Did allot of research before leaping to use in our $12k hot tub...very hesitant.  </li>
            <li> Well, I have been taking hot baths religiously - 1 to 2 per day and using Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt soaking solution with Eucalyptus and I am blown away by the magical healing effects of these salts.</li>
            <li> so I picked them up at a local store, but I&#x27;ll be getting more</li>
            <li> I love to soak my feet in Dr. Teal&#x27;s epsom salt prior to doing my pedicure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no doctor (yet applying to medical school soon though :-),</li>
            <li> once in morning and once at night) I poured ~1cup of the Dr. Teal salt into my hot bath water</li>
            <li> Although I have used epsom salts for decades, this is my first experience using Dr. Teal&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This is one of the best but price is totally unfair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty off-putting.</li>
            <li> though if you&#x27;re simply looking for a pleasant scent and not the benefits of the above mentioned.</li>
            <li> What you will smell is a fragrance more akin to cheap soap such as Irish Spring or Dove;</li>
            <li> Nothing relaxes me more than the Dr. Teal&#x27;s Eucalyptus Spearmint bath salt at the end of a long day.</li>
            <li> This is full of perfume, smells like old men&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product, it smells good, the scent last the entire time at bath time, and is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful, is relaxing, and you get the exposure to the epsom salts through using it in the bath.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone wanting to have a relaxing and therapeutic soak after a hard workout, long day, or just being stressed out should consider this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Would be nice if a bit less pricey though</li>
            <li> I used 4 to 5 large scoops for each bath and soaked about 30 to 45 minutes each time.</li>
            <li> The eucalyptus scent is not overwhelming, it actually smells really good!</li>
            <li> So I combined what soap I would normally use and added the salt, and the salt does a great job dissolving as the crystals are very small.</li>
            <li> put a bit in warm water and dip my doggies paws  It after a walk to prevent itching bt their little \\&quot; toes\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy how awesome it works!  </li>
            <li> The epsom salt really helps with sore muscles and I find it helps with my migraines....</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance and wasn&#x27;t put off by it at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as a foot soak and it works very well to soften my feet.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> The price went up way too much.</li>
            <li> It smells very therapeutic, which I like.  </li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s my fault for not shopping around, but really?</li>
            <li> (if I don&#x27;t follow with a shower).&lt;br /&gt;The price is extremely reasonable.</li>
            <li> The scents are very pleasing and help me to relax....     </li>
            <li> Just took a 40 minute bath and feel very relaxed now.  </li>
            <li> It softens my feet and the scent of eucalyptus spearmint is very soothing.</li>
            <li> the amount was much more than expected.</li>
            <li> It has a very overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> found Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt Soaking Solution with Eucalyptus Spearmint and bought it originally to soak my overworked muscles after physical labor.</li>
            <li> I have tried some of Dr. Teal&#x27;s other scents (Milk &amp; Honey, Lavender, Rosemary Mint) and the Eucalyptus Spearmint is my favorite by far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And while I also love Amazon, I must tell you that you can order it and all the other Dr.</li>
            <li> It smells heavenly, beyond reasonable price and smells better than any of the redicuously priced beads and other products at the pool supply store!</li>
            <li> Before entering my first bath with this, I had a killer migraine and was sore as can be from an intensive work week and stressin&#x27; with school, and after a 40 minute bath with this stuff the migraine was nearly nonexistent</li>
            <li> Before you buy, please read the full following articles:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Expensive but great smell and very soothing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a steady customer.</li>
            <li> Warm water always helps, but the addition of these epsom salts to a hot bath is not only relaxing due to the aromatherapy nature of the ingredients, but also increases the effectiveness of a hot bath for my back and joint issues.</li>
            <li> 10lb bucket for a little more than 3lbs of this.</li>
            <li> I use it for detox (or just normal) baths.</li>
            <li> Although they felt good and worked, there is something in that brand that leaves an oily film on my skin, where Dr. Teal&#x27;s leaves nothing behind but a hint of the eucalyptus and spearmint scents.</li>
            <li> do believe that plain old-fashioned Epsom Salts would work well for all of these needs, but I have to say that the Eucalyptus Spearmint scent was lovely aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> We purchased a new home this spring, after living in one home for 30 years.</li>
            <li> Angel, from New York.</li>
            <li> If I want fragrance, I will stick with adding  a few drops of my own essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> funny thing about this was the next morning when my husband came into the bathroom, he said \\&quot;What smells like men&#x27;s cologne?\\</li>
            <li> I mixed it with salt that does not have smell, works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I take a hot bath w Epsom salts daily for the relaxing, restortive \\&quot;</li>
            <li> I first picked this up in Walmart--it was the last one on the shelf.  </li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel soft and your mind relaxed!</li>
            <li> but in reading and comparing the severity of my situation with those who had to see a medical professional, I decided to try a home remedy method first (and to save money).</li>
            <li> I would highly discourage anyone from buying this product (or any other Dr Teal&#x27;s epsom salt solutions with added fragrance) especially if you enjoy a non-toxic lifestyle, as \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; has hundreds of toxic compounds that do not need to be listed according to the fda.</li>
            <li> While a hot bath or shower alone may help my back for a couple of hours, this extends that out-- sometimes to a full day with little or no pain.</li>
            <li> Plus everyone in my house kept commenting on the amazing scent of the eucalyptus and spearmint wafting throughout my house as I soaked my poor foot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea I just wish they made a natural product instead of artificial scents .</li>
            <li> , my body was completely relaxed, and this stuff does wonders for my eczema.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the bag&#x27;s &amp;#34;sealing&amp;#34; feature is very faulty, nothing a rubber band or a clip of some sort can&#x27;t fix, and I personally like the smell.</li>
            <li> a scent far from relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It relaxes and refreshes me, my aches from standing on my feet as a young nurse ease up, my skin is softer and it detoxes me.</li>
            <li> My entire house absolutely reeks of chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I am a 51 yr old woman who is going thru menopause-</li>
            <li> This is the way to make a long day end peacefully - a hot soak in a relaxing tub of Epsom salts.  </li>
            <li> Baths should be taken at least 1 a week with this salt to guarantee we are making sure germs don&#x27;t linger on our skin.</li>
            <li> buy low, sell high!).</li>
            <li> Though Epsom salt is dirt-cheap, no research supports any direct effect on injury recovery, and none of the theories forwarded about how Epsom salt might help in indirect ways</li>
            <li> If you like natural scents this is not for you.</li>
            <li> when I got the bag that I bought too much but am now convinced I did not buy enough!</li>
            <li> I literally had to wash my skin with natural soap to get the smell off me.  </li>
            <li> I have not experienced any kind of irritation from using this product.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend them, next time I&#x27;m getting plain old unscented epsom salts and will add my own essential oils.</li>
            <li> In the future, I will buy plain epsom salts and essential oils and concoct my own.</li>
            <li> While a bath with these salts certainly helped me with some aching bones, I&#x27;ve had better results with the more generic and less expensive epsom salts.  </li>
            <li> Folk remedies are often generally neglected by researchers, but not usually so completely.&amp;#34; -- Paul Ingraham</li>
            <li> I mainly started using this because i read Epsom salt can help with back pain.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first bag at a local retail store and used it in the bath, Ladies I can not use bubble bath so this is very different.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to much of either, so it can go a long way.</li>
            <li> Unlike the product description, this Epsom salt is NOT delicately fragranced with essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Salt is a hostile environment for many common external pathogens (germs) that live outside of our body.</li>
            <li> After working all day, then going to the old home to pack up more boxes, I would be tired to the bone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a few Dr. Teal&#x27;s products from my local Walgreen&#x27;s, so I was excited to try the Eucalyptus Spearmint Epsom Salt Soaking Solution.  </li>
            <li> AFter a hard and tiring workout, I enjoy my nightly bath with Dr. Teals Epsom Salts.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is, where is jus tplain old Epsom Salts?</li>
            <li> I am not usually such an emotional reviewer but this product has really effected me and I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone else to suffer the same fate based on the glowing reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder to find, which is a real bummer.</li>
            <li> I suggest be careful when pouring so you dont use too much of it.</li>
            <li> Used this after a half marathon and it really took away the aches and pains!</li>
            <li> This stuff sells out fast compared to the other Dr. Teal&#x27;s scented bath salts I have noticed.</li>
            <li> The older bag used to just have a ziplock type closure which did not work in keeping the bag closed.</li>
            <li> it really helps to relax my muscles and clears up various skin issues or other irritations.</li>
            <li> You just need to use at least 2 cups in the bath to get the full treatment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a difficult decision between this and my other dr teals scents, BUT dr teal&#x27;s is always good product.</li>
            <li> I take a small dixie cup (the bathroom sized ones) and fill it with the epsom salt and pour it right into the spout of running water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hands down my favorite and hard to find in Wal mart.</li>
            <li> so I deliberately used much less than the recommended quantity (used only 1 small cup), even then the smell filled the bathroom and our bedroom.</li>
            <li> So...took the leap and have been using it several times a month with no apparent damage for about six months.</li>
            <li> It was a bit expensive and we went through it pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> I found that soaking in a tub with these Epsom salts immediately after such hard work helped alleviate much of the stiffness and soreness</li>
            <li> I have been recovering from a car accident - thankfully no major injuries, but if you know, which I hope you don&#x27;t for your sake,</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last long!</li>
            <li> Barring future research, it&#x27;s very hard to justify an Epsom salt bath over a traditional ice bath or hot water bath for treating an injury.</li>
            <li> These epsom salts have WAY too strong of a fake chemical perfume scent.</li>
            <li> The only thing I do not like is that it takes 2 cups per bath, so there is only enough in teh bag for about 3 and a half baths..</li>
            <li> It wont give long term relief and i wont tell you its a miracle cure cause its not.</li>
            <li> so I tried digging it all out and got it to partially seal, but it is still open to allow air in.</li>
            <li> Taking a long soaking bath in Dr. Teal&#x27;s Eucalyptus and Spearmint Epsom Salts, I felt relaxed, refreshed, slept like a baby and no sore muscles.</li>
            <li> Plan on a long soak in the tub the aroma and the way your skin and body feels after a soak with this product will make you a believer, you will be hooked.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy it so long as they keep producing the salt.</li>
            <li> This gland is located on either side inside the labia minor.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t matter as long as my vagina was immersed in the water).</li>
            <li> It is so strong and so artificial, it seems like someone emptied an entire can of Glade or Lysol in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I am a big bath taker, probably once a night or ever other night as it allows.</li>
            <li> Now I definitely want to try the other scents in this line too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little bit bigger and cheaper than the product for the same price at Walmart!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product whether you are an athlete or hard worker who needs that muscle relaxing soak now and then.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this stuff doesn&#x27;t really smell like either of those natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I put this product in bath water and the smell was so over powering even with a small amount, I had to drain it out of the tub and put the fan on to clear out the smell.  </li>
            <li> I unpacked the rest of the items from the box and then dumped the loose salts into a bath.  </li>
            <li> It can get expensive when I buy several bags at a time, but it&#x27;s certainly cheaper than a spa day!</li>
            <li> I was very wary of using this product after reading the negative reviews, but decided to give it a try (2 cups as recommended, with the plan to go down to 1 cup plus 1 cup of cheap, plain Epsom salt if the smell was too strong).  </li>
            <li> When it arrived it was the same size as the one I buy at Walmart for less than $5.00.</li>
            <li> Help heal after a long work day!!!</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful what I out in my baths.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time this year working on the yard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bag is meant to be resealable, but it&#x27;s really not.</li>
            <li> It only lasted me a few baths</li>
            <li> I just mix with plain Epsom salts to ho further</li>
            <li> I have tried Epsom salts plain then added essential oils to the bath</li>
            <li> It did not cause me discomfort and pain, but it was an alarming site to see when your vagina looks distorted due to swelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had read other people&#x27;s reviews in advance</li>
            <li> Epsom salts have tons of other uses, too- read up on it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I  this or any other product</li>
            <li> With RA and other issues, I can say definitively</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like some other soaking solutions.</li>
            <li> The item was affordably priced on Amazon, so I made my purchase (along with some of the other scents).  </li>
            <li> Who could not love this stuff, I bought four different scented salts and the bubble bath.  </li>
            <li> It lost its aroma fairly quickly, which was quite a disappointment.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the &amp;#34;zip lock&amp;#34; type seal does not work.</li>
            <li> I usually buy 4 bags at a time (Target or WalMart are roughly the same price) and try to avoid missing out!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is when I ordered some, I paid about $12 for a 3 lb bag.  </li>
            <li> The zip-lock mechanism doesn&#x27;t really work because the salt gets stuck in between the grooves making it impossible for the two sides to lock in properly.</li>
            <li> I remember getting it for much less at Walgreens some months ago.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t make this homemade for less.</li>
            <li> The package seemed a little knocked around and would not reseal, but that was not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> BUT I am NOT happy that 2 days after purchasing this item on amazon for almost $12, I see it on the shelf at my local walmart for less than $5.</li>
            <li> These bath salts definitely have the mint and eucalyptus scents, but they are subtle and relaxing not the usual attack on the senses.  </li>
            <li> recommend using plain epsom salts over this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll not choose plain if I can have this scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with my plain salts.</li>
            <li> Since they were out of plain epsom salts I bought this.  </li>
            <li> We use it in our toddler sons bath when he has a cold and it helps clear his sinuses.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend it, especially for cold winter nights in the northwest!</li>
            <li> Salt baths are unbelievable to remove toxins and reduce inflammation.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get past the perfume smell.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something herbal, and I&#x27;ve used scented bathsalts in the past, but this is a smack-you-in-the-head scent.</li>
            <li> Left my skin soft and helped my sore muscles after a tough workout!!!!</li>
            <li> I was unable to find even a single scientific paper studying their effect on body pain.</li>
            <li> I use this after a hard workout at the gym</li>
            <li> I am also quite prone to mosquito bites, which have a hard time healing because I&#x27;m a bit allergic and tend to scratch them while asleep when they burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When the package arrived 1 week later, unfortunately, this bag of epsom salts had broken inside the shipment box.  </li>
            <li> and I was very disappointed about how quickly it ran out.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve had it for years), so I decided to go and pick up one of these bad boys from the local Walgreens (save time and money</li>
            <li> But after awhile I got tired of the lavender scent-</li>
            <li> week my son came over with tired, blistered feet.</li>
            <li> Holy crap go buy it locally and save some money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced burning with non-branded, non-scented epsom salts.  </li>
            <li> This is a relaxing soak for tired or sore muscles that also soothes the brain using aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> I know other reviews had warned against this, but I reasoned that it couldn&#x27;t be that bad.</li>
            <li> Artificial fragrance is loaded with petrochemicals that irritate the body as well as are known carcinogens.</li>
            <li> search for scientific evidence concerning Epsom salt baths was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Sorry, Amazon!</li>
            <li> Way too fragrant, with unpleasant undertones.</li>
            <li> And to think that they want one to soak in this chemical concoction and absorb it though the skin is abhorrent.  </li>
            <li> I received some as part of a gift bag and was shocked I hadn&#x27;t heard recommendations to use it before!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed , this product has a lot of perfume in it.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  We actually mix this with non scented epsom salts.  One bag to 10 lbs of the non scented.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to all. I love the aroma and the relaxing benefits. I will definitely continue to purchase the Epsom salts.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Jeanne</li>
            <li> If I had a list of my favorite things, this would make it on there for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is GREAT if you have aches and pains!  It&#x27;s crazy how awesome it works!  I plan to give it as gifts this Christmas season!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Eucalyptus Spearmint scent is my favorite as well.  It&#x27;s so calming.  I see that Dr. Teal&#x27;s makes a bubble bath with that same scent, so if bubbles are your thing, that would be nice.  But I like that the Epsom Salt takes care of aches and pains.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use after working out or having had a stressful day.  The scent is calming, too.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it, especially for cold winter nights in the northwest!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it for detox (or just normal) baths. I also sprinkle some on the shower floor when I am feeling congested. Great smell and stays fresh in the resealable bag.</li>
            <li> Expensive but great smell and very soothing.  I just mix with plain Epsom salts to ho further</li>
            <li> This is great if you have aches and pains or stuffy head. I use it regularly for Fibromyalgia and it does help somewhat.</li>
            <li> The product has been so enjoyably relaxing that we&#x27;ve purchased additional scents. Give yourself a bit of luxury and try this in your bath.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels incredible!</li>
            <li> If there is any eucalyptus or spearmint in this product, you will not smell or feel it in this bath.  I should have known better as these essential oils are not mentioned in the ingredients, but just lumped in with \\&quot;fragrance.\\&quot;  I should also have known better as plastic bags can not contain products with any significant amount of essential oils as the oils will eat through most plastics.  What you will smell is a fragrance more akin to cheap soap such as Irish Spring or Dove; a scent far from relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using plain epsom salts over this product.</li>
            <li> Scent is a bit overpowering in the tub, but smells awesome afterwards for a while. I absolutely love Dr. Teals, so no complaints.</li>
            <li> This soaking solution smells great and worked wonders on my sore legs after biking twetny miles. The only drawback is, where is jus tplain old Epsom Salts? Can&#x27;t seem to find them anymore. I can add my own scents.</li>
            <li> This product is so wonderful, combined with Dr. Teal&#x27;s foaming bath and you have a very relaxing soak. The epsom salt really helps with sore muscles and I find it helps with my migraines....I love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! It is soothing and has a great clean fresh crisp scent. The only thing is it seems you do have to use quite a bit but it&#x27;s still an awesome product!</li>
            <li> My fav bath salts, good price on these as well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it smells good, the scent last the entire time at bath time, and is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> It is very refreshing and if put in an open jar or container, it can be used as an air freshener too.  But I can purchase it closer to home  for the same price</li>
            <li> I use this after a hard workout at the gym and I don&#x27;t get still muscles. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I use this in every bath. I mainly started using this because i read Epsom salt can help with back pain. It wont give long term relief and i wont tell you its a miracle cure cause its not. But it will give temporary relief with a nice scent as a bonus i love the feel of skin after bath.</li>
            <li> Wonderful aroma and soothing goodness. There is nothing like a good soak after a rough workout and this product delivers. The package seemed a little knocked around and would not reseal, but that was not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> Product helps ease my back and allow me to sleep without pain.  Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a great product</li>
            <li> I was gifted this a couple of years ago and now image sure to always stock it in my bathroom. I swear by it for muscle pain from workouts, snow shoveling and body aches related to illness. I really like this fragrance and wasn&#x27;t put off by it at all. I find the scent relaxing. I have very sensitive skin so I have to be careful what I out in my baths. I have not experienced any kind of irritation from using this product. I would highly recommend this as an effective, affordable way to ease aches and pains.</li>
            <li> Compared to buying locally this is a great deal. I have been using this as a foot soak and it works very well to soften my feet. I am adding some tea tree oil with it to help deal with a foot infection, and everything seems to be going well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the &amp;#34;zip lock&amp;#34; type seal does not work. It was packed full of salt so I tried digging it all out and got it to partially seal, but it is still open to allow air in. I had hoped I could squeeze air out then seal it to minimize exposure to humidity but that isn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> The product works well but the aroma is much better suited to the female gender. A bit overwhelming for the male gender. Strictly my opinion.</li>
            <li> Like the product but way over-priced......</li>
            <li> We purchased a new home this spring, after living in one home for 30 years. I finally have a wonderful soaking tub, and purchased this product to use in my new home. After working all day, then going to the old home to pack up more boxes, I would be tired to the bone.  Taking a long soaking bath in Dr. Teal&#x27;s Eucalyptus and Spearmint Epsom Salts, I felt relaxed, refreshed, slept like a baby and no sore muscles. WONDERFUL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The funny thing about this was the next morning when my husband came into the bathroom, he said \\&quot;What smells like men&#x27;s cologne?\\&quot; I said, \\&quot;I have no clue!\\&quot; It didn&#x27;t smell like that to me, but everyone perceives sent differently, so I had no idea what would smell like men&#x27;s cologne in my home. The next time I bathed, same thing. I held the bag of salts up to his nose, and said \\&quot;IS THIS WHAT YOU ARE SMELLING?\\&quot; He said \\&quot;Yes!\\&quot; I should have told him that I was hiding my boyfriend in the linen closet! :o) Anyway, I highly recommend this product for a nice Soak!</li>
            <li> Wonderful to just take a little time for myself with this wonderful bath product.  I use all the scents.  Love them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time this year working on the yard. I&#x27;ve put in a flower bed, planted three trees and 9 bushes. On top of that, I put in a 19&#x27;x11&#x27; sandset stone patio, digging up the area by hand - back-breaking work. I am also quite prone to mosquito bites, which have a hard time healing because I&#x27;m a bit allergic and tend to scratch them while asleep when they burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt Soaking Solution with Eucalyptus Spearmint and bought it originally to soak my overworked muscles after physical labor. They work marvelously for this purpose. I found that soaking in a tub with these Epsom salts immediately after such hard work helped alleviate much of the stiffness and soreness I might have felt the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, but the Epsom salts took the sting out of all the fresh mosquito bites I got working outside, so I was able to sleep without scratching them, allowing them to heal better. The Epsom salts aided in the healing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do believe that plain old-fashioned Epsom Salts would work well for all of these needs, but I have to say that the Eucalyptus Spearmint scent was lovely aromatherapy. I&#x27;ll not choose plain if I can have this scent. I have tried some of Dr. Teal&#x27;s other scents (Milk &amp; Honey, Lavender, Rosemary Mint) and the Eucalyptus Spearmint is my favorite by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried Walgreen&#x27;s generic brand of Eucalyptus Epsom Salts and was not as happy. Although they felt good and worked, there is something in that brand that leaves an oily film on my skin, where Dr. Teal&#x27;s leaves nothing behind but a hint of the eucalyptus and spearmint scents.</li>
            <li> It has a strong but pleasant smell. I mixed it with salt that does not have smell, works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This stuff melts away sore muscles and has a relaxing scent.</li>
            <li> Strong and powerful but a great scent!! And works great too</li>
            <li> I started using Dr.Teal&#x27;s lavender Epsom salts and fell in love. But after awhile I got tired of the lavender scent- I still use it but switch the scents up. I love bath and body works line of  stress relief eucalyptus and spearmint. The soaps and pillow sprays are amazing so I was excited when I found Dr. Teals eucalyptus salts. I put almost 2 cups in my bath, get my book and soak for 20-40 minutes 1-3 times a week. It relaxes and refreshes me, my aches from standing on my feet as a young nurse ease up, my skin is softer and it detoxes me. How do I know it detoxes me? I take a quick shower first with soap and shampoo my hair, then draw the bath with salts. You will see or feel a ring in the bath if toxins were pulled out by the magnesium properties in the salt. I always sleep better after a warm bath, but I sleep even better when using any of Dr. Teal&#x27;s salts. If you are worried about the salt price, mix 1 cup of dr teals and 1 cup of regular Epsom salt that is VERY cheap. A friend told me that trick and it works. It can get expensive when I buy several bags at a time, but it&#x27;s certainly cheaper than a spa day!</li>
            <li> Ugh, my throat is sore and scratchy from irritation.  My entire house absolutely reeks of chemicals.  I am returning this bag of product as soon as poossible.  Unlike the product description, this Epsom salt is NOT delicately fragranced with essential oils.  After Epsom salt, the first ingredient is &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;  followed by essential oils.  Artificial fragrance is loaded with petrochemicals that irritate the body as well as are known carcinogens. It is so strong and so artificial, it seems like someone emptied an entire can of Glade or Lysol in my bathroom.  The scent is so strong I can TASTE it!  And to think that they want one to soak in this chemical concoction and absorb it though the skin is abhorrent.  I ordered another bag without scent at all that has not yet arrived.  I hope that it is truly fragrance-free or it will be going back as well.  If I want fragrance, I will stick with adding  a few drops of my own essential oils.  I am not usually such an emotional reviewer but this product has really effected me and I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone else to suffer the same fate based on the glowing reviews.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed , this product has a lot of perfume in it. I thought I was buying eucalyptus and mint in a bag of Epson&#x27;s salt. This is full of perfume, smells like old men&#x27;s cologne.  It&#x27;s a great idea I just wish they made a natural product instead of artificial scents . I&#x27;ll stick with my plain salts.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried the Dr. Teal&#x27;s line of epsom salts until about a year ago, when I began having severe back issues. Warm water always helps, but the addition of these epsom salts to a hot bath is not only relaxing due to the aromatherapy nature of the ingredients, but also increases the effectiveness of a hot bath for my back and joint issues. While a hot bath or shower alone may help my back for a couple of hours, this extends that out-- sometimes to a full day with little or no pain.</li>
            <li> I wanted a good quality epsom salt to soak in when I am sore from running. This one seemed to fit the bill with eucalyptus which is supposed to have a gentle smell, but is still considered effective for massage purposes. The salt does a good job of soothing sore muscles, no doubt about that. However, the strong sort-of-cheap fragrance is simply overwhelming. I had read other people&#x27;s reviews in advance so I deliberately used much less than the recommended quantity (used only 1 small cup), even then the smell filled the bathroom and our bedroom. The dense smell lingered all night, smelt like a cheap salon inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag is meant to be resealable, but it&#x27;s really not. The zip-lock mechanism doesn&#x27;t really work because the salt gets stuck in between the grooves making it impossible for the two sides to lock in properly. Not really a big deal, I simply folded the bag from the top and pressed it against the wall so that the top part wouldn&#x27;t rise. This is good enough to keep water out from the bag, leaving the salt dry and good for subsequent uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this product but given the overwhelming smell, I will probably not be using it again. Hopefully I can find something better - effective but with a lighter fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love the price and free Prime shopping. These are the best salts and I&#x27;ve tried many others just for comparison. I always come back to this product. Salt baths are unbelievable to remove toxins and reduce inflammation. It&#x27;s a great gentle exfoliation and naturally hydrates. Dr. Teals is at the top of the top. And by far the best price per pound. Salts simply heal.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this scent of Epsom Salt.  It&#x27;s getting harder to find, which is a real bummer.</li>
            <li> When staying at a rental house on vacation, this was available and I took a soothing bath and recalled the name in order to find some for home. It is pricey but I think the best. I have tried Epsom salts plain then added essential oils to the bath but this is much better. Would be nice if a bit less pricey though</li>
            <li> I loved everything about it except the price. I remember getting it for much less at Walgreens some months ago.</li>
            <li> My husband does, too. He always comments that I smell wonderful after I&#x27;ve had a bath in the Eucalyptus Spearmint soaking solution. Feels wonderful on my aching muscles, as well.</li>
            <li> My most favorite Epsom salt!</li>
            <li> I am a 51 yr old woman who is going thru menopause- I take a hot bath w Epsom salts daily for the relaxing, restortive \\&quot; feel\\&quot; .My ritual baths help me feel better and sleep better, I discovered Epsom salts only last year and it truly helps aching muscles!!!i can tell the difference whether I add it or not- this being said I buy \\&quot; regular\\&quot; unscented most Lo the time bc of price and weight but this brand I buy all scents, most people review the lavender nighttime sleepy one.Personally it doesn&#x27;t make me drowsy at all! This scent is amazingly clean!! It&#x27;s hands down my favorite and hard to find in Wal mart.I highly recommend this one! Epsom salts have tons of other uses, too- read up on it!&lt;br /&gt;I put a bit in warm water and dip my doggies paws  It after a walk to prevent itching bt their little \\&quot; toes\\&quot; it works wonders- Epsom salts can be made into a \\&quot; poultice\\&quot; for strains, etc. ( btw , I don&#x27;t sell reviews or have any \\&quot; interst I  this or any other product I review- I only review things I like enormously)</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I&#x27;ve purchased it from Amazon many times, however will not pay inflated price.&lt;br /&gt; price comparison for Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt, Eucalyptus Spearmint soaking solution.&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Teal&#x27;s 48 oz or 3 lb. package on Amazon Prime is $13.99 vs. Walmart Dr. Teal&#x27;s 48 oz. or 3 lb. packages for $4.87.  shipping is free with both and you can pick it up same day with Walmart Site to Store.</li>
            <li> The price went up way too much. I can&#x27;t even fathom paying this amount for a 3lb bag. I used to order it when it was under $7-$8 and I would order 6 bags at a time. I don&#x27;t think this was the specific vendor, but it has to be cheaper elsewhere. I&#x27;m back to ordering the basic Epsom salt now. 10lb bucket for a little more than 3lbs of this.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soaking solution!  The smell is amazing and I feel so relaxed after.  But buy from Walmart! It is only 4.87 there.</li>
            <li> Used this after a half marathon and it really took away the aches and pains!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite bath salt that I have come across in the market. I am a big bath taker, probably once a night or ever other night as it allows. Nothing relaxes me more than the Dr. Teal&#x27;s Eucalyptus Spearmint bath salt at the end of a long day. I take a small dixie cup (the bathroom sized ones) and fill it with the epsom salt and pour it right into the spout of running water. One cup full is all you need to make the bath feel amazing. The Dr. Teal&#x27;s website has coupons for $1 off if you sign up for their mailing list. This stuff sells out fast compared to the other Dr. Teal&#x27;s scented bath salts I have noticed. I usually buy 4 bags at a time (Target or WalMart are roughly the same price) and try to avoid missing out!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get past the perfume smell.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first bag at a local retail store and used it in the bath, Ladies I can not use bubble bath so this is very different. Plan on a long soak in the tub the aroma and the way your skin and body feels after a soak with this product will make you a believer, you will be hooked.</li>
            <li> Help heal after a long work day!!!</li>
            <li> This was ok, I like it!!!</li>
            <li> I work as a handyman and my feet tend to hurt cause of it. I brought the salt of Dr. Teal&#x27;s... and have used it for 3 nights in a row and my pain was gone after just the 3 nights and the aroma was great as well. I will continue to buy it so long as they keep producing the salt. Thank you, Dr. Teal for making your product..... our product...... Angel, from New York.</li>
            <li> Feels so good after soaking, you don&#x27;t need lotion. Smells good, and is very soft.</li>
            <li> I broke my arm and started using this in my bath, alternating with Dr. Teal&#x27;s Rosemary and Mint formulation. As far as I am concerned both formulations are great and enhance the effectiveness of Epsom Salts. However, I recently just used this as a foot bath after being on my feet for several hours. Wow, this was great and far better than the product I&#x27;ve used forever. I tossed on soft white socks, went to bed, and felt great in the a.m.&lt;br /&gt;Last week my son came over with tired, blistered feet. I gave him an extra bag of Dr. Teal&#x27;s and told him to soak his feet when he got home for 20-30 minutes and go to bed. He is a believer now and happy I introduced him to the &amp;#34;Dr.&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t give any guarantees, but this really works for me and seems to be especially nice when soaking in the tub.</li>
            <li> I happen to be very sensitive to overpowering fragrances and often have to use fragrance free versions of most things.  These bath salts definitely have the mint and eucalyptus scents, but they are subtle and relaxing not the usual attack on the senses.  Thank goodness someone out there understands more is not always better where fragrance is concerned.</li>
            <li> These are very affordable and make your feet feel better.  It smells very therapeutic, which I like.  You can&#x27;t make this homemade for less.</li>
            <li> So soothing and smells great. Will place another order soon. The menthol has a warm calming effect on my body, feet &amp; hands. It opens my nose up and I can breath with ease at night and after an hour or so let the water out after it cools and the house smells so good and calming while we sleep, since I started using this several years ago my allergies are so much better.</li>
            <li> The scent gives your bath a much more relaxing ambiance.</li>
            <li> Did allot of research before leaping to use in our $12k hot tub...very hesitant.  It is NOT salt, however still hesitant. So...took the leap and have been using it several times a month with no apparent damage for about six months. It doesn&#x27;t change the ph so no added maintenance.  OK...  does it fix my joint pain?  With RA and other issues, I can say definitively no at the amounts that I use (1 cup in my 400 gal) tub.  BUT...hear this... It smells heavenly, beyond reasonable price and smells better than any of the redicuously priced beads and other products at the pool supply store! It takes me away and takes my mind off my pain for the 20 min I&#x27;m in the tub!!!</li>
            <li> This is the way to make a long day end peacefully - a hot soak in a relaxing tub of Epsom salts.  It soothes the body and revives the soul.  Dr. Teal&#x27;s Eucalyptus Spearmint is designed to provide relaxation, and it does.  The only downside is that you don&#x27;t want the bath to end.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time and as described-Thanks!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. it&#x27;s great for sore muscles/headaches...BUT I am NOT happy that 2 days after purchasing this item on amazon for almost $12, I see it on the shelf at my local walmart for less than $5. I guess it&#x27;s my fault for not shopping around, but really?</li>
            <li> I can buy the same size bag at Target for $4.99</li>
            <li> I have been recovering from a car accident - thankfully no major injuries, but if you know, which I hope you don&#x27;t for your sake, excruciating muscle and even bone aches for 2 weeks or more after the impact. Well, I have been taking hot baths religiously - 1 to 2 per day and using Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt soaking solution with Eucalyptus and I am blown away by the magical healing effects of these salts. The reason this review is not a verified purchase is that I couldn&#x27;t wait to have my salts so I picked them up at a local store, but I&#x27;ll be getting more tomorrow - probably lavender and this same Eucalyptus again. And I had to give them a glowing review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of these bath salts is soothing, luxurious, and lasting. I can smell it on my skin afterwards (if I don&#x27;t follow with a shower).&lt;br /&gt;The price is extremely reasonable. It was under $5 at Walmart or wherever I picked it up.&lt;br /&gt;The container did not come with a scooper so I used one of my own. I used 4 to 5 large scoops for each bath and soaked about 30 to 45 minutes each time. Sometimes I&#x27;d turn on my jets, sometimes just soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would go into the bath with aches and pains and strange sensations - thanks to my car wreck - and emerge healed and pain-free and fell into a beautiful sleep. I did this 12 times and I can say without a doubt that these bath salts are a healing miracle!!! Hope this helped you and hey, take more bath salts in the winter. Your body will love you for it!</li>
            <li> I bought mine at Walmart for $4.47. AFter a hard and tiring workout, I enjoy my nightly bath with Dr. Teals Epsom Salts. Helps with the sore muscles and fatigue. The scents are very pleasing and help me to relax....     The only thing I do not like is that it takes 2 cups per bath, so there is only enough in teh bag for about 3 and a half baths..</li>
            <li> Soothing to the muscles and smells good as well!</li>
            <li> This soaking solution was pretty good, but not the best.  It lost its aroma fairly quickly, which was quite a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Holy crap go buy it locally and save some money.  Do not buy at this price!  I need a more words...</li>
            <li> I love this product because of the therapeutic qualities and the smell is very nice, not overwhelming.  I use it several times a week.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like some other soaking solutions.</li>
            <li> This is a helpful product for soothing your aches and pains and helping ensure a good nights sleep. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> I was very wary of using this product after reading the negative reviews, but decided to give it a try (2 cups as recommended, with the plan to go down to 1 cup plus 1 cup of cheap, plain Epsom salt if the smell was too strong).  Using it as recommended, I found I really liked it.  The smell was strong at first, but I acclimated to it and found myself really enjoying it.  Just took a 40 minute bath and feel very relaxed now.  Now I definitely want to try the other scents in this line too.</li>
            <li> I love to soak my feet in Dr. Teal&#x27;s epsom salt prior to doing my pedicure. It softens my feet and the scent of eucalyptus spearmint is very soothing.</li>
            <li> I loved item!&lt;br /&gt;It is a little bit bigger and cheaper than the product for the same price at Walmart! I enjoyed free shipping!</li>
            <li> I am 34 weeks pregnant and have used both this stuff and relief md salts. The smell was nice for Dr. Teals which I also purchased at walmart for around 5 bucks. However, relief md was MUCH more effective at relaxing my muscles. I would recommend relief md if you want something to relax you and not just scented salts.</li>
            <li> I got this as a free sample from Smiley 360  and love it!!  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING! After workouts or long days at work I truly enjoy soaking in a nice bubble bath where I also add this product! The eucalyptus scent is not overwhelming, it actually smells really good! I love how my body responds to this salt - my muscles relax very nicely in matter of minutes and my skin is glowing afterwards. I highly recommend this product whether you are an athlete or hard worker who needs that muscle relaxing soak now and then. This is the best salt out there!</li>
            <li> Not an easy item to find in store and the amount was much more than expected. Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> To Women of All Kind (Even Men):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning this review may seem like too much information (regarding a health condition) so please take caution before reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY THIS PRODUCT FOR ME: I bought this product after reading blogs regarding a vaginal issue I was dealing with. I diagnosed myself with having bartholin cyst. It&#x27;s a condition caused by swelling of a bartholin gland that secretes lubricant fluids inside the labia minora. This gland is located on either side inside the labia minor. For some reason showering every so often was not cleansing my body the way it should have been, and my bartholin gland got blocked/infected/or whatever. I&#x27;m no doctor (yet applying to medical school soon though :-), but in reading and comparing the severity of my situation with those who had to see a medical professional, I decided to try a home remedy method first (and to save money). The size of my cyst was comparable to a grape. It did not cause me discomfort and pain, but it was an alarming site to see when your vagina looks distorted due to swelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY THS PRODUCT FOR CLEANSING: Salt is a hostile environment for many common external pathogens (germs) that live outside of our body. When you had a tooth infection and your gums were swollen do you remember washing with salt water? Salt kills many infectious bacteria that cannot survive, and is a perfect remedy for mild or temporary external bodily issues we can come across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW DID I USE THE PRODUCT: Once a day (or twice: once in morning and once at night) I poured ~1cup of the Dr. Teal salt into my hot bath water (amount of water doesn&#x27;t matter I filled up to my hips or up to my ribcage....doesn&#x27;t matter as long as my vagina was immersed in the water). In addition I used bubble bath soap to make sitting in the tub relaxing (and the more cleansing products the better...don&#x27;t over do it though as it can be a waste if you&#x27;re reading too much into this). So I combined what soap I would normally use and added the salt, and the salt does a great job dissolving as the crystals are very small. I soaked for about 30mins-1hr or until my feet look shriveled (this is an indicator that my skin has soaked the salt water....my cyst has salt water in it to kill the infection). In addition I used my fingers to open/massage the folds and creases in my vagina to make sure water traveled everywhere and then cleaned myself with a washrag while bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS: The swelling grape-like cyst is gone!!! It still looks like I should continue for an additional week my bath-salt ritual to make sure no traces of infection exists, but the bubble inside my vagina has disappeared.  I am super happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SMELL: The salt smells like light cologne for men (it&#x27;s strong though in intensity), but the scent lightens up on your skin so you can wear perfume and whatnot without feeling overpowered by the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY I RECOMMEND BATH SALTS FOR ALL: We all have sexual organs that have creases and folds we can miss while cleansing. Baths should be taken at least 1 a week with this salt to guarantee we are making sure germs don&#x27;t linger on our skin. You can use my review as an example when you don&#x27;t properly clean yourself. This product is a preventative of the many skin conditions out there so start using it!</li>
            <li> This Product is so great. I took a bath and after I went to bed I was knocked out I don&#x27;t know what it did but I slept like a baby. I recommend this to everyone. I got my product for free at smiley360.com for just a review on the product and I give my honest opinion 100% mine. I Got a 3 pound bag. and did I mention it was for free!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;user- Savannah sergio</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I love this bath salt. It smells heavenly and both myself and my husband use it on a regular basis. We use it in our toddler sons bath when he has a cold and it helps clear his sinuses.</li>
            <li> The older bag used to just have a ziplock type closure which did not work in keeping the bag closed. Now, improved packaging has a velcro type closure thus its resealable. Love it. And if course quality and scent of Dr Teal&#x27;s is great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done my research/reading on what&#x27;s better for eczema treatment (I&#x27;ve had it for years), so I decided to go and pick up one of these bad boys from the local Walgreens (save time and money, it&#x27;s only about 5$ at your local store).  Before entering my first bath with this, I had a killer migraine and was sore as can be from an intensive work week and stressin&#x27; with school, and after a 40 minute bath with this stuff the migraine was nearly nonexistent, my body was completely relaxed, and this stuff does wonders for my eczema.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the bag&#x27;s &amp;#34;sealing&amp;#34; feature is very faulty, nothing a rubber band or a clip of some sort can&#x27;t fix, and I personally like the smell. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> This scent is an all time favorite.  I must have on hand just in case I need to soak, very nice herb and mint scent. This one is not to feminine, he will use it as well.</li>
            <li> Wow, was I impressed with this soaking solution! I received some as part of a gift bag and was shocked I hadn&#x27;t heard recommendations to use it before! The scent is so relaxing and soothing and after shoveling snow all day the benefits of soaking in a tub of Dr. Teal&#x27;s was amazing. All my sore aching muscles were soothed, my skin was soft as silk, and the aromatherapy provided a wonderful experience! Coudn&#x27;t recommend this more!</li>
            <li> My wife loved it.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great.</li>
            <li> There was a Band-Aid inside the package. Gross.</li>
            <li> Love LOVE love this product!</li>
            <li> Keep buying these over and over again.  Great deal!</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells! It is so relaxing! I bought four bags because I love it so much!</li>
            <li> Unlike some reviewers, I did not find the spearmint epsom salts overpowering; however, I only used about one-half cup in a foot soaking tub.  Although I have used epsom salts for decades, this is my first experience using Dr. Teal&#x27;s and I would recommend the epsom salt solution and I will most certainly will purchase The Dr. Teal&#x27;s variety of soaking solutions again.</li>
            <li> I love this product but not THIS price. Jet tub baths are one of my favorite leisure activities.....every night before bedtime. I have tried many salts/bubble baths. This is one of the best but price is totally unfair. I ordered it thinking it was a larger size.....didn&#x27;t check.....my fault. When it arrived it was the same size as the one I buy at Walmart for less than $5.00.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample from smiley 360. I tried it 3x a week in a warm bath. It helped me relax and I also slept better. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product and I&#x27;m ordering it!!!!</li>
            <li> The best price for sea salts are always on amazon. You get a big bag for almost nothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a few Dr. Teal&#x27;s products from my local Walgreen&#x27;s, so I was excited to try the Eucalyptus Spearmint Epsom Salt Soaking Solution.  The item was affordably priced on Amazon, so I made my purchase (along with some of the other scents).  When the package arrived 1 week later, unfortunately, this bag of epsom salts had broken inside the shipment box.  I unpacked the rest of the items from the box and then dumped the loose salts into a bath.  I&#x27;m bummed that I didn&#x27;t get the spa experience I had hoped for with this product.  The scent of the eucalyptus and spearmint was synthetic and the epsom salts burned into blemishes and tiny nicks on my skin like salt to a wound.  I&#x27;ve never experienced burning with non-branded, non-scented epsom salts.  It leads me to wonder if this is not in fact authentic epsom salt, but rather scented table salt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this one and the Rosemary and Mint one. I like this one (Eucalyptus and Spearmint) more. It&#x27;s nice for when your muscles are sore and smells good to inhale too.  I play tennis and am a FT working mom, so this is a nice treat. My only complaint is when I ordered some, I paid about $12 for a 3 lb bag.  The same bag was on sale at Fred Meyers for $7. Actually, every time I&#x27;ve purchased a bag from Freddy&#x27;s it&#x27;s been on sale. So shop around for prices if that&#x27;s a concern of yours.</li>
            <li> I put this product in bath water and the smell was so over powering even with a small amount, I had to drain it out of the tub and put the fan on to clear out the smell.  I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> My wife loves soaking in the tub with these salts. Amazon has them for the best price we can find (although it does fluctuate from time to time...buy low, sell high!). The scent is strong, but not overpowering..:always leaves our bathroom  and nearby hallway smelling like a nice spa :-)</li>
            <li> I love to use epsom salt after working out or to soak during the winter and used to put oils in with it. now this has both and it smells great. it really helps to relax my muscles and clears up various skin issues or other irritations. also helps me sleep well.</li>
            <li> These epsom salts have WAY too strong of a fake chemical perfume scent. I know other reviews had warned against this, but I reasoned that it couldn&#x27;t be that bad. It&#x27;s pretty off-putting. I&#x27;m keeping them and will still use them, but I can&#x27;t help but feel like I&#x27;m getting cancer from the fumes these epsom salts emit. I would not recommend them, next time I&#x27;m getting plain old unscented epsom salts and will add my own essential oils.</li>
            <li> Reason why I gave this one only 3 stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have smelled eucalyptus before, and different types in essential oils, as well as spearmint, I grew up around its uses. Honestly, this smelled NOTHING like either of the two or the two together. No big deal though if you&#x27;re simply looking for a pleasant scent and not the benefits of the above mentioned. Eucalyptus and Spearmint have their benefits even if in an aromatherapy type way (hence a bath with the true oil/scent is one variation). Point is, I&#x27;d like to know what I am buying, is actually what they say it is. And...eh...it&#x27;s not. Disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s Epsom salts, what can I say: Epsom is great!</li>
            <li> There is no scientific evidence to support Epsom Salt relieving muscle pain or speeding healing. Before you buy, please read the full following articles:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RunnersConnect Website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are Epsom Salt Baths an Effective Treatment for Running Injuries? by John Davis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Conclusion...Barring future research, it&#x27;s very hard to justify an Epsom salt bath over a traditional ice bath or hot water bath for treating an injury. Though Epsom salt is dirt-cheap, no research supports any direct effect on injury recovery, and none of the theories forwarded about how Epsom salt might help in indirect ways hold up to any scrutiny either.&amp;#34; -- John Davis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PainScience Website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do Epsom Salts Work? by Paul Ingraham&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;My search for scientific evidence concerning Epsom salt baths was disappointing. I was unable to find even a single scientific paper studying their effect on body pain. Folk remedies are often generally neglected by researchers, but not usually so completely.&amp;#34; -- Paul Ingraham</li>
            <li> I loved it but it didn&#x27;t last long! It only lasted me a few baths and I was very disappointed about how quickly it ran out. Other than that, I loved it and whenever I have money to spare, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff was great it made for a great bath experience. You don&#x27;t need to much of either, so it can go a long way. I suggest be careful when pouring so you dont use too much of it.</li>
            <li> My wife and I like epsom salts baths.  Since they were out of plain epsom salts I bought this.  Eucalyptus, I like, Spearmint, I like.  Unfortunately this stuff doesn&#x27;t really smell like either of those natural ingredients.  It smells like (fragrance) which is the number two ingredient.  Think laundry soap or fabric softener.  If you like natural scents this is not for you.</li>
            <li> Nice salt for the bath.  It has a very strong smell, but I like it.  If you not big on eucalyptus, do not get this.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  Love it!  It can be purchased at Walmart and Target for under $5.</li>
            <li> I first picked this up in Walmart--it was the last one on the shelf.  I loved it so much, it sucked all my worries away within 10 minutes of soaking.  This is a must have to unwind on any stressful day.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell like eucalyptus or spearmint, just cheap perfume. It made me itchy and sneezy. In the future, I will buy plain epsom salts and essential oils and concoct my own.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It smells wonderful, is relaxing, and you get the exposure to the epsom salts through using it in the bath.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone wanting to have a relaxing and therapeutic soak after a hard workout, long day, or just being stressed out should consider this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for my baby since she was born and I swear by it. It seems to me she sleeps better and feels better. Now that shes a toddler the bumps and bruises of falling are nicely soaked away in a soothing scented epsom salt bath. Love it.</li>
            <li> This product is great. It smells nice, but I would like more spearmint. Your bath will smell like a spa, light your candles and relax.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff alot.  It was a bit expensive and we went through it pretty fast.  I did end up finding some at the local drug store for 1/4 of the price and it is just as good!  So i won&#x27;t be buying this again</li>
            <li> I love this bath salt! It helps you to unwind after a stressful day! I store mine in a glass jar and scoop some out into my bath when I need it! Makes your skin feel soft and your mind relaxed! If you&#x27;ve ever tried the Bath &amp; Body Works Stress Relief line, it smells just like that! So nice!</li>
            <li> Refreshing yet relaxing! Helped my foot recover after a stingray punctured me. I&#x27;m not advocating that as treatment, but it helped soothe the excruciating pain I felt. Plus everyone in my house kept commenting on the amazing scent of the eucalyptus and spearmint wafting throughout my house as I soaked my poor foot.</li>
            <li> MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM this smells SOOOOO good. It&#x27;s another good after gym or post-work soak. It&#x27;s a difficult decision between this and my other dr teals scents, BUT dr teal&#x27;s is always good product. They never disappoint me!!!!</li>
            <li> It has a very overpowering scent. I personally can&#x27;t handle it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  And while I also love Amazon, I must tell you that you can order it and all the other Dr.Teal&#x27;s products online from Wal-Mart for about $4.50.  Same size.  You get free shipping with any order of $50 or more.  Ouch!  Sorry, Amazon!</li>
            <li> Maybe I am a cheap perfume type of girl but I think it smells aaaaaaahmazing!!! Left my skin soft and helped my sore muscles after a tough workout!!!!</li>
            <li> You deserve a nice soak!  This is the best smelling, most relaxing soak you could ever want.  We all get stressed out during the week....so set sometime aside, grab the Dr. Teal&#x27;s and RELAX</li>
            <li> Who could not love this stuff, I bought four different scented salts and the bubble bath.  I use to buy it at Walgreens or Walmart, but it is cheaper on line and they have a lot more options.  I love this stuff and place the salts in a bowl by the tub and they also fragrance the room.</li>
            <li> Great lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  I use it with a foot soaking tub and it both feels and smells amazing.  Good value for the money, too.  I would recommend this to anyone - excellent find.</li>
            <li> Perfect for relaxing.. Smells great</li>
            <li> Dr. Teal&#x27;s scented epsom salt is amazing.  It smells so good and it&#x27;s the perfect thing after a long day.</li>
            <li> After workout heavenly bath</li>
            <li> One of the things my cranky old joints enjoy is a good soak in the Jacuzzi tub.  I started using Dr. Teal&#x27;s and have found it to be a fine product at what I think is a fair price.  I like the eucalyptus aroma.  Clears the senses, relaxes the mind.  I&#x27;m a steady customer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice way to pamper yourself to get smooth feeling skin. You just need to use at least 2 cups in the bath to get the full treatment.</li>
            <li> Way too fragrant, with unpleasant undertones. I was hoping for something herbal, and I&#x27;ve used scented bathsalts in the past, but this is a smack-you-in-the-head scent. Kind of makes me itch.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and how it feels.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mum, she has cancer , she loves soaking in this to alleviate the pain.</li>
            <li> Love the lavender fragrance and the salts dissolve quickly in the bath; muscles and mind both relax: great before bed.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my room smell after using it. I would definitely recommend for anyone into aroma therapy or just needs a good soaking.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved soaking in these salts! The scent was amazing and very relaxing! I was concerned when I got the bag that I bought too much but am now convinced I did not buy enough!</li>
            <li> OMG,  I know Epsom salts have always been used for medicinal purposes but this was a wonderful experience,  unlike any other. I felt the healing power immediately,  it was so calming.  I will never use regular epsom salts again.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of these epsom salts. This is a relaxing soak for tired or sore muscles that also soothes the brain using aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> ...unless you enjoy the overwhelmingly pungent smell of cheap cologne.&lt;br /&gt;I used half the recommended amount, but had to stop after five minutes because the added \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; gave me headaches and nausea.  I literally had to wash my skin with natural soap to get the smell off me.  Also I cannot smell any eucalyptus or spearmint because the added fragrance is so overwhelming.  The manufacturers of this product managed to turn a beneficial mineral into a toxic concoction.  I would highly discourage anyone from buying this product (or any other Dr Teal&#x27;s epsom salt solutions with added fragrance) especially if you enjoy a non-toxic lifestyle, as \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; has hundreds of toxic compounds that do not need to be listed according to the fda.</li>
            <li> The are few things better than taking a nice scented bath at end of day.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this and enjoy, relax and get soft skin too!</li>
            <li> LOVE this. The aroma fills the room, and imbues good feeling all around. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> While a bath with these salts certainly helped me with some aching bones, I&#x27;ve had better results with the more generic and less expensive epsom salts.  I did appreciate the soothing scent, however.</li>
