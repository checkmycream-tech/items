It is difficult for me to give any product a 5----------so do not use my giving a 4 a means not to buy it.</li>
            <li> My husband has always preferred this cologne. So this is the best way to buy it, in such a big bottle. It came in the mail very quickly too.</li>

            <li> I bought this very large Joop for my husband at about the same price of a bottle 1/2 the size would cost at Ulta</li>
            <li> I used to wear this before I met my wife and it attracted her to me.  Now - when I wear it, it&#x27;s like she&#x27;s cheating on me with me ... go figure!  Thanks Joop ... you keep me smelling like a man whore - I love it!  Alternate between this and Obsession, and it&#x27;s like spanish fly on crack.  Ladies are like ... &#x27;oooh, you smell so good&#x27; and that when I say ... &#x27;if you like the way it smells, wait until you ...&#x27;</li>
            <li> The real thing, lasts all day, I love this scent!!</li>
            <li> Purchased as a Christmas gift for my Joop loving husband. He loved it! LARGE bottle. Great scent. Both my 52 year old husband and my 17 year old son love it.</li>
            <li> I love it and people around me seem to also since I find some inhaling while around me in a strong way and getting closer to me while doing it (no kidding)</li>
            <li> Really love the size that you get for that price, will be buying another as a early Christmas gift this year.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Had a coworker tell me she liked this scent so i bought it on a whim.  Have had a lot of compliments since.</li>
