            <li>primer color is more vivid but still a bit tricky to blend.</li>
            <li>Loved the color long lasting great for cosplay and regular wear.</li>
            <li>I probably would have liked it better, but 2 of the colors were broken, and it took a while to clean it.</li>
            <li>the semi hard plastic over the shadow boxes was a great idea.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented, and just the variety I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Colors are vibrant and bold.</li>
            <li>you would be better off getting a coastal scents or bh cosmetics eyeshadow palettes for about the same price.</li>
            <li>The seller shipped fast &amp; pricing is well worth it</li>

            <li>Highly recommendðŸ˜Ž</li>
            <li>one color came crushed, it was fine</li>
            <li>my 4 yr old niece always wants to play with my make up and this is a palette i won&#x27;t mind her reaching</li>

            <li>PURCHASE IS COMPLETELY UP TO YOU</li>
            <li>item arrived right on the day it was expected.</li>
            <li>first off you don&#x27;t really get 63 different colors, theres a few repeated colors in the palette.</li>
            <li>I originally got this because I only have a few matte shadows</li>
            <li>i tried both natural and synthetic brushes and had the same result.</li>
            <li>but I would not purchase this palette again due to the shadow not being strong enough or lasting long like I expected.</li>
            <li>(comes in a very cool booklet like case with magnets that keep the book held together) and only a couple of the colors had small chips missing.</li>

            <li> The shadows are also ugh larger than expected and should last a while.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to recieve the package only to find half of the colors were broken</li>
            <li> PALETTE IS BIGGER THAN EXPECTED.  </li>
            <li> They are pretty small but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this product 4 stars is due to the packaging.</li>
            <li> .. rate it one start just for the blue and green colors, the colors are not pigmented at all, the size is so big, already give it to my daughter to play with it.</li>
            <li> This pallet is TOTALLY pigmeneted with little to no fall out.</li>
            <li> So, it turns out that one of the shadows was crushed during shipping.</li>
            <li> Today, I have on a pink and purple eye.</li>
            <li> The designs are endless.</li>
            <li> the plus side, the all of the other shadows were  in place.</li>
            <li> If you want true matte shades and a bunch of variety, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product!</li>
            <li> On the down side one of my colors were missing.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented but I like the look with a eye shadow base first colors do not rub off with base first.</li>
            <li> so the pallet alone is amazing just wish mines didn&#x27;t get all broken up :-(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably give the one I have to my little sister.</li>
            <li> the only hard thing is...choosing a color...!!</li>
            <li> You can buy a palette from one of those well-known brands and you pay $45 for a random assortment of glitters and shimmers with maybe one or two mattes and you only get about a dozen of those shades.</li>
            <li> when using primer id definitely use a white base.</li>
            <li> had a hard time blending out the color, as id</li>
            <li> A few of the colors arrived broken.</li>
            <li> Expect at least one color to be broken during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are quite chalky and dusty.</li>
            <li> This came in the mail as expected,and when I opened it, nothing was broken</li>
            <li> had 3 colors broken.</li>
            <li> None of the shadows were broken.</li>
            <li> I was so afraid that the colors were broken inside.  </li>
            <li> but i was deeply disappointed to see upon receiving it</li>
            <li> (i hate shiny and glitter eye shadows).</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>

            <li> the love, are the best eye shadows I&#x27;ve had, perfect paint, paint pretty, the colors are beautiful, I am delighted with my new toy, are perfect and the price is amazing, has all the necessary colors will not be disappointed ...</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE PRODUCT.  PALETTE IS BIGGER THAN EXPECTED.  COLOURS ARE BRIGHT, VERY EASY TO APPLY.  I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!!</li>
            <li> Great colors, arrived nicely. Awesome new palette</li>
            <li> Delivered in good condition. Nice colors to look at. I like a good heavy pigment. These are quite chalky and dusty.</li>
            <li> Honestly for the price you are paying this is a great buy. The colors are super vibrant, they last a fairly long time, and they are truly matte. Ive bought several eye shadows claiming to be matte but they always had a sparkle to them. Not this product! Arrived on time, not damaged at all.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this product 4 stars is due to the packaging. A couple of shadows broke and got all over the place. But the quality of the shadows and the color payoff are amazing. The shadows are also ugh larger than expected and should last a while. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This came in the mail as expected,and when I opened it, nothing was broken (I think the condition depends on how it&#x27;s handled while being shipped). I tried a few of the neutral shadows and the brighter colors on my palms, and they were really pigmented. I would definitely recommend this to someone who wants a quality all matte eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li> This pallette is amazing. I love the colors, they are extremely pigmented.I appreciate the longwear aspect of these also. The product came well packaged and timely. Would like to  see more palettes offered</li>
            <li> look quite different and also the pictures aren&#x27;t matte at all!</li>
            <li> The colors are very pretty however they aren&#x27;t the greatest quality. If you are looking for something to last all day I would look elsewhere. Expect at least one color to be broken during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again? No. I&#x27;ll probably give the one I have to my little sister.</li>
            <li> Cute i love the colors and lloks exactly like the picture also played in some of the colors goes on nicely not exactly matte but goes on better than powder</li>
            <li> Super pigmented colours, amazing for bright, artistic makeup. Comparable to (and in the case of some shades, better than) sugarpill. Highly reccomend.</li>
            <li> For this price its a excellent product. Very pigmented, the color selection is balanced with neutrals and bright colors. All are matte!! (i hate shiny and glitter eye shadows). is a cardboard case that closes with magnets, inside are protected in foam, not  plastic!&lt;br /&gt;it very light and secure to carry everywhere.</li>
            <li> All I can say is...it&#x27;s easy to just pull it out and apply...the only hard thing is...choosing a color...!! Lol I love it...so many choices...!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful colors, very pigmented, the palette arrived in perfect conditions , I&#x27;m so happy I bought his product.</li>
            <li> The palette came on time with delivery but I would not purchase this palette again due to the shadow not being strong enough or lasting long like I expected.</li>
            <li> Really pretty colors loved it</li>
            <li> This is tha bomb eye-shadow..... The colors are very bold n very pretty.... Highly recommendðŸ˜Ž</li>
            <li> The colors were beautiful it didn&#x27;t come with the book to help you get color ideas for your shadow.</li>
            <li> I love this palette! Great pigment and it applies smoothly</li>
            <li> I thought it was two separate pallets as seen on the pic but its mainly a big book pallet. It has a very nice selection of colors but i was deeply disappointed to see upon receiving it had 3 colors broken. I did have an expectation to get what i had paid for. Besides that issue it is a very cute pallet</li>
            <li> Was in quick but item was damaged.</li>
            <li> I use this on reborn dolls for shading not on myself. It works great!</li>
            <li> Some of the colors are pigmented in this pallet however I will say that I used one of the purple Matte before using my urban decay shimmer backfire color on it.. It looked gorgeous...Will buy again..</li>
            <li> I love it , thank you</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t give it a one star neither will I give it a 5 star. The shadows they looks nice in the box but for me they are a bit too powdery. They fall off is intense..I am definitely not a fan of it... But it was a good lesson to be learned.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, rich pigments. Very blendable colors and a nice addition to my collection at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Beautiful bright colors.  When I opened it I thought the case was covered with a design that looked like eyeshadow splotches.  After taking off the plastic, I realized that it was actual eyeshadow.  I was so afraid that the colors were broken inside.  However I opened the case (comes in a very cool booklet like case with magnets that keep the book held together) and only a couple of the colors had small chips missing. Sigh of relief!</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted to give this 5 stars because the colors are beautiful, I purchased this with the eyeliners as well (which are amazing btw) I was so excited to recieve the package only to find half of the colors were broken I don&#x27;t blame the seller it may have just been handled improperly but again the colors show up great so the pallet alone is amazing just wish mines didn&#x27;t get all broken up :-(</li>
            <li> one color came crushed, it was fine cause it was the white that I wouldn&#x27;t have used anyway.</li>
            <li> I love the colors! I&#x27;ve had issues getting them to not crease in my eyelid though.</li>
            <li> I probably would have liked it better, but 2 of the colors were broken, and it took a while to clean it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and bright colors! Very pigmented, and just the variety I was looking for!</li>
            <li> These eye shadows are  amazing. Colors are vibrant and bold. The designs are endless. Packaging was well protected and arrived on time.The quality of the matte colors lasts all day I would suggest buying the eye liners as well (,italia eye liners set of 12 and italia  lip liners)</li>
            <li> was excited to get a matte eyeshadow palette, 63 colors!! awesome!!....... thats what i thought. i like collecting makeup and, like finding good products that are not talked about to try out and see if they&#x27;re being missed. i like the lip and eyeliners from this brand so I&#x27;m like &amp;#34;yea imma give this palette a try&amp;#34;...........not  happy! first off you don&#x27;t really get 63 different colors, theres a few repeated colors in the palette. some colors feel a bit smoother than most but still chalky. had a hard time blending out the color, as id blend color would disappear without primer mind you i packed the color on the brush. primer color is more vivid but still a bit tricky to blend. i tried both natural and synthetic brushes and had the same result. when using primer id definitely use a white base. you would be better off getting a coastal scents or bh cosmetics eyeshadow palettes for about the same price. my 4 yr old niece always wants to play with my make up and this is a palette i won&#x27;t mind her reaching for.&lt;br /&gt;THIS PURCHASE IS COMPLETELY UP TO YOU IF YOU if you want to try it out for your self, but I gave my opinions and suggestions.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this, I can&#x27;t wear shimmer shadows and that is all I find. Now I can go with any color I choose. It&#x27;s a great pallet.</li>
            <li> Colors are very well pigmented. On the down side one of my colors were missing.</li>
            <li> I just got my package today and I&#x27;m very happy and pleased with the product and the delivery time. Thank you and I&#x27;m looking forward to doing more business with your company... Joyce</li>
            <li> Im absolutely in love with this pallet. I was looking for something cheap but yet reliable..and here it is! This pallet is TOTALLY pigmeneted with little to no fall out. The colors blend like a dream &amp; easy to work with from beginners to pro&#x27;s. The seller shipped fast &amp; pricing is well worth it</li>
            <li> Nice color selection. All 63 are matte. Deposits color well and last all day.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! JUST WHAT I WANTED! The package was perfect and size is perfect too. The colors are beautiful and the pigmentation is very good.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice and pigmented. They blend nicely</li>
            <li> it was delivered three days after i ordered it!! the colors are awesome and it was exactly what i was looking for!! thank you!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this palette!!!</li>
            <li> Colors colors lots of fun colors!</li>
            <li> Love love..I didn&#x27;t get to use this pallet  yet but I used my fingers and arm to get a feel of how pigmented the colors are. But so far so good...</li>
            <li> Arrived in very good condition</li>
            <li> It looks exactly as pictured. Very pigmented. I didn&#x27;t even use primer. I like that they are all matte colors and very easy to blend. Would definitely recommend and will buy again. You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this palette!! the color pay off is amazing and the color selection is great, not too many brights or neutrals they are perfectly divided. just ordered a second one for my mom. high recommend!</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow pallets is amazing !very pigmented :D</li>
            <li> If you love matte eye shadows this is the palette for you! I love the color options and the color pay off is on point. these eyeshadows are super pigmented and matte as described in the description :) Extremely pleased highly recommend!</li>
            <li> There are a lot of colors in this eye shadow palette. The colors are all matte. The packaging was perfect . None of the shadows were broken. I would buy from this company again. The colors are very pigmented but I like the look with a eye shadow base first colors do not rub off with base first.</li>
            <li> I like it but when it arrived many of the colors had been broken up due to shipping. Pretty colors.</li>
            <li> I originally got this because I only have a few matte shadows and they are all neutral colors. I really can&#x27;t stand having a bunch of shimmer/glitter on my face but I wanted some bright, colorful mattes.&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived right on the day it was expected. I opened the box and the plastic covering was filled with brown dust. So, it turns out that one of the shadows was crushed during shipping. That was a bummer but it was one of the brown/taupe colors and I was getting it mostly for the brighter colors.&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the all of the other shadows were  in place. They are pretty small but a little goes a long way. The first day, I did an orange eye with yellow and two very bright oranges. Today, I have on a pink and purple eye. I love the color payoff and the shadows last. These shadows are very pigmented and come off just as they appear. I had forgotten to take my eyeshadow last night before sleeping and took a shower. I still had a bit of color in my crease that I used an eye makeup remover with! All of the shadows are matte, just as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite only having 62 shadows, I do not regret this purchase. You can buy a palette from one of those well-known brands and you pay $45 for a random assortment of glitters and shimmers with maybe one or two mattes and you only get about a dozen of those shades. If you want true matte shades and a bunch of variety, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted eye shadow like this!!</li>
            <li> Love the color choices</li>
            <li> Some of the colours look different after application but overall for the price it&#x27;s fine for practice.</li>
            <li> A few of the colors arrived broken. Not as brightly colored once applied. There is a good amount of each color though which is nice.</li>
            <li> Loved the color long lasting great for cosplay and regular wear.</li>
            <li> Beautiful vibrant colors, arrived on time with no broken squares. IT IS ONLY ONE PALLETE</li>
            <li> Love the colors goes on well and last through out the day</li>
            <li> Finally an eye-shadow that is not so powder that it goes in your eyes. The colors are pretty and they blend well together. the semi hard plastic over the shadow boxes was a great idea.</li>
            <li> not as any things from what I read on the comments. .. rate it one start just for the blue and green colors, the colors are not pigmented at all, the size is so big, already give it to my daughter to play with it. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Great variety of colors, you don&#x27;t need to apply a lot for a good outcome. Hopefully it lasts me a while</li>
            <li> Some colours are very vibrant while some are not visible even with primer</li>
