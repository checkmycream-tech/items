            <li>I love mine and the design is so perfect for me!!</li>
            <li>Perfect size case for oils... easy to fit into others bags and looks great too!</li>
            <li>The quality is good, but the price still seems steep for the product.</li>
            <li>Perfect size for secure bottles... and lovely to behold!</li>
            <li>The descriptions states that it fits 5ml-15ml bottles so my 10ml bottles should fit perfectly, I can&#x27;t get more than 12!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this bag and would but it again.</li>
            <li>Very cute bag.</li>
            <li>I love this case!  </li>
            <li>which is kind of unconventional when I am in a hurry!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cute, holds the oils securely and pads them well.  </li>
            <li>As the photo shows, this carrier does not hold as many oils as promised.</li>
            <li>Cute also.</li>
            <li>I really love the carry handle located on the top of the case so that when you lift it, the oils stay in an upright position.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil bag.</li>
            <li>As an oiler I know most of us want to carry all our oils around with us.</li>
            <li>oh so cute.</li>
            <li>PERFECT FOE KEEPING, AND TRAVELING WITH MY PRIZED ESSENTIAL OILS!!!</li>
            <li>Bought two more as gifts.  </li>
            <li>It is stylish and sturdy, and has a convenient handle on the top.</li>
            <li>I got the red one and the color is true to the picture; the print is awesome.</li>
            <li>It is storing my oils much better than how I originally had them - in a plastic box where they slid around everywhere.</li>
            <li>It holds 28 bottles easily.  </li>
            <li>The case is super cute</li>
            <li>it just needs to be about twice the size to fit 26 bottles.</li>
            <li>Great bag for holding my essential oils.  </li>
            <li>This bag is perfect for smaller bottles .It is very well made and</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, would order from this shipper again.</li>
            <li>I do like it, and would consider ordering a second, but I think better to just limit the number of oils I buy!</li>
            <li>The new larger bag looks great</li>
            <li>I expected this product to fit more than it does!</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy bag; seems well made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very well thought out design.</li>
            <li>I only have 5ml bottles and they fit well,</li>
            <li>High quality construction.  </li>
            <li>Adding three more bottles in the empty slot, this bag will comfortably hold only 21 bottles -- far from the 30 I expected.</li>
            <li>Very stylish and not too big or too small.</li>
            <li>but if you have anything bigger it will probably be pretty snug.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a tight fit</li>
            <li>The dividers needed to be made a little bigger to allow for more room for the bottles.  </li>
            <li>This bag is not made for more than a few 15 ml bottles mixed in with 10 or 5 ml.</li>
            <li>Not a good oils case if you are working with mostly 15 ml bottles.  </li>
            <li>Well made bag but much smaller than I expected,  30 bottles is a very tight fit!!  </li>
            <li>I have 12 10ml bottles in my case, in the individual slots (there are 18 slots available), they are hard to put in and out because the slots don&#x27;t seem to be big enough!</li>
            <li>The reason I&#x27;m only rating it 4 stars is that I&#x27;m not sure it is worth the $28</li>

            <li> There are 18 individual pockets and 2 large pockets at the back, which fits miscellaneous items like pipettes, small funnel, carrier oil, etc.  </li>
            <li> The fabric is a sturdy canvas type, zipper has two pulls that can meet in the middle or pull to one side or the other.  </li>
            <li> i spent on it....</li>
            <li> I appreciate the longer pouches so I can store my roller bottles as well as other odds and ends.</li>
            <li> Wish I would&#x27;ve slowed down and read what other said.</li>
            <li> I had to leave one space per row empty or risk breaking a bottle if I forced it in.</li>
            <li> My oils are all 5 and 10 mL size, I do not have any of the 15 mL bottles, which some reviewers said do not fit well.  </li>
            <li> but I am waiting  until a few color choices to come out.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT FIT 26 bottles!</li>
            <li> It is hard to zip and unzip</li>
            <li> The zipper flap fold over makes it a little difficult to zip and unzip, but it doesn&#x27;t get stuck in the zipper.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>

            <li> I love mine and the design is so perfect for me!! I am so happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> DOES NOT FIT 26 bottles! The case is super cute it just needs to be about twice the size to fit 26 bottles. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Well made. Perfect size for secure bottles... and lovely to behold!</li>
            <li> Not a good oils case if you are working with mostly 15 ml bottles.  The dividers needed to be made a little bigger to allow for more room for the bottles.  I put my 15 ml bottles in and then couldn&#x27;t get them out.</li>
            <li> As the photo shows, this carrier does not hold as many oils as promised. All the bottles shown are doTerea... the two in the front corners are 5ml and the rest are 15ml. I had to leave one space per row empty or risk breaking a bottle if I forced it in. Adding three more bottles in the empty slot, this bag will comfortably hold only 21 bottles -- far from the 30 I expected.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I needed.  Cute also.</li>
            <li> Nice size for travel; well made; looks great! I like to keep my oils separate according to category, and this case works perfect! Great quality too! Also allows my oils to stay upright.</li>
            <li> Very nice bag. I really like it. It has a variety of pocket sizes. The zipper flap fold over makes it a little difficult to zip and unzip, but it doesn&#x27;t get stuck in the zipper. I am very pleased with this bag and would but it again.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy bag; seems well made. My oils are all 5 and 10 mL size, I do not have any of the 15 mL bottles, which some reviewers said do not fit well.  There are 18 individual pockets and 2 large pockets at the back, which fits miscellaneous items like pipettes, small funnel, carrier oil, etc.  One reviewer stated that the separators are attached to the bottom so your bottles do not slip through and fall in a heap when you pick up the carrier to transport.  My bag (I have the Ocean Blue) is not secured to the bottom, but it is sturdy enough that the bottles are not going anywhere.  I do like it, and would consider ordering a second, but I think better to just limit the number of oils I buy!</li>
            <li> I love this case!  It&#x27;s very cute, holds the oils securely and pads them well.  The fabric is a sturdy canvas type, zipper has two pulls that can meet in the middle or pull to one side or the other.  Lots of options here.  I really love the carry handle located on the top of the case so that when you lift it, the oils stay in an upright position.  High quality construction.  Very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Very cute bag. I appreciate the longer pouches so I can store my roller bottles as well as other odds and ends. It&#x27;s a very well thought out design. I got the red one and the color is true to the picture; the print is awesome.</li>
            <li> I love this oil bag. This bag is not made for more than a few 15 ml bottles mixed in with 10 or 5 ml. Bottles. As an oiler I know most of us want to carry all our oils around with us. I have started dispensing my oils into smaller roller ball bottles for my on the go oils. This bag is perfect for smaller bottles .It is very well made and oh so cute. Keep up the quality workmanship!  The new larger bag looks great but I am waiting  until a few color choices to come out.</li>
            <li> PERFECT FOE KEEPING, AND TRAVELING WITH MY PRIZED ESSENTIAL OILS!!!</li>
            <li> My wife thought this was good!</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I needed.  Bought two more as gifts.  It holds 28 bottles easily.  Quick shipping, would order from this shipper again.</li>
            <li> This bag is smaller than I thought it would be, but it still holds and stores my oils like I had hoped. I only have 5ml bottles and they fit well, but if you have anything bigger it will probably be pretty snug. It is stylish and sturdy, and has a convenient handle on the top. The reason I&#x27;m only rating it 4 stars is that I&#x27;m not sure it is worth the $28 i spent on it.... The quality is good, but the price still seems steep for the product. It is storing my oils much better than how I originally had them - in a plastic box where they slid around everywhere.</li>
            <li> does not hold regular size bottles. to use for 26 bottle they would have to be 5ML. Not good. I want to return it.</li>
            <li> Just the size I was looking for. Very stylish and not too big or too small.</li>
            <li> I expected this product to fit more than it does! I have 12 10ml bottles in my case, in the individual slots (there are 18 slots available), they are hard to put in and out because the slots don&#x27;t seem to be big enough! The descriptions states that it fits 5ml-15ml bottles so my 10ml bottles should fit perfectly, I can&#x27;t get more than 12! It is hard to zip and unzip which is kind of unconventional when I am in a hurry!&lt;br /&gt;I do like the two bigger spaces in the back, I can put my cotton balls and some roller bottles back there! The material is quality and I like the fabric design, very trendy!</li>
            <li> Well made bag but much smaller than I expected,  30 bottles is a very tight fit!!  I think it&#x27;s a bit overpriced but like I said the way it&#x27;s made is second to done!!</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my oils</li>
            <li> Great bag for holding my essential oils.  Like it a lot.</li>
            <li> wish I would have taken time to read the reviews before my order.  This case does NOT hold 15 ml bottles, it is made for the 5 ml bottles, I can squeeze in the 15 ml but it&#x27;s a tight fit and you cannot put them side by side.  Now I&#x27;m headed on vacation without a case.  Hope this helps someone.  Wish I would&#x27;ve slowed down and read what other said.</li>
