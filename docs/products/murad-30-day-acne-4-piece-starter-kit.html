            <li>Her skin looks beautiful!!  </li>
            <li>This Murad kit is the best product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>and I am very very happy.</li>
            <li>This was the perfect kit to try this product without spending a ton of money.  </li>
            <li>This is perfect for trying out and travel.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Murad!!!</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t as great as I had hoped, but I still like it.</li>
            <li>Great way to spend a birthday...</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>Works great for my daughter.</li>
            <li>Love Murad products!!</li>
            <li>BUT this would have been good for someone who has moderate-severe acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very easy system and great for traveling too.</li>
            <li>I love these products!</li>
            <li>Otherwise it feels like they all blend together and doesn&#x27;t get a chance to it&#x27;s job effectively.</li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve found for adult acne.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best thing for my combination skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gotten rid of my blackheads perfectly, but doesn&#x27;t do anything for the larger &amp;#34;under the skin&amp;#34; kind of acne that hurts.</li>
            <li>Product is very light on face.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot better on my skin than proactive.</li>
            <li>Double-check before you order to be SURE the seller accepts returns.</li>
            <li>and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>So glad something has cured the murad curse.</li>
            <li>I already use the Murad oil-control mattifier and I love it</li>
            <li>love love love.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin though, doesn&#x27;t leave residue, smells pretty nice, better than ProActiv which just bleached everything it touched.</li>
            <li>But I have finally found a good product!</li>
            <li>Once I got it, I used it and the acne cleared up very quickly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard great things from other people, and it&#x27;s a nice light wash and moisturizer, great for sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>Perhaps 3 times a week is fine.</li>
            <li>My daughter has tried every over the counter acne treatment available and nothing worked until this.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product</li>
            <li>My 3q13 year old daughter was not having good results with proactive, so she switched to murad.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter saw significant clearance after just one day of use.  </li>
            <li>My face felt clean but the texture and acne hasn&#x27;t cleared up at all.</li>
            <li>I will be buying the full sizes soon.</li>
            <li>and I had no bad reaction to the Murad.</li>
            <li>Pretty happy about that but be careful it could give you a mild rash!</li>
            <li>clears it up quickly, keeps skin hydrated, and doesn&#x27;t make it oily at all.</li>
            <li>I get mild breakouts now and</li>
            <li>Purchased this based on a recommendation from a friend (it worked really well for her light acne issues).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is worth trying again.</li>
            <li>I use a little of the clearing solution and wake up acne free!!!</li>
            <li>Yah right</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice changes to my skin, but my skin is very sensitive to most formulas.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didnt like was the spot treatment, I have sensitive skin and it gave me an itchy red patch where I applied it on my skin, but everything else was great!</li>
            <li>Small amounts, but great to test the product or for traveling</li>
            <li>As long as you wash your face twice a day and use all the steps you should get effective results.</li>
            <li>I could see a difference in my skin after the first day i used this product...</li>
            <li>This product really worked for me...</li>
            <li>My face is very oily anyway</li>
            <li>It literally only took a couple days to see a significant improvement in her blemishes and skin tone.</li>
            <li>I am 45 yeas old with mild adult acne that comes and goes.</li>
            <li>But I am convinced this does better than those in the local stores and the acne cream I was getting at the local</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am 31 years old and have had acne my whole life.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference and when I actually use everyday I&#x27;m pimple free.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Only thing I have found that has cleared up my skin &amp; has kept it clear!!!!</li>
            <li>but my skin is clear to the touch</li>
            <li>In a week her face was much clearer, in fact, she only gets breakouts once a month for hormonal reasons now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>As soon as I started using it my whole face was covered in giant pimples.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to believe that after all these years, I may eventually have decent looking skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s and have had acne prone skin since I was a teenager, trying many different products over the years; high end, low end, organic...</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m barely on my 4th day!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now and haven&#x27;t seen any major improvements yet.</li>
            <li>Also, this product does not dry out my skin like a lot of acne cleaners do, so that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
            <li>I have completely cleared up besides an occasional tiny pimple that is gone after a day or two.</li>

            <li> It gave me a minor rash left my face</li>
            <li> Then wait for that to dry before using the final step.</li>
            <li> It has helped my break outs become less frequent.</li>
            <li> TINY bottles, I cannot explain how let down I was when I opened the box and saw these tiny bottles that I spent $25 on.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t dry out her skin like Proactiv did.</li>
            <li> Wait until your face is dry before using step two.</li>
            <li> then and this cleared me up without dry out my face.</li>
            <li> So if that&#x27;s you, I reccomend because my breakouts went away in about 3 days, just don&#x27;t over due it because it can dry out out.</li>
            <li> This only dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> Total waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Before I used murad I got occasional breakouts usually just a couple.</li>
            <li> I do appreciate the fact that Murad offers a 30 day supply of this product, would&#x27;ve hated to be stuck with full size products that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I think I will incorporate other products from this line moving forward!</li>
            <li> Also notice any dark marks I had from previous breakouts cleared up.</li>
            <li> I have some spots from previous acne</li>
            <li> It is much clearer and I haven&#x27;t got any of those big painful blemishes that leave scars since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> It did nothing for the small bumps on his cheeks and only a small bit of difference on his forehead.  </li>
            <li> and you can mess up the results.</li>
            <li> ProActiv even made my skin worse, but this Murad kit is actually clearing my skin.</li>
            <li> but it dried out my skin/</li>
            <li> It also dried my skin out a bit.</li>
            <li> I reccomend this product for someone who really has bad acne.</li>
            <li> I have used blotting cloths in the past, usually about 2-3 a day.</li>
            <li> He has small bumps on his cheeks and has quite a bit of acne on his forehead.  </li>
            <li> Even when I feel lazy and not want to wash my face before sleep</li>
            <li> red u was using it twice a day but cutting it down to once at night.</li>
            <li> Used for a month and sadly still will not be re-purchasing.</li>
            <li> I ordered it because I broke out and went crazy buying all these products.</li>
            <li> I consulted with an Esthetician and she said I didn&#x27;t have to use this product since I didn&#x27;t have bad acne</li>
            <li> I have had bad acne ever since.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My 3q13 year old daughter was not having good results with proactive, so she switched to murad. In a week her face was much clearer, in fact, she only gets breakouts once a month for hormonal reasons now. She loves it</li>
            <li> I recomemde to all may clients!!!!perfect...</li>
            <li> After my daughter tried over the counter acne medications, Proactive, and a dermatologist prescription, we found this and her acne was gone in 3 days.  Her skin looks beautiful!!  Love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> It gave me a minor rash left my face red u was using it twice a day but cutting it down to once at night. It has worked on taking away redness an some acne scars that I&#x27;ve had. And I&#x27;m barely on my 4th day! Pretty happy about that but be careful it could give you a mild rash!</li>
            <li> Too drying for my skin</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s a lot better on my skin than proactive. It doesn&#x27;t burn my face and cleared up my acne. It&#x27;s also made with natural ingredients. I will definitely advise my friends and family that suffer with acne to try this product.</li>
            <li> I am 31 years old and have had acne my whole life. I have tried everything even proactive and clinque acne system. This Murad kit is the best product I have ever used. It keeps my skin matte all day. I have completely cleared up besides an occasional tiny pimple that is gone after a day or two. I have some spots from previous acne but my skin is clear to the touch and I am very very happy. I think I will incorporate other products from this line moving forward!</li>
            <li> This only dried out my skin. It claimed that it only takes 72 hours to see cleared skin. Yah right</li>
            <li> This was the perfect kit to try this product without spending a ton of money.  My daughter has tried every over the counter acne treatment available and nothing worked until this. It literally only took a couple days to see a significant improvement in her blemishes and skin tone. This product doesn&#x27;t dry out her skin like Proactiv did. I holy recommend trying this product if you struggle with acne.</li>
            <li> This product really worked for me...I started breaking out while I was breastfeeding my daughter.. I tried everything and nothing worked...I could see a difference in my skin after the first day i used this product...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since I was 13 (now 71) &amp; nothing ever helped. ProActiv even made my skin worse, but this Murad kit is actually clearing my skin. I&#x27;m starting to believe that after all these years, I may eventually have decent looking skin. I hope they never stop making this product!</li>
            <li> Product is very light on face. My face is very oily anyway but it doesn&#x27;t make it feel that way. Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> TINY bottles, I cannot explain how let down I was when I opened the box and saw these tiny bottles that I spent $25 on. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now and haven&#x27;t seen any major improvements yet.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve found for adult acne.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t as great as I had hoped, but I still like it. It&#x27;s a very easy system and great for traveling too. I didn&#x27;t really notice changes to my skin, but my skin is very sensitive to most formulas. I&#x27;ve heard great things from other people, and it&#x27;s a nice light wash and moisturizer, great for sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a trip because of the size and convenience and my face cleared up on the trip! I will be buying the full sizes soon.</li>
            <li> I reccomend this product for someone who really has bad acne. I ordered it because I broke out and went crazy buying all these products. Once I got it, I used it and the acne cleared up very quickly but it dried out my skin/ I got itchy. I consulted with an Esthetician and she said I didn&#x27;t have to use this product since I didn&#x27;t have bad acne BUT this would have been good for someone who has moderate-severe acne. So if that&#x27;s you, I reccomend because my breakouts went away in about 3 days, just don&#x27;t over due it because it can dry out out. Perhaps 3 times a week is fine.</li>
            <li> I am 45 yeas old with mild adult acne that comes and goes. As long as you wash your face twice a day and use all the steps you should get effective results. Miss a day and you can mess up the results. I have used blotting cloths in the past, usually about 2-3 a day. Now I need just one a day. This is perfect for trying out and travel. But I am convinced this does better than those in the local stores and the acne cream I was getting at the local spa.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest pace yourself between steps.Wait until your face is dry before using step two. Then wait for that to dry before using the final step. Otherwise it feels like they all blend together and doesn&#x27;t get a chance to it&#x27;s job effectively.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter who has acne, she couldn&#x27;t use it. Made her face peel even with use of the moisturizer. I contacted the seller immediately &amp; never heard a word back. Threw it all in the trash. Total waste of my money. Double-check before you order to be SURE the seller accepts returns. If not, don&#x27;t risk it. I didn&#x27;t check ahead of time. My big mistake.</li>
            <li> Recommended to everyone. I have sensitive skin and I love this stuff. I trust everything Murad does.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It has helped my break outs become less frequent. I don&#x27;t have severe acne, but I do have occasional breakouts. I won&#x27;t be switching from this!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Murad!!! Only thing I have found that has cleared up my skin &amp; has kept it clear!!!! I would recommend to anyone!! Fantastic product</li>
            <li> Got this when I was 16 almost 17. Now 4 years later, I&#x27;m still dealing with the aftermath. Before I used murad I got occasional breakouts usually just a couple. As soon as I started using it my whole face was covered in giant pimples. Great way to spend a birthday... Not! I have had bad acne ever since. But I have finally found a good product! After using their makeup I tried C******* face wash. I noticed a huge difference and when I actually use everyday I&#x27;m pimple free. So glad something has cured the murad curse.</li>
            <li> I already use the Murad oil-control mattifier and I love it so I thought I would try this. I did notice a difference in my face after a couple days of using this. It is much clearer and I haven&#x27;t got any of those big painful blemishes that leave scars since I started using this product. I have been using this product for a couple months now and will continue to use it. Also, this product does not dry out my skin like a lot of acne cleaners do, so that&#x27;s a plus! The only thing I didnt like was the spot treatment, I have sensitive skin and it gave me an itchy red patch where I applied it on my skin, but everything else was great! Love Murad products!!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter saw significant clearance after just one day of use.  We were all amazed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 and realizing that proactive and clearasil really only work for adolescent skin. This is by far the best thing for my combination skin. clears it up quickly, keeps skin hydrated, and doesn&#x27;t make it oily at all. love love love.</li>
            <li> I love these products!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son.  He has small bumps on his cheeks and has quite a bit of acne on his forehead.  It did nothing for the small bumps on his cheeks and only a small bit of difference on his forehead.  I don&#x27;t think it is worth trying again.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer:  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week. It&#x27;s gotten rid of my blackheads perfectly, but doesn&#x27;t do anything for the larger &amp;#34;under the skin&amp;#34; kind of acne that hurts. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin though, doesn&#x27;t leave residue, smells pretty nice, better than ProActiv which just bleached everything it touched.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s and have had acne prone skin since I was a teenager, trying many different products over the years; high end, low end, organic...you get the picture. Purchased this based on a recommendation from a friend (it worked really well for her light acne issues). Used for a month and sadly still will not be re-purchasing. My face felt clean but the texture and acne hasn&#x27;t cleared up at all. It also dried my skin out a bit. I do appreciate the fact that Murad offers a 30 day supply of this product, would&#x27;ve hated to be stuck with full size products that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I am 100% sold on this. I have very sensitive skin and I had no bad reaction to the Murad. I get mild breakouts now and then and this cleared me up without dry out my face. Also notice any dark marks I had from previous breakouts cleared up. Great product</li>
            <li> Works great for my daughter.</li>
            <li> only products that work on my skin!! Even when I feel lazy and not want to wash my face before sleep I use a little of the clearing solution and wake up acne free!!!</li>
            <li> Small amounts, but great to test the product or for traveling</li>
