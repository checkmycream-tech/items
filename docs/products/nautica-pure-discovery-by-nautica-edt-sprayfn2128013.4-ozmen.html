            <li>I really liked the way it smelt and got the 3.4-ouncer for $65.</li>
            <li>There is honestly NOTHING ELSE like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Am loving it</li>
            <li>Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it was a good buy for the price.  </li>
            <li>I love the fragrance, nice sillage too.</li>
            <li>own many colognes and have tried many samples.</li>
            <li>Smells great and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>The smell is really nice, reminding me of those nice summer nights at the bay, enjoying the beautiful view of the quiet waves.</li>
            <li>I love its smell too</li>
            <li>sure I&#x27;m not wearing too much?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Yet it is much more sophisticated than Acqua di Gio or Azzaro Chrome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Moderate to Excellent longevity.</li>
            <li>love love the quality</li>
            <li>What a fantastic price for this cologne!</li>
            <li>course, I would inform them of the time the fragrance is most realized.</li>
            <li>Love this scent on my hubby.  </li>
            <li>with the original package and with the cover,i love it and would recommend it for sure!</li>
            <li>Love when my husband uses it.</li>
            <li>I cannot use to many colognes as I have a reaction  to them.</li>
            <li>This cologne is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Projection is pretty good as well.</li>
            <li>Amazing price and fast shipping :)</li>
            <li>There are better colognes at there that worth paying money for, but not this one.</li>
            <li>I tried this scent in the store and loved it at first, its very fresh and crisp; however, after about 5-10 minutes I couldn&#x27;t smell even a trace of the spray (and I had sprayed 3-4 sprays).</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m a such big fan of nautica colognes, and pure discovery isn&#x27;t a exception, smell so good and last all the day, if you want a sweet smell this is a perfect choice for a very good price.</li>
            <li>Cologne has great fresh clean smell that reminds me of the smell of early spring in the midwest.</li>
            <li>It smells great and lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice, doesn&#x27;t smell like a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; fragrance, and seems to last most of the day.</li>
            <li>Crisp and clean smell and a bargain here!</li>
            <li>It is a good perfume especially for the price</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean smell</li>
            <li>CLEAN AND FRESH SMELL</li>
            <li>In fact, it makes you want to spray more and more on, but all you are doing is wasting precious spray, as it&#x27;s not cheap to begin with.  </li>
            <li>The best scent, light and lasts a long , long time*</li>
            <li>This fragrance is excellent, however, it does not last long.  </li>
            <li>Nautica does not have that effect on me, it smells nice but not too overly strong and the there really is no harshness to it.</li>
            <li>this product is subtle enough to wear around people who are sensitive to strong fragrances but strong enough for your wife to know your wearing her favorite scent, great price, great product.</li>
            <li>crisp, clean and refreshing casual scent that&#x27;s great for the summer days.</li>
            <li>This product really smells good to my wife, and is exactly the same that the stores sell at a much higher price.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume this my second bought love the soothing cool smell it has, definitely a must have.</li>
            <li>like very much the fragrance (almost like Dunhill Pure which is one of my favorites) and for the unbeatable price from Amazon!</li>
            <li>Oh yeah, the bottle is different and fancy, but I&#x27;d rather the manufacturer put more emphasis on the contents itself than the container.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!  </li>
            <li>i love it  definitely i recomeded</li>
            <li>A good everyday fragrance.</li>
            <li>really good perfume that I would use everyday.</li>
            <li>What I mean by that is it is a beautiful mix between a warm-summer-day cologne (Acqua) and a more evening-style cologne (Black).</li>
            <li>This cologne is an AMAZING mixture between Acqua di Gio and Polo Black.</li>
            <li>it is bigger and alot cheaper than walmart but the scent is not as strong.</li>
            <li>not very strong or overwhelming but has a calm tone.</li>
            <li>First time trying this particular brand of Nautica.</li>
            <li>Hopefully writing this review doesn&#x27;t make it catch on too much.</li>
            <li>This cologne has a aqua scent, Nautica always have products that I know will be well like and appreciated.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMENDED!</li>
            <li>and he absolutely like it.</li>
            <li>Yes, the scent is very nice, a little different from all of the rest of the colognes out there.  </li>
            <li>Was wearing classic Nautica for around 10 years before making the switch to Discovery.</li>
            <li>but for the price walmart wants for it then its about worth puttin g a couple extra sprays on.</li>
            <li>Casual perfume, just perfect for a daily usage.</li>
            <li>Right now I own this cologne, Polo Black, Aqua di Gio, Azzaro Chrome, Burberry Brit, Chanel Bleu, Gucci by Gucci, Bvlgari Black, Dolce &amp; Gabanna Light Blue and Dolce &amp; Gabanna</li>
            <li>Yet I think that sometimes, although I do love them, the super-citrusey colognes can be too predictable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be a long-time wearer of this new scent.</li>
            <li>The One Gentleman (a little too strong for my taste, thinking of getting rid of it).</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t sharp, but it isn&#x27;t sweet either.</li>
            <li>spray it on my skin and clothes, and my clothes smell Pure Discovery till the following day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re young or young-at-heart but like to keep it classy, give this a try.</li>
            <li>This tells me that Nautica uses very little essential oils in this cologne, and evidently, it&#x27;s mostly alcohol and coloring.  </li>
            <li>This is the 2nd Nautica Pure Discovery Eau De Toilet I buy.  </li>
            <li>Once my bottle is empty I am going to choose another cologne, and probably not another Nautica product, as, judging by their Pure Discovery, it is not a quality product.  </li>
            <li>I paid half the price for a large bottle!</li>
            <li>cologne???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was at Macy&#x27;s the other day buying a bottle of Polo Black (also an amazing cologne) and stumbled across this hidden gem.</li>

            <li> People ALL THE TIME for the past 10 years or so (with this and/or Classic Nautica), even passing ladies on the street, will turn around and say, &amp;</li>
            <li> Only downside is it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as other nautica colognes.</li>
            <li> and you are left with small notes of distinct but delicate &amp;#34;oceanic&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> A huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I would be shocked if you didn&#x27;t LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Over all I&#x27;ve probably tried two dozen different colognes in the past year.</li>
            <li> and less than $20</li>
            <li> After a few hours I knew I had found a treasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can NOT pull off colognes that are too heavy, musty or woody.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a tall, thin, 22-year-old white boy.</li>
            <li> Our son goes a little overboard when he sprays cologne and usually it stings my eyes and makes me gag.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed with this cologne, and I wish that I didn&#x27;t buy it in the first place because it is truly a waste of money.</li>
            <li> ; Co-workers even comment they like walking past me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to find super-sophisticated scents that I can pull off.</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s my little secret at this</li>
            <li> wrong scent lasts all day</li>

            <li> Really disappointed with this cologne, and I wish that I didn&#x27;t buy it in the first place because it is truly a waste of money. There are better colognes at there that worth paying money for, but not this one. My advice to you is to stay away from buying this one, and the smell don&#x27;t even last a minute.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume this my second bought love the soothing cool smell it has, definitely a must have.</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase! like very much the fragrance (almost like Dunhill Pure which is one of my favorites) and for the unbeatable price from Amazon! I am a very happy with my choice!</li>
            <li> Amazing price and fast shipping :) thank you I love its smell too</li>
            <li> This cologne by Nautica is very nice. The scent isn&#x27;t sharp, but it isn&#x27;t sweet either. It&#x27;s very balanced for everyday use. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long. It lasts about 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li> People ALL THE TIME for the past 10 years or so (with this and/or Classic Nautica), even passing ladies on the street, will turn around and say, &amp;#34;baby, you smell gooOOOd! - mmm!&amp;#34; Co-workers even comment they like walking past me and I double check with, &amp;#34;you sure I&#x27;m not wearing too much?&amp;#34; And the reply is always the same, &amp;#34;not at all.&amp;#34; Been wearing for years and people from professionals to lovers to strangers all say the same thing - you smell terrific!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cologne is not overpowering and requires quite a bit when initially applying because the initial smell does &amp;#34;drift away&amp;#34; within 20 minutes and you are left with small notes of distinct but delicate &amp;#34;oceanic&amp;#34; scent. Was wearing classic Nautica for around 10 years before making the switch to Discovery. A+++++++++++++++</li>
            <li> How do people not know about this cologne???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was at Macy&#x27;s the other day buying a bottle of Polo Black (also an amazing cologne) and stumbled across this hidden gem. I really liked the way it smelt and got the 3.4-ouncer for $65. I guess you could say it was love-at-first-sight. Put it on as I got in my car. After a few hours I knew I had found a treasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own many colognes and have tried many samples. Over all I&#x27;ve probably tried two dozen different colognes in the past year. Right now I own this cologne, Polo Black, Aqua di Gio, Azzaro Chrome, Burberry Brit, Chanel Bleu, Gucci by Gucci, Bvlgari Black, Dolce &amp; Gabanna Light Blue and Dolce &amp; Gabanna The One Gentleman (a little too strong for my taste, thinking of getting rid of it). This cologne is an AMAZING mixture between Acqua di Gio and Polo Black. What I mean by that is it is a beautiful mix between a warm-summer-day cologne (Acqua) and a more evening-style cologne (Black). There is honestly NOTHING ELSE like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I listed my colognes so you can get a feel for whether or not you have my style in scent. I can NOT pull off colognes that are too heavy, musty or woody. Those styles are just not for me. Yet I think that sometimes, although I do love them, the super-citrusey colognes can be too predictable. I&#x27;m a tall, thin, 22-year-old white boy. It&#x27;s hard for me to find super-sophisticated scents that I can pull off. I can pull this one off beautifully. Yet it is much more sophisticated than Acqua di Gio or Azzaro Chrome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be a long-time wearer of this new scent. Hopefully writing this review doesn&#x27;t make it catch on too much. I feel like it&#x27;s my little secret at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re young or young-at-heart but like to keep it classy, give this a try. I would be shocked if you didn&#x27;t LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Yes, the scent is very nice, a little different from all of the rest of the colognes out there.  However, the scent lasts about five minutes, then it&#x27;s gone.  In fact, it makes you want to spray more and more on, but all you are doing is wasting precious spray, as it&#x27;s not cheap to begin with.  This tells me that Nautica uses very little essential oils in this cologne, and evidently, it&#x27;s mostly alcohol and coloring.  Once my bottle is empty I am going to choose another cologne, and probably not another Nautica product, as, judging by their Pure Discovery, it is not a quality product.  Oh yeah, the bottle is different and fancy, but I&#x27;d rather the manufacturer put more emphasis on the contents itself than the container.  A huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> What a bargain! Like the scent; lasts all day. First time trying this particular brand of Nautica.</li>
            <li> This cologne is pretty good. Moderate to Excellent longevity. The smell is really nice, reminding me of those nice summer nights at the bay, enjoying the beautiful view of the quiet waves. Projection is pretty good as well. 5 out of 5 for me!</li>
            <li> love love the quality</li>
            <li> This cologne has a aqua scent, Nautica always have products that I know will be well like and appreciated. One of the best.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic price for this cologne! You cannot beat it! Fast shipping too!  I paid half the price for a large bottle! Awesome!</li>
            <li> i love it  definitely i recomeded</li>
            <li> The best scent, light and lasts a long , long time* my fav*</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMENDED! SMELLS GREAT, A LOT OF IT! GOOD FOR WINTER OR SUMMER! IF YOU WANT TO SMELL GOOD I WOULD GET THIS!~</li>
            <li> I ought it for my dad and he absolutely like it. It is a good perfume especially for the price</li>
            <li> Smells great and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is excellent, however, it does not last long.  Fortunately, it was a good buy for the price.  Yes, it would recommend this to friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I would inform them of the time the fragrance is most realized.</li>
            <li> Our son goes a little overboard when he sprays cologne and usually it stings my eyes and makes me gag. Nautica does not have that effect on me, it smells nice but not too overly strong and the there really is no harshness to it.</li>
            <li> Husband loved it. Great price from the seller!</li>
            <li> Smells nice, doesn&#x27;t smell like a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; fragrance, and seems to last most of the day. A good everyday fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance, nice sillage too. Got a compliment.&lt;br /&gt;I spray it on my skin and clothes, and my clothes smell Pure Discovery till the following day. Am loving it</li>
            <li> Love this scent on my hubby.  He will get another bottle on his birthday in March.  I buy it every year for him.</li>
            <li> Great smell, good size.  Great buy for the price</li>
            <li> Crisp and clean smell and a bargain here!</li>
            <li> Great scent: smooth, not in your face. I got the 1.7 fl oz of this cologne from a department store for about $30 and thought i was getting a great deal with this. At 3.4 fl. oz. and less than $20, this is a steal. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, my girl friend loves it and almost every girl that has smelled it and you cant beat the price.</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean smell</li>
            <li> CLEAN AND FRESH SMELL</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a such big fan of nautica colognes, and pure discovery isn&#x27;t a exception, smell so good and last all the day, if you want a sweet smell this is a perfect choice for a very good price.</li>
            <li> This product really smells good to my wife, and is exactly the same that the stores sell at a much higher price.</li>
            <li> Casual perfume, just perfect for a daily usage. I gave it as a gift, good option!</li>
            <li> Perfect,very rapid shipping.&lt;br /&gt;comes with the original package and with the cover,i love it and would recommend it for sure!</li>
            <li> it is bigger and alot cheaper than walmart but the scent is not as strong. but for the price walmart wants for it then its about worth puttin g a couple extra sprays on.</li>
            <li> smells awesome. Love when my husband uses it.</li>
            <li> I tried this scent in the store and loved it at first, its very fresh and crisp; however, after about 5-10 minutes I couldn&#x27;t smell even a trace of the spray (and I had sprayed 3-4 sprays). Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> crisp, clean and refreshing casual scent that&#x27;s great for the summer days. not overpowering or obnoxious. I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I thought with the low price it would be a  knockoff but I was wrong scent lasts all day it has a great scent for spring and summer I have had lots of compliments  I would buy again</li>
            <li> really good perfume that I would use everyday. not very strong or overwhelming but has a calm tone. I had multiple complements. I would definitely get it again.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely great! I cannot use to many colognes as I have a reaction  to them. This one from Nautica has an excellent aroma, doesn&#x27;t cause irritation to me. It is my favorite! If I could give ten stars I would!</li>
            <li> Everything is great!!!</li>
            <li> Cologne has great fresh clean smell that reminds me of the smell of early spring in the midwest. Only downside is it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as other nautica colognes. this product is subtle enough to wear around people who are sensitive to strong fragrances but strong enough for your wife to know your wearing her favorite scent, great price, great product.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd Nautica Pure Discovery Eau De Toilet I buy.  It smells great and lasts all day long.  I deffinetelly recommend this one</li>
