    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Wonderful Stretch mark treatment.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m just happy it already improved my skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li>and I see great results already.</li>
            <li>so I switched to something else that works good for those.  </li>
            <li>but I still have a good amount in my bottle</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Amazingly soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>I recived this product @ a discount, &amp; based this review on my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Now I need to consider whether I want to purchase another bottle and see if its the 4-6 week thing is the magic number because 4 weeks doesn’t seem to be.&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle of this at a discounted rate to facilitate this review, however all opinions are 100% honest and my own.</li>
            <li>I have seen some results cant wait to see more.</li>
            <li>I love how it easily absorbs into my skin and how lightweight it is.</li>
            <li>Right now on Amazon it is $27.99, however its original retail price is set at $94.99 and has been all over the place price wise since I first discovered the product.</li>
            <li>But I really like this one it makes your skin feel nice and smooth</li>
            <li>received this product for the purposes of testing and reviewing, and my takeaway is that overall, this is a great product that truly improves and firms skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very soft and smooth, which is nice.</li>
            <li>My original review below.   </li>
            <li>(The date I will be updating my results will be June 18, so you will have to wait until then to get the full review in which I will then edit and update this.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Which is good, because here I am back on June 22, 2015 to update this review.</li>
            <li>My daughters loved how this product over time diminishes the look of the deep stretch marks and the colors have faded to a lighter color after using Protege Stretch Mark Treatment!.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this treatment and will be getting more and sticking with this product.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply evenly despite being much thicker than lotion.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li>This product is worth buying</li>
            <li>First the reviews were all over the place.</li>
            <li>Some people were raving about it, and others were pretty upset.</li>
            <li>but I will leave an update, but so far it makes my skin feel smooth</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>I was so skeptical about buying this product, but dang am I happy I did!</li>
            <li>I paid so much</li>
            <li>VANISH, the stretch mark removal cream in Protege&#x27;s line of beauty and skincare products, works very well to diminish the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li>However, I really have not seen any difference in my before and after.</li>
            <li>This product works really well in helping to fade and remove stretch marks.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not that much</li>
            <li>If this product can&#x27;t help heal fresh scars, there is no way it will help old, ingrained scar tissue.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work my stretch marks are still there.</li>
            <li>Also comes in a cute little bottle &amp; does not dispense too much cream.</li>
            <li>A good product for lightening small stretch marks, but not really deep ones</li>
            <li>the thing I have noticed so far is that it leaves the skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to completely see a huge difference</li>
            <li>and I have had no reactions from this as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I use a well known product pretty regularly and it works when used regularly.</li>
            <li>I only wish the bottle was a little bit bigger since I apply the cream two times per day and am going it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 1oz and for me personally I don&#x27;t think it would last me 4-6 weeks because my problem areas are Large.</li>
            <li>First picture is before the other is after.</li>
            <li>After noticing no improvement on these recent scars, I stopped bothering to apply it to some old stretch mark scars.</li>
            <li>I have stretch marks on my arms from my first pregnancy 12 years ago &amp; after using this cream, it has faded slightly.  </li>
            <li>I have some white stretch marks on my stomach that were very apparent, but after 2 weeks, they are starting to blend in and not be so obvious.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this for 4 weeks, I could definitely tell my stretch marks had faded quite a bit, but I have some pretty deep stretch marks on my stomach from pregnancy, and I needed something a little stronger,  </li>
            <li>Light fragrance that is not overwhelming like other cellulite/stretch mark</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Light fragrance that is not overwhelming like other cellulite/stretch mark</li>
            <li> Easy dispensing, unlike other stretch mark creams that came in a tube (i.e. Palmer&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;+ Subtle but visible results after 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even at nearly $30 its expensive, but if it works, that is not a bad price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this stretch mark cream long enough to see any progress</li>
            <li> Used this product religiously twice a day, morning and night, for over a month, and saw absolutely NO improvement with my fairly recent (within the last 6 months) post-surgical scars on my neck/shoulder area and the inside of my elbow.</li>
            <li> The only con is (and I know a little bit goes a long way)</li>
            <li> Bottle is a little bit small, so I&#x27;m afraid that I will run out of the cream before I really get to see its true potential at 6-8 weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While it looks a little weird, it goes on easily and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li> read all the reviews before hand, and did a little research on the actual product.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> The small dimples have not completely disappeared (as expected - this is not a miracle cream), but the cellulite is not as obvious as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> I have been using this on a few stretch marks I have on my lower back...</li>
            <li> , the cream is brown in appearance, smells a little strange but probably the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have Tried other Products</li>
            <li> * Update, the small stretch marks on my thighs are starting to fade, it&#x27;s been a little over a week.</li>
            <li> my trouble areas are on my thighs and butt due to pregnancy , and it does make my skin feel firmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 weeks now and just have seen a slight improvement.  </li>
            <li> It was a liquid base amd light brown in color.</li>
            <li> VANISH is not cheap.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using it, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I have a few acne spots as well, that I am trying this on</li>
            <li> and it never worked. :/</li>
            <li> small and Compact if you want to carry it with you.</li>
            <li> This gel-like cream left a weird shiny glaze on the skin which also caused dryness and itchiness.</li>
            <li> Anyways it kinda sucks</li>
            <li> Too small for the price, didn&#x27;t see any difference in my stretch marks!</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t Greasy  and does not have a bad smell .</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this for 4 weeks, I could definitely tell my stretch marks had faded quite a bit, but I have some pretty deep stretch marks on my stomach from pregnancy, and I needed something a little stronger,  so I switched to something else that works good for those.  I used this for 4 weeks only and it recommends 6 weeks.  A good product for lightening small stretch marks, but not really deep ones</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all. It was a liquid base amd light brown in color. I have been using it twice a day since I received it and seen no results.  Save your money...</li>
            <li> I paid 40 dollars for this and it didn&#x27;t work. I used every last drop for about 6/8 weeks. Everyone said it worked so well but they said they got a discount to write a review. I never got a discount. Anyways it kinda sucks I paid so much and it never worked. :/</li>
            <li> Been using this for well over 6 weeks No change</li>
            <li> Too small for the price, didn&#x27;t see any difference in my stretch marks!</li>
            <li> This product is worth buying</li>
            <li> VANISH, the stretch mark removal cream in Protege&#x27;s line of beauty and skincare products, works very well to diminish the appearance of cellulite. However, keep in mind that it is not an overnight miracle cure, and will therefore take several applications before yielding visible results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Skin is smoother and firmer around my thigh area. The small dimples have not completely disappeared (as expected - this is not a miracle cream), but the cellulite is not as obvious as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;+ Helps my scars fade in color and intensity. I have some white stretch marks on my stomach that were very apparent, but after 2 weeks, they are starting to blend in and not be so obvious.&lt;br /&gt;+ Light fragrance that is not overwhelming like other cellulite/stretch mark creams.&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to apply evenly despite being much thicker than lotion.&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy dispensing, unlike other stretch mark creams that came in a tube (i.e. Palmer&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;+ Subtle but visible results after 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Bottle is a little bit small, so I&#x27;m afraid that I will run out of the cream before I really get to see its true potential at 6-8 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for the purposes of testing and reviewing, and my takeaway is that overall, this is a great product that truly improves and firms skin. I only wish the bottle was a little bit bigger since I apply the cream two times per day and am going it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed anything, every morning &amp; night i apply it &amp; still see no changes. 3 weeks already &amp; see no results .</li>
            <li> Who doesn’t wish they could get rid of stretch marks? I use a well known product pretty regularly and it works when used regularly. So when I was offered the opportunity to try VANISH Stretch Mark Removal cream, I wondered if it could/would work any faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all the reviews before hand, and did a little research on the actual product. First the reviews were all over the place. Some people were raving about it, and others were pretty upset. VANISH is not cheap. Right now on Amazon it is $27.99, however its original retail price is set at $94.99 and has been all over the place price wise since I first discovered the product. Even at nearly $30 its expensive, but if it works, that is not a bad price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the Vanish cream on May 20, 2015. (The date I will be updating my results will be June 18, so you will have to wait until then to get the full review in which I will then edit and update this.) I use the product morning and night. While it looks a little weird, it goes on easily and is non-greasy. It absorbs into the skin well and the thing I have noticed so far is that it leaves the skin very soft. Amazingly soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is good, because here I am back on June 22, 2015 to update this review. The product has been used every morning and every night since May 20, 2015. It leaves my skin very soft and smooth, which is nice. However, I really have not seen any difference in my before and after. I am going to allow you to be the final judge on whether it worked or not. Now I need to consider whether I want to purchase another bottle and see if its the 4-6 week thing is the magic number because 4 weeks doesn’t seem to be.&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle of this at a discounted rate to facilitate this review, however all opinions are 100% honest and my own.</li>
            <li> I have Tried other Products But I really like this one it makes your skin feel nice and smooth isn&#x27;t Greasy  and does not have a bad smell . small and Compact if you want to carry it with you. I have seen some results cant wait to see more.</li>
            <li> *** Update, the small stretch marks on my thighs are starting to fade, it&#x27;s been a little over a week. First picture is before the other is after. My original review below.   I haven&#x27;t used this stretch mark cream long enough to see any progress but I will leave an update, but so far it makes my skin feel smooth, the cream is brown in appearance, smells a little strange but probably the ingredients. my trouble areas are on my thighs and butt due to pregnancy , and it does make my skin feel firmer. The only con is (and I know a little bit goes a long way) but I think this product should have a bigger sized product for the price listed on this site. It&#x27;s 1oz and for me personally I don&#x27;t think it would last me 4-6 weeks because my problem areas are Large. But I will continue to use this and if it does fade them I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying the listed price to eliminate my marks. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my girls who got stretch marks from working out and from child birth. My daughters loved how this product over time diminishes the look of the deep stretch marks and the colors have faded to a lighter color after using Protege Stretch Mark Treatment!. This product works really well in helping to fade and remove stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 weeks now and just have seen a slight improvement.  I will have to see in buying another one to use for 6 weeks to see how it keeps working...</li>
            <li> Love it! It really works!  After a few weeks of using it, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference. I have stretch marks on my arms from my first pregnancy 12 years ago &amp; after using this cream, it has faded slightly.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to completely see a huge difference but I&#x27;m just happy it already improved my skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Stretch mark treatment. I have been using this on a few stretch marks I have on my lower back...I have only had it for about a week &amp; I notice them actually appearing smaller. I love how it easily absorbs into my skin and how lightweight it is. This cream leaves no residue and I have had no reactions from this as I have sensitive skin. I have a few acne spots as well, that I am trying this on and it&#x27;s helping with that too. I highly recommend this treatment and will be getting more and sticking with this product.Also comes in a cute little bottle &amp; does not dispense too much cream. I recived this product @ a discount, &amp; based this review on my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical about buying this product, but dang am I happy I did! I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3wks on some deep stretch marks from weight gain I went through and I see great results already. It&#x27;s only an ounce so it&#x27;s not that much but I still have a good amount in my bottle and I&#x27;ve been using it religously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just bought another bottle (:</li>
            <li> Used this product religiously twice a day, morning and night, for over a month, and saw absolutely NO improvement with my fairly recent (within the last 6 months) post-surgical scars on my neck/shoulder area and the inside of my elbow. This gel-like cream left a weird shiny glaze on the skin which also caused dryness and itchiness. After applying, I layered over it with a vitamin E gel moisturizer to counteract this. After noticing no improvement on these recent scars, I stopped bothering to apply it to some old stretch mark scars. If this product can&#x27;t help heal fresh scars, there is no way it will help old, ingrained scar tissue.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work my stretch marks are still there.</li>
