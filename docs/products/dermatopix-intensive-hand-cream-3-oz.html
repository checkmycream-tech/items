            <li>This is the best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used, and that&#x27;s saying a lot because I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li>I purchased this hand cream after reading a review in a magazine - always in the market to try something good.  </li>
            <li>The cream is light and non-greasy; and makes your hands feel wonderful!</li>
            <li>Good product and would order it again.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful feel and dries quickly leaving my hands moist but with no residue, and no odor to boot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>This is the most effective one I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>The cream went on very smoothly and was not sticky.</li>
            <li>Glad to use something that does what it claims.</li>
            <li>but I have to say, I love it.</li>
            <li>After you apply this cream, your skin feel smooth and nicely moisturized.</li>
            <li>and my hands are much better</li>
            <li>Best of all, it stays on through several hand washings.</li>
            <li>reality is that it does an OK job at moisturizing my hands.</li>
            <li>It was okay.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong aroma, so if you are looking for a perfumed hand cream this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>It goes on incredibly easy, smooth, no grease or stickiness.</li>
            <li>this really works my hands always are scally and crack and this makes them soft and it lasts awhile great</li>
            <li>True to the advertisement.</li>
            <li>And (best part for me) it seems to last all day through multiple hand washings!</li>
            <li>I have very dry hands especially during the winter months and was thrilled when I read all the great reviews about Derma Topix.</li>
            <li>My day consists of many chores, gardening, caring for 2 dogs and 2 cats, which means that I tend to wash my hands frequently.</li>
            <li>My opinion is if you don&#x27;t mind the price, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve found that really moisturizes without being greasy and leaves a nice barrier that lasts.</li>
            <li>Last, but not least, this hand cream is made in U.S.A. Love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given it as a gift to very grateful recipients!</li>
            <li>but  this is the first time the product did what it said it would do</li>
            <li>My hands definitely look and feel better as they stay hydrated.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t stand out, and personally, I like my Gold Bond hand lotion much better.  </li>
            <li>Using it once a day and then again at night, this cream really saved my hands this winter.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many, many hand creams, from the cheapest to the most expensive, and Derma Topix is the only one that works for me.</li>
            <li>I really like this hand cream  </li>
            <li>This cream really does work.</li>
            <li>Despite paying much much more for hand creams over the years, this is the only one that I keep going back to -- must be because it works!!!</li>
            <li>The main difference and advantage of this cream versus others is that it is not sticky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given my tube to a neighbor who claims to really like it and so far has had no itchy reaction :0)</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado.</li>
            <li>Hand lotions are mostly water, and not very effective.</li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent as I am very sensitive to fragrances.  </li>
            <li>nothing special, not very moisturizing</li>
            <li>Derma Topix Intensive Hand Cream is a smooth and long lasting hand cream.</li>
            <li>I used to have to bandage with an ointment the cracks that developed in the skin on my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Keeps your hands soft and supple even after washing a couple of times.  </li>
            <li>so I am a bit surprised that I had this type of reaction.</li>
            <li>I pay much less for other hand lotions that feel and work better.</li>
            <li>Would try another product or go back to my old standby Ahava.</li>
            <li>This product is a rich, thick cream, which totally soaks into your skin, so that hands are soft, but never greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the health care field, and frequent hand washing leads to dry skin, so moisturizing is a must.</li>

            <li> Purchased this hand cream due to the glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I bought this hand lotion due to some of the rave reviews.  </li>
            <li> rub in  just a little of this ointment when my hands feel dry, and there is no longer any problem</li>
            <li> A small amount does go a long way and it has virtually no smell</li>
            <li> I really like this hand cream, unfortunately there is something in it that doesn&#x27;t agree with me...</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hand creams.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Buyer beware: Contains parabens. It is misleading that the list of ingredients is not listed - it is a hassle having to return.</li>
            <li> Incredible product! It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve ever used that gets me through the entire Chicago winter. Recommended by my dermatologist and was an excellent purchase. I&#x27;ve given it as a gift to very grateful recipients!</li>
            <li> Very good hand Creme.  Only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars was do to price. Price is steep.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m plagued by dry hands year-round, and often get patches of rough scaly skin on my knuckles. Needless to say, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hand creams. This one blows all of them out of the water. It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve found that really moisturizes without being greasy and leaves a nice barrier that lasts. It&#x27;s amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> I used to have to bandage with an ointment the cracks that developed in the skin on my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;I rub in  just a little of this ointment when my hands feel dry, and there is no longer any problem whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;It also solves the peeling skin problem on my wife&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> Despite trying countless other products, the skin on the back of my hands would crack and bleed every winter.  Using it once a day and then again at night, this cream really saved my hands this winter.  It is excellent.  My only reservation is that it contains parabens, and so I used the cream less as a result.  It would be great if the manufacturer could come up with a paraben-free formulation.</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many hand creams, from the cheapest to the most expensive, and Derma Topix is the only one that works for me. My day consists of many chores, gardening, caring for 2 dogs and 2 cats, which means that I tend to wash my hands frequently. In the winter they get unbearably cracked and dry, but Derma Topix does the trick. It has a wonderful feel and dries quickly leaving my hands moist but with no residue, and no odor to boot. Despite paying much much more for hand creams over the years, this is the only one that I keep going back to -- must be because it works!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent hand cream, does what it says! I recommend it to everyone with dry cracked hands. Glad to use something that does what it claims.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hand cream after reading a review in a magazine - always in the market to try something good.  The cream is light and non-greasy; and makes your hands feel wonderful!</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on all of the reviews. It&#x27;s certainly not the holy grail of hand creams but it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> I really like this hand cream  It sinks in well and it makes my hands look younger!  I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent as I am very sensitive to fragrances.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands especially during the winter months and was thrilled when I read all the great reviews about Derma Topix. I was hoping it would do the trick, however while it&#x27;s not greasy neither is it moisturizing. A small amount does go a long way and it has virtually no smell so I gave it three stars, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> Derma Topix Intensive Hand Cream is a smooth and long lasting hand cream. It feels like a glove reflecting water from my hands.</li>
            <li> Very nice! Not greasy but heals and protects.</li>
            <li> Best ever. It&#x27;s the only lotion that works on dry chapped hands and around my fingernails.</li>
            <li> I have tried every product on the market for dry cracked hands from expensive to cheap. This is the most effective one I&#x27;ve ever tried. It goes on incredibly easy, smooth, no grease or stickiness. And (best part for me) it seems to last all day through multiple hand washings!</li>
            <li> Hands were soft after using this product but I did not like the tacky, hard to&lt;br /&gt;spread consistency. Would try another product or go back to my old standby Ahava.</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado. This cream really does work. Not the best ever but I have to say, I love it. A tad pricey for what you get though. Could either make it $5 cheaper or dbl the size. My opinion is if you don&#x27;t mind the price, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> This hand cream was recommended to me by a doctor. It works really well, a small amount goes a long way.  The main difference and advantage of this cream versus others is that it is not sticky. After you apply this cream, your skin feel smooth and nicely moisturized. It does not have any unwanted scent either. Last, but not least, this hand cream is made in U.S.A. Love it!</li>
            <li> I tried several products for my hands but  this is the first time the product did what it said it would do and my hands are much better</li>
            <li> Keeps your hands soft and supple even after washing a couple of times.  Not greasy feeling, absorbs well - I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> this really works my hands always are scally and crack and this makes them soft and it lasts awhile great</li>
            <li> The cream went on very smoothly and was not sticky. Very nice scent. Just started using so cannot comment on effects.</li>
            <li> Amazing product and a great seller!!! i will be back!!</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used, and that&#x27;s saying a lot because I&#x27;ve tried many. I&#x27;m in the health care field, and frequent hand washing leads to dry skin, so moisturizing is a must. Hand lotions are mostly water, and not very effective. Hand creams are thicker, but can often be greasy and can transfer.  Scented creams/lotions can lead to skin irritation. This product is a rich, thick cream, which totally soaks into your skin, so that hands are soft, but never greasy. I can apply this before bed, and still read a book without leaving fingerprints! It&#x27;s unscented, so no irritation and you don&#x27;t leave a cloud of noxious perfume when you apply it. Best of all, it stays on through several hand washings. I have tubes stashed in convenient locations at home, in my car, in my purse, and in my briefcase. It&#x27;s hand-tastic!!</li>
            <li> Purchased this hand cream due to the glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;The reality is that it does an OK job at moisturizing my hands. I prefer Strivectin.</li>
            <li> Wonderful hand cream. True to the advertisement. My hands definitely look and feel better as they stay hydrated. Good product and would order it again.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is awesome! I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> I bought this hand lotion due to some of the rave reviews.  It was okay.  It didn&#x27;t stand out, and personally, I like my Gold Bond hand lotion much better.  I pay much less for other hand lotions that feel and work better.</li>
            <li> nothing special, not very moisturizing</li>
            <li> I really like this hand cream, unfortunately there is something in it that doesn&#x27;t agree with me...It makes me itch like crazy. I won&#x27;t take stars away because it&#x27;s not the fault of the cream, but buyers should know that it is a possibility. I don&#x27;t usually have sensitive skin so I am a bit surprised that I had this type of reaction. I&#x27;ve given my tube to a neighbor who claims to really like it and so far has had no itchy reaction :0)</li>
            <li> For those of you who miss Pacquins hand cream, this is the only product that comes close. It was recommended by my dermatologist. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong aroma, so if you are looking for a perfumed hand cream this isn&#x27;t for you. But if you want an effective hand cream that doesn&#x27;t leave you hands feeling greasy, this is perfect.</li>
