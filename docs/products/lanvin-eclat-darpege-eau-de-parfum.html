            <li>The quality is great no difference than the one I smelled at a  department store, you can buy yourself 2 or 3 for the price of one at the store!</li>
            <li>It is particularly wonderful for close working environments, because the fragrance won&#x27;t enter the room before you do.</li>

            <li>So I keep it handy in my purse.</li>
            <li>Heady, leaning on warm scent.</li>
            <li>my opinion, this fragrance is suitable for ALL occasions.</li>
            <li>This is a very light scent and smells nothing like Arpege.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received so many compliments when wearing this perfume</li>
            <li>I just love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>The staying power is not the best and repeat applications are necessary.  </li>
            <li>research shows top notes include: lemon leaves and lilac.</li>
            <li>The staying power will likely be best during warmer months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to keep a vat of it, all to myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to keep a vat of it, all to myself.</li>
            <li>I have been asked from so many people about this perfume whenever I wear it.</li>
            <li>:) I had put in my 2 weeks notice in and as a gift</li>
            <li>The packaging is cute.  </li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>So good and fast !</li>
            <li>He hands me the most exotic lily; his smile is seductive.  </li>
            <li>If someone wearing this passes by, its fine.</li>
            <li>Changing to something else more fresh and light.</li>
            <li>ladies --- purchase and enjoy.</li>
            <li>If other more experienced lanvin reviewers say that it&#x27;s not supposed to smell that way</li>
            <li>The perfume has a Light sweet smell</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s fairly unique.</li>
            <li>or I got something that is not an original, then I wouldn&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gift to my cousin, she loves it and ordered form my country because she wants an original one :)</li>
            <li>and oh so special.</li>
            <li>nothing special in this bottle.</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s the super feminine, clean smell</li>
            <li>Not bad tho</li>
            <li>Just amazing , now my sister have a x-mas present!</li>
            <li>I think my fantasy is worth it, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wearing it and smelling it all day long gave me a headache because of the warm scent.</li>
            <li>light florals, with citrus, blooming into a fresh aquatic scent that is totally original and ultimately intriguing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the first spray I can close my eyes and be carried away to Paris.  </li>
            <li>If you love LB, you&#x27;re likely to lose your composure over this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, order it through Amazon it is cheaper and the real deal!</li>
            <li>But this was my first purchase for this one.</li>
            <li>It is a great scent--appropriate for the office and other public places.</li>
            <li>bottle is very pretty--just an added bonus.</li>
            <li>like lemmings, straight into the sea --- intoxicated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m suddenly at the Paris Flower Market on the River Seine; there has been a light rain, accentuating the scents.  </li>
            <li>have noted a similarity to D&amp;G&#x27;s &#x27;Light Blue&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Delivery was so fast</li>
            <li>When my hubby first smelled it he nuzzled up close, \\&quot;Wow,</li>
            <li>Only gave it a one star because I really can&#x27;t wear it.</li>
            <li>I awaken from my mind trip, because the scent has left me --- right in the middle of my &#x27;shades of gray&#x27; fantasy.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve received so many compliments when wearing this perfume</li>
            <li> It is awesome~ Good Seller</li>
            <li> Bought as a present for my wife. She used it before and i should admit it&#x27;s a good choice. Recommend.</li>
            <li> Only after applying it 8-9 times can you smell something. Also, the fragrance goes away rather soon..but not too soon.  So I keep it handy in my purse. But honestly, It&#x27;s a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a very light scent and smells nothing like Arpege. It is a great scent--appropriate for the office and other public places. However, I find myself reapplying it often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is very pretty--just an added bonus.</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells so good even my 21 year daughter loves it! The quality is great no difference than the one I smelled at a  department store, you can buy yourself 2 or 3 for the price of one at the store!</li>
            <li> I just love this perfume.  It seems so delicate and femine and this is the 2nd time I have bought it.  I would recommend it to all the ladies who like a floral fragrance.</li>
            <li> like lemmings, straight into the sea --- intoxicated. When my hubby first smelled it he nuzzled up close, \\&quot;Wow, you smell terrific, did you just get out of the shower?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s the super feminine, clean smell, that is such an attraction; light florals, with citrus, blooming into a fresh aquatic scent that is totally original and ultimately intriguing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the first spray I can close my eyes and be carried away to Paris.  I&#x27;m suddenly at the Paris Flower Market on the River Seine; there has been a light rain, accentuating the scents.  I&#x27;m dressed in casual Parisian Chic; a Bohemian styled, Lanvin maxi dress, strappy sandals. In my mind I weigh twenty pounds less, too. A vendor catches my eye; he begins to follow me. \\&quot;Excuse me, what is that fragrance you&#x27;re wearing that insults my bouquets?\\&quot;  He speaks broken English, but that doesn&#x27;t matter. He&#x27;s an image off of a bodice torn novel. He hands me the most exotic lily; his smile is seductive.  Be still, my heart. Whatever happens in Paris...stays in Paris, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I awaken from my mind trip, because the scent has left me --- right in the middle of my &#x27;shades of gray&#x27; fantasy.  Yes, this is the only grievance with my, now signature scent. The staying power is not the best and repeat applications are necessary.  I think my fantasy is worth it, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have noted a similarity to D&amp;G&#x27;s &#x27;Light Blue&#x27;. There is a resemblance, but I feel Lanvin has taken all the negatives of LB and perfected the fragrance with Eclat D&#x27;Arpege. If you love LB, you&#x27;re likely to lose your composure over this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My research shows top notes include: lemon leaves and lilac. Middle notes: wisteria, peach flowers, red peony, and Chinese Osmanthus. Base notes: white cedar, amber and sweet musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this fragrance is suitable for ALL occasions. The staying power will likely be best during warmer months. It is particularly wonderful for close working environments, because the fragrance won&#x27;t enter the room before you do. I work in health care where it is perfect and I constantly receive compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance is so fabulous, that I almost hate to shout-out to the world about it.

            <li> The perfume has a Light sweet smell And it&#x27;s fairly unique. I have been asked from so many people about this perfume whenever I wear it.</li>
            <li> I worked with a girl and every day she would come to my cubical just to smell me :) I had put in my 2 weeks notice in and as a gift I got her one, she could not believe she now owned the E&#x27;clat D&#x27;aprege, I told her when she runs out because her&#x27;s was the 1.7oz I told her do not get it from a stor, order it through Amazon it is cheaper and the real deal!</li>
            <li> I was disappointment.</li>
            <li> light and airy.  perfect for spring.</li>
            <li> Best perfume ever, very fresh and sexy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift to my cousin, she loves it and ordered form my country because she wants an original one :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scent for years.  It is expensive in the department stores but much more affordable online.  The scent is no different than the department store.  The packaging is cute.  I have nothing bad to say.</li>
            <li> Great perfume!!! I love it ! Delivery was so fast I even was surprise!!</li>
            <li> So good and fast ! Just amazing , now my sister have a x-mas present! I&#x27;m so happy ! :)</li>
            <li> Its ok. Heady, leaning on warm scent. If someone wearing this passes by, its fine. Wearing it and smelling it all day long gave me a headache because of the warm scent. It reminds me of what a woman (age 40 above) would wear around in the evening. Only gave it a one star because I really can&#x27;t wear it. Changing to something else more fresh and light. But this was my first purchase for this one. If other more experienced lanvin reviewers say that it&#x27;s not supposed to smell that way or I got something that is not an original, then I wouldn&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> b/c of the reviews I hoped it was something different and oh so special. Put on before hubby got home lol he never even noticed. Nope nothing special in this bottle. Not bad tho,  I&#x27;ll wear it.</li>
