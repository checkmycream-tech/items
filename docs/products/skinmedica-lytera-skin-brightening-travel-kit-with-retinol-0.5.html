            <li>Just ordered two more (because of the price).</li>

            <li>I will say it&#x27;s a nice small size carry on case with all the products needed to care for my skin.</li>
            <li>Now I have tried the other 3 products in the sampler and they all work just fine.</li>
            <li>I use a combination of about 2-3 different lines of skin care products, but when I got my sampler I stayed true to the Lytera in the white bottle more than the other 3 products that came with it.</li>
            <li>The product must have been old</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected and arrived the day before my trip.</li>

            <li> Lovely kit however I would have preferred a moisturizer rather than a Defense Sunscreen SPF 30.</li>
            <li> Good size samples, great way to try before spending on full size products.</li>
            <li> Loved it! It was exactly what I expected and arrived the day before my trip. Excellent product. My friend at work complimented me on my complexion today - she thought I was wearing different makeup!</li>
            <li> Very handy item for travel. Would recommend highly!</li>

            <li> I use this product line and love it.  This is perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> It is good to have travel kit while u travel. Skin Medica products always rocks!!</li>
            <li> Is great a product have seen pricier in other places. Keep up the great work</li>

            <li> Just ordered two more (because of the price). I love the way the Lytera Skin Brightener works on my skin. It seems to be much softer looking. I use a combination of about 2-3 different lines of skin care products, but when I got my sampler I stayed true to the Lytera in the white bottle more than the other 3 products that came with it. I do have to say the Lytera is a very nice product. I do think that SkinMedica in general is very expensive and the results are not so dramatic that I would gouge my pocket book again. Of course this one is super-inexpensive to give it a try. But I purchased another of their products for $181.00 bucks and even though it works fine, my Image line works just as well (for me) for a quarter of the price. Now I have tried the other 3 products in the sampler and they all work just fine.</li>
            <li> The product must have been old bk the creme was discolored.  I bought it before from my Dr. and it was not that color.</li>
            <li> Nice travel-sized versions of products I use.  I was very happy to find it.  Fast shipment, too. Thanks!</li>
