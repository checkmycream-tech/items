            <li>I used the stickers on my toenails and it looked great.</li>
            <li>but over all very cute</li>
            <li>Very elegant looking.</li>
            <li>LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li>u so much have a wonderful day</li>
            <li>but it was ok.</li>
            <li>love them thank</li>
            <li>I ordered 4 sets, they are so cute in the picture.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line is if you&#x27;re OK with your manicure looking like scotch tape decals then go for it.</li>
            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>They are cute but not quite what I thought they would be like.</li>
            <li>They also smudge like ink as soon as you try and apply a top coat.</li>
            <li>and they tear easily</li>
            <li>The price is great, especially considering the free shipping from Germany, but they are a pain in the butt.</li>
            <li>its nice, looks like real nail art done by professionals.</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s why its so cheap.</li>
            <li>Some are very large and not going to fit nails.</li>
            <li>Came to the house quickly.  </li>
            <li>They rip really easy and even with a top-coat on they wear off fast.</li>
            <li>it is certainly worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>(Peeling the sticker off the backing using tweezers is fun too...</li>
            <li>I was so excited about these decals because I love the shape, but they are really low quality!</li>
            <li>found them to not be user friendly .I am very dissapointed with this product</li>
            <li>Tricky to use at first, be patient and keep trying,  </li>
            <li>Very simple and easy.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Very cute stickers but hard to separate sticker from backing</li>
            <li>yeah, except now it looks like I have a piece of single ply toilet paper under the top coat of my nail polish -- gee,</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m used to a clear plastic backing</li>
            <li>I did it on my natural nails</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s just classy lookin&#x27;...</li>
            <li>I only wish there was more of a selection other than flowers maybe some type of design that has multiple colors.</li>
            <li>The sticker is not only visible under the TWO layers of top coat, but it also has a texture similar to said single ply toilet paper under the polish, and I can feel the edges...</li>
            <li>First, There are 4 sizes; the 3 biggest are wayy too big for my nails, and the smallest size fits, but it is so small that there&#x27;s barely any detail visible.  </li>

            <li> These stickers are really hard to take off the paper and look very washed out when they are nails</li>

            <li> Stickers do not come off without tearing. Would not recommend this product.  I as very disappointed to have to throw most of it away.</li>
            <li> its nice, looks like real nail art done by professionals. I had a little problems applying it but it was ok. also its very very big. I did it on my natural nails so I just cut it in halfs.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my Wifes business and they were a hit.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend buying this !When removing from water it binds together and breaks when you try to pull it apart . I guess that&#x27;s why its so cheap.</li>
            <li> not like said on package. couldnt get on paper</li>
            <li> These stickers are really hard to take off the paper and look very washed out when they are nails</li>
            <li> Designs to small to see in person and to hard to use.  Waste of money on my part - do not recommend</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Tricky to use at first, be patient and keep trying,  it is certainly worth the effort.  LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of these stickers... The price is great, especially considering the free shipping from Germany, but they are a pain in the butt. First, There are 4 sizes; the 3 biggest are wayy too big for my nails, and the smallest size fits, but it is so small that there&#x27;s barely any detail visible.  THEN, you have to cut them out - the directions tell you that you can do this \\&quot;roughly\\&quot; -- yeah, except now it looks like I have a piece of single ply toilet paper under the top coat of my nail polish -- gee, that&#x27;s just classy lookin&#x27;... (Peeling the sticker off the backing using tweezers is fun too... Oh and then sticking the curled up thing evenly onto the nail... Ugh)&lt;br /&gt; The sticker is not only visible under the TWO layers of top coat, but it also has a texture similar to said single ply toilet paper under the polish, and I can feel the edges... It seems like it will peel off sooner rather than later (I just put it on).  Next time, I&#x27;m just going to the pharmacy and spending a couple extra bucks for something that I can see in person - I suggest you do the same.</li>
            <li> Very cute stickers but hard to separate sticker from backing and they tear easily but over all very cute and I got lots of compliments</li>
            <li> love them thank you cant wait2 show my nails off they look so beautiful thank u so much have a wonderful day</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 sets, they are so cute in the picture.  Bottom line is if you&#x27;re OK with your manicure looking like scotch tape decals then go for it.</li>
            <li> Love them.  No issues.  Very simple and easy.  Came to the house quickly.  Would purchase them again.  Very elegant looking.</li>
            <li> They look too complicated. They&#x27;re beautiful! They come on brown paper and I&#x27;m used to a clear plastic backing so I can&#x27;t see how they will look.</li>
            <li> I will not buy again .I found them to not be user friendly .I am very dissapointed with this product</li>
            <li> They are cute but not quite what I thought they would be like. Some are very large and not going to fit nails.</li>

            <li> I was a little skeptical when I ordered these nail tattoo stickers. Once I used them my worries were no more! I used the stickers on my toenails and it looked great. I gave them a 4 instead of a 5 because I ripped part of the tattoo when I pulled it off of the backing so be very careful when using them. I will definitely order them again. I only wish there was more of a selection other than flowers maybe some type of design that has multiple colors.</li>
