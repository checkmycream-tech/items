            <li>It looks so cute, and I get compliments on it every time I wear it.</li>
            <li>It is really cute on my head but the metal prices get stuck in my hair when I take it out.</li>
            <li>I just received this item and I love it.</li>
            <li>It has quickly become my favorite headband</li>
            <li>So if I were you secure it so it doesn&#x27;t slide or anything</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache</li>
            <li>It seems to be of good quality and fits the adult head well.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair back and very stylish.</li>
            <li>This broke the first time I tried to wear it, as the elastic doesn&#x27;t have very much give.</li>
            <li>The product itself is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty, but broke the first time I tried it on</li>
            <li>I gave to my cousin whos 4 years old and it fit her like a glove.</li>
            <li>it fell apart upon the first use.</li>
            <li>It looks really good with messy buns.</li>
            <li>it was easy to put back together</li>
            <li>Its sturdy and the band expands easily for the larger headed females.</li>
            <li>If it was a little bit bigger, I would give it a better review because it is cute-</li>
            <li>Sometimes get stuck in your hair, but I haven&#x27;t found it to be much of a problem.</li>
            <li>the way most other headbands do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice but it is very tight and gets caught in my hair.</li>
            <li>but I feel it gives the headband more grip so it won&#x27;t slide down.</li>
            <li>The head band is beautiful but is a little heavy.</li>
            <li>I got this in the mail the other day and tried it on right away.</li>
            <li>Once I slipped it on my head and moved to adjust it, the black headband component popped right in my hand while I was still in the car before I could get out and go to an event.  </li>
            <li>I have an abnormally small head (being totally honest here) and this is REALLY tight on me.  </li>
            <li>and I wear a lot of headbands and it still have me a headache after the first half hour.</li>
            <li>you have to re due your whole hair style.</li>
            <li>She cautioned me that she had purchased the exact product a few months before, and as soon as she went to wear it, it snapped over her head.</li>

            <li> /&gt;It was beautiful don&#x27;t get me wrong, but incredibly poorly made.  </li>
            <li> Very tight fitting and poorly made.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to stretch too much so it can be a little tight.</li>
            <li> I heard many people said is fragile and was broken immediately, but mine is very small, and i ca&#x27;t put it on ; I have to replace the elastic</li>
            <li> and it still works, so just be extra careful!</li>
            <li> Delivery took a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have been very careful with putting it on as it is very fragile</li>
            <li> Of course it&#x27;s not real gold</li>
            <li> I have bought quite a few headbands recently and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just careful putting it on and taking it off.</li>
            <li> be careful if you want the item to last.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping took less than a month, which I can&#x27;t complain about since it had a long trip to make!</li>
            <li> I found that it was very careful with it because I felt like I would break it.</li>
            <li> So my warning is to just be very careful with it.</li>
            <li> I feel my head is average in size, but trying to stretch this to put it on snapped one of the connectors immediately.</li>
            <li> ~Takes a little while to receive,worth the wait~</li>
            <li> The little notches that connect the metal flowers catch my hair and it hurts to get my hair out of the headband.</li>
            <li> I was annoyed from the beginning of the transaction it took almost a month to come standard mail all the way from</li>
            <li> I  got what was in the photo, but it snap after a few months.</li>
            <li> I worried about a metal headband being uncomfortable but I actually barely notice it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> It is also very tight around my head</li>
            <li> It was a bit small for my head, so I had to take off the elastic band &amp; put another one on</li>
            <li> but if you have a normal size head, don&#x27;t waste your money :(</li>
            <li> I know this not because I had to learn the hard way, but my roommate immediately warned me as I ripped it fresh-out-of-the-package and went to shove it around my head.</li>
            <li> Way to small!</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was upset, won&#x27;t purchase again...</li>
            <li> Too bad as I did like the look of it!</li>

            <li> I heard many people said is fragile and was broken immediately, but mine is very small, and i ca&#x27;t put it on ; I have to replace the elastic</li>
            <li> The shipping take like a month but i love is so cute 100% happy ðŸ‘Œ</li>

            <li> Fragile isn&#x27;t the word... The second I slipped it in my head, it popped.  I was annoyed from the beginning of the transaction it took almost a month to come standard mail all the way from China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was beautiful don&#x27;t get me wrong, but incredibly poorly made.  Once I slipped it on my head and moved to adjust it, the black headband component popped right in my hand while I was still in the car before I could get out and go to an event.  Needless to say I was upset, won&#x27;t purchase again... And I would tell you to save every drop of your pennies and don&#x27;t even bother</li>
            <li> Very tight fitting and poorly made.</li>
            <li> Love it ! I don&#x27;t know about how everybody says it&#x27;s fragile. Just learn how to put it on &amp; you&#x27;ll love it. It does pull on hair but I feel it gives the headband more grip so it won&#x27;t slide down. Bought 2 already. But don&#x27;t wear it so often it tends to turn coppery. Of course it&#x27;s not real gold</li>
            <li> Received compliments. I have been very careful with putting it on as it is very fragile</li>
            <li> It was a bit small for my head, so I had to take off the elastic band &amp; put another one on</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful headband, fits great</li>
            <li> I love how good it looks in my hair. It looks really good with messy buns. I love how it stretches. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the roses have like a hook thing on them so it gets tangled in your hair and if you try to take it out you have to re due your whole hair style. So if I were you secure it so it doesn&#x27;t slide or anything so all you have to do is take it out before you go to bed.</li>
            <li> Very good quality for the price. love it â™¥</li>
            <li> I have an abnormally small head (being totally honest here) and this is REALLY tight on me.  I can&#x27;t wear it because it gives me a headache.  If it was a little bit bigger, I would give it a better review because it is cute- but if you have a normal size head, don&#x27;t waste your money :(</li>
            <li> The product itself is exactly as described. It seems to be of good quality and fits the adult head well. Sometimes get stuck in your hair, but I haven&#x27;t found it to be much of a problem. It is comfortable and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache the way most other headbands do. It has quickly become my favorite headband and I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> ~Love this necklace~Fits nice and good Quality~Takes a little while to receive,worth the wait~</li>
            <li> I have bought quite a few headbands recently and this is one of my favorites. It is exactly as pictured. I worried about a metal headband being uncomfortable but I actually barely notice it&#x27;s there. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> Cute you might have a technicality with it but nothing a set of pliers won&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li> I broke the first time I used it. I could fix it. It&#x27;s beauti but you should make it stronger</li>
            <li> its beautiful and worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Looks just like the picture</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, but broke the first time I tried it on</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail the other day and tried it on right away. I found that it was very careful with it because I felt like I would break it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to stretch too much so it can be a little tight. It is still beautiful and I loved the way it looked. I&#x27;m just careful putting it on and taking it off.</li>
            <li> My daughter wears this around her head and across her forehead ~ cute! I don&#x27;t think it would stay in place as a traditional headband, but that&#x27;s not what she wanted.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these, and I can not stop wearing it. It looks so cute, and I get compliments on it every time I wear it. The only two issues I have with it are that it tends to get caught in my hair. The little notches that connect the metal flowers catch my hair and it hurts to get my hair out of the headband. It&#x27;s also very fragile. Now every time it&#x27;s broke it was easy to put back together and once it&#x27;s in your hair it won&#x27;t snap, it&#x27;s once your taking it off or putting it on. So my warning is to just be very careful with it. I&#x27;ve had mine for about two months and it still works, so just be extra careful!</li>
            <li> The headband is dazzling and attractive, but very fragile, as well. I know this not because I had to learn the hard way, but my roommate immediately warned me as I ripped it fresh-out-of-the-package and went to shove it around my head. She cautioned me that she had purchased the exact product a few months before, and as soon as she went to wear it, it snapped over her head. That hasn&#x27;t happened to me yet, but it is a wise forewarning: be careful if you want the item to last.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.&lt;br /&gt;It was a dollar or two, so you get what you pay for anyhow.</li>
            <li> It is really cute on my head but the metal prices get stuck in my hair when I take it out. It is also very tight around my head and I wear a lot of headbands and it still have me a headache after the first half hour.</li>
            <li> I just received this item and I love it. It&#x27;s jewelry for your hair. Its sturdy and the band expands easily for the larger headed females. Nice shiny bright color, very nice piece of hair flash</li>
            <li> Way to small! I gave to my cousin whos 4 years old and it fit her like a glove.</li>
            <li> This broke the first time I tried to wear it, as the elastic doesn&#x27;t have very much give. I feel my head is average in size, but trying to stretch this to put it on snapped one of the connectors immediately. Too bad as I did like the look of it!</li>
            <li> it fell apart upon the first use. big dissapointment</li>
            <li> Great value!! Shipping took less than a month, which I can&#x27;t complain about since it had a long trip to make! Love the headband!</li>
            <li> I  got what was in the photo, but it snap after a few months.</li>
            <li> The head band is beautiful but is a little heavy.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair back and very stylish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but it is very tight and gets caught in my hair.</li>
