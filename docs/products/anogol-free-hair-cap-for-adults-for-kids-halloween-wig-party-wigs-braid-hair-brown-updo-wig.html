            <li>Excellent quality wig!  </li>
            <li>very good quality for the price</li>
            <li>Beautiful Wig.</li>
            <li>Great quality.</li>
            <li>The wig itself is well made, and it looks good.  </li>
            <li>great for dress up going forward :))</li>
            <li>Perfect - delivered quickly and with nice quality</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Cute and nice for the price!</li>
            <li>There is no way this wig should get more than two stars.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t covery all the way to my ears, you see the cap under the bangs and the more I try to adjust the wig, the more plastic hair falls out.  </li>
            <li>BUT this is my third Amazon purchase of an Anna wig and this was the best of the bunch.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s perfect though!!</li>
            <li>I have never received so many compliments on my hair as I did wearing this week.</li>
            <li>One man told me, &amp;#34;Your hair is esquisite&amp;#34; and others said, &amp;#34;I love your hair that way, you should wear that style more often&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The wig is much better than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely adorable.  </li>
            <li>My daughter loved it for Halloween although the bun was alittle heavy lol!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t able to use it for Halloween,  which was ok because I Learned to do the coronation hair myself but was just going to keep the wig for my daughter to play dress up.  </li>
            <li>The wig is beautiful but way to smal and the bun is far too high---not like the picture.</li>
            <li>Fantastic wig.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a wig extention type design where you wear it to look like you have more hair that matches your natural hair.</li>
            <li>It looks cool but was a surprise.</li>
            <li>Very Very Pretty hair and very very reasonable in price.</li>
            <li>Tore a hole right in the cap.  </li>
            <li>Would fit a child but not an adult.</li>
            <li>First it was shipped two weeks before Halloween</li>
            <li>Might fit a 13 year old.  </li>
            <li>Might be better for a person younger than 18 who hasn&#x27;t fully grown yet.</li>
            <li>This would fit on a child, not an adult.  </li>
            <li>People who know me, know I don&#x27;t have that much hair</li>
            <li>But, people who didn&#x27;t know me thought it was my real hair.</li>
            <li>I so wish I had that much hair.</li>
            <li>But how gentle is a seven year old</li>
            <li>Wig held up pretty well through 2 fall festivals, 2 trunk or treats, and finally trick or treating.  </li>
            <li>However the blonde highlight for Annas hair is a light pink.</li>
            <li>Nearly perfect!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used it for a 7 year old&#x27;s Anna costume.</li>
            <li>Order early, shipping takes a while.</li>
            <li>Got several compliments and comments from people about how realistic &amp;#34;Anna&#x27;s&amp;#34; hair was.</li>
            <li>After ordering it 4 weeks earlier,  there was glue that held the bun part to the main piece</li>
            <li>I was surprised that this is slightly different than the picture.</li>
            <li>Not a good fit at all (to big for my seven year old)</li>
            <li>pretty heavy on the head</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Glue shows, the white strand is actually pink</li>
            <li> This wig took soooooo long to get here.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am super bummed out and sending it back.</li>
            <li> , not fittng an adult size head , too small</li>
            <li> Not at all as pictured and it was a huge disappointment for my granddaughter, who wanted to use it for a Halloween costume.</li>
            <li> the wig itself is beautiful...but not quite as expected</li>
            <li> It is definitely not for adults unless they have very small heads.</li>
            <li> Bun is too heavy and just pulls wig backwards</li>
            <li> Wig was way to small.</li>
            <li> The wig was too small anyway.</li>
            <li> This item was poorly packaged and arrived a mess.</li>
            <li> The wig is hardly designed for adults.</li>
            <li> It at least covered my hair line.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it is WAY too small!</li>
            <li> , she was disappointed, I tried it on, and it was big for my head and also it was heavy.</li>
            <li> By the time you get the wig on the elastic hooks snap apart and latch onto the poorly designed wig cap.</li>
            <li> and you could see glue smears along the base of the bun where it attached as well as a long the too of the bun...</li>
            <li> sad part is, the size runs very small for my head. :(</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed...</li>
            <li> and she hate it</li>

            <li> Wig was way to small. Would fit a child but not an adult.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who wrights these reviews, but this wig is horrible. First it was shipped two weeks before Halloween and I didn&#x27;t receive it until two days ago. I tried it on my daughter and she hate it, she was disappointed, I tried it on, and it was big for my head and also it was heavy. There is no way this wig should get more than two stars.</li>
            <li> The wig is beautiful but way to smal and the bun is far too high---not like the picture.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that this is slightly different than the picture. It is definitely not for adults unless they have very small heads. the wig itself is beautiful...but not quite as expected</li>
            <li> The wig is hardly designed for adults. I&#x27;m not a big person in any way shape or form. I read that it has adjustable elastic, so I bought it.  The elastic isn is not stitched into the inner fabric of the wig like elastic pants would be.  It&#x27;s a strap that you clip.  It wouldn&#x27;t have been an issue if it did it&#x27;s job. The elastic straps hook together like the straps on an adjustable bra.  By the time you get the wig on the elastic hooks snap apart and latch onto the poorly designed wig cap. Tore a hole right in the cap.  The wig was too small anyway. Might fit a 13 year old.  The only way the wig could work is if I bleached my hair.  It&#x27;s more of a wig extention type design where you wear it to look like you have more hair that matches your natural hair. It doesn&#x27;t covery all the way to my ears, you see the cap under the bangs and the more I try to adjust the wig, the more plastic hair falls out.  I don&#x27;t plan on buying wigs from this vendor again for myself. Might be better for a person younger than 18 who hasn&#x27;t fully grown yet.</li>
            <li> Not a good fit at all (to big for my seven year old) and it arrived much later than I expected.</li>
            <li> Very Very Pretty hair and very very reasonable in price.</li>
            <li> Glue shows, the white strand is actually pink BUT this is my third Amazon purchase of an Anna wig and this was the best of the bunch. It at least covered my hair line.</li>
            <li> The quality is spot on! Love it! Nearly perfect!&lt;br /&gt;The sad part is, the size runs very small for my head. :(</li>
            <li> This item was poorly packaged and arrived a mess. Not at all as pictured and it was a huge disappointment for my granddaughter, who wanted to use it for a Halloween costume.</li>
            <li> very good quality for the price</li>
            <li> Fantastic wig. However the blonde highlight for Annas hair is a light pink. It looks cool but was a surprise. Overall it&#x27;s perfect though!!</li>
            <li> bangs are way too short, not fittng an adult size head , too small</li>
            <li> Cute and nice for the price!</li>
            <li> I have never received so many compliments on my hair as I did wearing this week. One man told me, &amp;#34;Your hair is esquisite&amp;#34; and others said, &amp;#34;I love your hair that way, you should wear that style more often&amp;#34;. People who know me, know I don&#x27;t have that much hair so they figured out it was a wig. But, people who didn&#x27;t know me thought it was my real hair. I so wish I had that much hair. Beautiful Wig. Thank you,</li>
            <li> Part of my daughter&#x27;s Halloween costume.  The wig is much better than I thought it would be.  My daughter loves it and cannot wait for Halloween so she can dress up as Anna.</li>
            <li> Bun is too heavy and just pulls wig backwards</li>
            <li> pretty heavy on the head</li>
            <li> Excellent quality wig!  Used it for a 7 year old&#x27;s Anna costume. Wig held up pretty well through 2 fall festivals, 2 trunk or treats, and finally trick or treating.  Only issue was that hair started pulling out of the wig after the second ware.  But how gentle is a seven year old gonna be with it?  Would recommend this wig company to anybody and everybody. Got several compliments and comments from people about how realistic &amp;#34;Anna&#x27;s&amp;#34; hair was. Order early, shipping takes a while.</li>
            <li> I received the wig about a week before Halloween. After ordering it 4 weeks earlier,  there was glue that held the bun part to the main piece and you could see glue smears along the base of the bun where it attached as well as a long the too of the bun... it looked terrible. Didn&#x27;t end up wearing it and I&#x27;m totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> Absolutely adorable.  Great quality.</li>
            <li> The wig itself is well made, and it looks good.  However, it&#x27;s itchy as heck.  Not to mention it is WAY too small! This would fit on a child, not an adult.  I&#x27;m really disappointed...</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it for Halloween although the bun was alittle heavy lol! great for dress up going forward :))</li>
            <li> This wig took soooooo long to get here. Wasn&#x27;t able to use it for Halloween,  which was ok because I Learned to do the coronation hair myself but was just going to keep the wig for my daughter to play dress up.  The supposed to be white streak in the hair is actually a pinkish color and the lace inside was ripped. Needless to say, I am super bummed out and sending it back.</li>
            <li> Perfect - delivered quickly and with nice quality</li>
