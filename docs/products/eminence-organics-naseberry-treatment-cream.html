            <li>A little thicker than expected but excellent results!</li>
            <li>It is not as fragrant as the Naseberry body lotion, but you wouldn&#x27;t want a cream too strong on the face next to the nose all night.  </li>

            <li>Delivery was fast, no complaints, have recommended to my friends.  </li>

            <li>and I love the fact that they are not full of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>My skin broke out when I used this product - gave it to my teenage son and his skin really improved</li>
            <li>Exactly what i expected</li>
            <li>and it arrived 5 days earlier, i live in UK.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating for this very dry winter.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft, and helps with my dry skin.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I am partial to any Eminence product.  Naseberry did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer. Doesn&#x27;t feel oily, soaks in really well and as always with Eminence, smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a dear friend for Christmas.  Every year I buy her a couple Eminence products. The smell is wonderful like melon, or fresh berries.It is not as fragrant as the Naseberry body lotion, but you wouldn&#x27;t want a cream too strong on the face next to the nose all night.  There is a tiny citrus edge in there too.  As with all their products they are safe and worry free. This cream is silky and melts into the skin.  You notice a difference right away in skin texture..My friend was very pleased. This company that sent the order was super quick, and sent samples as well.  I like that!</li>
            <li> Nice product with great aroma! A little thicker than expected but excellent results! Best for night cream. Can be combined with serum for even better results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this treatment cream for several years at night before I go to sleep. It makes my skin feel soft, and helps with my dry skin. Great price on amazon, and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time, non-greasy, great when used as under-base to foundation. I use this under MakeUp Forever foundation and get a flawless finish. Does not break me out. I would give it 5 starts instead of 4 if I liked the smell better. Does not smell bad, Naseberry is just not my scent preference in skin care creams.</li>
            <li> My skin broke out when I used this product - gave it to my teenage son and his skin really improved</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this item - seems greasy. I used it two times and will not use it again.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product was as described and new in the box. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I love Eminence products.  They feel so great on my skin and I love the fact that they are not full of chemicals.  This has  strongish smell but I think it&#x27;s a very nice smell - berry like.  It does a good job as a day moisturizer.  I&#x27;m very happy with it and would certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li> I try to use this x2 daily, but often use it at least once daily and skin looks very plumped up. reduces some fine lines also. love this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best face cream ever! Very hydrating for this very dry winter. I love that I can buy this product for leaps and bounds less on Amazon then at the spa. I give this product two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Have been using this cream for a couple of years now and I love the way it makes me look and feel. Love Eninence products.</li>
            <li> Great seller! Exactly what i expected and it arrived 5 days earlier, i live in UK. Very happy with my order!</li>
            <li> I am 60 and am told I look 45. Eminence is amazing. Try their scrub in the bottle...fabulous too! Seriously&lt;br /&gt;I would love to rep this product.</li>
            <li> After one week I can already see a difference!!! Delivery was fast, no complaints, have recommended to my friends.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> A very good face cream for day and night! Absorbs very well and is light, not heavy like some rich creams</li>
            <li> Great product! Noticed a difference in the condition of my skin after using this after just a couple of weeks. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Zero stars. After hearing so much about altered or imitation product on line, I was careful to check the seal on my Naseberry Treatment purchase. Not sealed. Just not worth the risk -- and certainly not worth the money. Avoid this seller: FineBeauty. Will be returning product and trying again with another seller.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cream! It&#x27;s very dry where I live in the winter, and my skin has been so tight and flaky. However, I have combination skin, so most creams tend to break me out on my chin. This cream does not! It&#x27;s the perfect blend of super moisturizing without clogging my pores. And it smells divine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this night cream for about a month now. I have normal/combo t-area skin. This thick product just soaks onto my face and isn&#x27;t oily. The look &amp; feel of my skin is softer. I love going to bed smelling like naseberry.</li>
