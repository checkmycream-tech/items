            <li>Good standby soap</li>

            <li>Happy to be able to stock up by buying on-line.</li>

            <li>Love it as I always have!</li>
            <li>Nothing is better for me and my family!</li>
            <li>I do wash my hands four or more times a day!</li>
            <li>It is a great size/price for that use, and it is easy to store.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, cleans well &amp; smells great!</li>
            <li>I liked the smell and the feeling after you use it a lot.</li>
            <li>I bought with Borax and washing soda to make my own laundry detergent</li>
            <li>Nice price</li>
            <li>I purchased this to make my own laundry soap.  </li>
            <li>it contains potentially hazardous fragrance and TETRASODIUM EDTA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice to have it delivered.....</li>
            <li>Cleared up my complexion nicely.  </li>
            <li>Leaves me squeaky clean and great value for my money.</li>
            <li>Always an excellent product for a good price especially when you subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>(Although I should probably look in to some liquid soaps to see if there are any good ones that wash off clean)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like body washes, because you&#x27;re paying to package, haul, then use mostly water; and they&#x27;re VERY easy to overuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better for the shower than the 3.1 oz.</li>
            <li>This soap is great in that it is inexpensive, doesn&#x27;t smell much, and doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily.</li>
            <li>And the soap smells ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>We have bought many packages and will continue buying from this company.  </li>
            <li>was getting a better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I prefer Ivory, and basically always have, because it doesn&#x27;t contain fragrances and oils that fill most soaps.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>you looked at the ingredients of your favorite body wash?</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My husband cannot use many soaps on the market because of the perfumes etc.  </li>
            <li>In an emergency setting, it can be used for so much more than body soap: washing hair, clothes, dishes.  </li>
            <li>, I think these are better choices (though more expensive):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I ended up using most of the bars for felted soap presents.</li>
            <li>SO NOW I BUY IT AND HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR MANY YEARS AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT.</li>
            <li>Awesome and inexpensive facial cleanser!  </li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>I think I just moved on to more perfumed soaps... until the allergies</li>
            <li>very satisied-very happy with product</li>
            <li>This is my favorite soap.</li>
            <li>excellent value and larger size bar then in supermarkets.</li>
            <li>It keeps the whole family nice and clean for a great price.  </li>
            <li>Its soap, we stay clean, it is a great price (if its the add on offer from Amazon) and its about a yrs worth for the house</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>I used this soap first at my friend&#x27;s apartment and it was really good.</li>
            <li>This Soap is excellent for people with very oily faces as it removes oil very well IMO.</li>
            <li>I love it and enjoy having the added bonus that it floats in the tub.  </li>
            <li>The reasonable price is good for the amount of bars delivered.</li>
            <li>I love the brisk, clean scent of this soap.</li>
            <li>I love the clean smell of this soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy for fibers from towels and additives in soap that stay on the skin to get transferred to contact lenses and irritate the eyes.  </li>
            <li>makes it so easy</li>
            <li>figure by the time you&#x27;ve made the leap to buying soap on Amazon, you&#x27;re likely already familiar with your own soap preferences, so the bottom line on this particular item is this: it&#x27;s the best price per ounce.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sure rich and clean smelling.  </li>
            <li>Not to mislead, there IS a light fragrance for both the original and aloe versions, but not overly strong.</li>
            <li>It is a cheap soap, it cleans but gives no lather n feels cheap.</li>
            <li>Coco Castile Bar Soap, Fragrance Free 4 oz</li>
            <li>I like the convenience of having it shipped free two day shipping to my front door, too.</li>
            <li>I buy more than one bar at a time because sometimes I run out and forget to get more when I&#x27;m at the real store.</li>
            <li>The soap was packed in the original wrap.</li>
            <li>started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the switch about 6 months ago, and so far, I am very pleased with Ivory soap.  </li>
            <li>Besides that, it gives you a clean clean.</li>
            <li>leaves your skin clean and you not smelling like a fragrance store exploded onto you.</li>
            <li>It is a bit more \\&quot;drying\\&quot; to my skin, but I tend to have more \\&quot;oily\\&quot; skin, so that hasn&#x27;t been a problem so far.  </li>
            <li>Nothing else leaves my skin feeling as  clean as Ivory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it lathers up well, and it leaves you feeling clean as a whistle without any filmy feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li>Love Ivory soap and the large bars.</li>
            <li>It has a clean, mild smell.  </li>
            <li>and I do like some of the fresh scents that are available in soaps like Lever.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good, basic soap and suits my needs well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fresh and clean, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>*so fresh and so clean</li>
            <li>That way even kids or adults with mild allergies to scented soaps can use these.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good old reasonably priced Ivory.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good soap, it does not have all those additives that dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>only thing holding me from a higher rating is that there used to be a cheaper package still, with MANY more bars of soap.</li>
            <li>Ivory soap is useful for cleaning almost every part of my body.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t have to be a fresh stain, though that is preferred.</li>
            <li>The size is right.  </li>
            <li>Also we give them in gift boxes to the local shelters and they are great because they have low allergic reactions.</li>
            <li>It was so soft and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This soap inexpensive and works very well for us!</li>
            <li>And  it is the whole Perfume thing!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Nothing like a hot shower with Ivory soap.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it was the first thing I thought about when I ordered this 10-count package of Ivory soap.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time comparing prices since I use this soap to make my own washing detergent.</li>
            <li>that way they don&#x27;t run the risk of losing their soap after the first wash.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE BIG BARS!</li>
            <li>After a little research, I found that this \\&quot;pure\\&quot; soap is not as good &amp; pure as I thought.</li>
            <li>This is by far the most natural out there on the market today...</li>
            <li>The bars wear down quickly, but I love this soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild on my skin and it retains my natural skin tone.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get to the  local super store much anymore, so I have started doing some of this type of shopping on Amazon and similar sites, and the deal I got here was as good if not better than those huge super places, with none of the hassle.</li>
            <li>Thank you for keeping Ivory pure.</li>
            <li>My Face Pure Olive Oil Bar Soap, 8-Ounce Bars (Pack of 8)]]&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a decent value; but I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better than just going ahead and buying the smaller bars at a store with a decent price.</li>
            <li>And thank goodness Amazon sells it, because Walgreens has stopped selling the bars and only sells the liquid version, which might or might not be fine sensitivity-wise (probably not), but I&#x27;d really like to avoid soap that comes in a plastic bottle.</li>
            <li>We now have it in our own bed down by the feet!</li>
            <li>BUT, what I really wanted this for is emergency preparedness.  </li>
            <li>Ivory soap is as gentle as they say.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very drying on your skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most other commercial soaps that are easily available in the US and find that they don&#x27;t satisfy me.</li>
            <li>kids like to use, only the original</li>
            <li>This is the only soap I can find that doesn&#x27;t smell perfumey, just clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works great on sensitive skin and won&#x27;t dry you out like some other bar soaps do.</li>
            <li>Ivory soap is a classic  </li>
            <li>The size of these bars was also decent for the price.</li>
            <li>Who would not like the classic scent of Iviory soap.  </li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s why it famously floats), each bar does not last as long as other more dense soaps can.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Smelled kind of like Irish Spring to me a bit, but this leaves a film on your skin, AND the actual packaging sticks to the soap, the paper it&#x27;s wrapped in is wet/damp, and some of the outside bars smell like cat piss.</li>
            <li>No complaint.</li>
            <li>Like most bar soap it gets messy in the soap dish.</li>
            <li>Been using it forever, love the feel and everyday use of it.  </li>
            <li>the price is in the average, maybe you can find lower price in other stores, good purchase.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I do not use Ivory soap as my daily soap - it is a little to drying for my skin</li>
            <li>he said maybe they changed to a new version...</li>
            <li>When you have a social agenda such as I do you need to be clean and not smell like you just crawed through a sewer pipe like on the episode of Family Guy that spoofed the Shawshank Redemption.</li>
            <li>She has very sensitive skin and soap with dyes causes her to itch and will sometimes give her a rash.  </li>
            <li>Some dry out my skin after use (regardless of how much moisture they seem to impart at the time), some have odors that seem pleasant in the shower or at the sink but later simply do not, and some are seemingly made of so little substance that 4 ounces can disappear in twice as much time as Ivory.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And, it doesn&#x27;t hurt my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>He has been using Ivory since he was burned as a young boy.  </li>
            <li>You just can&#x27;t beat natural soap...</li>
            <li>never appreciated Ivory more than when I had bought some glycerin soap and left it six months in the cabinet, only to find out that it went rancid.  </li>
            <li>The Ivory soap is worth the money, the bars of soap is smaller then a regular bar of soap, i will buy again.</li>
            <li>I do use it as a body soap too, especially when I want to feel really clean - but daily use would be drying on my skin, especially in winter.</li>
            <li>My husband is extremely chemically sensitive and Ivory original is the only bar soap his body can tolerate.</li>
            <li>Well satisfied as usual with Ivory soap and use it regularly.</li>
            <li>I am extremely sensitive to scents and body care ingredients, and probably if I were trying Ivory for the first time now, I&#x27;d have the same problems I have with practically every other product.</li>
            <li>It does seem like the bars were around high humidity at some point; the wrapper was unusually difficult to remove from most of the bars.</li>
            <li>(apparently).  </li>
            <li>When he smelled the soap, he told me that I bought the wrong kind</li>
            <li>Ivory soap doesn&#x27;t alter my complexion the way some other soap bars do like pure glycerin, cocoa butter, and shea butter soaps.</li>
            <li>This is the only soap I have used for as far back as I can remember!</li>
            <li>Always a very reliable basic quality soap, mild non irritating.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t like body washes, because you&#x27;re paying to package, haul, then use mostly water; and they&#x27;re VERY easy to overuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better for the shower than the 3.1 oz.</li>
            <li> This soap is great in that it is inexpensive, doesn&#x27;t smell much, and doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily.</li>
            <li> And the soap smells ok.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> We have bought many packages and will continue buying from this company.  </li>
            <li> was getting a better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer Ivory, and basically always have, because it doesn&#x27;t contain fragrances and oils that fill most soaps.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> you looked at the ingredients of your favorite body wash?</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My husband cannot use many soaps on the market because of the perfumes etc.  </li>
            <li> In an emergency setting, it can be used for so much more than body soap: washing hair, clothes, dishes.  </li>
            <li> , I think these are better choices (though more expensive):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I ended up using most of the bars for felted soap presents.</li>
            <li> SO NOW I BUY IT AND HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR MANY YEARS AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT.</li>
            <li> Awesome and inexpensive facial cleanser!  </li>
            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> I think I just moved on to more perfumed soaps... until the allergies</li>
            <li> very satisied-very happy with product</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap.</li>
            <li> excellent value and larger size bar then in supermarkets.</li>
            <li> It keeps the whole family nice and clean for a great price.  </li>
            <li> Its soap, we stay clean, it is a great price (if its the add on offer from Amazon) and its about a yrs worth for the house</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> I used this soap first at my friend&#x27;s apartment and it was really good.</li>
            <li> This Soap is excellent for people with very oily faces as it removes oil very well IMO.</li>
            <li> I love it and enjoy having the added bonus that it floats in the tub.  </li>
            <li> The reasonable price is good for the amount of bars delivered.</li>
            <li> I love the brisk, clean scent of this soap.</li>
            <li> I love the clean smell of this soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy for fibers from towels and additives in soap that stay on the skin to get transferred to contact lenses and irritate the eyes.  </li>
            <li> makes it so easy</li>
            <li> figure by the time you&#x27;ve made the leap to buying soap on Amazon, you&#x27;re likely already familiar with your own soap preferences, so the bottom line on this particular item is this: it&#x27;s the best price per ounce.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sure rich and clean smelling.  </li>
            <li> Not to mislead, there IS a light fragrance for both the original and aloe versions, but not overly strong.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap soap, it cleans but gives no lather n feels cheap.</li>
            <li> Coco Castile Bar Soap, Fragrance Free 4 oz</li>
            <li> I like the convenience of having it shipped free two day shipping to my front door, too.</li>
            <li> I buy more than one bar at a time because sometimes I run out and forget to get more when I&#x27;m at the real store.</li>
            <li> The soap was packed in the original wrap.</li>
            <li> started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the switch about 6 months ago, and so far, I am very pleased with Ivory soap.  </li>
            <li> Besides that, it gives you a clean clean.</li>
            <li> leaves your skin clean and you not smelling like a fragrance store exploded onto you.</li>
            <li> It is a bit more \\&quot;drying\\&quot; to my skin, but I tend to have more \\&quot;oily\\&quot; skin, so that hasn&#x27;t been a problem so far.  </li>
            <li> Nothing else leaves my skin feeling as  clean as Ivory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it lathers up well, and it leaves you feeling clean as a whistle without any filmy feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li> Love Ivory soap and the large bars.</li>
            <li> It has a clean, mild smell.  </li>
            <li> and I do like some of the fresh scents that are available in soaps like Lever.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good, basic soap and suits my needs well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fresh and clean, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> *so fresh and so clean</li>
            <li> That way even kids or adults with mild allergies to scented soaps can use these.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Good old reasonably priced Ivory.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a good soap, it does not have all those additives that dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> only thing holding me from a higher rating is that there used to be a cheaper package still, with MANY more bars of soap.</li>
            <li> Ivory soap is useful for cleaning almost every part of my body.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have to be a fresh stain, though that is preferred.</li>
            <li> The size is right.  </li>
            <li> Also we give them in gift boxes to the local shelters and they are great because they have low allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> It was so soft and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This soap inexpensive and works very well for us!</li>
            <li> And  it is the whole Perfume thing!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Nothing like a hot shower with Ivory soap.</li>
            <li> Anyway, it was the first thing I thought about when I ordered this 10-count package of Ivory soap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time comparing prices since I use this soap to make my own washing detergent.</li>
            <li> that way they don&#x27;t run the risk of losing their soap after the first wash.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE BIG BARS!</li>
            <li> After a little research, I found that this \\&quot;pure\\&quot; soap is not as good &amp; pure as I thought.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most natural out there on the market today...</li>
            <li> The bars wear down quickly, but I love this soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild on my skin and it retains my natural skin tone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get to the  local super store much anymore, so I have started doing some of this type of shopping on Amazon and similar sites, and the deal I got here was as good if not better than those huge super places, with none of the hassle.</li>
            <li> Thank you for keeping Ivory pure.</li>
            <li> My Face Pure Olive Oil Bar Soap, 8-Ounce Bars (Pack of 8)]]&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a decent value; but I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better than just going ahead and buying the smaller bars at a store with a decent price.</li>
            <li> And thank goodness Amazon sells it, because Walgreens has stopped selling the bars and only sells the liquid version, which might or might not be fine sensitivity-wise (probably not), but I&#x27;d really like to avoid soap that comes in a plastic bottle.</li>
            <li> We now have it in our own bed down by the feet!</li>
            <li> BUT, what I really wanted this for is emergency preparedness.  </li>
            <li> Ivory soap is as gentle as they say.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very drying on your skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most other commercial soaps that are easily available in the US and find that they don&#x27;t satisfy me.</li>
            <li> kids like to use, only the original</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I can find that doesn&#x27;t smell perfumey, just clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works great on sensitive skin and won&#x27;t dry you out like some other bar soaps do.</li>
            <li> Ivory soap is a classic  </li>
            <li> The size of these bars was also decent for the price.</li>
            <li> Who would not like the classic scent of Iviory soap.  </li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s why it famously floats), each bar does not last as long as other more dense soaps can.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Smelled kind of like Irish Spring to me a bit, but this leaves a film on your skin, AND the actual packaging sticks to the soap, the paper it&#x27;s wrapped in is wet/damp, and some of the outside bars smell like cat piss.</li>
            <li> No complaint.</li>
            <li> Like most bar soap it gets messy in the soap dish.</li>
            <li> Been using it forever, love the feel and everyday use of it.  </li>
            <li> the price is in the average, maybe you can find lower price in other stores, good purchase.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I do not use Ivory soap as my daily soap - it is a little to drying for my skin</li>
            <li> he said maybe they changed to a new version...</li>
            <li> When you have a social agenda such as I do you need to be clean and not smell like you just crawed through a sewer pipe like on the episode of Family Guy that spoofed the Shawshank Redemption.</li>
            <li> She has very sensitive skin and soap with dyes causes her to itch and will sometimes give her a rash.  </li>
            <li> Some dry out my skin after use (regardless of how much moisture they seem to impart at the time), some have odors that seem pleasant in the shower or at the sink but later simply do not, and some are seemingly made of so little substance that 4 ounces can disappear in twice as much time as Ivory.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And, it doesn&#x27;t hurt my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> He has been using Ivory since he was burned as a young boy.  </li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t beat natural soap...</li>
            <li> never appreciated Ivory more than when I had bought some glycerin soap and left it six months in the cabinet, only to find out that it went rancid.  </li>
            <li> The Ivory soap is worth the money, the bars of soap is smaller then a regular bar of soap, i will buy again.</li>
            <li> I do use it as a body soap too, especially when I want to feel really clean - but daily use would be drying on my skin, especially in winter.</li>
            <li> My husband is extremely chemically sensitive and Ivory original is the only bar soap his body can tolerate.</li>
            <li> Well satisfied as usual with Ivory soap and use it regularly.</li>
            <li> I am extremely sensitive to scents and body care ingredients, and probably if I were trying Ivory for the first time now, I&#x27;d have the same problems I have with practically every other product.</li>
            <li> It does seem like the bars were around high humidity at some point; the wrapper was unusually difficult to remove from most of the bars.</li>
            <li> (apparently).  </li>
            <li> When he smelled the soap, he told me that I bought the wrong kind</li>
            <li> Ivory soap doesn&#x27;t alter my complexion the way some other soap bars do like pure glycerin, cocoa butter, and shea butter soaps.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I have used for as far back as I can remember!</li>
            <li> Always a very reliable basic quality soap, mild non irritating.</li>
            <li> Ivory is great because there are just a few ingredients, meaning, less weird chemicals you&#x27;re putting on your skin (that your body absorbs and then has to process).</li>
            <li> This little 11 pound girl is a 15 years old schnoodle, and her bones are a bit creaky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but this is definitely not what I was expected.</li>
            <li> The bars are a little softer than they were in the old days, meaning you go through them faster, so unwrapping bars and letting them dry out a month or two will help them</li>
            <li> I was trying to get the big bath bars they used to sell, as apposed to the little personal bars.  </li>
            <li> The only downsides are that it does dry my skin during the winter, so I use it only during the other seasons,  The other downside is because it is made with air whipped into it</li>
            <li> You know, not greasy, not overly dry --</li>
            <li> It is highly recommended because it has very few chemicals to react with other ingredients</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed, but not because of the quality.  </li>
            <li> I shower regularly with this soap and use a little cologne and everythign is coming up roses.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like other bar soap.</li>
            <li> bars which are getting harder &amp; harder to find.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Some of these soaps turn me into a pale yellow!</li>
            <li> And remember gentlemen a little colongne goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use other bar soaps</li>
            <li> I try other soaps but always return to the ivory bar...</li>
            <li> I send some to foreign countries where the kids bath in rivers and lakes, Ivory soap floats,</li>
            <li> the Ivory is down to 4 oz per bar.</li>
            <li> but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again due to the narrow bars.  </li>
            <li> however I found out I can get these at Target for half the price.</li>
            <li> (Well less of a risk)</li>
            <li> Ivory is a little too drying for my daughter and I.</li>
            <li> Lastly the packaging is not obnoxious, so you are not throwing away a bunch of unnecessary plastic.</li>
            <li> Sometime during my adulthood, I slowly started having \\&quot;contact</li>
            <li> I hate liquid bath soap and will only use this brand from now on.</li>
            <li> That seems like unnecessary packaging and the plastic is lousy for the environment.</li>
            <li> since another bad incident happened with a soap I ordered before.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m a bit disappointed these aren&#x27;t wider.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worst soap ever used.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is one of the only soaps that my daughter can use.  She has very sensitive skin and soap with dyes causes her to itch and will sometimes give her a rash.  This soap inexpensive and works very well for us!</li>
            <li> Love it as I always have! Nothing is better for me and my family! Thank you for the expedient response!</li>
            <li> Better for the shower than the 3.1 oz. &amp;#34;bath size&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Best soap for your skin. It&#x27;s gentle, cleans well &amp; smells great! Happy to be able to stock up by buying on-line.</li>
            <li> Great soap, no frills and that is what I like about it. Some soaps give me oily skin, or the fragrance bothers me. This soap is great in that it is inexpensive, doesn&#x27;t smell much, and doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily. The fact that it floats is also a bonus if you happen to drop it in the tub! Lastly the packaging is not obnoxious, so you are not throwing away a bunch of unnecessary plastic.</li>
            <li> This is the only shower soap my husband will use.  No perfumes, no deodorant, just a simple bar of soap.</li>
            <li> So I JUST got the soap. The price was very good for 10 bars. And the soap smells ok. Smelled kind of like Irish Spring to me a bit, but this leaves a film on your skin, AND the actual packaging sticks to the soap, the paper it&#x27;s wrapped in is wet/damp, and some of the outside bars smell like cat piss. Wtf. I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m gonna get a break with soap on here, since another bad incident happened with a soap I ordered before. I&#x27;m so pissed.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I have used for as far back as I can remember! And  it is the whole Perfume thing!</li>
            <li> works well and adds a pleasant smell to my homemade laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bigger bars of Ivory; but they&#x27;re narrower than the just slightly larger bars used to be.  It&#x27;s ok.  I&#x27;m a bit of a spend thrift.  I don&#x27;t like body washes, because you&#x27;re paying to package, haul, then use mostly water; and they&#x27;re VERY easy to overuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stick the tiny remnants of bar soap onto the next bar.  So, I&#x27;m a bit disappointed these aren&#x27;t wider.  But, hey, it&#x27;s Ivory, it works.  I like it; but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again due to the narrow bars.  It&#x27;s still a decent value; but I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better than just going ahead and buying the smaller bars at a store with a decent price.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my laundry detergent &amp; they work great however I found out I can get these at Target for half the price. Check around for pricing.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re always looking for inexpensive soap to put in health kits that are distributed in disaster areas around the world.  We&#x27;re supposed to use 4-5 oz. bars which are getting harder &amp; harder to find.  Kits put together for babies have to have unscented soap, so this is perfect.  We have bought many packages and will continue buying from this company.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s Ivory soap. I couldn&#x27;t find the bath size at Walmart, so bought them here. Very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Nothing like a hot shower with Ivory soap. I love the brisk, clean scent of this soap. It&#x27;s mild on my skin and it retains my natural skin tone. Ivory soap doesn&#x27;t alter my complexion the way some other soap bars do like pure glycerin, cocoa butter, and shea butter soaps. Some of these soaps turn me into a pale yellow! I have to stick with plainer soaps with fewer ingredients. I use other bar soaps but I always fall back on Ivory! It smells so good.</li>
            <li> Ivory soap is a classic  It has a clean, mild smell.  It does not irritate my children&#x27;s&#x27; skin.  It keeps the whole family nice and clean for a great price.  The only downsides are that it does dry my skin during the winter, so I use it only during the other seasons,  The other downside is because it is made with air whipped into it (that&#x27;s why it famously floats), each bar does not last as long as other more dense soaps can.  We are happy with having it on Amazon Subscription too!</li>
            <li> I was ordering this in subscribe and save.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, they no longer sell it for s&amp;s.&lt;br /&gt;I was getting a better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good soap, it does not have all those additives that dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> good soap. product is what is described.</li>
            <li> My husband is an immigrant from Mexico.  When he smelled the soap, he told me that I bought the wrong kind - he believed that this was for clothes because it smells like laundry soap used in Mexico (apparently).  I like the smell... it&#x27;s fresh and clean, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I love the clean smell of this soap. It&#x27;s works great on sensitive skin and won&#x27;t dry you out like some other bar soaps do. The price is good too. The best inexpensive soap out there in fact! Also, if you drop it in the shower it floats!</li>
            <li> Bought this soap to get the stains out of my baby&#x27;s diapers and cloths just like grandma did when I was a baby. Still works like a charm! And, it doesn&#x27;t hurt my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin. The size of these bars was also decent for the price.</li>
            <li> I prefer Ivory, and basically always have, because it doesn&#x27;t contain fragrances and oils that fill most soaps. It&#x27;s just soap. I&#x27;ve tried most other commercial soaps that are easily available in the US and find that they don&#x27;t satisfy me. Some dry out my skin after use (regardless of how much moisture they seem to impart at the time), some have odors that seem pleasant in the shower or at the sink but later simply do not, and some are seemingly made of so little substance that 4 ounces can disappear in twice as much time as Ivory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figure by the time you&#x27;ve made the leap to buying soap on Amazon, you&#x27;re likely already familiar with your own soap preferences, so the bottom line on this particular item is this: it&#x27;s the best price per ounce. There&#x27;s cheaper packages with smaller bar sizes, but this works out to 40 ounces of soap, which should last two people about 4-6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing holding me from a higher rating is that there used to be a cheaper package still, with MANY more bars of soap. It seems to have disappeared some time ago.</li>
            <li> What can one say about Ivory soap that hasn&#x27;t already been said?  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I love it.  It&#x27;s sure rich and clean smelling.  End of story.  Order some.</li>
            <li> Ivory is a great soap if you have allergies as I do...I try other soaps but always return to the ivory bar...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled that Ivory bar soap is such a bargain. It is GOOD STUFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you looked at the ingredients of your favorite body wash? Can you pronounce all of them? Ivory is great because there are just a few ingredients, meaning, less weird chemicals you&#x27;re putting on your skin (that your body absorbs and then has to process). Besides that, it gives you a clean clean. You know, not greasy, not overly dry -- leaves your skin clean and you not smelling like a fragrance store exploded onto you. Not to mislead, there IS a light fragrance for both the original and aloe versions, but not overly strong. I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every soap, but this one makes me feel *so fresh and so clean*. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My husband cannot use many soaps on the market because of the perfumes etc.  He has been using Ivory since he was burned as a young boy.  Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> It floats, it floats...Ivory soap.  That was the punch line to some joke I heard at summer camp as a kid, but I can&#x27;t remember the joke.  Anyway, it was the first thing I thought about when I ordered this 10-count package of Ivory soap.  To be honest, I do not use Ivory soap as my daily soap - it is a little to drying for my skin and I do like some of the fresh scents that are available in soaps like Lever.  BUT, what I really wanted this for is emergency preparedness.  In an emergency setting, it can be used for so much more than body soap: washing hair, clothes, dishes.  The results would not be perfect, but for emergencies you want something versatile.  It is a great size/price for that use, and it is easy to store.  I do use it as a body soap too, especially when I want to feel really clean - but daily use would be drying on my skin, especially in winter.</li>
            <li> I am extremely sensitive to scents and body care ingredients, and probably if I were trying Ivory for the first time now, I&#x27;d have the same problems I have with practically every other product. But since I was introduced to it in childhood and have used it exclusively for 20 or 30 years now, thank goodness, no problems. And thank goodness Amazon sells it, because Walgreens has stopped selling the bars and only sells the liquid version, which might or might not be fine sensitivity-wise (probably not), but I&#x27;d really like to avoid soap that comes in a plastic bottle. That seems like unnecessary packaging and the plastic is lousy for the environment. (There&#x27;s not really such a thing as recycling plastic in the way that glass or metal can be recycled. Every time plastic is re-used, it degrades in quality and a lot of it eventually ends up in the ocean.) Anyway, yes, Ivory soap!</li>
            <li> I used this soap first at my friend&#x27;s apartment and it was really good. I liked the smell and the feeling after you use it a lot. He told me it was this one but he bought his in actual store. I sent the link with him and he said it was this one, so I bought these. However, it is totally different. I am so disappointed. it smells not that good. I told me friend he said maybe they changed to a new version... I don&#x27;t know, but this is definitely not what I was expected.</li>
            <li> Love Ivory soap and the large bars.</li>
            <li> Good item. I bought with Borax and washing soda to make my own laundry detergent but I found you can buy them cheaper at the store.</li>
            <li> Yup, it&#x27;s Ivory Soap.  Everybody knows about Ivory Soap.  And the bath size is the largest size.  Lots of bars for the money.  Good value.  No shipping costs.  What else can I say?</li>
            <li> While some scented and oiled soaps may not bother people on their skin, the additives can irritate people eyes who use contacts.  It&#x27;s easy for fibers from towels and additives in soap that stay on the skin to get transferred to contact lenses and irritate the eyes.  I keep this around to wash my hands before air drying them when I&#x27;m using contacts.  (Although I should probably look in to some liquid soaps to see if there are any good ones that wash off clean)</li>
            <li> It is a cheap soap, it cleans but gives no lather n feels cheap. Won&#x27;t buy it ever again. Worst soap ever used.</li>
            <li> The price for 10 in one package is low.  The size is right.  What else one can ask for?&lt;br /&gt;I use it everywhere in my house --- bathroom, kitchen and laundry sink.  No complaint.</li>
            <li> Who would not like the classic scent of Iviory soap.  I love it and enjoy having the added bonus that it floats in the tub.  Great for kids too!</li>
            <li> My husband is extremely chemically sensitive and Ivory original is the only bar soap his body can tolerate. Thank you for keeping Ivory pure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Ivory .What can I say.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this 4 oz bar vs 3.1 oz bar at Walmart. So I just decided to see if Amazon had larger bars.</li>
            <li> Best soap for cleaning Makeup Brushes and Sponges</li>
            <li> Dude, you don&#x27;t need Ivory soap explained to you.  Go outside and play or something.  Have a wonderful day, friend.</li>
            <li> Always a very reliable basic quality soap, mild non irritating. The reasonable price is good for the amount of bars delivered. Well satisfied as usual with Ivory soap and use it regularly.</li>
            <li> Very good soap at a great price.</li>
            <li> Ivory soap is as gentle as they say.  The scent is pleasant.  Like most bar soap it gets messy in the soap dish.</li>
            <li> If you can drive to the Grocery store, CVS/Walgreens then save your money and don&#x27;t buy this online. It&#x27;s more expensive here than it is at any store I shop in. I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time comparing prices since I use this soap to make my own washing detergent.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap for two reasons...&lt;br /&gt;1- I am using it in homemade laundry detergent. It is highly recommended because it has very few chemicals to react with other ingredients&lt;br /&gt;2- to put in gift boxes for underprivileged kids. I send some to foreign countries where the kids bath in rivers and lakes, Ivory soap floats, that way they don&#x27;t run the risk of losing their soap after the first wash. (Well less of a risk) Also we give them in gift boxes to the local shelters and they are great because they have low allergic reactions. That way even kids or adults with mild allergies to scented soaps can use these.&lt;br /&gt;I can recommend it as a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Ivory soap is useful for cleaning almost every part of my body. I buy more than one bar at a time because sometimes I run out and forget to get more when I&#x27;m at the real store.</li>
            <li> What can I say....I have loved ivory soap since I was a kid.  My husband and I just couldn&#x27;t do without it!  Nice price and I don&#x27;t have to remember to pick it up at the store - I&#x27;m on the Amazon subscribe and save program!</li>
            <li> Beat soap, in my opinion..</li>
            <li> This Soap is excellent for people with very oily faces as it removes oil very well IMO. It leaves my face feeling very clean. I like it.</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t beat natural soap...This is by far the most natural out there on the market today...Everyone in the family uses it.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I can find that doesn&#x27;t smell perfumey, just clean. Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Smells very good, helps to wash laundering objects better if soap was applied for couple of hours before laundry itself</li>
            <li> Always an excellent product for a good price especially when you subscribe and save. This is a staple item in our household.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to make my own laundry soap.  It was so soft and easy to use.  It smells great in my soap too.</li>
            <li> Its soap, we stay clean, it is a great price (if its the add on offer from Amazon) and its about a yrs worth for the house so its nice not to have to worry about running out!!</li>
            <li> This is the same product that you can find a your local store. It will leave you feeling refreshed without any layer left on your body. The best part is that it floats.</li>
            <li> I like it because this soap last enough, smell so beatiful... the price is in the average, maybe you can find lower price in other stores, good purchase.</li>
            <li> When you have a social agenda such as I do you need to be clean and not smell like you just crawed through a sewer pipe like on the episode of Family Guy that spoofed the Shawshank Redemption. I shower regularly with this soap and use a little cologne and everythign is coming up roses. And remember gentlemen a little colongne goes a long way. Just saying.</li>
            <li> Have always used Ivory.  Really basic soap.  See no reason to change.  Appreciate the 4 oz. size for shower use.</li>
            <li> After a little research, I found that this \\&quot;pure\\&quot; soap is not as good &amp; pure as I thought. it contains potentially hazardous fragrance and TETRASODIUM EDTA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something \\&quot;pure\\&quot;, I think these are better choices (though more expensive):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* [[ASIN:B001E6O8WU Kiss My Face Pure Olive Oil Bar Soap, 8-Ounce Bars (Pack of 8)]]&lt;br /&gt;* [[ASIN:B001F1W8YO Kirk&#x27;s Castile: Coco Castile Bar Soap, Fragrance Free 4 oz (5 pack)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, pay attention to the soap size... the Ivory is down to 4 oz per bar. The Kiss My Face soap recommended above are 8 ounce bars (not 4).</li>
            <li> The Ivory soap is worth the money, the bars of soap is smaller then a regular bar of soap, i will buy again.</li>
            <li> and hasn&#x27;t changed in years! This pack was a great value and I ended up using most of the bars for felted soap presents. It does seem like the bars were around high humidity at some point; the wrapper was unusually difficult to remove from most of the bars.</li>
            <li> I have not used Ivory since I was a child. But when I saw the price, childhood memories got the best of me. I still have not used it all and I will probably be shopping online for something else. Ivory is a little too drying for my daughter and I.</li>
            <li> I always thought Ivory soap was a great soap.  I still feel this way.  You get a lot for your money.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s there to say about ivory soap?  Been using it forever, love the feel and everyday use of it.  The bars are a little softer than they were in the old days, meaning you go through them faster, so unwrapping bars and letting them dry out a month or two will help them last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never appreciated Ivory more than when I had bought some glycerin soap and left it six months in the cabinet, only to find out that it went rancid.  ACK!  I&#x27;ve never had that problem with good ol&#x27; Ivory.  I like the convenience of having it shipped free two day shipping to my front door, too.</li>
            <li> Perfect size/price for operation christmas child boxes, floats if dropped in a river or stream, no perfumes or dyes.</li>
            <li> The soap was packed in the original wrap. Nice to have it delivered..... I like to have backup and ordering on line makes it so easy</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING IVORY SOAP SINCE I WAS A CHILD. MY PARENTS BOUGHT IT SO NOW I BUY IT AND HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR MANY YEARS AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT. LOVE THE BIG BARS!</li>
            <li> We break the bars in two and put in opposite corners of our dog&#x27;s bed. This little 11 pound girl is a 15 years old schnoodle, and her bones are a bit creaky. Guess what? The ivory soap in the bed causes her joint pain to go away. We now have it in our own bed down by the feet! I heard this would work and now I see it does work.</li>
            <li> This is all my grown up kids like to use, only the original</li>
            <li> Great for carving. Good price.</li>
            <li> Good old reasonably priced Ivory.  Great for making bags to hand out to persons in need.  Good standby soap and yes, it still floats when you have to take a bath in the river when camping!</li>
            <li> I buy this product regularly and use this as a face and body bar.  Awesome and inexpensive facial cleanser!  I used to breakout from time to time but since I started using this on my face (1x in the morning during shower and 1x at night before going to bed) I haven&#x27;t had a problem.  Cleared up my complexion nicely.  Leaves me squeaky clean and great value for my money.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It&#x27;s very drying on your skin so I don&#x27;t use it on my body. It also leaves a white film when you use it. It&#x27;s perfect for getting out blood stains in clothing. You have to be patient though. Just scrub the stain with the soap, rinse, scrub again, rinse, then repeat as necessary. eventually the stain will be removed. It&#x27;s as though you&#x27;re removing a layer of the stain with every wash and rinse. One tip, don&#x27;t prewash your stained garments before using the ivory soap. it doesn&#x27;t have to be a fresh stain, though that is preferred. It does, however, need to be an unwashed stain. Washing the stain will &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; it and cause it to be unremovable.</li>
            <li> Sometime during my adulthood, I slowly started having \\&quot;contact allergies\\&quot; with various soaps.  Bath soaps, laundry soaps... I don&#x27;t even use fabric softener anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously, I was using Cetaphil bar soap (for about 5 years), which worked well for me, but I thought I would try Ivory soap for a while and ease my budget a bit.  It had been years since I used Ivory soap, but I don&#x27;t recall not liking it... I think I just moved on to more perfumed soaps... until the allergies started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the switch about 6 months ago, and so far, I am very pleased with Ivory soap.  I have had no allergy-like symptoms.  It is a bit more \\&quot;drying\\&quot; to my skin, but I tend to have more \\&quot;oily\\&quot; skin, so that hasn&#x27;t been a problem so far.  I used it during the Winter and Spring... and now Summer is arriving, so I believe I will stay with Ivory for a while. It&#x27;s a good, basic soap and suits my needs well.</li>
            <li> very satisied-very happy with product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good ol&#x27; soap that cleans my oily face with ease.  Nothing else leaves my skin feeling as  clean as Ivory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: it floats in the tub!</li>
            <li> The bars wear down quickly, but I love this soap. The version with aloe makes me beak out, but this one does not.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like about Ivory soap? it lathers up well, and it leaves you feeling clean as a whistle without any filmy feeling on your skin. It&#x27;s great  for babiestoo! I don&#x27;t get to the  local super store much anymore, so I have started doing some of this type of shopping on Amazon and similar sites, and the deal I got here was as good if not better than those huge super places, with none of the hassle.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like other bar soap. I hate liquid bath soap and will only use this brand from now on.</li>
            <li> I do use Ivory Soap and need to have this in my apartment! I do wash my hands four or more times a day!</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed, but not because of the quality.  I have always used Ivory soap, and it hasn&#x27;t changed in like a hundred years.  I was trying to get the big bath bars they used to sell, as apposed to the little personal bars.  They just don&#x27;t make them like they used to.  However, the cost was good, considering volume, Prime, and avoidance of impulse buys.</li>
            <li> excellent value and larger size bar then in supermarkets.</li>
