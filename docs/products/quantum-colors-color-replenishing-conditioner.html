    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It has a great scent, I will give it credit for that.</li>
            <li>My hair feels great after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keeps the color looking good.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Figured I&#x27;d add my own to spread awareness.</li>
            <li>Ever since I started using the Riveting Reds shampoo and conditioner it has been able to help me hold onto that gorgeous color</li>
            <li>I used this along with the Riveting Reds shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to stretch re-coloring from 4 weeks to 6.</li>
            <li>I dyed my hair with Manic Panic Vampire red and thought this shampoo would be awesome since I saw on a youtube tutorial that one of the ladies recommended this to keep your color from fading.</li>
            <li>, even Hotel shampoo works better on my hair than this crap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shampoo was okay though.  </li>
            <li>and they gave you more product for the price.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you mix it with a quality conditioner (I use Paul Mitchell products).</li>
            <li>i love this stuff it makes my hair look like I just dyed it</li>
            <li>B00185EA8E Quantum Riveting Reds Color Replenishing Shampoo]]</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Great for red hair.</li>
            <li>either-- like it isn&#x27;t getting clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this conditioner with the shampoo and my hair color has stayed bright red!</li>
            <li>Full strength, I didn&#x27;t like the way they made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>and I love the vibrant colors</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it though.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t feel right with this</li>
            <li>The amount of color deposited is not dramatic, even full strength.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t brought out more red.  </li>
            <li>That was the first thing I noticed after using this product along with the conditioner...</li>
            <li>It washed out my reds within the first shampoo, made them look brown...</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over a year consistently.</li>
            <li>It was not noticeable at first, but with time, It has a nice, natural, red color.</li>
            <li>I actually heard of this conditioner while watching YouTube tutorials about dying my hair bright red</li>
            <li>(Anyone with dyed red hair knows the horror of seeing your beautiful color run down the drain).</li>
            <li>and it has kept my red hair from becoming brassy and helped maintain the shade longer than if I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.to anyone looking to maintain their red or make it more vibrant!</li>
            <li>although more faded but still very noticeable, normally by now they are very faded and almost back to the bleached.  </li>
            <li>and this product has really kept my color</li>
            <li>The review is in no way a reflection on the seller, as the product was delivered fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li>I just really don&#x27;t like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Ehhh, doesn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
            <li>And I really did not see any difference in my hair color...  </li>
            <li>I adore so much.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li>fast shipping too</li>
            <li>This smells a bit like chocolate to me and is a nice, creamy texture and about the same color red as the bottle it&#x27;s packaged in.  </li>
            <li>but the red is still very bright and only a few shades faded, the purple and pinks have also stayed in pretty well</li>
            <li>I wish I could describe it any other way, but it was more the color of the bottle</li>
            <li>My natural color is a strawberry blonde and although the reds tend to blend better with my roots as it grows out the vibrant part normally fades out along with the purples and pinks.  </li>
            <li>wonders!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely suggest trying that instead of this garbage, it&#x27;ll cost you a bit more, but it will actually do what this&lt;</li>
            <li>, my current style involves a deep, rich and bright red with neon purple and pink stripes at the front.  </li>
            <li>and it was highly recommended.</li>
            <li>also noticed after I used this product I had 15+ hairs in the sink compared to my normal 3 - 5 strands of shedded hair.&lt;br /&gt;Soon</li>
            <li>Red hair fades fast and I was excited to try a \\&quot;color refreshing\\&quot; product marketed for red hair.  </li>
            <li>and I have 1/2&amp;#34; of new growth</li>
            <li>so nothing new since I changed.  </li>
            <li>I bought my Conditioner from Sally&#x27;s for twice as much compared to the price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Although the Conditioner is quite red in color, I did not notice it help much at all&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty unmanageable but it always has been and especially with pregnancy</li>
            <li>Just very crappy in general as a conditioner.</li>
            <li>I am a natural red head and wanted something tp \\&quot;brighten up\\&quot; my color when the summer sun wants to bleach it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather invest in the Aveda color treatment products or just re-dye my hair frequently than use this stuff...</li>
            <li>and I was really surprised.  </li>
            <li>so I am busy</li>
            <li>I use this conditioner very sparingly since it is a bit pricey and the bottle isn&#x27;t that big.</li>
            <li>Well, that didn&#x27;t happen but the conditioner did leave my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I am a natural redhead, with hair that has faded with time.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t leave my hair dry or greasy and I could tell it was revitalizing the color, which is great since my almost black hair has a hard time holding color.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a shampoo that would restore some of my red color, and not look too bright,&amp; fake red.</li>
            <li>currently mix Manic Panic in with some Loreal Repair 5 Conditioner in a clear 8 oz bottle from Sallys and it works</li>
            <li>I do not see any difference in my (natural) red.  </li>
            <li>I have been dyeing my hair a natural red for a couple years now.</li>
            <li>I am a natural blonde, but no one can notice unless I tell them.</li>
            <li>I also have hot showers and not cool and still the color has lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have it professionally lightened to a different shade of red.</li>
            <li>On my last color with a new stylist she told me to look for different shampoo and conditioner, specifically one designed for reds.&lt;br /&gt;I looked at several different brands and took the chance on this one</li>
            <li>Mixing them about half and half with my regular shampoo and conditioner, they worked just as well (as long as I left them in about 5 minutes) and my hair felt better.</li>
            <li>My main complaints with this conditioner is if you use it alone, it will dry out your hair and stain your shower enclosure if it sits too long.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> ( I have long red hair that I enhance)....</li>
            <li> I wait as long as possible to shampoo my hair</li>
            <li> I used Loreal Excellence HiColor HiLites for dark hair only in Red to dye my hair about a month ago.</li>
            <li> There is no detangling, no soft smoothing.  </li>
            <li> When my daily conditioner was at half a bottle, I mixed this in with it.</li>
            <li> My hair is so dry, tangled, and staticky because of this product.</li>
            <li> it will cause your hair to dry out.</li>
            <li> and that is deposits color back into my hair and made the color last (from the few times I used it).</li>
            <li> Overall not worth the price, though.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very dry.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally red hair, but it is very dark.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;actually pink (from the shampoo &amp; conditioner.)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much other product</li>
            <li> , it smells okay, but it leave my scalp DIRTY?!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect anything drastic after just a couple washes, at least if your already red.</li>
            <li> The product however is not worth the packaging it came in</li>
            <li> Of course, i have been using other techniques for keeping my red hair like only washing my hair twice a week with cold water and using dry shampoo in between washes.</li>
            <li> Also it can be a bit pricey, so I typically buy it when Sally&#x27;s has their two 2 liters for $15 sale every now and again.</li>
            <li> my hair is pretty crazy.  </li>
            <li> If your hair color is very dark, they probably won&#x27;t work as well for you.</li>
            <li> I have brighter copper-toned hair and after a few uses of this my color was changed quite drastically.  </li>
            <li> the conditioner came in after a few uses.</li>
            <li> It really dried my hair out too.</li>
            <li> but my gosh, it totally dried my hair out.  </li>
            <li> My natural color is dirty blond</li>
            <li> sometimes and maybe a small amount of moose when drying</li>
            <li> She told me to use this product once a week and to combine it with the conditioner I usually use or</li>
            <li> Dried of my hair!</li>
            <li> It also is a very thick product, and can stain shower curtains or other fabrics if not washed off.</li>
            <li> Made my hair brittle, dry, and just awful really.&lt;br /&gt;Tried to tolerate using the rest of the bottles because I paid so much for them, but they&#x27;re really&lt;br /&gt;awful</li>
            <li> No good.  </li>
            <li> Not happy at all, will not buy again.</li>
            <li> It is also extremely thin and runny.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my hair worse</li>
            <li> My hair felt hard, stiff and just so brittle after I got out of the shower I was afraid to detangle it!</li>
            <li> after I made the connection that it was this product that was causing this, I hopped on Amazon and read these reviews and just as I figured... not a good product for your hair!</li>
            <li> only used this shampoo three times and HATED how my hair felt.</li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t even consider buying this crap.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> helps maintain the color but doesnt seem to moisturize my hair or detangle in anyway ( I have long red hair that I enhance).... but it does help me maintina my color.</li>
            <li> My natural color is dirty blond and I dye it auburn. I used this along with the Riveting Reds shampoo. Full strength, I didn&#x27;t like the way they made my hair feel. I wanted to make them stretch anyway since they cost three times the price of my regular shampoo. Mixing them about half and half with my regular shampoo and conditioner, they worked just as well (as long as I left them in about 5 minutes) and my hair felt better. The amount of color deposited is not dramatic, even full strength. It&#x27;s just enough to keep my roots from being overly noticeable. I&#x27;ve been able to stretch re-coloring from 4 weeks to 6. If your hair color is very dark, they probably won&#x27;t work as well for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months now.  I do not see any difference in my (natural) red.  It hasn&#x27;t brought out more red.  I do follow the directions (leaving shampoo in for 2 minutes) and use the conditioner with it as well.  My hair doesn&#x27;t feel right with this either-- like it isn&#x27;t getting clean.  Conditioner does not seem to actually condition.  Not happy at all, will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Red hair fades fast and I was excited to try a \\&quot;color refreshing\\&quot; product marketed for red hair.  This smells a bit like chocolate to me and is a nice, creamy texture and about the same color red as the bottle it&#x27;s packaged in.  I have brighter copper-toned hair and after a few uses of this my color was changed quite drastically.  I wish I could describe it any other way, but it was more the color of the bottle the conditioner came in after a few uses. The pigments work well, but not with my hair color.</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair with Manic Panic Vampire red and thought this shampoo would be awesome since I saw on a youtube tutorial that one of the ladies recommended this to keep your color from fading. It&#x27;s suppose to deposit red back into the hair to make up for the loss of color.&lt;br /&gt;I only used this shampoo three times and HATED how my hair felt. That was the first thing I noticed after using this product along with the conditioner... My hair felt hard, stiff and just so brittle after I got out of the shower I was afraid to detangle it! Mind you I wait as long as possible to shampoo my hair so it&#x27;s not that I was using this shampoo &amp;#34;too frequently&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed after I used this product I had 15+ hairs in the sink compared to my normal 3 - 5 strands of shedded hair.&lt;br /&gt;Soon after I made the connection that it was this product that was causing this, I hopped on Amazon and read these reviews and just as I figured... not a good product for your hair! Figured I&#x27;d add my own to spread awareness. :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately went back to my Aveda shampoo and conditioner and rehydrated my hair and all is well... I&#x27;d rather invest in the Aveda color treatment products or just re-dye my hair frequently than use this stuff...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m ONLY giving this product two stars instead of one because I do believe it did &amp;#34;work&amp;#34;... meaning it did what it says it does and that is deposits color back into my hair and made the color last (from the few times I used it). Overall not worth the price, though.</li>
            <li> It washed out my reds within the first shampoo, made them look brown...I also don&#x27;t like the smell. John Frieda&#x27;s is keeping my color.</li>
            <li> This is for the product, not the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is equivalent to Suave. My hair is so dry, tangled, and staticky because of this product. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t even consider buying this crap. Such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am a natural red head and wanted something tp \\&quot;brighten up\\&quot; my color when the summer sun wants to bleach it. This worked well with continuous use. Don&#x27;t expect anything drastic after just a couple washes, at least if your already red.</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair for some time and I love the vibrant colors, my current style involves a deep, rich and bright red with neon purple and pink stripes at the front.  My natural color is a strawberry blonde and although the reds tend to blend better with my roots as it grows out the vibrant part normally fades out along with the purples and pinks.  On my last color with a new stylist she told me to look for different shampoo and conditioner, specifically one designed for reds.&lt;br /&gt;I looked at several different brands and took the chance on this one and I was really surprised.  I am a mother of 3 with another on the way so I am busy, I get to wash my hair 1-2 times a week and this product has really kept my color, I am now at about 7 weeks since I had my hair dyed and I have 1/2&amp;#34; of new growth but the red is still very bright and only a few shades faded, the purple and pinks have also stayed in pretty well although more faded but still very noticeable, normally by now they are very faded and almost back to the bleached.  I don&#x27;t use much other product just some frizz-ez sometimes and maybe a small amount of moose when drying but I do use hair dryers and hair straighteners, the straighteners almost daily at the moment with the abundance of pregnancy hormones my hair is pretty crazy.  I have not felt any residue on my hair and have not noticed it feeling drier than before ( I used to use treseme products).  My hair is pretty unmanageable but it always has been and especially with pregnancy so nothing new since I changed.  I also have hot showers and not cool and still the color has lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps as I will continue to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> I bought my Conditioner from Sally&#x27;s for twice as much compared to the price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Although the Conditioner is quite red in color, I did not notice it help much at all&lt;br /&gt;with the color of my hair, it smells okay, but it leave my scalp DIRTY?! Creates build up,&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s not me cause I&#x27;ve never had a problem with dandruff before and the build up is&lt;br /&gt;actually pink (from the shampoo &amp; conditioner.) Also when I stopped using this shampoo I no longer had&lt;br /&gt;any build up. Made my hair brittle, dry, and just awful really.&lt;br /&gt;Tried to tolerate using the rest of the bottles because I paid so much for them, but they&#x27;re really&lt;br /&gt;awful, even Hotel shampoo works better on my hair than this crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently mix Manic Panic in with some Loreal Repair 5 Conditioner in a clear 8 oz bottle from Sallys and it works wonders!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely suggest trying that instead of this garbage, it&#x27;ll cost you a bit more, but it will actually do what this&lt;br /&gt;product only claims to do.</li>
            <li> This suck as a conditioner.  There is no detangling, no soft smoothing.  Just very crappy in general as a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few color refreshing shampoos and conditioners lately, this being one of them. It has a great scent, I will give it credit for that. It does not leave any pigment after using however. It is also extremely thin and runny. It really dried my hair out too. I had to rewash and condition with another brand just to get a comb through my hair. The review is in no way a reflection on the seller, as the product was delivered fast and packaged well. The product however is not worth the packaging it came in</li>
            <li> Great for red hair. Keeps the color looking good.</li>
            <li> I just really don&#x27;t like this stuff.  It does help with the red but my gosh, it totally dried my hair out.  Now it just sits on a shelf in my cabinet...maybe one day I will use it again.</li>
            <li> Ehhh, doesn&#x27;t do much for me.  It didn&#x27;t make my hair worse but I do not believe that it helped preserve my color and I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> No good.  Leaves hair very dry.  Shampoo was okay though.  And I really did not see any difference in my hair color...  no extra shine, no nothing.</li>
            <li> I actually heard of this conditioner while watching YouTube tutorials about dying my hair bright red and it was highly recommended. I used Loreal Excellence HiColor HiLites for dark hair only in Red to dye my hair about a month ago. I&#x27;ve used this conditioner with the shampoo and my hair color has stayed bright red! Of course, i have been using other techniques for keeping my red hair like only washing my hair twice a week with cold water and using dry shampoo in between washes. I use this conditioner very sparingly since it is a bit pricey and the bottle isn&#x27;t that big. It comes out a deep red color that actually puts color back into your hair. (Anyone with dyed red hair knows the horror of seeing your beautiful color run down the drain). It doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes, skin, or bathroom surfaces. Honestly, this stuff is great. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive and they gave you more product for the price.</li>
            <li> I have naturally red hair, but it is very dark. I have it professionally lightened to a different shade of red. My stylist recommended that I purchase this conditioner to use. I get my hair colored every 8 weeks. She told me to use this product once a week and to combine it with the conditioner I usually use or it will cause your hair to dry out. When my daily conditioner was at half a bottle, I mixed this in with it. I use it once a week and it has kept my red hair from becoming brassy and helped maintain the shade longer than if I didn&#x27;t use it. Just make sure you mix it with a quality conditioner (I use Paul Mitchell products). I have used this product for over a year consistently. My main complaints with this conditioner is if you use it alone, it will dry out your hair and stain your shower enclosure if it sits too long.</li>
            <li> I have been dyeing my hair a natural red for a couple years now. Ever since I started using the Riveting Reds shampoo and conditioner it has been able to help me hold onto that gorgeous color I adore so much. There is a noticeable difference. I am a natural blonde, but no one can notice unless I tell them. My hair feels great after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the downside to this product is it might stay on your scalp if you don&#x27;t rinse thoroughly. Also it can be a bit pricey, so I typically buy it when Sally&#x27;s has their two 2 liters for $15 sale every now and again. Definitely worth it though. It also is a very thick product, and can stain shower curtains or other fabrics if not washed off.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff it makes my hair look like I just dyed it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t leave my hair dry or greasy and I could tell it was revitalizing the color, which is great since my almost black hair has a hard time holding color.</li>
            <li> I have fading red hair and was hopeful that this conditioner would bring some red back.  Well, that didn&#x27;t happen but the conditioner did leave my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I am a natural redhead, with hair that has faded with time. I have been looking for a shampoo that would restore some of my red color, and not look too bright,&amp; fake red. I really like this shampoo, in fact I am ordering my second bottle today. It was not noticeable at first, but with time, It has a nice, natural, red color. and I am thinking of stocking up on it. [[ASIN:B00185EA8E Quantum Riveting Reds Color Replenishing Shampoo]]</li>
