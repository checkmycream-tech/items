            <li>My son has an oily forehead and these work great to control the grease.</li>
            <li>THIS IS GREAT BLOTTING PAPER FOR THE PRICE</li>
            <li>Great blotting papers.</li>
            <li>These are great but take your makeup off if you are wearing any.</li>
            <li>NYX Matte Blotting Paper works great</li>
            <li>and I love them because they absorb oil perfectly without harming make-up...</li>
            <li>These blotting papers do a good job of reducing shine.  </li>
            <li>But these are good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Good Product.</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>Nothing amazing, but they do the job.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin so during the day at work these work nicely to get rid of the shine on my face</li>
            <li>Anyways, these are nice blotting papers.</li>
            <li>Perfect to clear up glowing oily patches on the face</li>
            <li>These lil guys are perfect for sticking in your purse or pocket and work great to soak up that little bit of shiny.</li>
            <li>but many of them have chemicals added.</li>
            <li>So much better to blot away the shine than pile on more powder.</li>
            <li>I love this paper for my skin, and keeps make up intact.</li>
            <li>These really are great blotting papers.</li>
            <li>Clearasil sheets work much better....</li>
            <li>I use 2 of these at most.</li>
            <li>The clean and clear one is the best one still of course.</li>
            <li>It works pretty good for that midday oil buildup that I get.  </li>
            <li>So, I was so glad to see these available as an add on.</li>
            <li>I live in a humid warm climate and use many products to keep me shine free all day long, these blotting papers are great to have in the bag for a quick fix and they work great.</li>
            <li>Easy to stash in my purse</li>
            <li>Easy to carry in my purse to freshen up mid-day.</li>
            <li>Removes oil fine and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin looking too powdery</li>
            <li>so I cannot give an accurate review at this time.</li>
            <li>I use three sheets and even then it does not leave me oil free.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the quality of these blotting papers and would compare them to Clean and Clear&#x27;s blotting papers.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very oily skin, but these come in handy when I&#x27;m going from work to outing without going home first.  </li>
            <li>Definitely need a few to get all the shine off my face from time to time, but great value, great product.</li>
            <li>Overall, does the job for the good price.</li>
            <li>Cute packaging fast arrival</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice and easy to open though.</li>
            <li>The other NYX blotting papers (the ones that have either tea tree oil, or salicylic acid on them) have great packaging.</li>
            <li>and I am a loyal of customer of anything Nyx brand as it always exceeding my expectations.</li>
            <li>My face is super oily</li>
            <li>I bought these because I was looking for cruelty free blotting paper (and the ones from The Body Shop are too &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>Clean &amp; Clear Sheets worked better for me.</li>
            <li>Clean &amp; Clear works so much better.</li>
            <li>I only bought them to meet the price amount, but now i&#x27;m really glad i did!</li>
            <li>even during these hot summer months!</li>
            <li>They work fine at absorbing oil on my face throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Anyways, the product is nice enough that I would re-purchase, I just wish they would change the packaging!</li>
            <li>They can tear easily if you aren&#x27;t careful, so make sure to blot and not rub.</li>
            <li>But you get what you pay, price is good but not worth it</li>
            <li>Plus they seem to draw more oil back after use.</li>
            <li>These you have to open it up, then unfold it a couple of times, then unfold a top part, all to get your tissue.</li>
            <li>Does not soak up oil, I get pretty oily through out the day and this does not do the job.</li>
            <li>First time buying ANY blotting paper</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, but come on!  </li>
            <li>and I would need to use about three to get what one clean and clear sheet would do.</li>
            <li>I love this blotting paper because it helps keeping my face from looking gross with too much oiliness.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin, and I use one Clean and Clear blotting paper and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Barely absorbs any oil, and are basically as useful as a blank sheet of copy paper.&lt;br /&gt;there are better products out there, go buy one of those.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin</li>
            <li>i have to use like 7 for my whole face.</li>
            <li>Absorbs some oil but for someone like me with really oily skin</li>
            <li>They are a nice size as well, a little bit bigger than the ELF ones for instance.</li>
            <li>I live in miami where the weather is...very tropical</li>
            <li>so you blot more often than usual.</li>
            <li>Just like other reviews, the material is thinner than Clean and Clear brand.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>maybe but if your skin is like mine and super oily, theses are not worth the $$$$</li>
            <li>but so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;White paper strips and does not leave any white on the face.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>It works but sometimes I have to look really hard to see the oil absorbed.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It works but sometimes I have to look really hard to see the oil absorbed.</li>
            <li> I tried these because they were more affordable, but these are VERY thin</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin, so several times throughout the day I use several blotting tissues, and then re-powder, always aiming to get my skin as matte as possible (even though that never will last for long.)</li>
            <li> so I need several sheets to dry it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these fall apart way too easily.</li>
            <li> Because the sheets are so thin they can only absorb so much oil</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t bad for the price, but I need several papers even for mild blotting.</li>
            <li> compared to using 1 or 2 of the other blotting sheets out there.</li>
            <li> Other than that no problems.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am just being lazy, but I don&#x27;t see why they didn&#x27;t have these have the same packaging as the other NYX blotting papers.</li>
            <li> that well.. i would say dont buy this blotting paper.. get some other brand</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to take the individual sheet out one at a time.</li>
            <li> Not worth your time or money.</li>
            <li> A waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I have to use a few sheets at a time.</li>
            <li> Absorb very little.</li>
            <li> You could even toss the small pack in your purse.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to my usual blotting papers (the Palladio papers that usually come with a skin-colored tint).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is even working...</li>
            <li> no more shine.</li>
            <li> Papers are so small and thin compared to other brands that it takes 2 or 3 of these.</li>
            <li> they hardly absorb anything at all.</li>
            <li> Also the color of the paper makes it hard to tell when the sheet is used up.</li>
            <li> The wax paper sheets are extremely thin</li>
            <li> I am way to oily for this thin papers.</li>
            <li> These are totally worthless, if you have a little bit of shine..</li>
            <li> These are so thin!</li>
            <li> it contains very thin absorbent papers that need to use 5 or 6 to reduce the grasitud.</li>
            <li> Oil blotting sheets can be expensive!</li>
            <li> very disappointed.. the sheets are tough to take it out from the box and they dont absorb oil</li>
            <li> It is worthless.</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>

            <li> Papers are so small and thin compared to other brands that it takes 2 or 3 of these. Plus they seem to draw more oil back after use.</li>
            <li> Love this!  I don&#x27;t have very oily skin, but these come in handy when I&#x27;m going from work to outing without going home first.  You can use both sides, so don&#x27;t throw them away without flipping them around.  They soak up the oil without drying out your face.  Definitely would recommend them.</li>
            <li> These are totally worthless, if you have a little bit of shine..maybe but if your skin is like mine and super oily, theses are not worth the $$$$</li>
            <li> Bought these for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Barely absorbs any oil, and are basically as useful as a blank sheet of copy paper.&lt;br /&gt;there are better products out there, go buy one of those.</li>
            <li> I have a oily face and this is a life saver</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin especially my t-zone... I love this blotting paper because it helps keeping my face from looking gross with too much oiliness.</li>
            <li> Blotting papers. They work if you need blotting papers. My son has an oily forehead and these work great to control the grease. I chose this brand because there are no additives to the paper! Who would think blotting papers would be anything but paper - but many of them have chemicals added. So if you&#x27;re looking for just paper - this is it.</li>
            <li> I really liked the quality of these blotting papers and would compare them to Clean and Clear&#x27;s blotting papers. Easy to stash in my purse and I am a loyal of customer of anything Nyx brand as it always exceeding my expectations.</li>
            <li> These blotting papers do a good job of reducing shine.  You could even toss the small pack in your purse.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good for that midday oil buildup that I get.  It helps to keep my face from being shiny!</li>
            <li> It works but sometimes I have to look really hard to see the oil absorbed. The clean and clear one is the best one still of course.</li>
            <li> The wax paper sheets are extremely thin so you end up using 2 or 3 at a time. Because the sheets are so thin they can only absorb so much oil so you blot more often than usual. Not worth your time or money.</li>
            <li> Nope, I would not recommend this product at all! I bought it thinking it maybe replace the one I buy from up&amp;up or neutrogena but this is nothing like it, its like putting a sheet or paper on your oily skin!</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to my usual blotting papers (the Palladio papers that usually come with a skin-colored tint). This isn&#x27;t bad for the price, but I need several papers even for mild blotting. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Takes all the oil off my face. Awesome.</li>
            <li> Absorb very little. Would not recommend</li>
            <li> I live in miami where the weather is...very tropical and I was in neeeed of this product</li>
            <li> THIS IS GREAT BLOTTING PAPER FOR THE PRICE AND AMOUNT YOU RECEIVE.</li>
            <li> These work great!! I only bought them to meet the price amount, but now i&#x27;m really glad i did! I use them all the time. I will repurchase when I run out.</li>
            <li> These are so thin! they hardly absorb anything at all. i have to use like 7 for my whole face. compared to using 1 or 2 of the other blotting sheets out there. These are like tissue paper. they even make a crinkly noise when you use them. Terrible! wont purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin, and I use one Clean and Clear blotting paper and it gets the job done. I tried these because they were more affordable, but these are VERY thin and I would need to use about three to get what one clean and clear sheet would do.</li>
            <li> Havent fully used yet but so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;White paper strips and does not leave any white on the face.&lt;br /&gt;Does soak up any oils from blotting.</li>
            <li> A waste of money for me. I am way to oily for this thin papers. I used several at a time to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Great blotting papers. They soak up the oil from your face but leave the makeup - if you try to blot your face with a tissue you will remove the makeup but still be shiny looking.&lt;br /&gt;Semi transparent, shiny-ish papers which become totally transparent as they come in contact with the oils of your face.  I like to use one before i take lunch each day, as i know  by that point i am getting shiny. it seems to sort of reset my makeup back in place while removing that oilyness.</li>
            <li> Absorbs some oil but for someone like me with really oily skin it&#x27;s not quite enough. I have to use a few sheets at a time. Clean &amp; Clear Sheets worked better for me. But these are good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> it contains very thin absorbent papers that need to use 5 or 6 to reduce the grasitud. It is worthless.</li>
            <li> So much better to blot away the shine than pile on more powder. Easy to carry in my purse to freshen up mid-day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to having powder paper when you buy blotting paper... I&#x27;m not sure if this is even working... don&#x27;t know what I think about this.</li>
            <li> Perfect to clear up glowing oily patches on the face</li>
            <li> Just like other reviews, the material is thinner than Clean and Clear brand. My face is super oily so I need several sheets to dry it. The packaging is nice and easy to open though.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for my skin</li>
            <li> Oil blotting sheets can be expensive! So, I was so glad to see these available as an add on. They work fine at absorbing oil on my face throughout the day. They can tear easily if you aren&#x27;t careful, so make sure to blot and not rub. Overall, does the job for the good price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t  used this product yet so I cannot give an accurate review at this time.I will let you know what I think when I do</li>
            <li> I have oily skin so during the day at work these work nicely to get rid of the shine on my face</li>
            <li> I love this paper for my skin, and keeps make up intact.</li>
            <li> I live in a humid warm climate and use many products to keep me shine free all day long, these blotting papers are great to have in the bag for a quick fix and they work great.</li>
            <li> These are great but take your makeup off if you are wearing any. Other than that no problems. Cute packaging fast arrival</li>
            <li> I had never used any sort of blotting paper. I was pleasantly surprised by this product. It blots away the shine without messing up your makeup; a definite must if you are on a photo shoot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to take the individual sheet out one at a time. Also the color of the paper makes it hard to tell when the sheet is used up. I won&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I was looking for cruelty free blotting paper (and the ones from The Body Shop are too &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34;).  Unfortunately, these fall apart way too easily.</li>
            <li> These really are great blotting papers. I use them before makeup and during the day. You can see the oil on the paper when you lift them off your face. Good price too!</li>
            <li> Works well and is comparable to those sold at CVS or Walgreens.  Removes oil fine and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin looking too powdery</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin, so several times throughout the day I use several blotting tissues, and then re-powder, always aiming to get my skin as matte as possible (even though that never will last for long.) Anyways, these are nice blotting papers. Nothing amazing, but they do the job. They are a nice size as well, a little bit bigger than the ELF ones for instance. What I do not like about these is the packaging though. The other NYX blotting papers (the ones that have either tea tree oil, or salicylic acid on them) have great packaging. You just open it up, and pull out your paper. These you have to open it up, then unfold it a couple of times, then unfold a top part, all to get your tissue. Maybe I am just being lazy, but I don&#x27;t see why they didn&#x27;t have these have the same packaging as the other NYX blotting papers. Anyways, the product is nice enough that I would re-purchase, I just wish they would change the packaging!</li>
            <li> These lil guys are perfect for sticking in your purse or pocket and work great to soak up that little bit of shiny. A must have for anyone! Just pull a sheet out, press against your skin and TA-DA! no more shine.</li>
            <li> Does not soak up oil, I get pretty oily through out the day and this does not do the job. I use three sheets and even then it does not leave me oil free.  But you get what you pay, price is good but not worth it</li>
            <li> very disappointed.. the sheets are tough to take it out from the box and they dont absorb oil that well.. i would say dont buy this blotting paper.. get some other brand</li>
            <li> First time buying ANY blotting paper and I am sold!  NYX Matte Blotting Paper works great and I love them because they absorb oil perfectly without harming make-up...even during these hot summer months! I&#x27;m never leaving home without them!</li>
            <li> Clean &amp; Clear works so much better.</li>
            <li> These work great!  Definitely need a few to get all the shine off my face from time to time, but great value, great product.</li>
            <li> I had to use 15 (FIFTEEN!) of these to get the oil off my face.  I have very oily skin, but come on!  Clearasil sheets work much better....I use 2 of these at most.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Good Product.</li>
