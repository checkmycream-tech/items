            <li>but I was more impressed with the Oi</li>
            <li>I also think the smell is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It smells so good</li>
            <li>So even though it seems like a good conditioner, I can&#x27;t use it, which is why I give it one star.</li>
            <li>I had gotten a sample of this conditioner and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Lasts a good three months.</li>
            <li>The product is good but the jar is a pain to use in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really the best conditioner I&#x27;ve every used; leaves your hair feeling silky and manageable, and it smells great.  </li>

            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic and my hair feels great using this product.</li>
            <li>Love this my hair has not looked this good since I was a teenager</li>
            <li>For those who are scent-sensitive, as I am, or need to be around others who are, this product has a very strong perfume.</li>
            <li>It does have a very strong fragrance, so</li>
            <li>Out of everything I&#x27;ve tried, they seem to do the best job of keeping my hair in great condition and have made it feel softer than other shampoo/conditioner pairs</li>
            <li>This is by far the best conditioner I have used.</li>
            <li>What can you say about all Davine&#x27;s products but &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; and this one clearly is a winner, hair feels great!</li>
            <li>Leaves you hair soft and smelling wonderful!</li>
            <li>It smells so good and rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>I had been using the Davines Melu shampoo and conditioner, which are specially targeted for damaged hair, but switched to this because I loved how the Oi oil for hair smelled.  </li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>The scent is almost overwhelming and leads me to believe that the product is either out of date or somehow being tampered with.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>have tried so many brands</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner</li>
            <li>I love taking my 5am showers now.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, and the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 years.</li>
            <li>Plus, I like the smell a lot better than the Melu.  </li>
            <li>If you prefer musky or exotic scents over fruity or floral ones, you probably will, too.  </li>
            <li>Love love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Seems to work OK, but my hair seems greasier.</li>
            <li>Smells more like lemon than anything else.</li>
            <li>I love this product when I buy it from the salon.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE it</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of an elegant perfume and Aveda.  </li>
            <li>The oil is fabulous too!</li>
            <li>Received a sample of this in my Birchbox shipment, and I love it, so I got more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a shame, because I love what it oes for my hair, but I just can&#x27;t handle the smell without getting a head ache.</li>
            <li>love what it does to my hair and my daughters/</li>
            <li>fabulous!</li>
            <li>Personally, I love it.  </li>
            <li>I use many chemicals; coloring my hair and beach etc.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been in love ever sense.  </li>
            <li>have been able to.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t necessarily my favorite of all the hair products I&#x27;ve tried, but it isn&#x27;t overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with the scent the minute he used it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting so many compliments on the way that my hair looks and smells.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>even tames the new fly away greys.</li>
            <li>my hair is so easy to work with afterwards.</li>
            <li>I think that the company should let the consumers know in their advertising about the strong scent.</li>
            <li>wa so strong</li>
            <li>The product seems, fine</li>
            <li>It smooths my fine yet frizzy curly hair while still boosting shine and curl.  </li>
            <li>It also smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I was warned that products purchased online may not be genuine, but I for the price I thought I&#x27;d try it.  </li>
            <li>I have a great regime for warding off the brassiness that can plague blonde hair</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have time to always stop there to restock, so this site is always my backup in finding my products and free shipping and returns.</li>
            <li>Conditioner has a subtle scent that smells wonderful, you will love your hair all day.</li>
            <li>Pricey, but worth it!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Smells great and really makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li>- it has a strong, distinct smell.  </li>
            <li>I have very straight smooth hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this, I have thin fine hair and it works really great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is knock-off Davines Oi and not the real thing.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is pricey, but really worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li>This lasts a while and it&#x27;s absolutely worth the price.  </li>
            <li>but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>Coupled with the shampoo and the after-shower spray, Davines Oi will leave your hair incredibly soft to the  touch, silky, and smooth!</li>
            <li>Worth it and</li>
            <li>It really does make your hair smell freshly washed!</li>
            <li>my absolute favorite new product.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair naturally but wear extensions.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too pleased that it was open when it arrived.</li>
            <li>Works great for frizzy, thick hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also worth noting that I do use the [[ASIN:B005EMQKHG Davines OI / Oil Absolute Beautifying Potion - 4.56 oz]] and Davines</li>
            <li>I would much prefer they put it in a tube!</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff after discovering at my local salon.</li>
            <li>Absolutely my FAV right now.</li>
            <li>This conditioner left my hair feeling soft and moisturized with nice body and sheen.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of a scent or perfume my mother use to wear when she was going somewhere special and makes me feel like she is alive again.</li>
            <li>my curls are super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to ensure that you get to use all of the product you actually paid for, rather than it clinging inside the bottle.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend&lt;br /&gt;it for fragile hair.</li>
            <li>One of the reasons I buy this product is purely nostalgia.</li>
            <li>I have blonde fine oily hair</li>
            <li>I really like this one.</li>
            <li>Highly perfumed!</li>
            <li>I got it for Christmas, but wouldn&#x27;t spend that much on shampoo.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>This makes it easier to get as much as I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall for my hair needs I absolutely adore this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I personally think whenever something is in tub form I tend to use more of it than I would a product from a bottle if I&#x27;m not careful.  </li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, and it makes my hair soft and manageable without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>used on my fine, dry, curly tending-to-frizz hair.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Wish it detangled a little bit more though.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t do much to keep the moisture in my hair and give me the soft feel I&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
            <li>thirst quencher for my super dry frizzy winter hair.</li>
            <li>Basically, it is the kind of hair that can look fantastic or depressing depending on how I style it and what products I use.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and damaged from hair coloring, so it has been hard to find a lightweight conditioner that does the job.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I opened the package is that the label was different....</li>
            <li>I have purchased this conditioner a few times from birch box.com, and it never smelled quite as strong as this one did from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Hair comes out so soft and smooth, but not weighted down.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m seeing better results because I&#x27;m using multiple products from the same brand vs. this shampoo and conditioner alone, but did feel it was worth</li>
            <li>It left my hair super soft and manageable without leaving it flat or oily looking.  </li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Davines products and they are typically much cheaper on Amazon than buying them at the salon I go to.  </li>
            <li>and it makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I towel dry somewhat first, comb it through and when I&#x27;m done with my shower, rince..</li>
            <li>(Kevin Murphy Blonde Angel which I would highly recommend for that purpose),</li>
            <li>No matter how much a conditioner promised to deep condition my hair, it never seemed to be enough to make a difference.  </li>
            <li>In terms of how it works it does leave the hair soft and silky, however for this price could you find something equal probably like the bed head line of products that are slightly cheaper, but it is worth it when you consider you get the softness in the hair the shine and the perfume.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I use it daily and the health of my hair has improved considerably.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure if it is the same product because I felt the other one left my hair more soft and straight.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>However, for me it&#x27;s actually been more convenient since I have very thick, longer hair and can spend forever trying to get enough conditioner for my needs out of a bottle.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so I think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>some weeks of use, I just got tired of the strong smell.</li>

            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too pleased that it was open when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Works great for frizzy, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also worth noting that I do use the [[ASIN:B005EMQKHG Davines OI / Oil Absolute Beautifying Potion - 4.56 oz]] and Davines</li>
            <li> I would much prefer they put it in a tube!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff after discovering at my local salon.</li>
            <li> Absolutely my FAV right now.</li>
            <li> This conditioner left my hair feeling soft and moisturized with nice body and sheen.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me of a scent or perfume my mother use to wear when she was going somewhere special and makes me feel like she is alive again.</li>
            <li> my curls are super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to ensure that you get to use all of the product you actually paid for, rather than it clinging inside the bottle.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend&lt;br /&gt;it for fragile hair.</li>
            <li> One of the reasons I buy this product is purely nostalgia.</li>
            <li> I have blonde fine oily hair</li>
            <li> I really like this one.</li>
            <li> Highly perfumed!</li>
            <li> I got it for Christmas, but wouldn&#x27;t spend that much on shampoo.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> This makes it easier to get as much as I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall for my hair needs I absolutely adore this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I personally think whenever something is in tub form I tend to use more of it than I would a product from a bottle if I&#x27;m not careful.  </li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, and it makes my hair soft and manageable without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> used on my fine, dry, curly tending-to-frizz hair.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Wish it detangled a little bit more though.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t do much to keep the moisture in my hair and give me the soft feel I&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
            <li> thirst quencher for my super dry frizzy winter hair.</li>
            <li> Basically, it is the kind of hair that can look fantastic or depressing depending on how I style it and what products I use.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and damaged from hair coloring, so it has been hard to find a lightweight conditioner that does the job.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I opened the package is that the label was different....</li>
            <li> I have purchased this conditioner a few times from birch box.com, and it never smelled quite as strong as this one did from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Hair comes out so soft and smooth, but not weighted down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m seeing better results because I&#x27;m using multiple products from the same brand vs. this shampoo and conditioner alone, but did feel it was worth</li>
            <li> It left my hair super soft and manageable without leaving it flat or oily looking.  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Davines products and they are typically much cheaper on Amazon than buying them at the salon I go to.  </li>
            <li> and it makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I towel dry somewhat first, comb it through and when I&#x27;m done with my shower, rince..</li>
            <li> (Kevin Murphy Blonde Angel which I would highly recommend for that purpose),</li>
            <li> No matter how much a conditioner promised to deep condition my hair, it never seemed to be enough to make a difference.  </li>
            <li> In terms of how it works it does leave the hair soft and silky, however for this price could you find something equal probably like the bed head line of products that are slightly cheaper, but it is worth it when you consider you get the softness in the hair the shine and the perfume.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I use it daily and the health of my hair has improved considerably.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is the same product because I felt the other one left my hair more soft and straight.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> However, for me it&#x27;s actually been more convenient since I have very thick, longer hair and can spend forever trying to get enough conditioner for my needs out of a bottle.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so I think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> some weeks of use, I just got tired of the strong smell.</li>
            <li> I will say that it seems to do a good enough job conditioning my hair, but I&#x27;m disappointed I paid $26 for a product and got something completely different instead.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and unlike some of the other reviewers, I actually like the container, because I can choose exactly the amount I want, rather than dealing with a pump.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my sample was just not as strongly scented because it loses some of that due to the packaging or the smaller amount of product in the container, but I am sensitive to scents and this product was just not working for me on that</li>
            <li> But - it&#x27;s too expensive and the scent is too strong for someone to purchase without knowing what they were getting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but worth it!</li>
            <li> I have wavy, slightly coarse hair, while my husband&#x27;s hair is very thick and straight.</li>
            <li> Conditions my dry, textured hair so well</li>
            <li> that also tends to be naturally dry and wiry and that gets subjected to a lot of heat styling.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered with some dry scalp issues for quite some time, and after a week of using this product, my dry scalp is gone.  </li>
            <li> A tub will last me about 6 weeks, and I have hair that goes almost down to my waist.  </li>
            <li> I finally found a conditioner that I truly only need a very small amount to fully condition and soften my entire head of hair!</li>
            <li> The label was different, the jar wasn&#x27;t sealed in any way, and the smell and texture are totally different than my usual oi conditioner.</li>
            <li> Was a little worried I wouldn&#x27;t get the same level of damage protection with the Oi shampoo and conditioner, but my worries were unfounded.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so dense you only need a little bit.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of conditioner goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I believe this product was probably exposed to extreme temperatures as the consistency was way off.  </li>
            <li> I get compliments often when I use this product and other Davines products.  </li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended this conditioner after some of my hair broke off due to getting a perm a week after I got it colored.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably been using it for about a year and a half, longer than any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> I use almost half of what I use with other conditioners.  </li>
            <li> Fake - not the real deal.</li>
            <li> I want to try the whole line, but it is expensive.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a buy if you have thick hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s always tempting to get something cheaper because the price is steep (especially if you have thick, longer hair like me and are using a lot)</li>
            <li> Better than drugstore crap..</li>
            <li> smells a little different and not as thick in consistency as my other jar.</li>
            <li> Smooths my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Your hair will dry faster, too - not sure how that works</li>
            <li> Label didn&#x27;t look like previous purchases from salon.</li>
            <li> I also have much less breakage since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> A little odd....</li>
            <li> And no matter how tangled my hair can get, I put a little of the conditioner in and I can work the knots out with my fingers.  </li>
            <li> The label and smell are the dead giveaway.</li>
            <li> This creamy conditioner isnt too heavy yet leaves my hair feeling silky/healthy</li>
            <li> The label is different from the original and the smell was awful.</li>
            <li> Not sure why?</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair usually every other day and always use this conditioner; if I don&#x27;t use it, my hair notices and is not happy.</li>
            <li> I have thick color treated hair (salon lightened to blonde with low lights, toner and base bump)</li>
            <li> Very disappointed as this product isn&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
            <li> Hair conditioner (and shampoo) are so subjective so this is hard to review.</li>
            <li> It has a delicate smell or aroma that just will remind you of grandma or mom and it stays in your hair for a day or two.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s too late to return it....</li>
            <li> Less expensive online then in a salon.  </li>
            <li> The results were poor as well.  </li>
            <li> This product seemed to be a fake.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed.</li>
            <li> To date, I&#x27;ve always gone in hopeful and ended up disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing</li>
            <li> Would give it 5 stars but the container is kinda annoying to open/close during a shower.</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> This time the product had a nasty chemical smell and didn&#x27;t condition as well.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product my curls are super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this conditioner a few times from birch box.com, and it never smelled quite as strong as this one did from Amazon. I think another reviewer mentioned this. The scent is almost overwhelming and leads me to believe that the product is either out of date or somehow being tampered with.</li>
            <li> thirst quencher for my super dry frizzy winter hair. even tames the new fly away greys. love it. have tried so many brands but i always go back to Davines. always a problem solver.</li>
            <li> Works great on my curls!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner</li>
            <li> The best conditioner money can buy!!</li>
            <li> This product seemed to be a fake.  The label was different, the jar wasn&#x27;t sealed in any way, and the smell and texture are totally different than my usual oi conditioner.</li>
            <li> Fake - not the real deal. I had been warned about buying this through Amazon and will not do it again. The label and smell are the dead giveaway. VERY disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Davines products and this conditioner didn&#x27;t disappoint. I use to buy this product at Birchbox but then bought it here because it was way cheaper. I am not sure if it is the same product because I felt the other one left my hair more soft and straight.&lt;br /&gt;After some weeks of use, I just got tired of the strong smell.</li>
            <li> I am using the shampoo and the conditioner. I use to use pureology Kerastase and I am not going back. Great conditioner.</li>
            <li> Smells and has the same texture. I wasn&#x27;t too pleased that it was open when it arrived. There was no tamper-resistant packaging at all. A little odd....</li>
            <li> This is not the correct product. The label is different from the original and the smell was awful. Definitely a knockoff product! Returning immediately</li>
            <li> Great conditioner and has a very nice smell</li>
            <li> This is by far the best conditioner I have used. I&#x27;m obsessed. As soon as I switched to Oi, people at work noticed a difference in my hair and I got tons of compliments. This conditioner feels and smells amazing. I love taking my 5am showers now. My hair is very fine and damaged from hair coloring, so it has been hard to find a lightweight conditioner that does the job. Here it is!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this and was truly amazed.  It&#x27;s really the best conditioner I&#x27;ve every used; leaves your hair feeling silky and manageable, and it smells great.  Yes, it is pricey, but really worth it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, and the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I use Davines but this product not moisturizing enough for me.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 years. I have blonde fine oily hair And this product gives my hair volume and shine without the oil.</li>
            <li> The product seems, fine but when I received it was obvious that a scoop had been taken out.  I would purchase it again but from another seller!!</li>
            <li> My hair LOVES this conditioner.  It smells so good and rinses clean.  Definitely a buy if you have thick hair and you use curling irons, blow dryers, or straighteners on your hair.</li>
            <li> Works great for frizzy, thick hair.  I really like this one.</li>
            <li> Would give it 5 stars but the container is kinda annoying to open/close during a shower.I have fine hair naturally but wear extensions. This creamy conditioner isnt too heavy yet leaves my hair feeling silky/healthy</li>
            <li> I had been using the Davines Melu shampoo and conditioner, which are specially targeted for damaged hair, but switched to this because I loved how the Oi oil for hair smelled.  Was a little worried I wouldn&#x27;t get the same level of damage protection with the Oi shampoo and conditioner, but my worries were unfounded.  Hair comes out so soft and smooth, but not weighted down.  And no matter how tangled my hair can get, I put a little of the conditioner in and I can work the knots out with my fingers.  Plus, I like the smell a lot better than the Melu.  If you prefer musky or exotic scents over fruity or floral ones, you probably will, too.  It&#x27;s almost like sandalwood mixed with baby powder.</li>
            <li> I believe this product was probably exposed to extreme temperatures as the consistency was way off.  The results were poor as well.  I will go back to purchasing this only through my salon.</li>
            <li> Love love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Label didn&#x27;t look like previous purchases from salon. Smelled completely different. Not sure why? Seems to work OK, but my hair seems greasier.</li>
            <li> What can you say about all Davine&#x27;s products but &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; and this one clearly is a winner, hair feels great! Conditioner has a subtle scent that smells wonderful, you will love your hair all day.</li>
            <li> One of the reasons I buy this product is purely nostalgia. It reminds me of a scent or perfume my mother use to wear when she was going somewhere special and makes me feel like she is alive again. It has a delicate smell or aroma that just will remind you of grandma or mom and it stays in your hair for a day or two. In terms of how it works it does leave the hair soft and silky, however for this price could you find something equal probably like the bed head line of products that are slightly cheaper, but it is worth it when you consider you get the softness in the hair the shine and the perfume. I would even say it equal to the Moroccan Oil line of products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is knock-off Davines Oi and not the real thing. The first thing I noticed when I opened the package is that the label was different.... different font, different layout. I thought maybe Davines had just done a packaging update or something. Then I opened it and discovered it smells NOTHING like Oi. Smells more like lemon than anything else. At this point, I&#x27;ve already opened and used the product so it&#x27;s too late to return it.... I will say that it seems to do a good enough job conditioning my hair, but I&#x27;m disappointed I paid $26 for a product and got something completely different instead. Will not order again.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look and feel like I do when I leave a salon. Great smell, too.</li>
            <li> Smells different than before</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Davines products and they are typically much cheaper on Amazon than buying them at the salon I go to.  This conditioner is great!  It smooths my fine yet frizzy curly hair while still boosting shine and curl.  I like using it with the Oi hair oil serum.  It also smells fantastic.  I get compliments often when I use this product and other Davines products.  A little goes a long way, so I think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Softens hair and smells great.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended this conditioner after some of my hair broke off due to getting a perm a week after I got it colored. This conditioner basically saved my hair and my hair no longer breaks. It smells so good and it makes my hair soft and manageable. I highly recommend this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this my hair has not looked this good since I was a teenager</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, and it makes my hair soft and manageable without weighing it down. A little goes a long way, and unlike some of the other reviewers, I actually like the container, because I can choose exactly the amount I want, rather than dealing with a pump. It&#x27;s also easy to ensure that you get to use all of the product you actually paid for, rather than it clinging inside the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this product when I buy it from the salon.  The one purchased here was not the same, and probably a knock-off.  Davines is known for their scent and texture and both are way off in the product I received.  I was warned that products purchased online may not be genuine, but I for the price I thought I&#x27;d try it.  Very disappointing</li>
            <li> Highly perfumed! For those who are scent-sensitive, as I am, or need to be around others who are, this product has a very strong perfume. So even though it seems like a good conditioner, I can&#x27;t use it, which is why I give it one star. I think that the company should let the consumers know in their advertising about the strong scent.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but worth it! Leaves you hair soft and smelling wonderful!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I don&#x27;t have to straighten my hair it lays so well after use it. LOVE LOVE LOVE it</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Less expensive online then in a salon.  It works great too.  I use it as a leave in conditioner as well.  I have curly frizzy hair.  I want to try the whole line, but it is expensive.  The smell reminds me of an elegant perfume and Aveda.  I actual wear the Davines hair oil has a perfume (the one from this line).</li>
            <li> Hair conditioner (and shampoo) are so subjective so this is hard to review. For us, the Oi conditioner is great. I have wavy, slightly coarse hair, while my husband&#x27;s hair is very thick and straight. It works great for both of us. I wash my hair usually every other day and always use this conditioner; if I don&#x27;t use it, my hair notices and is not happy. I&#x27;ve probably been using it for about a year and a half, longer than any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> my absolute favorite new product. Wonders for the hair!</li>
            <li> Took for freakin&#x27; ever to get here, but it wasn&#x27;t the seller&#x27;s fault... USPS once again! It&#x27;s expensive, but worth it! I don&#x27;t think the shampoo is required. I got it for Christmas, but wouldn&#x27;t spend that much on shampoo. The oil is fabulous too!</li>
            <li> Received a sample of this in my Birchbox shipment, and I love it, so I got more. Makes my hair feel silky! It does have a very strong fragrance, so if you don&#x27;t like that, this probably isn&#x27;t for you. I am using this sporadically. Maybe 2x&#x27;s a week along with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have _ever_ used on my fine, dry, curly tending-to-frizz hair.  My hair guy&lt;br /&gt;turned me onto it.  I use it daily and the health of my hair has improved considerably.  Strongly recommend&lt;br /&gt;it for fragile hair.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a sample of this conditioner and loved it.  It left my hair super soft and manageable without leaving it flat or oily looking.  Was looking forward to getting the product to use regularly, but when it arrived the scent wa so strong I had to send it back.  I&#x27;m not sure if my sample was just not as strongly scented because it loses some of that due to the packaging or the smaller amount of product in the container, but I am sensitive to scents and this product was just not working for me on that level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame, because I love what it oes for my hair, but I just can&#x27;t handle the smell without getting a head ache.</li>
            <li> fabulous and so great. love what it does to my hair and my daughters/</li>
            <li> Great conditioner.  Makes my hair silky and shiny with no oily residue.  I discovered this as a sample in a Birchbox gift that I received.</li>
            <li> Conditions my dry, textured hair so well and it smells amazing !  It&#x27;s worth the money and it&#x27;s so dense you only need a little bit.  I use almost half of what I use with other conditioners.  Lasts a good three months.</li>
            <li> fabulous! love the way it smells!</li>
            <li> not as moisturizing as i hoped</li>
            <li> This conditioner left my hair feeling soft and moisturized with nice body and sheen.  I also have much less breakage since I started using it.  I like it but I was more impressed with the Oi All-In-One-Milk Leave-In Treatment.</li>
            <li> Again product does not seem to be the same as when I buy it from the salon I go to.  I only purchased on line because I have not had a chance to get there.&lt;br /&gt;It smells a little different and not as thick in consistency as my other jar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product as a deep conditioner for years.  This time the product had a nasty chemical smell and didn&#x27;t condition as well.  Very disappointed as this product isn&#x27;t cheap.  Not sure I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
            <li> This lasts a while and it&#x27;s absolutely worth the price.  Yes, you can find and purchase shampoo/conditioner at a lower price, but, as they always say, you get what you pay for.  Don&#x27;t buy it if you haven&#x27;t smelled it before - it has a strong, distinct smell.  Personally, I love it.  But - it&#x27;s too expensive and the scent is too strong for someone to purchase without knowing what they were getting.</li>
            <li> This Oi is amazing. It smells divine..my hair is so easy to work with afterwards. I use many chemicals; coloring my hair and beach etc. My hair is short so I don&#x27;t need much. I towel dry somewhat first, comb it through and when I&#x27;m done with my shower, rince..Absolutely my FAV right now.</li>
            <li> I have thick color treated hair (salon lightened to blonde with low lights, toner and base bump) that also tends to be naturally dry and wiry and that gets subjected to a lot of heat styling.  Basically, it is the kind of hair that can look fantastic or depressing depending on how I style it and what products I use.  I have a great regime for warding off the brassiness that can plague blonde hair (Kevin Murphy Blonde Angel which I would highly recommend for that purpose), but it doesn&#x27;t do much to keep the moisture in my hair and give me the soft feel I&#x27;m looking for.  So I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a shampoo and conditioner pair to use on the days I don&#x27;t use a violet shampoo.  To date, I&#x27;ve always gone in hopeful and ended up disappointed.  No matter how much a conditioner promised to deep condition my hair, it never seemed to be enough to make a difference.  Then I tried the Davines Oi shampoo and conditioner and I&#x27;ve been in love ever sense.  Out of everything I&#x27;ve tried, they seem to do the best job of keeping my hair in great condition and have made it feel softer than other shampoo/conditioner pairs have been able to.  It&#x27;s not a miracle cure (though I&#x27;m not convinced any product is) but it definitely makes a noticeable difference.  I also think the smell is pleasant.  It isn&#x27;t necessarily my favorite of all the hair products I&#x27;ve tried, but it isn&#x27;t overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the formulation of the conditioner itself, the packaging is also different since it is a tub rather than a bottle.  This is can be a blessing or a curse depending on your needs.  I personally think whenever something is in tub form I tend to use more of it than I would a product from a bottle if I&#x27;m not careful.  However, for me it&#x27;s actually been more convenient since I have very thick, longer hair and can spend forever trying to get enough conditioner for my needs out of a bottle.  This makes it easier to get as much as I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also worth noting that I do use the [[ASIN:B005EMQKHG Davines OI / Oil Absolute Beautifying Potion - 4.56 oz]] and Davines THIS IS A RELAXING MOISTURIZING FLUID after towel drying and before styling my hair.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m seeing better results because I&#x27;m using multiple products from the same brand vs. this shampoo and conditioner alone, but did feel it was worth noting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall for my hair needs I absolutely adore this conditioner.  Whenever I stock up and see the price tag it&#x27;s always tempting to get something cheaper because the price is steep (especially if you have thick, longer hair like me and are using a lot) but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!</li>
            <li> My stylist used this on my hair and I fell in love with the scent the minute he used it.  It really does make your hair smell freshly washed!</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but worth every penny.  I have suffered with some dry scalp issues for quite some time, and after a week of using this product, my dry scalp is gone.  A little bit of conditioner goes a long way.  A tub will last me about 6 weeks, and I have hair that goes almost down to my waist.  I have very straight smooth hair.  This product makes it shine.  I&#x27;ve been getting so many compliments on the way that my hair looks and smells.  Can&#x27;t say how happy I am with Davines!</li>
            <li> Amazing. Smells fantastic and my hair feels great using this product.</li>
            <li> The product is good but the jar is a pain to use in the shower.  I would much prefer they put it in a tube!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is awesome. Smells great and really makes your hair soft. I can&#x27;t use another conditioner. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I finally found a conditioner that I truly only need a very small amount to fully condition and soften my entire head of hair! This size will probably last me a year!</li>
            <li> I love this, I have thin fine hair and it works really great. Smooths my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> This came sealed and matches the one I am currently using in smell and texture.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Love the smell, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. Wish it detangled a little bit more though.</li>
            <li> Coupled with the shampoo and the after-shower spray, Davines Oi will leave your hair incredibly soft to the  touch, silky, and smooth! Your hair will dry faster, too - not sure how that works but it does! Your hair feels enriched and hydrated. A great product!</li>
            <li> This was a great value.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff after discovering at my local salon. Don&#x27;t have time to always stop there to restock, so this site is always my backup in finding my products and free shipping and returns. Can&#x27;t beat that. I know the smell and texture of this product, so def know I have legitimate stuff. Better than drugstore crap.. I invest in hair products, especially after you pay A LOT at the salon to look FAB! Worth it and the smell gets lots on compliments.</li>
