    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>But in terms of the flex, the shaping and pointing of the teeth, it&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect brush for me.</li>
            <li>and I was handed a beautiful brush for my cats!</li>
            <li>excellent for washing hair as well as massaging head</li>
            <li>Excellent value and fits into pocket and gives your head a good brush and head a wee massage.</li>
            <li>It works great for mens hair too...</li>
            <li>These guys work great</li>
            <li>Feels good on the scalp too</li>
            <li>Nice brush for a good scalp massage.</li>
            <li>They love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like petting her than brushing her.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve lent this out to friends with dogs and while removing hair might take some time to remove, this is more gentler approach than using steel combs.</li>
            <li>I was at a famous well known pet store</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to find this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I cannot justify paying more than that for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to settle for many sub par cheaply designed picket combs.</li>
            <li>I gave the brush to my grandson and he loved it thanks.</li>
            <li>a break cat owners all over the world know cats are into cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>Like the box you get for free from Amazon, so on and so on...</li>
            <li>Was suprised how cheap it looked right off the bat.  </li>
            <li>Very thin, but good.. Very handy to have product.  </li>
            <li>The molded bristles in this brush are soft, as described, and make shampooing comfortable again.</li>
            <li>initially bought two and am so pleased I just bought another 2-pack.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to carry in a front or back pocket.</li>
            <li>Do you see how much cat brushes cost...</li>
            <li>Old school wins again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it to brush out my scalp while my hair is dry and free of product, then I shower and shampoo with Zincon.</li>
            <li>It was also delivered quickly and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the entire purchase from beginning to end.</li>
            <li>Having never heard of the company American Comb Corporation,  I am happy to report this item is not only 100% American made, but a less expensive and more comfortable alternative to traditional combs.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had surgery on my scalp and there are spots that are still sensitive.  </li>

            <li> For 20+ years I&#x27;d find these in beauty supply stores for $2-$3 each, but they&#x27;re almost impossible to find now at any price.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re used for scalp massages in some spas, and really help with winter dandruff, as well as being easy to pack travel brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as soft as I&#x27;d like, but not as stiff, especially after dumping it in warmer water.    </li>
            <li> Bristles are very short and hurt, like they are uneven</li>
            <li> This product is everything I expected and hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> rip off much too expensive</li>
            <li> It makes brushing her easier and less stressful for both of us.</li>
            <li> Small</li>
            <li> I received the one hole type not the three hole like I have purchased in the past</li>
            <li> Not happy they wasn&#x27;t what was advertised</li>

            <li> I love these kinds of brushes to use when shampooing, but this one is really uncomfortable and hurts.  Was suprised how cheap it looked right off the bat.  Bristles are very short and hurt, like they are uneven and I&#x27;m poking myself.</li>
            <li> I purchased these palm brushes for my pet.  It makes brushing her easier and less stressful for both of us. It&#x27;s more like petting her than brushing her.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think something this simple would be a no-brainier. But in terms of the flex, the shaping and pointing of the teeth, it&#x27;s just perfect. If you&#x27;re trying to rid yourself of pesky dandruff, get this immediately. I use it to brush out my scalp while my hair is dry and free of product, then I shower and shampoo with Zincon. It&#x27;s the miracle cure for dandruff that&#x27;s been plaguing me for years.</li>
            <li> I have had surgery on my scalp and there are spots that are still sensitive.  The molded bristles in this brush are soft, as described, and make shampooing comfortable again.</li>
            <li> Having never heard of the company American Comb Corporation,  I am happy to report this item is not only 100% American made, but a less expensive and more comfortable alternative to traditional combs.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve lent this out to friends with dogs and while removing hair might take some time to remove, this is more gentler approach than using steel combs.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect brush for me. I&#x27;ve had to settle for many sub par cheaply designed picket combs. This one does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Does the trick, just as advertised.  Small and it fits in the pocket neatly.</li>
            <li> Very thin, but good.. Very handy to have product.  Feels good on the scalp too</li>
            <li> Not happy they wasn&#x27;t what was advertised I received the one hole type not the three hole like I have purchased in the past SO I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these</li>
            <li> I use this for my cats... They love it! Do you see how much cat brushes cost... I was at a famous well known pet store and I was handed a beautiful brush for my cats! I almost passed out when I saw the tag. I said&#x27; Elizabeth... Elizabeth... I coming... as I staggered across the isle...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give me a break cat owners all over the world know cats are into cheap stuff. Like the box you get for free from Amazon, so on and so on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush was purrfect for my kitties. It works great for mens hair too... Thats how I remembered this hair comb. Old school wins again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cats give this 5 paws...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I was able to find this on Amazon.  It&#x27;s easy to carry in a front or back pocket.</li>
            <li> excellent for washing hair as well as massaging head</li>
            <li> If I was reviewing the product itself; it&#x27;d get 5 stars. It&#x27;s not as soft as I&#x27;d like, but not as stiff, especially after dumping it in warmer water.    However, do your research prior to purchasing it from here; the thing will cost you $.69 in your local grocery store (attached is the picture of the receipt). On Amazon the 2-pack goes for $7 &#x3D; $3.5 each. Both are literally identical. I cannot justify paying more than that for it.</li>
            <li> This product is everything I expected and hoped it would be. It was also delivered quickly and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the entire purchase from beginning to end.</li>
            <li> Excellent value and fits into pocket and gives your head a good brush and head a wee massage.</li>
            <li> Got one for my travel bag and one for my gym bag. These guys work great</li>
            <li> rip off much too expensive</li>
            <li> I gave the brush to my grandson and he loved it thanks.</li>
            <li> For 20+ years I&#x27;d find these in beauty supply stores for $2-$3 each, but they&#x27;re almost impossible to find now at any price.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re used for scalp massages in some spas, and really help with winter dandruff, as well as being easy to pack travel brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I initially bought two and am so pleased I just bought another 2-pack.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the handles wear and break -- I think they&#x27;ve used the same plastic mold since plastic was invented -- but it&#x27;s not enough of an issue to not give them 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Nice brush for a good scalp massage.</li>
