            <li>Nice hold &amp; no flaking.</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff for twist outs on natural hair.  </li>
            <li>It also works as a great setting lotion because the shape and dimension of my hairstyle can withstand the humid DC summers, and even hot crowded nights in the club.</li>

            <li>Works great on holding short giveaways.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, shipped fast.</li>
            <li>It gives a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>For years I have used a foam wrapp that can be purchased at your local beauty supply stores and that was good, but I found out about this product in a hair magazine, I also found out Grammy winning</li>
            <li>My new favorite!</li>
            <li>am pleased with the product and with Amazon for finding it and delivering it very fast.</li>
            <li>With the amount of product that she used, I was sure that my hair would turn out crisp and flaky..</li>
            <li>so this significantly decreases the heat needed to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>but I tried Amazon and was able to find it very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unlike many setting lotions it does not flake whatsoever, it not hard, or sticky.</li>
            <li>It really helps to detangle and smooth the hair before the heat is applied.</li>
            <li>What I love most about this product is that you don&#x27;t have to use much to cover your entire head.</li>
            <li>Love this product for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>Product was what I expected , very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Molds my hair really good and less dandruff.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it states and describes.</li>
            <li>Smooths out my curls and lays down for a nice molded look.</li>
            <li>Always a great product black short hair, doesnt matter how course your hair is.</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>This has really saved my hair as I used to heat style every day.</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft and shiny!!!  </li>
            <li>By the time it dries your hair does not need a lot of flat ironing/curling since the product already smoothed my hair significantly.</li>
            <li>It does wonders for my new pixie cut!</li>
            <li>The other added benefit that is different about this product is that it adds a gorgeous sheen to the hair and my flat iron just glides over it, and doesn&#x27;t snag or pull.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural, with no perm in my hair.</li>
            <li>excelent productu for a 3c  natural hair  give shine and definition</li>
            <li>Transformed my twist outs on natural hair.</li>
            <li>It was fast and wrapped secured enough that their was no spillage.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and looks so shiny</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair soft, no flakes.</li>
            <li>it make s your hair really soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>This foam left my hair soft, shiny and with lots of body!</li>
            <li>High shine and doesn&#x27;t leave hair flaky or dry.</li>

            <li> I am transitioning and I needed a product to hold my flat twist out in the humid rainy Texas weather.</li>
            <li> I will use this as long as it&#x27;s being sold.</li>
            <li> I wash and condition then use a quarter size amount of essential botanical oil (also nairobi) on my soaking wet hair</li>
            <li> (of course they straighten out but are still quite shapely) as long as I sleep on a satin pillow.</li>
            <li> Will be using this product for a long time!</li>
            <li> No flaking or residue build up after you&#x27;re dry.</li>
            <li> Now that my hair is growing back, I use this to lay my hair down</li>
            <li> It left my hair dry and a little body.</li>
            <li> but if you have very dry hair</li>
            <li> Plain and Simple</li>
            <li> Then I either roller set it and go under the dryer, or wrap it down and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> It is thick and lays down hair well, it is not runny like other foams, it leaves hair bouncy and soft!</li>
            <li> I would say that compared to other foams that my other stylists used, and the foams that I have used at home, the Nairobi Wrapp</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot when I work out and Nairobi is the only wrapping lotion that does not get hard a crunchy after my hair dries from working out.  </li>
            <li> This stuff dried hard on my hair, opposite of what it supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I can set my hair in half the time using this foam.</li>
            <li> I always like to read ingredients lists and was a little concerned</li>
            <li> I did not know what I was missing</li>
            <li> All other wraps I have ever used would make my hair hard, stiff, and prone to breakage when my hair dried from working out.    </li>
            <li> Helps hair dey faat and shiny without flakes or heavy residue!</li>
            <li> MEDICAL TREATMENT BAD REACTION FROM THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product previously and was unable to purchase it in the Beauty Supply Store.&lt;br /&gt;I was so disappointed</li>
            <li> I was truly thinking about cutting all of my hair off.</li>
            <li> Just know that you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was so wrong!!</li>
            <li> I hate it!</li>

            <li> Always a great product black short hair, doesnt matter how course your hair is. its great1</li>
            <li> For years I have used a foam wrapp that can be purchased at your local beauty supply stores and that was good, but I found out about this product in a hair magazine, I also found out Grammy winning R&amp;B artist Monica swears by this product! What I love most about this product is that you don&#x27;t have to use much to cover your entire head.</li>
            <li> Great product and got it pretty fast!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product previously and was unable to purchase it in the Beauty Supply Store.&lt;br /&gt;I was so disappointed but I tried Amazon and was able to find it very easily.&lt;br /&gt;To add icing to the cake, I was going away a couple of days after I placed the order and I recieved it before I left for vacation!&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the product and with Amazon for finding it and delivering it very fast.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0030VBCR6 Nairobi Wrapp-It Shine Foaming Lotion(8 oz)]]    I NEVER leave home without it!  Its the bomb! Plain and Simple</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff for twist outs on natural hair.  It leaves my hair silky with lots of body and shine.  I can set my hair in half the time using this foam.</li>
            <li> everything I have tried by Nairobi has been really great. This product does exactly what it states and describes. Will be using this product for a long time!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Product was sealed and packaged well.  This was a purchase for a friend of mines who asked if I could get it for her.  She raves about it so I know she loves it.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product created by man/woman for my hair!  I love this stuff!  I make sure to keep the foaming lotion around. I recently went through chemo and lost my hair.  Now that my hair is growing back, I use this to lay my hair down and it&#x27;s not sticky or flaky!  Recommend it to all African American women! Looooove it!</li>
            <li> This works really well. My beautician uses it all the time. Going to order the 32 oz refill. I love it and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I hate it! I&#x27;m natural, with no perm in my hair. My hair is fine and wavey. This stuff dried hard on my hair, opposite of what it supposed to do. Used it 3x hoping to get the body and shine...not the case.It left my hair dry and a little body. Maybe it works better on relaxed/permed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will keep using Suave and TRESemm&amp;eacute; mousse.</li>
            <li> My stylist uses this product on my hair when I get a roller wrap. With the amount of product that she used, I was sure that my hair would turn out crisp and flaky.. I was so wrong!! This foam left my hair soft, shiny and with lots of body! My wrap style lasted between salon visits, and even helped to reduce breakage!! I wanted to test this product at home to see if I will get the same results. I would say that compared to other foams that my other stylists used, and the foams that I have used at home, the Nairobi Wrapp-It Shine Foaming Lotion surpasses them all!! I would recommend this product to professionals as well as kitchen beauticians!!</li>
            <li> This product dosent feel like the product i got from orginal Nairobi. Dosent smell the same feels like water and not foam i orignally.</li>

            <li> Nairobi leaves a nice shine to my hair</li>
            <li> I love it. I will use this as long as it&#x27;s being sold. I was truly thinking about cutting all of my hair off. It helps detangle &amp; condition my hair.</li>
            <li> Best thing Ive ever put on my hair. Using this product has helped my hair grow by saving it from heat damage. It protects it from heat damage for 2 reasons: 1. The ingredients (heat activated lubricator) and 2. It really helps to detangle and smooth the hair before the heat is applied. I wash and condition then use a quarter size amount of essential botanical oil (also nairobi) on my soaking wet hair, then I put about 3-4 pumps of the foam in my palms and run it through my hair. Then I either roller set it and go under the dryer, or wrap it down and let it air dry. By the time it dries your hair does not need a lot of flat ironing/curling since the product already smoothed my hair significantly. I have African American 3b-3c hair so this significantly decreases the heat needed to straighten my hair. It also works as a great setting lotion because the shape and dimension of my hairstyle can withstand the humid DC summers, and even hot crowded nights in the club. The other added benefit that is different about this product is that it adds a gorgeous sheen to the hair and my flat iron just glides over it, and doesn&#x27;t snag or pull. Unlike many setting lotions it does not flake whatsoever, it not hard, or sticky. It feels like there is nothing on my hair. My hair also tends to hold the relative shape of the curl for 4-5 days (of course they straighten out but are still quite shapely) as long as I sleep on a satin pillow. This has really saved my hair as I used to heat style every day. Thats about it! I hope this review helps someone out there!</li>

            <li> One of the best hair products out. It does wonders for my new pixie cut!</li>
            <li> I always like to read ingredients lists and was a little concerned this wasn&#x27;t provided before I ordered it. But I had read about it in a book on hair care, so I ordered it thinking I would read about the ingredients when it arrived. No ingredients listed...I have never seen that in a quality product, so I threw it away. I like knowing what I&#x27;m putting on my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> It is a very good prod. I did not know what I was missing Thank you</li>
