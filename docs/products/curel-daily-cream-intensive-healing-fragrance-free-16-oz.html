            <li>It&#x27;s great, but not designer brand pricing great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great hand cream.</li>
            <li>Love It!!</li>
            <li>anyone still has any questions for me, I&#x27;d be happy to go into even more detail regarding any responses on this cream.  </li>
            <li>and I love it for my eczema!  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this exact Curel cream as the best product available for hands and cuticles!</li>
            <li>This one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I love it.</li>
            <li>I follow many beauty blogs, and one of them did a comparison of creams that were lower priced &amp;#34;dupes&amp;#34; for La Mer and could be used on the face.</li>
            <li>Niva was a top one, as was this Curel cream.</li>
            <li>For the first couple of days, the skin on my face was beautiful -- smooth, plump, and glowing.</li>
            <li>There are many Curel products that I like quite a bit, and I was expecting to like this as well.  </li>
            <li>I believe I will be able to use this.</li>
            <li>This does not have &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; and it seems I will be able to use it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hands from drying out, without being too greasy (if you make sure to use just a bit).</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think I do my skin any favors by dragging it when putting on something that&#x27;s supposed to make it better.  </li>
            <li>After four days of use, my toes are perfect and my heels are definitely on their way there.</li>
            <li>could deal with the mineral oil/face conundrum, given how well it is working on my feet, but the paraban issue is much more concerning.</li>
            <li>thought it would be more fluidlike.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency.  </li>
            <li>That said, where it is applied does feel in some ways, more protected from the elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best cream I have tried in a long time.  </li>
            <li>the more I would recommend it, however, if you have an oily skin type, I strongly suggest skipping this product all together.  </li>
            <li>It really does a good job smoothing extra-dry skin and making it look smooth!  </li>
            <li>I also love it because it&#x27;s fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>Some are good, some are watery, some contain too much perfume.</li>
            <li>I think it does a good job absorbing easily-</li>
            <li>it does: This cream is very good for severe dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Your skin will be silky smooth in no time at all.</li>
            <li>I just bought 3 jars for 9.99 each elsewhere and got free shipping.</li>
            <li>This cream is available at Target for $11.00 and on line at drugstore.com for $12.99</li>
            <li>but you have to pay $5.99 shipping unless you order more than $25 worth.  </li>
            <li>important...</li>
            <li>This is important for, if you&#x27;re in a rush, use something else.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic</li>
            <li>I still must strongly suggest that anything over $12.99 is probably more than anyone should pay for this exact cream.  </li>
            <li>It is recommended by physicians for healing and comfort after treatments, lovely smell, cool to the skin and economical.</li>
            <li>Bought it at Kmart for $8 it was originally $12.99.</li>
            <li>This is great for dry hands.</li>
            <li>When you get it right, it&#x27;s a great product, that with enough time worked into the schedule</li>
            <li>Curel cream has helped my skin stay nice and soft,</li>
            <li>I still am looking for a cheaper alternative, but for now you can&#x27;t really get better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It re-blended pretty easily, though.</li>
            <li>Really is good for dry skin, but is not greasy.</li>
            <li>By the third night, his feet looked pretty good.</li>
            <li>So good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this and it does a good job on dry hands.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best for someone of a skin type that is low in oil, and is most effective on skin that has seen little to no moisturizer in a long period of time.  </li>
            <li>i like that it is fragrance-free, but it is very greasy and sticky, which i&#x27;d be fine with if i didn&#x27;t have to reapply it.</li>
            <li>It is worth a try.  </li>
            <li>For a laugh, type in Curél Intensive Healing into Google Shopping, and be amazed at the highest asking price for this product.  </li>
            <li>It is rich and very moisturizing as well as odorless.</li>
            <li>For those that don&#x27;t want to read a long review to get the most important information, I&#x27;ll start with that...</li>
            <li>While it may not moisturize as much immediately, the pro is that the formula is not greasy - rubbing it into your skin for 30 seconds doesn&#x27;t leave the greasy residue, and I&#x27;m able to resume normal activities like writing or typing almost</li>
            <li>This cream works great for both dry hands and sensitive face skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I think it&#x27;s better than a regular lotion, I didn&#x27;t find it to be that quick-absorbing or far more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>And because I use so much, I go through it quickly.</li>
            <li>Amazing hand cream, especially for those in the health care industry who wear gloves much of the time.</li>
            <li>As skin starts to heal, the effectiveness of this cream starts to become less compared to other brands, but if you&#x27;re looking for a place to start to get the most healing in the quickest amount of time, this product (when used right) does a great</li>
            <li>Keeps your hands soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>When it did absorb, my skin didn&#x27;t feel any softer or more moisturized, especially when it came to my feet and the tops of my toes.</li>
            <li>I was concerned at first because it does have mineral oil in it and mineral oil used to break me out</li>
            <li>I need a bit more moisture but especially on my face.  </li>
            <li>While all lotions make the hands more likely to leave finger prints, finger prints from this product are like prints on steroids.  </li>
            <li>your skin will not absorb as much as younger skin so it does tend to stay on top of the skin...not their fault though.</li>
            <li>It too took a while to absorb, leaving white streaks that took forever to get worked into the skin, and it didn&#x27;t really make my skin feel much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For people that own pets, after this product has been worked in, it&#x27;s much easier to pet a cat/dog what have you, than after using many other Curél products, for there&#x27;s far less water, and a lot more oil in this product.  </li>
            <li>I think my very dry skin looks so much better when I use the Curel Intensive Healing.</li>
            <li>Currently I&#x27;ve been using coconut oil with great results, but I thought this might absorb a little faster.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m honest, I do use quite a lot of it day to day because I live in the desert and suffer from extremely flaky/scaly skin.</li>
            <li>when I&#x27;m trying to find the most effective product for my needs, often I feel like I&#x27;m shopping partially blind, so for any men out there that are looking for thorough reviews, this is why I have gone into the level of detail I have...  </li>
            <li>I am very allergic to scents and this product has almost no scent whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.</li>
            <li>thicker than the bottle form really helps with cracking feet</li>
            <li>But with lotions, their effect can be very transient.  </li>
            <li>I have already given it to my grandma (who also loves it)  and my mother in law (who also loves it) who both get really chapped hands.</li>
            <li>I probably use a whole pot of it every two weeks.</li>
            <li>If you much prefer nonstick cookware, get something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Why does it cost so much here?</li>
            <li>As many have stated, it is heavier, much heavier than probably any other Curél product out there, (though I haven&#x27;t tried the foot cream, so that may be an exception).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much better than other creams I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Much more problematic, and much more difficult to remove, even after having the device in a pocket for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, if you are older (50ish)</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>There are other brands that fit in much</li>
            <li>In addition to expected benefits, it has improved my nails tremendously!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far more greasy than a lot of other products out there, and doesn&#x27;t spread well at first.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put this on all over my body right after shower or steam room and an extra layer on my feet then wear the socks on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to use too much than just the right amount, and yet still very possible to use not enough and need to reapply as a result.  </li>
            <li>and I guarantee you will be greatly surprised at how fast it works to soft and remove any cracks, crevices or calluses from your skin.</li>
            <li>My nose is very sensitive to any fragrance, which makes my eyes water for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream for baby soft supple skin.</li>
            <li>Unlike other creams it has a lasting effect on the skin and my body feels more moist.</li>
            <li>but apparently my \\&quot;older\\&quot; skin doesn&#x27;t mind so much.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another important thing this cream does not do is, after application, and after it has been worked in well, the hands do not feel quite as soft as they do from other Curél products like Ultra Healing, or Hand and Cuticle, or Itch Defense, or</li>
            <li>I put this on over my Bio Oil and my face is very comfortable the whole day and even into the next day if I&#x27;m being lazy on the weekend.  </li>
            <li>no more dry skin, I use  daily, it works great on my feet too, they&#x27;re no longer rough and dry, I love this product~</li>
            <li>There are many other products from other brands and Curél that are much easier to balance (pump and no pump) the amount needed, and or redistribute what has been over applied.  </li>
            <li>This is a huge jar and will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li>pretty much any other Curél product out there.  </li>
            <li>I am a Registered Nurse and cannot say enough about this very high quality cream.</li>
            <li>It works and make his skin soft and moisturize all day.</li>
            <li>Ot seems that this one which I bought at Target,  truly works to make my legs soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>However, it leaves your skin feeling soft and soothed.</li>
            <li>However, after applying 3-4 times a day for 3 weeks, my skin is almost completely healed and soft again</li>
            <li>This cream&#x27;s effects last, and you don&#x27;t need much at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used every cream ever on by one year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I received a sample of this cream in the mail and could not find it in any store near me.  </li>
            <li>so the tub should last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it really is the only product I can 100% recommend.</li>
            <li>This is its only real downside because I&#x27;d like to keep the water ON my skin, not towel it off.</li>
            <li>B008H2UTFE Curel Intensive Healing Cream for Extra-Dry or Sensitive Skin, Fragrance-Free, 16 oz]]</li>
            <li>It is so soft and creamy.  </li>
            <li>This helps my extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth the price (anywhere but here unfortunately), but it&#x27;s not for the hurried, and much more for those who don&#x27;t mind labor of love.&lt;br</li>
            <li>more thick, like gesso paint.</li>
            <li>This product is thick, but not too thick, and it smooths on easily and is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff for my psoriasis, especially for winter dry skin where my patches get really dry.</li>
            <li>This cream grabs hold and comes out in higher amounts than expected, (again, even using just one finger).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Because of the consistency of the cream, it&#x27;s very difficult to get the right amount, for putting even just one finger into the cream can easily be too much for the hands.  </li>
            <li>Just a small amount smoothed over your hands, and a bit more on the trouble spots works very well.</li>
            <li>It is not super cheap, either, so I wish I could buy it in bigger containers for a lesser price.</li>
            <li>the skin on my hands is supple and no longer painful because of this great product.  </li>
            <li>, I have had persistent cracks near fingertips which have finally healed after using this cream.  </li>
            <li>expect results the next day, but by sticking with the Curel for a few weeks, I&#x27;ve definitely seen results, and without the sticky, greasy residue of so many other moisturizing formulas.</li>
            <li>obviously this is only useful for the external but, it keeps my hands from cracking due to the dryness produced by the disease.  </li>
            <li>on the very sensitive and dry skin of my hands and feet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to over apply, and again, why it&#x27;s not best for people in a rush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin (as a child I was diagnosed with eczema), and I&#x27;m always looking for new lotions/products to try.</li>
            <li>A must have for those who have sensitive and dry skin.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> When you get it right, it&#x27;s a great product, that with enough time worked into the schedule</li>
            <li> Curel cream has helped my skin stay nice and soft,</li>
            <li> I still am looking for a cheaper alternative, but for now you can&#x27;t really get better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It re-blended pretty easily, though.</li>
            <li> Really is good for dry skin, but is not greasy.</li>
            <li> By the third night, his feet looked pretty good.</li>
            <li> So good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this and it does a good job on dry hands.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best for someone of a skin type that is low in oil, and is most effective on skin that has seen little to no moisturizer in a long period of time.  </li>
            <li> i like that it is fragrance-free, but it is very greasy and sticky, which i&#x27;d be fine with if i didn&#x27;t have to reapply it.</li>
            <li> It is worth a try.  </li>
            <li> For a laugh, type in Curél Intensive Healing into Google Shopping, and be amazed at the highest asking price for this product.  </li>
            <li> It is rich and very moisturizing as well as odorless.</li>
            <li> For those that don&#x27;t want to read a long review to get the most important information, I&#x27;ll start with that...</li>
            <li> While it may not moisturize as much immediately, the pro is that the formula is not greasy - rubbing it into your skin for 30 seconds doesn&#x27;t leave the greasy residue, and I&#x27;m able to resume normal activities like writing or typing almost</li>
            <li> This cream works great for both dry hands and sensitive face skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I think it&#x27;s better than a regular lotion, I didn&#x27;t find it to be that quick-absorbing or far more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> And because I use so much, I go through it quickly.</li>
            <li> Amazing hand cream, especially for those in the health care industry who wear gloves much of the time.</li>
            <li> As skin starts to heal, the effectiveness of this cream starts to become less compared to other brands, but if you&#x27;re looking for a place to start to get the most healing in the quickest amount of time, this product (when used right) does a great</li>
            <li> Keeps your hands soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> When it did absorb, my skin didn&#x27;t feel any softer or more moisturized, especially when it came to my feet and the tops of my toes.</li>
            <li> I was concerned at first because it does have mineral oil in it and mineral oil used to break me out</li>
            <li> I need a bit more moisture but especially on my face.  </li>
            <li> While all lotions make the hands more likely to leave finger prints, finger prints from this product are like prints on steroids.  </li>
            <li> your skin will not absorb as much as younger skin so it does tend to stay on top of the skin...not their fault though.</li>
            <li> It too took a while to absorb, leaving white streaks that took forever to get worked into the skin, and it didn&#x27;t really make my skin feel much better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For people that own pets, after this product has been worked in, it&#x27;s much easier to pet a cat/dog what have you, than after using many other Curél products, for there&#x27;s far less water, and a lot more oil in this product.  </li>
            <li> I think my very dry skin looks so much better when I use the Curel Intensive Healing.</li>
            <li> Currently I&#x27;ve been using coconut oil with great results, but I thought this might absorb a little faster.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m honest, I do use quite a lot of it day to day because I live in the desert and suffer from extremely flaky/scaly skin.</li>
            <li> when I&#x27;m trying to find the most effective product for my needs, often I feel like I&#x27;m shopping partially blind, so for any men out there that are looking for thorough reviews, this is why I have gone into the level of detail I have...  </li>
            <li> I am very allergic to scents and this product has almost no scent whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream.</li>
            <li> thicker than the bottle form really helps with cracking feet</li>
            <li> But with lotions, their effect can be very transient.  </li>
            <li> I have already given it to my grandma (who also loves it)  and my mother in law (who also loves it) who both get really chapped hands.</li>
            <li> I probably use a whole pot of it every two weeks.</li>
            <li> If you much prefer nonstick cookware, get something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Why does it cost so much here?</li>
            <li> As many have stated, it is heavier, much heavier than probably any other Curél product out there, (though I haven&#x27;t tried the foot cream, so that may be an exception).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much better than other creams I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Much more problematic, and much more difficult to remove, even after having the device in a pocket for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, if you are older (50ish)</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> There are other brands that fit in much</li>
            <li> In addition to expected benefits, it has improved my nails tremendously!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far more greasy than a lot of other products out there, and doesn&#x27;t spread well at first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put this on all over my body right after shower or steam room and an extra layer on my feet then wear the socks on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to use too much than just the right amount, and yet still very possible to use not enough and need to reapply as a result.  </li>
            <li> and I guarantee you will be greatly surprised at how fast it works to soft and remove any cracks, crevices or calluses from your skin.</li>
            <li> My nose is very sensitive to any fragrance, which makes my eyes water for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream for baby soft supple skin.</li>
            <li> Unlike other creams it has a lasting effect on the skin and my body feels more moist.</li>
            <li> but apparently my \\&quot;older\\&quot; skin doesn&#x27;t mind so much.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another important thing this cream does not do is, after application, and after it has been worked in well, the hands do not feel quite as soft as they do from other Curél products like Ultra Healing, or Hand and Cuticle, or Itch Defense, or</li>
            <li> I put this on over my Bio Oil and my face is very comfortable the whole day and even into the next day if I&#x27;m being lazy on the weekend.  </li>
            <li> no more dry skin, I use  daily, it works great on my feet too, they&#x27;re no longer rough and dry, I love this product~</li>
            <li> There are many other products from other brands and Curél that are much easier to balance (pump and no pump) the amount needed, and or redistribute what has been over applied.  </li>
            <li> This is a huge jar and will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> pretty much any other Curél product out there.  </li>
            <li> I am a Registered Nurse and cannot say enough about this very high quality cream.</li>
            <li> It works and make his skin soft and moisturize all day.</li>
            <li> Ot seems that this one which I bought at Target,  truly works to make my legs soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> However, it leaves your skin feeling soft and soothed.</li>
            <li> However, after applying 3-4 times a day for 3 weeks, my skin is almost completely healed and soft again</li>
            <li> This cream&#x27;s effects last, and you don&#x27;t need much at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used every cream ever on by one year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> I received a sample of this cream in the mail and could not find it in any store near me.  </li>
            <li> so the tub should last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it really is the only product I can 100% recommend.</li>
            <li> This is its only real downside because I&#x27;d like to keep the water ON my skin, not towel it off.</li>
            <li> B008H2UTFE Curel Intensive Healing Cream for Extra-Dry or Sensitive Skin, Fragrance-Free, 16 oz]]</li>
            <li> It is so soft and creamy.  </li>
            <li> This helps my extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth the price (anywhere but here unfortunately), but it&#x27;s not for the hurried, and much more for those who don&#x27;t mind labor of love.&lt;br</li>
            <li> more thick, like gesso paint.</li>
            <li> This product is thick, but not too thick, and it smooths on easily and is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my psoriasis, especially for winter dry skin where my patches get really dry.</li>
            <li> This cream grabs hold and comes out in higher amounts than expected, (again, even using just one finger).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the consistency of the cream, it&#x27;s very difficult to get the right amount, for putting even just one finger into the cream can easily be too much for the hands.  </li>
            <li> Just a small amount smoothed over your hands, and a bit more on the trouble spots works very well.</li>
            <li> It is not super cheap, either, so I wish I could buy it in bigger containers for a lesser price.</li>
            <li> the skin on my hands is supple and no longer painful because of this great product.  </li>
            <li> , I have had persistent cracks near fingertips which have finally healed after using this cream.  </li>
            <li> expect results the next day, but by sticking with the Curel for a few weeks, I&#x27;ve definitely seen results, and without the sticky, greasy residue of so many other moisturizing formulas.</li>
            <li> obviously this is only useful for the external but, it keeps my hands from cracking due to the dryness produced by the disease.  </li>
            <li> on the very sensitive and dry skin of my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to over apply, and again, why it&#x27;s not best for people in a rush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin (as a child I was diagnosed with eczema), and I&#x27;m always looking for new lotions/products to try.</li>
            <li> A must have for those who have sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Forpeople who live in very dry climates, this cream may work for regular dry skin, the drier the climate,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this is very thick and rich.  </li>
            <li> I have to be very careful after I use it to not get it anywhere near my face.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve always had dry skin, but i&#x27;ve been able to manage without thick, heavy creams.</li>
            <li> and it definitely helps my dry skin on my elbows, plus it deep conditions my face during sleep without coming off on my pillow.  </li>
            <li> Better than all the other expensive creams.</li>
            <li> go a long way</li>
            <li> I found this cream much too thick &amp; greasy.</li>
            <li> This Cream is terrific - heals dry skin and the moisturizer keeps on working!!</li>
            <li> I noticed a slight difference the next night and the next.</li>
            <li> Curel will cure the dry, flaky and scaly patches on your body.</li>
            <li> My husbands feet were so dry and cracked that I was worried that he would have to go see the foot</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my dry skin and it works.</li>
            <li> I have had chronic dry skin since birth.</li>
            <li> recommended for anyone with problem dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It helps in the dry winter months and when I break out with stress ecezma on my hands.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> But it just doesn&#x27;t work unless you are totally dry.</li>
            <li> A few hours after applying it to my legs I noticed that there was still a big white blotch of it just sitting on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I only use it during dry/cold weather because it is a thick cream texture that gives me baby soft skin after.</li>
            <li> cream does not wash off as much as typical lotions, (which is a good thing, for it does mean less needs to be reapplied for dry hands like mine after hand washing), also, soap suds on skin are decreased due to the use of this product, which highlights the increased amount of oil contained in this cream versus other creams and lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My heels were dry and cracked and the skin between my toes was really rough.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son has a very dry skin because of eczema.</li>
            <li> I quit using this on my face and instead use it on my legs, arms and hands, which tend to get very dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> It goes on really thick and keeps my VERY dry skin completely hydrated for about 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Due to medication I&#x27;m taking my skin is extremely dry.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it dries non-sticky.</li>
            <li> Other creams and lotions soaked up within an hour.</li>
            <li> For anyone who loves their smartphones, and does not keep them in cases or use screen protectors, use a different product, or live with very difficult residue to remove from the screen of your phone, and any other glossy surface for that matter, if you use this, and also touch your phone, (especially if you have over applied)</li>
            <li> have a few patches of extremely dry skin - specifically, my elbows, and a spot of contact dermatitis/eczema surrounding my ring finger.  </li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and this cream is gentle enough for dry painful skin.  </li>
            <li> Those who give this cream bad ratings apparently prefer a lotion that doesn&#x27;t take any time to rub in, and may even be using too much.  </li>
            <li> Unlike very thick, greasy creams like Vaseline or the Neutrogena Norwegian Formula cream, the Curel did not provide immediate relief - I found myself applying over and over in an attempt to stop the itching and burning from my extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> No more cracks or dry feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that I need to use my scrub a lot less.  </li>
            <li> warning, though - make sure your skin is TOTALLY dry from a shower/bath, as this stuff goes on TERRIBLY over wet skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand it when the skin of my face gets tight with dryness.  </li>
            <li> works well for my dry skin but is really thick and takes a while to absorb</li>
            <li> It goes on sort of like a clay mask, but absorbs well in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> this product doesn&#x27;t do: It&#x27;s a heavy cream.  </li>
            <li> Not as heavy or greasy as the lotions I was using in the past.  </li>
            <li> This also helps to make very little</li>
            <li> It is thick, heavy, sticky and does not spread or absorb well.  </li>
            <li> I do, however, use a small bit of the hand lotion to mix with it</li>
            <li> It has parabans, which I usually avoid.</li>
            <li> me, the biggest knock against this product is how difficult it is to dose out the proper amount needed.  </li>
            <li> otherwise it&#x27;s really hard to spread</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a thick intensive cream.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so thick</li>
            <li> I had a bad rash a few weeks ago which coupled with the seasonal change of winter itch, has made my hair follicles and skin dry and scaly</li>
            <li> This price is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is VERY thick and takes a while to sink it.</li>
            <li> Alas, no.  </li>
            <li> Very thick!  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so expensive here.</li>
            <li> cold weather and my hands in and out of dishwater, etc.</li>
            <li> It just smears in an unpleasant way.</li>
            <li> then i moved to the desert, and i was having to reapply throughout the day, all over my body, which is annoying.</li>
            <li> although from a dtrugstore - not at this outrageous Amazon price!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This cream works great for both dry hands and sensitive face skin. Was recommended for my daughter by dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Works well - not greasy at all</li>
            <li> If you have deep cracks, crevices and calluses on your feet, hands or elbows this is the product for you. Due to medication I&#x27;m taking my skin is extremely dry. My dermatologist gave me some samples (so I wouldn&#x27;t have to spend money on pharmaceuticals) and it has done a marvelous job of reducing all the signs of dryness and in my case age too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product and I guarantee you will be greatly surprised at how fast it works to soft and remove any cracks, crevices or calluses from your skin. Curel will cure the dry, flaky and scaly patches on your body. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time at all.</li>
            <li> This Cream is terrific - heals dry skin and the moisturizer keeps on working!!</li>
            <li> Awesome cream. Really is good for dry skin, but is not greasy. My husband and I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son has a very dry skin because of eczema. It works and make his skin soft and moisturize all day.</li>
            <li> This works well especially for winter dry/cold weather. Yes, it is a thick intensive cream. That&#x27;s why it leaves a greasiness feeling once it&#x27;s applied.  I only use it during dry/cold weather because it is a thick cream texture that gives me baby soft skin after. I put this on all over my body right after shower or steam room and an extra layer on my feet then wear the socks on.</li>
            <li> This product is for my husband.  He loves it and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else as his face cream!</li>
            <li> Love It!! Great Delivery!!</li>
            <li> This is a great cream. It stays on your skin for hours. Unscented. A must have for those who have sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> My husbands feet were so dry and cracked that I was worried that he would have to go see the foot dr. I ordered this cream. I applied the cream to his feet and then covered them with socks each night. I noticed a slight difference the next night and the next. By the third night, his feet looked pretty good. No more cracks or dry feet. I am very allergic to scents and this product has almost no scent whatsoever. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had a bad rash a few weeks ago which coupled with the seasonal change of winter itch, has made my hair follicles and skin dry and scaly no matter. Other creams and lotions soaked up within an hour. Ot seems that this one which I bought at Target,  truly works to make my legs soft and hydrated. It goes on sort of like a clay mask, but absorbs well in a few minutes. It&#x27;s not greasy as vaseline but is thicker than lotion. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Not as heavy or greasy as the lotions I was using in the past.  I think my very dry skin looks so much better when I use the Curel Intensive Healing.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream. It is recommended by physicians for healing and comfort after treatments, lovely smell, cool to the skin and economical.</li>
            <li> Curel cream has helped my skin stay nice and soft, no more dry skin, I use  daily, it works great on my feet too, they&#x27;re no longer rough and dry, I love this product~</li>
            <li> This is great for dry hands. I put it on every night during the winter. Keeps your hands soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am a Registered Nurse and cannot say enough about this very high quality cream. This is the very best cream I have ever&lt;br /&gt;used on the very sensitive and dry skin of my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> Curel is always a great product!</li>
            <li> I follow many beauty blogs, and one of them did a comparison of creams that were lower priced &amp;#34;dupes&amp;#34; for La Mer and could be used on the face. Niva was a top one, as was this Curel cream. I decided to give this Curel cream a try. For the first couple of days, the skin on my face was beautiful -- smooth, plump, and glowing. And then the clogged pores came. I quit using this on my face and instead use it on my legs, arms and hands, which tend to get very dry in the winter. The lotion is VERY thick and takes a while to sink it. However, it leaves your skin feeling soft and soothed. I would recommend for use on your body, but not on your face.</li>
            <li> works well for my dry skin but is really thick and takes a while to absorb</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my dry skin and it works. It feels like a protective shield over my face.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and this cream is gentle enough for dry painful skin.  This price is ridiculous.  I just bought 3 jars for 9.99 each elsewhere and got free shipping.</li>
            <li> Great product!  My dermatologist recommended it and I love it for my eczema!  But don&#x27;t pay this price for it!  I got the same product and the same size jar at Wal-Mart for just 13 bucks!</li>
            <li> I got this lotion on a whim at Target for $11 or $12. I have very dry skin (as a child I was diagnosed with eczema), and I&#x27;m always looking for new lotions/products to try. Currently I&#x27;ve been using coconut oil with great results, but I thought this might absorb a little faster. I also wanted another option in case I just didn&#x27;t want to smell like a coconut that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I think it&#x27;s better than a regular lotion, I didn&#x27;t find it to be that quick-absorbing or far more moisturizing. When it did absorb, my skin didn&#x27;t feel any softer or more moisturized, especially when it came to my feet and the tops of my toes. While it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or anything, I just didn&#x27;t think it worked to an \\&quot;intensive\\&quot; level. I prefer an Aveeno-type oatmeal lotion to this. It reminded me of a prescription lotion I had to use when I was younger. It too took a while to absorb, leaving white streaks that took forever to get worked into the skin, and it didn&#x27;t really make my skin feel much better. However, unlike that lotion, this one truly is fragrance-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short: This lotion didn&#x27;t work to an \\&quot;intensive healing\\&quot; level for me. I prefer Aveeno or ethnic skin care products like Coconut Oil.</li>
            <li> I have had chronic dry skin since birth. I have used every cream on the market. Some are good, some are watery, some contain too much perfume. This product is thick, but not too thick, and it smooths on easily and is absorbed quickly. Unlike other creams it has a lasting effect on the skin and my body feels more moist.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Curel from BzzAgent, and would definitely buy it again (although from a dtrugstore - not at this outrageous Amazon price!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a few patches of extremely dry skin - specifically, my elbows, and a spot of contact dermatitis/eczema surrounding my ring finger.  With the very sudden drop in temperature and humidity, my elbows went from soft to rough and itchy almost overnight, so I turned to the Curel Intesive Healing Cream.  Unlike very thick, greasy creams like Vaseline or the Neutrogena Norwegian Formula cream, the Curel did not provide immediate relief - I found myself applying over and over in an attempt to stop the itching and burning from my extremely dry skin.  However, after applying 3-4 times a day for 3 weeks, my skin is almost completely healed and soft again and I&#x27;ve cut back my application two twice daily.  While it may not moisturize as much immediately, the pro is that the formula is not greasy - rubbing it into your skin for 30 seconds doesn&#x27;t leave the greasy residue, and I&#x27;m able to resume normal activities like writing or typing almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect results the next day, but by sticking with the Curel for a few weeks, I&#x27;ve definitely seen results, and without the sticky, greasy residue of so many other moisturizing formulas.</li>
            <li> There are many Curel products that I like quite a bit, and I was expecting to like this as well.  Alas, no.  It is thick, heavy, sticky and does not spread or absorb well.  It has the consistency of a greasy paste.  A few hours after applying it to my legs I noticed that there was still a big white blotch of it just sitting on my skin.  I actually think I could forgive all that if I felt that it was moisturing well, but it doesn&#x27;t even do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I will never buy this again.</li>
            <li> thicker than the bottle form really helps with cracking feet</li>
            <li> I believe I will be able to use this. I have been sensitive/allergic to ALL products but keep trying. This does not have &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; and it seems I will be able to use it. A really big deal for me!</li>
            <li> I found this cream much too thick &amp; greasy.</li>
            <li> Best cream I have tried in a long time.  BUT DON&amp;#34;T PAY $42.00 for this!!!  This cream is available at Target for $11.00 and on line at drugstore.com for $12.99 but you have to pay $5.99 shipping unless you order more than $25 worth.  Paying $42 for this is ridiculous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With cold weather and my hands in and out of dishwater, etc., I have had persistent cracks near fingertips which have finally healed after using this cream.  Those who give this cream bad ratings apparently prefer a lotion that doesn&#x27;t take any time to rub in, and may even be using too much.  But with lotions, their effect can be very transient.  This cream&#x27;s effects last, and you don&#x27;t need much at all.  Just a small amount smoothed over your hands, and a bit more on the trouble spots works very well.</li>
            <li> i have scleroderma (internal and external) obviously this is only useful for the external but, it keeps my hands from cracking due to the dryness produced by the disease.  the skin on my hands is supple and no longer painful because of this great product.  recommended for anyone with problem dry skin.  good job Curel!</li>
            <li> Received a sample from my dermatologist. I love this product. It keeps my hands from drying out, without being too greasy (if you make sure to use just a bit). It helps in the dry winter months and when I break out with stress ecezma on my hands. I have already given it to my grandma (who also loves it)  and my mother in law (who also loves it) who both get really chapped hands.</li>
            <li> I swear by Curel Daily Cream Intensive Healing Fragrance-Free!  It really does a good job smoothing extra-dry skin and making it look smooth!  I also love it because it&#x27;s fragrance free.  My nose is very sensitive to any fragrance, which makes my eyes water for the rest of the day.  I think out of all the brands of moisturizing cream, this one is the best!</li>
            <li> Best eczema cream ever!  I&#x27;ve used every cream ever on by one year old daughter.  This one is by far the best.  Better than all the other expensive creams.</li>
            <li> excellent product, thank you, and my grade is 10.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this cream in the mail and could not find it in any store near me.  I have extremely dry skin.  This is the best cream since Nutra-e went off the market.  A little goes a long way and it dries non-sticky. I use it face to toes.  I highly recommend this cream for baby soft supple skin.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve always had dry skin, but i&#x27;ve been able to manage without thick, heavy creams. then i moved to the desert, and i was having to reapply throughout the day, all over my body, which is annoying. i was hoping to find a cream that would keep me moisturized for 24 hours, but this one does not do that; i still have to reapply twice a day. i like that it is fragrance-free, but it is very greasy and sticky, which i&#x27;d be fine with if i didn&#x27;t have to reapply it.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t do without this product!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this at the grocery store for about $13 - I&#x27;m hoping this is multiple packs for $40(?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is very thick and rich.  I was concerned at first because it does have mineral oil in it and mineral oil used to break me out but apparently my \\&quot;older\\&quot; skin doesn&#x27;t mind so much.  I do, however, use a small bit of the hand lotion to mix with it otherwise it&#x27;s really hard to spread it&#x27;s so thick and I don&#x27;t think I do my skin any favors by dragging it when putting on something that&#x27;s supposed to make it better.  This also helps to make very little go a long way so the tub should last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my face, my hands - anywhere I need a bit more moisture but especially on my face.  I can&#x27;t stand it when the skin of my face gets tight with dryness.  I put this on over my Bio Oil and my face is very comfortable the whole day and even into the next day if I&#x27;m being lazy on the weekend.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that I need to use my scrub a lot less.  A great product.  Just don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so expensive here.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product. It is rich and very moisturizing as well as odorless. So good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this from BzzAgent. I have been using it twice a day on my feet for about four days. It has made a huge difference. My heels were dry and cracked and the skin between my toes was really rough. After four days of use, my toes are perfect and my heels are definitely on their way there. So, from the \\&quot;does it work\\&quot; perspective, it definitely does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I do have a couple of concerns. It has parabans, which I usually avoid. It also has mineral oil, which will cause my face to breakout if it gets on it. I have to be very careful after I use it to not get it anywhere near my face. It absorbs really slowly, so I actually have to wash it off my hands to keep it off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could deal with the mineral oil/face conundrum, given how well it is working on my feet, but the paraban issue is much more concerning. I&#x27;ll have to think on that one for a while.</li>
            <li> This is basically the best lotion I can use on my body. It goes on really thick and keeps my VERY dry skin completely hydrated for about 24 hours. If I&#x27;m honest, I do use quite a lot of it day to day because I live in the desert and suffer from extremely flaky/scaly skin. And because I use so much, I go through it quickly. I probably use a whole pot of it every two weeks. It is not super cheap, either, so I wish I could buy it in bigger containers for a lesser price. But it really is the only product I can 100% recommend. I still am looking for a cheaper alternative, but for now you can&#x27;t really get better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fair warning, though - make sure your skin is TOTALLY dry from a shower/bath, as this stuff goes on TERRIBLY over wet skin. It just smears in an unpleasant way. This is its only real downside because I&#x27;d like to keep the water ON my skin, not towel it off. But it just doesn&#x27;t work unless you are totally dry.</li>
            <li> I can not believe that people pay  42 dollars here when you can buy at drugstore.com for 7.99 or your local Walmart for 11 dollars. WOW! I just am amazed... only 11 left.. lol! [[ASIN:B008H2UTFE Curel Intensive Healing Cream for Extra-Dry or Sensitive Skin, Fragrance-Free, 16 oz]]</li>
            <li> Recommended by my Dermatologist. Much better than other creams I&#x27;ve tried.  In addition to expected benefits, it has improved my nails tremendously!</li>
            <li> more thick, like gesso paint. thought it would be more fluidlike. But the formula works like a charm. wish it was a bit thinner</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my psoriasis, especially for winter dry skin where my patches get really dry. Bought it at Kmart for $8 it was originally $12.99. Def would not pay $11 for it.</li>
            <li> This lotion feels like a glove.  I love the consistency.  It is so soft and creamy.  I constantly have eczema on my hands. This helps my extremely sensitive skin.  My doctor told me to moisturize all the time so I will use this from now on.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin overly greasy like some lotions.  I think it does a good job absorbing easily- just like it says on the bottle.  It is worth a try.  I paid about $12 for 16 oz.  I see that it is listed on Amazon at $40 for 16 oz which is egregious.</li>
            <li> I have been using The Curel Intensive Healing Cream for over a year and it has worked  wonderfully.  Also I recently used it to protect my skin during radiation treatment for breast cancer and it helped a lot.  Even my doctors were impressed by this product.</li>
            <li> This is a huge jar and will last a very long time.  I like the feel of it and it definitely helps my dry skin on my elbows, plus it deep conditions my face during sleep without coming off on my pillow.  I&#x27;ve used products that cost triple the cost that didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> For those that don&#x27;t want to read a long review to get the most important information, I&#x27;ll start with that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most important... For anyone who loves their smartphones, and does not keep them in cases or use screen protectors, use a different product, or live with very difficult residue to remove from the screen of your phone, and any other glossy surface for that matter, if you use this, and also touch your phone, (especially if you have over applied) I can&#x27;t stress this enough.  While all lotions make the hands more likely to leave finger prints, finger prints from this product are like prints on steroids.  Much more problematic, and much more difficult to remove, even after having the device in a pocket for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find not enough men review lotions and creams, so when I&#x27;m trying to find the most effective product for my needs, often I feel like I&#x27;m shopping partially blind, so for any men out there that are looking for thorough reviews, this is why I have gone into the level of detail I have...  That being said, now for the goods and bads, and the inbetweens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it does: This cream is very good for severe dry skin.  It&#x27;s best for someone of a skin type that is low in oil, and is most effective on skin that has seen little to no moisturizer in a long period of time.  As skin starts to heal, the effectiveness of this cream starts to become less compared to other brands, but if you&#x27;re looking for a place to start to get the most healing in the quickest amount of time, this product (when used right) does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people that own pets, after this product has been worked in, it&#x27;s much easier to pet a cat/dog what have you, than after using many other Curél products, for there&#x27;s far less water, and a lot more oil in this product.  As many have stated, it is heavier, much heavier than probably any other Curél product out there, (though I haven&#x27;t tried the foot cream, so that may be an exception).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forpeople who live in very dry climates, this cream may work for regular dry skin, the drier the climate, the more I would recommend it, however, if you have an oily skin type, I strongly suggest skipping this product all together.  There are other brands that fit in much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this product doesn&#x27;t do: It&#x27;s a heavy cream.  This is important for, if you&#x27;re in a rush, use something else.  It&#x27;s far more greasy than a lot of other products out there, and doesn&#x27;t spread well at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the consistency of the cream, it&#x27;s very difficult to get the right amount, for putting even just one finger into the cream can easily be too much for the hands.  This cream grabs hold and comes out in higher amounts than expected, (again, even using just one finger).  It&#x27;s very easy to over apply, and again, why it&#x27;s not best for people in a rush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream does not wash off as much as typical lotions, (which is a good thing, for it does mean less needs to be reapplied for dry hands like mine after hand washing), also, soap suds on skin are decreased due to the use of this product, which highlights the increased amount of oil contained in this cream versus other creams and lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another important thing this cream does not do is, after application, and after it has been worked in well, the hands do not feel quite as soft as they do from other Curél products like Ultra Healing, or Hand and Cuticle, or Itch Defense, or pretty much any other Curél product out there.  That said, where it is applied does feel in some ways, more protected from the elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the biggest knock against this product is how difficult it is to dose out the proper amount needed.  It&#x27;s much easier to use too much than just the right amount, and yet still very possible to use not enough and need to reapply as a result.  There are many other products from other brands and Curél that are much easier to balance (pump and no pump) the amount needed, and or redistribute what has been over applied.  When you get it right, it&#x27;s a great product, that with enough time worked into the schedule, it&#x27;s worth the price (anywhere but here unfortunately), but it&#x27;s not for the hurried, and much more for those who don&#x27;t mind labor of love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another way to put it, if you like copper cookware, and like caring for it, you won&#x27;t mind the work that goes into using this cream.  If you much prefer nonstick cookware, get something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone still has any questions for me, I&#x27;d be happy to go into even more detail regarding any responses on this cream.  Just let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stand corrected on price...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly, Amazon is not the most expensive out there.  For a laugh, type in Curél Intensive Healing into Google Shopping, and be amazed at the highest asking price for this product.  I still must strongly suggest that anything over $12.99 is probably more than anyone should pay for this exact cream.  It&#x27;s great, but not designer brand pricing great.</li>
            <li> Amazing hand cream, especially for those in the health care industry who wear gloves much of the time. My dermatologist recommended this exact Curel cream as the best product available for hands and cuticles!</li>
            <li> Excellent item and excellent service.</li>
            <li> Very thick!  However, if you are older (50ish) your skin will not absorb as much as younger skin so it does tend to stay on top of the skin...not their fault though.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic I would recommend it to all I know. However it is selling at Walgreens and Drugstore.com for $9.99.  Why does it cost so much here?</li>
            <li> I guess I should have included delivery instructions, because it was left on our side porch and froze. It re-blended pretty easily, though. It&#x27;s a great hand cream.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this and it does a good job on dry hands.  No list of ingredients was provided so I looked them up online and it contains PARABENS!  I am throwing it out.</li>
