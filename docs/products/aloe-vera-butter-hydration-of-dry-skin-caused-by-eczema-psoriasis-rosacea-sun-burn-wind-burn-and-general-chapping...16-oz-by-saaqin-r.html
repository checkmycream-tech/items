            <li>Aloe Vera Butter is a very excellent product to use, when making DIY bath &amp; body products.</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>I truly loved this aloe butter!  </li>
            <li>Hello,    I ordered before aloe vera butter and it was really great.</li>
            <li>It worked great but people like to know what is in a product before they put it in their bodies.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a month now with great results, and no respiratory response.</li>
            <li>Not too greasy, not too light, just perfect.</li>
            <li>like always good butter</li>
            <li>and I have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>I bought this, it&#x27;s good, and the large size of the enclosure, also smelled good, I bought two packs to my mother and her friend and is happy with this product</li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>I have always liked aloe vera, having grown up using it in South Florida.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the way it makes the skin feel</li>
            <li>So far, so good!  </li>
            <li>They are super emollient and benefit from the healthy properties found in aloe.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>It arrived fast and came in a nice air right screw top container.  </li>
            <li>The aloe butter arrived early, and is in a nice sized tub.  </li>
            <li>It really holds in moisture, is easy to put on-</li>
            <li>It blended really well with other butters and had a very light almost non existent smell.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well thus far.</li>
            <li>this item came on time, the aloe vera butter, is very soft and moisturizing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problems with my skin since early college.</li>
            <li>I bought some cocoa butter, and try that for a while, but for some reason in the winter developed a reaction to that.</li>
            <li>i like it so much but the packing want good and it melt, so i keep it in a cold place.</li>
            <li>at least is easy as coconut butter or cocoa butter-and has no discernible odor.</li>
            <li>So far, my only complaints are (1) storage instructions weren&#x27;t included and (2) I have no idea what is in this aloe butter.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it, especially if you have sensitivities to other moisturizers.</li>

            <li> Hello,    I ordered before aloe vera butter and it was really great. Not too greasy, not too light, just perfect. I could use it by itself or in combination with other butters. I placed another order for 2 aloe vera butter jars and in return I received 2 bottles of aloe vera oil. I tried to contact the company, but with no result, so now I have a product that I paid for and didn&#x27;t wanted.... Also inside the box there was no paper/invoice with the address of the company that shipped the product, so I could not return it.  In the past I ordered from HalaEveryDay with no problems, but this time and especially this order were horrible...</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  The aloe butter arrived early, and is in a nice sized tub.  So far, my only complaints are (1) storage instructions weren&#x27;t included and (2) I have no idea what is in this aloe butter.  Hopefully, it&#x27;s only made of aloe vera and coconut oil.</li>
            <li> i like it so much but the packing want good and it melt, so i keep it in a cold place.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth. It glides on my hair and skin. I love it. I will purchase it again</li>
            <li> Finally! Body butter that works FOR me, and not AGAINST me! I&#x27;ve had problems with my skin since early college. Finally! No medication anymore. I can rely on something all-natural.</li>
            <li> I bought this, it&#x27;s good, and the large size of the enclosure, also smelled good, I bought two packs to my mother and her friend and is happy with this product</li>
            <li> this item came on time, the aloe vera butter, is very soft and moisturizing, I add this to my skin and hair care products.</li>
            <li> It was as described.  Thank you.  I have already used the product.</li>
            <li> Not good ,,,not organic at all</li>
            <li> I truly loved this aloe butter!  It blended really well with other butters and had a very light almost non existent smell.  It arrived fast and came in a nice air right screw top container.  The only thing I did not like was there was no ingredients on the container at all just a label saying &amp;#34;aloe Vera butter.&amp;#34;  A label also would have been helpful in telling customers not only what&#x27;s in the product, but how to properly store the product.  It worked great but people like to know what is in a product before they put it in their bodies.</li>
            <li> Aloe Vera Butter is a very excellent product to use, when making DIY bath &amp; body products. I LOVE the way it makes the skin feel ❤❤❤</li>
            <li> Really softens my hair and but leaves a dull shine to it. I can see people mixing this with other hair butters.</li>
            <li> I like this aloe butter alot</li>
            <li> Very good product. I combined it with the cocoa, avocado and shea butter, cocoanut &amp; jojoba oil and an essential oil for a body butter for the winter. Works pretty well thus far.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. I purchased coconut butter, and tried that. I liked it but I started to have a small reaction to the odor over time, which was disappointing. I bought some cocoa butter, and try that for a while, but for some reason in the winter developed a reaction to that. It seemed that both irritated my nasal passages in the winter. It felt like I was having allergy symptoms. I have always liked aloe vera, having grown up using it in South Florida. I figured I would try this and I have been very pleased. It really holds in moisture, is easy to put on-at least is easy as coconut butter or cocoa butter-and has no discernible odor. I have been using it for a month now with great results, and no respiratory response. I never would have thought to buy aloe vera butter. I had never even heard of it. I would highly recommend it, especially if you have sensitivities to other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> like always good butter</li>
            <li> I use the aloe vera butter in making my lip balm and other body care products.  They are super emollient and benefit from the healthy properties found in aloe.</li>
