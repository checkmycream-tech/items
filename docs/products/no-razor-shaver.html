            <li>I hope I can use this product 20 more years.</li>
            <li>Outstanding razor for use with Magic Shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad someone stepped up to the plate to make a no razor shaver since magic shave stopped making this type.</li>
            <li>Glad this product is available and it works well.</li>
            <li>I am so glad these are available for sale.  </li>
            <li>These blades provide a clean smooth slave for Magic Shave users.</li>
            <li>The original source discontinued making it.</li>
            <li>Just like the original</li>
            <li>The Brittny professional is the same as Palmer&#x27;s with the same excellent results.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>So glad that this product came back on the market.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s really helpfull to me.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Good for what it is intended for but the blade edge could be less rough.</li>
            <li>Magic shave has a product that is way too small to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an exact copy of the Palmer&#x27;s blade that suddenly disappeared.  </li>
            <li>Hard find but will be a repeat customer for sure.</li>
            <li>Just what I expected, I hope they will be available in the future</li>

            <li> &amp;#34;I have been searching for a replacement no blade shaver every since Palmer&#x27;s discontinued manufacturing its no blade shaver. The Brittny professional is the same as Palmer&#x27;s with the same excellent results.&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> We&#x27;re back in business!  It&#x27;s an exact copy of the Palmer&#x27;s blade that suddenly disappeared.  Shaves just as easy and close; no sharp edges and a nice sharp PLASTIC blade.</li>
            <li> If this product is anything like its predecessor by Palmer, it is a great tool for use with a depiliatory. I have a Palmer&#x27;s No Blade Shaved that I&#x27;ve been using for the last 4 years, so afraid that it would get broken. I just ordered 3 of these just in case it too disappears.</li>
            <li> This is the only razor ever hit my face. I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t able to find in any local store.  Works really well.</li>
