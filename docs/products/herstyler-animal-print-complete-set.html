            <li>This is an amazing gift set ,it was totally worth buying !</li>
            <li>It  heats really fast and it does  the job good.</li>
            <li>they all heat up supper fast and work really good.</li>
            <li>and I was thrilled to find this set for such a good price.</li>
            <li>and she loves it and says it works just fine</li>

            <li>Its a cheap material.</li>
            <li>My wife love it  thanks.</li>
            <li>It quickly straightens your hair and it is made of ceramic all over and does no damage to your hair.</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s a heats up pretty quick</li>
            <li>It truly does wonders and if you can find a set for $50 I would recommend snatching it up right away.</li>
            <li>but the handle got incredibly hot</li>
            <li>In fairness, the product says the handle will get hot, but it shouldn&#x27;t since this is where you hold the unit.</li>
            <li>not just but also how it works.. it heats up pretty fast and it straightens my hair very fast too..</li>
            <li>All three work very well get hot</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyone who says they don&#x27;t work are lying or must have got a really defective batch.. in the first swipe your hair will get straight.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying it at the mall</li>
            <li>really works ,it leaves your hair looking shiny and smooth&lt;</li>
            <li>it so much easier in styling your hair without having to wait for ever just to straighten or curl your hair .Great</li>
            <li>and I have really curly hair</li>
            <li>Other than that is just an okay set.</li>
            <li>the straightener works like a dream and the curler is large and professional quality..</li>
            <li>Look up reviews on youtube if you’d like to see live</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the exact same thing</li>
            <li>My old one would make my hair smell burnt</li>
            <li>I have natural hair .</li>
            <li>but the wand will burn the sh*T out of you if your not careful!</li>

            <li> Curled well but the handle got incredibly hot--I believe it is unsafe for younger children/teenagers.  I chose to return the product.  In fairness, the product says the handle will get hot, but it shouldn&#x27;t since this is where you hold the unit.</li>
            <li> What a good deal!! ! ! Much cheaper than buying it at the mall and it&#x27;s the exact same thing</li>
            <li> Love the way it looks!!  And the awesome price for 3 great tools!! All in all I really love it!</li>
            <li> Got this for my sister for school in December2014 and she loves it and says it works just fine</li>
            <li> This product got the job done.....i would like a matching dryer........ when it be comes available..... thanks i guess lol,</li>
            <li> This is an amazing gift set ,it was totally worth buying ! I bought this because it comes with a flat iron ,curling iron and mini curling iron .It really works ,it leaves your hair looking shiny and smooth&lt;br /&gt;Makes it so much easier in styling your hair without having to wait for ever just to straighten or curl your hair .Great brand i reccomend it</li>
            <li> My old one would make my hair smell burnt and I have really curly hair and it works great .</li>
            <li> I like color and the design of he product... not just but also how it works.. it heats up pretty fast and it straightens my hair very fast too.. i really love this.</li>
            <li> My wife love it  thanks.</li>
            <li> Very nice, love it, thanks</li>
            <li> Its a cheap material. The curling iron has no clamp though. The flat iron has no temp setting, is just on and off. Other than that is just an okay set. I rather quality then quantity though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super happy that I purchased this set &amp; it&#x27;s a heats up pretty quick so no need to preheat  I had to buy another herstyler great products very cute &amp; stylish</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome. It quickly straightens your hair and it is made of ceramic all over and does no damage to your hair. No heat resistant liquid needed! It’s safe! It truly does wonders and if you can find a set for $50 I would recommend snatching it up right away. These things are much better than even chi’s, they are cuter, and can find them at a great deal so they&#x27;re inexpensive. Look up reviews on youtube if you’d like to see live demos!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who says they don&#x27;t work are lying or must have got a really defective batch.. in the first swipe your hair will get straight. I love this set!</li>
            <li> Love love love love love it</li>
            <li> I bought this set to straighten my hair I have natural hair . It  heats really fast and it does  the job good.</li>
            <li> I bought this iron for my daughter...I loved  the style but this is garbage...doesn&#x27;t work at all...don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> love this. all three items work awesome. but the wand will burn the sh*T out of you if your not careful! it clipped my arm with it when curling my hair and it burnt me so bad it literally melted my skin. i saw a drop of skin melt to my floor! so i suggest wearing a sweater and the glove when using the wand. but over all it works awesome! they all heat up supper fast and work really good.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it...</li>
            <li> Very useful!!! Saw several reviews on YouTube and it is very good product!!!</li>
            <li> These work fantastic! Quick heat up and work beautifully! Great quality for a great price! Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> All three work very well get hot</li>
            <li> So in love with this herstyler set! It was a gift to me off my wish list and I was thrilled to find this set for such a good price. (It is 500$ on the herstyler website)  the straightener works like a dream and the curler is large and professional quality.. Perfect gift set, especially for a girl with frizzy hair. :)</li>
