            <li>Love eminence products</li>
            <li>I love Eminence products.</li>
            <li>I love that it is organic.  </li>
            <li>I also love the dispenser - so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Really makes the eyes feel good.</li>

            <li>The push top is super easy and &amp;#34;un-messy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>bottle is fantastic.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a lot more natural than most others that work as well.</li>
            <li>Has entered my eyes many times and is absolutely harmless.</li>
            <li>I will keep buying dior makeup remover which is more gentle</li>
            <li>So gentle, refreshing, non oily finish.</li>

            <li>This product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do...</li>
            <li>finally oil free!</li>
            <li>To top it of the pump dispenser is totally sanitary, lets me control how much I want on my cotton ball, and helps me not dispense more than I need (makes it last longer).  </li>
            <li>The size is considerably large, does not smell anything.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this wipes of my eye makeup very well w/o any redness or irritation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>

            <li>Gentle.  </li>
            <li>No turning up side down ,just press on the top with the pad and</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like this particular product and wished I had returned it before I was stuck with it.</li>
            <li>I save the bottles and use them for dispensing other liquids like nail polish remover and light oils.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to The eye remover.</li>
            <li>None of us have particularly sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my eyes and doesn&#x27;t sting when I actually get some in my eye.  </li>
            <li>Also, my first bottle has just a tiny amount left and it is still dispensing, so</li>
            <li>I have extra sensitive skin</li>
            <li>No dry!</li>
            <li>Not too much , not too little.</li>

            <li> I took off one star because this isn&#x27;t as natural as their other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this wipes of my eye makeup very well w/o any redness or irritation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus it&#x27;s a lot more natural than most others that work as well.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well for removing mascara.  It is gentle on the eye.  Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted an eye makeup remover that would take off my makeup without a lot of scrubbing, but that was semi-natural so I&#x27;m not filling my eyes with crazy chemicals.  This remover totally fits the bill.  To top it of the pump dispenser is totally sanitary, lets me control how much I want on my cotton ball, and helps me not dispense more than I need (makes it last longer).  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> The best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used!!!</li>
            <li> The product is not greasy. Has entered my eyes many times and is absolutely harmless. The size is considerably large, does not smell anything. Stir well makeup. It does something frothy liquid to place it on the eyes but not aggressive. No dry!</li>
            <li> Best eye make-up remover...love that there are no chemicals in it and I can remove my organic make up very easily without any problems!</li>
            <li> For organic this stuff burns and reminds me of foam soap. I will keep buying dior makeup remover which is more gentle</li>
            <li> I have extra sensitive skin and this is one of the only make up removers that does not irritate my skin.  It removes all eye make up effectively.  It does burn my eyes a little when I get some into my eyes though.</li>
            <li> Wow, again another superb Eminence product. This is such a soothing and effective eye make up remover. Really makes the eyes feel good. Calming and cooling.  Also the bottle is amazing at dispensing onto a cotton ball or pad. No turning up side down ,just press on the top with the pad and the liquid comes out into the pad. Not too much , not too little. I save the bottles and use them for dispensing other liquids like nail polish remover and light oils. I love really good honest products and this is one. Another one from Eminence.</li>
            <li> Works very well to remove eye makeup.  Nice smelling and easy container to work with - I use a cotton ball and only have to use very little of the product.  This product will go a long way.</li>
            <li> This product is 100% organic and that is very important for when using something that can enter my eyes. Very effective and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do...remove eye make-up. It doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my eyes and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li> Removes any kind of eye makeup without any problem. Doesn&#x27;t itch, pleasant smell, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Did not remove eyemakeup as well as Nutrigenia did.</li>
            <li> It looks and seems like the product would if purchased at a spa. Price is much better as well. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Get it! came so fast. bottle is fantastic. finally oil free! i&#x27;ve searched forever. yay. mission accomplished. done looking. thx.</li>
            <li> I was so hopeful about this product since I like many Eminence products. The product removes makeup well. However, it is too soapy for me and suds up a bit. I do not like the smell, it reminds me of the white shoe polish I used on my moccasins back in &#x27;86. It also stings my eyes, I will not purchase again. For now I will remove my eye makeup with a product I love, Vichy Purete Thermale 3 in 1 Calming Cleansing Solution, then use the Eminence to remove the makeup on the rest of my face. I do like the dispenser.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye makeup remover ever.  The push top is super easy and &amp;#34;un-messy&amp;#34;.  Does not irritate my eyes and takes off waterproof mascara easily</li>
            <li> Love eminence products</li>
            <li> Eminence make such great, high quality organic, and sometimes even biodynamic products - and this make up remover is no exception! It cleans and tones beautifully, and the dispenser is super convenient and efficient to use.  It has a very pleasant, mild scent. I have sensitive eyes, and it stings a little when removing eye make up.</li>
            <li> Absolutely excellent. So gentle, refreshing, non oily finish. It works quickly and I LOVE the dispenser top. Will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this again.  it&#x27;s gentle and it works.</li>
            <li> I love Eminence products. I am sensitive to The eye remover. It stings my eyes.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this eye makeup remover stung my eyes as if I were putting bath soap in them! It had the same effect on my two daughters&#x27; eyes. None of us have particularly sensitive eyes. The only good thing I can say is that I like the bottle design, but what good is that if you can&#x27;t use the product! 😣</li>
            <li> Very effective for removing mascara.  Gentle.  Does,notmrequire a lot. Very good will purchase again.  One two three four five&lt;br /&gt;X</li>
            <li> Stings my eyes no matter how careful I am in using it. Immediately after I have to flush my eyes with cold water. As an eye makeup remover its so-so. Eminence is a great brand but I don&#x27;t like this particular product and wished I had returned it before I was stuck with it.</li>
            <li> Great product especially for sensitive eyes!</li>
            <li> Good product. Be careful not to Get into your eye as it stings a little</li>
            <li> did not remove my eyemake up at all (and all i use is an all organic gel liner). waste of my money.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this eye makeup remover.  It is gentle on my eyes and doesn&#x27;t sting when I actually get some in my eye.  I love that it is organic.  I also love the dispenser - so easy to use.  You just open the lid and then push down on it with your cotton pad, cotton ball, or q-tip and it comes right out.  I&#x27;ve also used it to remove lipstick and it works great for that, too.  Also, my first bottle has just a tiny amount left and it is still dispensing, so I don&#x27;t think there will be any waste by the time I finally throw it away.</li>
