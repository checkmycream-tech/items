            <li> in the toilet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to purchase it for so long!</li>
            <li> A little more expensive here on Amazon, if you have a TJMaxx around you, I would recommend buying it there.</li>
            <li> The girl who received it said it smelled the same as Bieber&#x27;s previous perfume &amp; I agree.  </li>
            <li> Also the scent lasts almost all day for me, I&#x27;m not much of a perspiratory</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a Bieber fan</li>
            <li> Even though I hate Justin Bieber and hate the bottle, this smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> I know my daughter will be wearing this everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for the past few years</li>
            <li> but she has asked for it in the past....</li>
            <li> and I was a little skeptical about buying it before checking it out in the store.  </li>
            <li> How can you go wrong with anything with the Justin Bieber name.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because I do not think any product that is directed toward teenagers should be this expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive though.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive for what it is.  </li>
            <li> and I was afraid that it would smell too &amp;</li>
            <li> The perfume smells like a garbage dump and it is awful.</li>
    </ol>

Plus the bottle is very pretty, looks so nice on display! Also the scent lasts almost all day for me, I&#x27;m not much of a perspiratory so I don&#x27;t need to reapply at all, it lasts until I shower later that night of use!</li>

            <li> Purchased this product as a christmas gift for my little sister, ugh justin bieber, but she loved it. I reccomend it, good deal.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my granddaughter.  She loved it.</li>
            <li> Smells nice. I know my daughter will be wearing this everyday. I hope it lasts so I won&#x27;t have to get another one too soon</li>
            <li> This scent is nice but unfortunately doesn&#x27;t stay for long...if applied in the morning...its gone by lunchtime.  Wish the scent would linger longer.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it!</li>
            <li> My girl likes it but I don&#x27;t. I told her Justin Bieber Smells like alcohol so I might as well buy her a bottle of Jack Daniels if she want to smell like Bieber!</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume as a Christmas gift for my 12 year old daughter, who&#x27;s a HUGE Justin Bieber fan.  She&#x27;s been talking about this perfume for a while now, so I thought it&#x27;d be a GREAT holiday gift.  The price through Amazon.com was the cheapest I&#x27;ve been able to find, &amp; they shipped it out VERY QUICKLY!  My daughter was SO EXCITED when she opened this on Christmas day, as she didn&#x27;t expect to get it!  We had priced it at some local retailers recently, &amp; the price was at least $20 more than what I got it for on Amazon.com. The spray bottle itself is quite ornate, &amp; I&#x27;m sure adds quite a bit to the cost of the perfume.  That being said, it still looks REALLY COOL!  Surprisingly, it actually smells pretty good too.  My daughter&#x27;s happy, so I&#x27;m happy!  A GREAT purchase!  Thanks again Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas, and I must say, it&#x27;s awesome! The packaging is really unique, and the smell is great. It&#x27;s a light scent so you can wear it every day, but it smells nice all day long.</li>
            <li> I was actually plesantly surprised by this scent.  This was the first time my niece (16 y/o) asked for a perfume and I was a little skeptical about buying it before checking it out in the store.  It&#x27;s not overpowering.  Very appropriate for a young lady and the bottle is adorable.  She was very happy to get this for Christmas and I was happy that Amazon had it for a great price!</li>
            <li> I got this Perfume for my daughter on her birthday and she loves it. She is only 11 and I was afraid that it would smell too &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34; but it doesn’t its perfect for preteens.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect gift for a teen girl. (A friend of my daughter&#x27;s.)  She LOVES it!  It&#x27;s expensive though.</li>
            <li> The girl who received it said it smelled the same as Bieber&#x27;s previous perfume &amp; I agree.  A bit expensive for what it is.  The packaging gets an A+,  I give it 3 stars because it seems they only repackaged the product.  Everything arrived on time.</li>
            <li> LLLL OOOO VVVVVVV EEEEE  IIII TTTTTTT...again all may.daughtters friends loved the smell  tooooooo....she really like the bottle for her JB perfume</li>
            <li> My niece was thrilled with the perfume!!</li>
            <li> I teased my 13 year old for wanting this perfume, but I was suprised when she got it....it smells fantastic!  It is a sweet smell, but not too sweet.</li>
