            <li>This one is perfect!</li>
            <li>I have found the perfect product..</li>
            <li>It does a great job curling my lashes.</li>
            <li>This thing works GREAT.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with this product!</li>
            <li>Good product, but Ball Beauty Supplies will rip you off on shipping.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>good price&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, and curls perfectly (lasts till you wash your face).</li>
            <li>I LOVE this heated curler!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Product came exactly as described and works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>I love this heated eyelash curler!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>amazing</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways - if you want a very good eyelash curler don&#x27;t waste your time looking elsewhere, the Trim is wonderful!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, doesn&#x27;t burn the skin around my eyes or pull out my lashes.</li>
            <li>As far as creating the desired result of curled eyelashes with staying power I was completely impressed.  </li>
            <li>Always love the fair prices and free shipping at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I like this one better than any</li>
            <li>I do this several times per lash to get it to curl perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I can say that I am happily satisfied.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, it&#x27;s easy on my lashes (no pulling or pinching), and the curl lasts all day.</li>
            <li>: Heats lashes which makes them curl faster, easy to grip, will need to just crimp squeeze once or twice and done,</li>
            <li>This product allows me to create a perfect curl at my lash line and with the help of a little mascara it stays that way all day.  </li>
            <li>I wish this one had Prime shipping, I just don&#x27;t like to buy anything that doesn&#x27;t have free shipping after I paid for that upgrade to my account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Warms and cools quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>It heats up real fast!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I looked on Amazon and found them again.</li>
            <li>After I curl them I let them cool and put on mascara.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s looking for super curled eyelashes.</li>
            <li>worth every penny, I will never use another eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>One side tends to crimp part of my lashes when I do my right eye.  </li>
            <li>So I looked on Amazon and found it right away.  </li>
            <li>(that is when it is warm and ready), if you crimp too much your lashes will crimp straight up instead of a curl,the batteries need to be changed fast if you use it alot.</li>
            <li>I am almost 65 with very straight eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I had a heated eyelash curler similar to this one, but after many years of use, I wore it out.  </li>
            <li>A regular eye lash curler works better than this.  </li>
            <li>I had this eyelash curler for many years until the piece holding the battery in finally broke</li>
            <li>This is my first heated eyelash curler, and after a week of use</li>
            <li>I bought one in stores many years ago, and it finally broke, so I ordered this one.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried the product it curl them but for just 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>I put on mascara first the curl my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and its better than my old one bc of the purple strip that turns white when its heated up!!</li>
            <li>I have pretty long/thick eyelashes though (used to use a hairdryer to heat up the classic curler), but I feel this product may do alright for those who have more delicate eyelashes, mine just need more heat and curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have large eyes</li>
            <li>This particular one isn&#x27;t lined up exactly even, though.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and to the right temperature, and doesn&#x27;t snag my eyelashes out like my last heated curler did.  </li>
            <li>It is really cumbersome.  </li>
            <li>since I know this one works really well.      </li>
            <li>It takes about 1x2 times to get used to it and to really know how to use it to get the results you want.      </li>
            <li>It is inexpenxive and very reliable.</li>
            <li>After a few tries I realized the heated part does not get more than warm</li>
            <li>The first was a gift, but my 19 year old daughter kept taking mine</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s not very wide, and it&#x27;s pretty straight across).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still experimenting with the amount of time and method, but this is working very well so far.</li>
            <li>no tiene ninguna ventaja sobre los otros, es mas diria que funciona peor que uno normal.</li>
            <li>I just use the normal metal curler now.</li>
            <li>I decided to try out something new and tried this product.</li>
            <li>I bought the first one several years ago.</li>
            <li>: You have to hold the push button up for a while until the strip turns clear</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that it takes 2 AAA batteries, these lasted for about 8-12 months for me, and I use it every day at least once, when touching up my eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li>and so far it has not caused any noticable damage to my lashes.</li>
            <li>I have used it for about 5 years now and my old one (same brand and same exact curler) just died on me.  </li>
            <li>This thing was bizarre, not really sure what I was thinking with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>It finally kicked the bucket, so I had to get a new one.  </li>
            <li>I have had this crueler for about a month now and my main complaints are that the batteries died pretty fast (replaced them today), the curler itself is shaped at a softer angle so it is harder to get the dramatic curl with it, and for my lashes the curler does not get hot enough so the curl falls out after an hour or so.</li>
            <li>I have STICK straight eyelashes and my previous heated eyelash curler gave out on me</li>
            <li>I had one of these exact same curlers for a few years.</li>

            <li> I have STICK straight eyelashes and my previous heated eyelash curler gave out on me</li>
            <li> I had one of these exact same curlers for a few years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never replaced it because it was broken or stopped heating up, only because I&#x27;ve lost it when traveling or when my Daughters \\&quot;borrow\\&quot; it for a special night out and forgot to bring it back.</li>
            <li> I apply mascara and let it dry for several minutes.</li>
            <li> This was the third Trim eyelash curler I have bought because I wore the other two out.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong! :)</li>
            <li> Instead of holding it in one place I drag it down the lash similar to how I use a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have paid a lot more for similar products and have always been disappointed.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the batteries do not last very long</li>
            <li> I use it for about 20 sec on each eye after it is warmed up.  </li>
            <li> The only con - if you use this curler everyday you will need to replace the batteries about every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> At first glance I thought this item was expensive for an eye lash curler, however, based on the other reviews I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Such product usually ships for less than 3.00$ thus, the pricing of the product is misleading.</li>
            <li> the only bad thing about it is the lashes are hard not soft as they grow longer and this Curler works very well to curl them where the regular curler doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The curl lasts longer than the conventional type of curler.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary - does an average job for longer/thicker eyelashes.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;to hold the lever down for 20 seconds for it to heat up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little awkward but worth it.</li>
            <li> Instead, I have to curl half the lashes on each lid at a time.</li>
            <li> sometimes Albertson&#x27;s and Sally&#x27;s Beauty, I have always paid about half what is being charged for this one.  </li>
            <li> It would take me forever to curl my eyelashes with a normal eyelash curler because my eyelashes are small and thin.</li>
            <li> Once I received the item I was afraid to use it at first because I did not want to burn my eye lid.  </li>
            <li> No more accidental pinches or weird crimps, and the curl really lasts.  </li>
            <li> I even use it on the weekends sometimes when I want a little pick-me-up to my look but do not feel like wearing make-up.</li>
            <li> I kept trying it everyday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous other products claiming to work and are expensive and none have met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I threw this one away and bought one in a different style - the wand-type ones, and I am totally addicted now!  </li>
            <li> Maybe if you have small eyes the Trim Heated Eyelash Curler might work for you.  </li>
            <li> It is really hard to use without burning your face.  </li>
            <li> I found it incredibly hard to get my lashes into the curling mechanism.  </li>
            <li> I have tired everything even buying expensive maacara.</li>
            <li> And with the heat, if you crimp in the wrong place, then your lashes look really weird.  </li>
            <li> Its design makes it impossible to insert lashes into the mechanism, thus no curl,</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer said, it&#x27;s impossible to get all your lashes at once</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it is worthless!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had one of these exact same curlers for a few years. It finally kicked the bucket, so I had to get a new one.  Couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the stores.  It heats up real fast! This particular one isn&#x27;t lined up exactly even, though.  One side tends to crimp part of my lashes when I do my right eye.  Other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have Glucoma and the medicine I use in my eyedrops had the medicine that makes your lashed grow and the only bad thing about it is the lashes are hard not soft as they grow longer and this Curler works very well to curl them where the regular curler doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I had a heated eyelash curler similar to this one, but after many years of use, I wore it out.  This one is like the last, with an improvement:  the rubbery material changes color to let you know when it is heated.  It does a great job curling my lashes.</li>
            <li> A regular eye lash curler works better than this.  It is really hard to use without burning your face.  You have&lt;br /&gt;to hold the lever down for 20 seconds for it to heat up.  As soon as you release the lever the machine cools down.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, I couldn&#x27;t get it on my lashes before it cooled.  It is really cumbersome.  I buy a lot of merchandise&lt;br /&gt;from Amazon and never returned anything, except this eye lash curler.  In my opinion it is worthless!</li>
            <li> This was the third Trim eyelash curler I have bought because I wore the other two out.  I have paid a lot more for similar products and have always been disappointed. The only reason I tried others was I could not find a heated eyelash curler anywhere anymore. I bought the first one several years ago. I was so excited when I looked on Amazon and found them again.</li>
            <li> I had this eyelash curler for many years until the piece holding the battery in finally broke so I went to several stores looking for another one because I like the heating feature and couldn&#x27;t find it.  So I looked on Amazon and found it right away.  I like this one better than any I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders!  I have used it for about 5 years now and my old one (same brand and same exact curler) just died on me.  I didn&#x27;t risk going for a cheaper one since I know this one works really well.      It takes about 1x2 times to get used to it and to really know how to use it to get the results you want.      I use it for about 20 sec on each eye after it is warmed up.  Instead of holding it in one place I drag it down the lash similar to how I use a flat iron.  I do this several times per lash to get it to curl perfectly.  After I curl them I let them cool and put on mascara.  My lashes stay curled until I wash them.</li>
            <li> This curler simply doesn&#x27;t work.  Its design makes it impossible to insert lashes into the mechanism, thus no curl, no nothing.  Perhaps if you have no cheeks you could get lashes inside to curl.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Good product, but Ball Beauty Supplies will rip you off on shipping. Such product usually ships for less than 3.00$ thus, the pricing of the product is misleading. Make a point by not purchasing from vendors with substandard business practices.</li>
            <li> I have STICK straight eyelashes and my previous heated eyelash curler gave out on me so I took a chance with this one.  This one is perfect! Heats up quickly and to the right temperature, and doesn&#x27;t snag my eyelashes out like my last heated curler did.  I recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s looking for super curled eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Lo compre hace algunos meses y simplemente no se calienta, no se si solamente el mio esta fallado pero no pasa de estar levemente tibio.&lt;br /&gt;Este arqueador de pesta&amp;ntilde;as funciona igual que uno que no se calienta no tiene ninguna ventaja sobre los otros, es mas diria que funciona peor que uno normal.</li>
            <li> This is my first heated eyelash curler, and after a week of use I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to a non-heated curler. There&#x27;s definitely a learning curve for this thing. Like another reviewer said, it&#x27;s impossible to get all your lashes at once (it&#x27;s not very wide, and it&#x27;s pretty straight across). Instead, I have to curl half the lashes on each lid at a time. It&#x27;s a little awkward but worth it. This thing works GREAT. It heats up quickly, it&#x27;s easy on my lashes (no pulling or pinching), and the curl lasts all day. I&#x27;m thrilled with this product!</li>
            <li> I found it incredibly hard to get my lashes into the curling mechanism.  And with the heat, if you crimp in the wrong place, then your lashes look really weird.  I threw this one away and bought one in a different style - the wand-type ones, and I am totally addicted now!  No more accidental pinches or weird crimps, and the curl really lasts.  Skip this one and get a wand-style curler.</li>
            <li> At first glance I thought this item was expensive for an eye lash curler, however, based on the other reviews I decided to give it a try.  Once I received the item I was afraid to use it at first because I did not want to burn my eye lid.  After a few tries I realized the heated part does not get more than warm so getting burnt is not an issue.    As far as creating the desired result of curled eyelashes with staying power I was completely impressed.  This product allows me to create a perfect curl at my lash line and with the help of a little mascara it stays that way all day.  I even use it on the weekends sometimes when I want a little pick-me-up to my look but do not feel like wearing make-up.</li>
            <li> worth every penny, I will never use another eyelash curler. I have found the perfect product.. It NEVER rips out lashes. It heats up quickly, and curls perfectly (lasts till you wash your face). I bought one in stores many years ago, and it finally broke, so I ordered this one. It came quickly and its better than my old one bc of the purple strip that turns white when its heated up!! amazing</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have small eyes the Trim Heated Eyelash Curler might work for you.  I have large eyes and I can&#x27;t get all my eyelashes into the curler at the same time.  Not only that, but even the lashes that get into the curler don&#x27;t curl with this piece of garbage.    Save your money and buy something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this eyelash curler for about 7 years now. I&#x27;ve tried others and they just don&#x27;t work the same, although that is probably because I have grown so accustomed to the Trim.  I&#x27;ve always bought it at the drug store, sometimes Albertson&#x27;s and Sally&#x27;s Beauty, I have always paid about half what is being charged for this one.  I&#x27;ve never replaced it because it was broken or stopped heating up, only because I&#x27;ve lost it when traveling or when my Daughters \\&quot;borrow\\&quot; it for a special night out and forgot to bring it back. I had thought I would try a different one since I am purchasing a heated curler from Amazon with my Prime shipping, but the only one that seems to be comparable is the Panasonic.  I wish this one had Prime shipping, I just don&#x27;t like to buy anything that doesn&#x27;t have free shipping after I paid for that upgrade to my account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways - if you want a very good eyelash curler don&#x27;t waste your time looking elsewhere, the Trim is wonderful! Keep in mind that it takes 2 AAA batteries, these lasted for about 8-12 months for me, and I use it every day at least once, when touching up my eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> I have had this crueler for about a month now and my main complaints are that the batteries died pretty fast (replaced them today), the curler itself is shaped at a softer angle so it is harder to get the dramatic curl with it, and for my lashes the curler does not get hot enough so the curl falls out after an hour or so. I have pretty long/thick eyelashes though (used to use a hairdryer to heat up the classic curler), but I feel this product may do alright for those who have more delicate eyelashes, mine just need more heat and curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary - does an average job for longer/thicker eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I have tired everything even buying expensive maacara. I even tried a blow dryer over and it did not work just heated my face. The first time I tried the product it curl them but for just 15 minutes. I kept trying it everyday and now they last all day. I never have tried a heated eyelash as was scared it will burn them off. I put on mascara first the curl my eyelashes. Good luck.</li>
            <li> I am almost 65 with very straight eyelashes.  I LOVE this heated curler!  The curl lasts longer than the conventional type of curler.  My only complaint is that the batteries do not last very long but this is b/c it takes a lot of \\&quot;juice\\&quot; to heat anything. I curl my lashes for about about 10 seconds ... no problems.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY curler I&#x27;ve ever used that gives a lasting curl! I apply mascara and let it dry for several minutes. Then, I use the curler for about 15 seconds per eye. I&#x27;m still experimenting with the amount of time and method, but this is working very well so far.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is inexpenxive and very reliable. I&#x27;ve tried numerous other products claiming to work and are expensive and none have met my expectations. The only con - if you use this curler everyday you will need to replace the batteries about every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Product came exactly as described and works wonderfully! Very easy to use, doesn&#x27;t burn the skin around my eyes or pull out my lashes. Warms and cools quickly and easily. Curl has lasted all day through sweat and humidity, but does wash out (just as heat-curled hair does). I have been using it daily and so far it has not caused any noticable damage to my lashes. I intend to continue daily use and would buy this again, and recommend it to friends!</li>
            <li> I love this heated eyelash curler!</li>
            <li> It would take me forever to curl my eyelashes with a normal eyelash curler because my eyelashes are small and thin. I decided to try out something new and tried this product. I can say that I am happily satisfied. It takes me lesser than three minutes to crimp both eyes and put on mascara with this curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Heats lashes which makes them curl faster, easy to grip, will need to just crimp squeeze once or twice and done, good price&lt;br /&gt;Cons: You have to hold the push button up for a while until the strip turns clear (that is when it is warm and ready), if you crimp too much your lashes will crimp straight up instead of a curl,the batteries need to be changed fast if you use it alot.</li>
            <li> This thing was bizarre, not really sure what I was thinking with this purchase.  I just use the normal metal curler now.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyelash curler that works (curls lashes) for me anyway. It must be the heat that helps curl the lashes. This is the second one I&#x27;ve gotten. The first was a gift, but my 19 year old daughter kept taking mine so I bought her one. Love it! Always love the fair prices and free shipping at Amazon. Can&#x27;t go wrong! :)</li>
