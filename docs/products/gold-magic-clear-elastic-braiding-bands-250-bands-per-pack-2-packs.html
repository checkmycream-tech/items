            <li>cheaper but more durable than the ones sold in cvs.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite elastics to use on my hair.</li>
            <li>These are flexible, easy to manage and don&#x27;t pull or break her hair.  </li>
            <li>Break easily,  returned item.</li>
            <li>Works just fine for braids in hair.</li>
            <li>They slide out very easily and last more than one use.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re better than some other brands, but still break petty easily.</li>
            <li>work well, pretty sturdy&lt;br /&gt;worth</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great, I lost them after i got about half way through my second pack, but now i find them everywhere and can count on finding one or two here and there.</li>
            <li>Very stretchy but dissolve with any oil products on the hair.  </li>
            <li>My granddaughter has very fine thin hair that doesn&#x27;t seem to securely keep her ponytails in place.  </li>

            <li>pretty much single use as they warp or tear when removing</li>
            <li>These work really well, much better than other elastics I have purchased in the past.  </li>

            <li> They&#x27;re better than some other brands, but still break petty easily.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great, I lost them after i got about half way through my second pack, but now i find them everywhere and can count on finding one or two here and there. They work and are not too noticeable. Of course they break sometimes, when trying to put them in or take them out. But i have not had any issue with them breaking while sitting in my hair.</li>
            <li> great price and work well.</li>
            <li> Very delicate, but there are a lot so when one breaks it&#x27;s not a huge deal</li>
            <li> work well, pretty sturdy&lt;br /&gt;worth the money</li>

            <li> These work really well, much better than other elastics I have purchased in the past.  The only down side is that I have dark hair, so you can see them when I use them.  But my daughter is a red head and you can hardly see them on her hair. They hold well and are stretchy but sturdy.  I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite elastics to use on my hair. They work for braids, they work for little girls hair, just about anything. At such a great price, I think they are really great quality. I&#x27;ve never had one break while using it. Definitely a hair product staple.</li>
            <li> Very stretchy but dissolve with any oil products on the hair.  Not recommended for wet or oiled hair.</li>
