            <li>The nail polish stand doesn&#x27;t stand upright on its own since the top part was only sent.</li>
            <li>Because it is clear, you can focus on the nice colors she owns.  </li>

            <li>Looks very pretty on her dresser.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to put together - large - sturdy  </li>
            <li>probably because it is in a large basket filled will bottles of polish.</li>
            <li>she completely filled it up and has commented how much she like it(she will probably need</li>
            <li>love the quality of the clear acrylic stand.  </li>
            <li>Might be nice to make one with an internal shelf</li>
            <li>I personally love the clear plastic as my young daughter was able to &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; on it and truly make it her own.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t that many things in the world that make you step back and just say, &#x27;Wow!&#x27;, and you sure wouldn&#x27;t expect you could feel that way about a nail polish rack - but this acrylic nail polish holder will do that to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>This is exactly what iwanted.</li>
            <li>Was able to store all of my bottles of nail polish, and all of my daily regimen of cosmetics and creams.</li>
            <li>If you have a large nail polish collection, this is exactly the thing you need to show it off.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy other items from this seller because their items are great quality and they do exactly what you expect it to do.</li>
            <li>This is a BIG organizer (easy to assemble), but then, that&#x27;s part of why the quality is so evident.</li>
            <li>It is much larger than I expected but very sturdy and attractive looking.  </li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and the quality is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>She sometimes cannot find the color nail polish she wants...</li>
            <li>Thanks Keeble Outlets for offering this product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much room to begin with there, so it has fulfilled its purpose</li>
            <li>This is a great rack that puts your nail polish on display, I was tired of keeping my nail products in a basket.</li>
            <li>Even if you can&#x27;t fit all your polish on one rack, buying a second one and lining them up side by side is a snap!</li>
            <li>I found that my Acquarella Water-Based Nail Polish fit with plenty of extra room, and with a little creativity, I was even able to make my Lauren Brooke Creme Foundation (on its side) rest on the rack.</li>
            <li>intended for this use, but might good to know, it does not fit spice jars, but does fit food coloring bottles and the little tubs of color for decorating cakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Even the space underneath the rack is great for storing larger bottles and tubes that will not fit on each individual shelf.    </li>
            <li>Just wish could hold a few more polishes.</li>
            <li>but it was not hard at all to figure out.</li>
            <li>(My only proviso would be to MEASURE first where you want to put this before you order it.</li>
            <li>The rack was seemingly large enough to accommodate my wife&#x27;s nail polish etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Larger than I expected (which is a plus!) and easy to assemble.</li>
            <li>The polishes are clearly displayed and neatly lined up.</li>
            <li>simple and straight to the point is what you are looking for</li>
            <li>No instructions were included, but might be useful in the future, especially the wrench</li>
            <li>dimensions are: 16.5&amp;#34; Length, 7 9/16&amp;#34; High, 7 15/16&#x27; Deep.&lt;br /&gt;Internal dimensions are: 1 3/8&amp;#34; deep per shelf x 16&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Quality racks, a little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>Would work in a kitchen cabinet to old your spices, or perhaps in the bathroom to hold smaller bottle of lotions etc.</li>
            <li>First of all it was broken in two areas right out of the box.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is plenty of room to store other makeup items on this rack if you don&#x27;t have that much nail polish, but the truth is, this was MADE for the nail polish devotee.</li>
            <li>However the shelves are large enough to hold other makeup bottles and cosmetic items which is convenient.</li>
            <li>Acrylic not as sturdy as I expected, One of the nuts has no threads, so I will have to get new screws and nuts to put it together.</li>
            <li>the nail polish fan, it doesn&#x27;t take much time to collect a few dozen bottles; half the time, it&#x27;s hard to know even what you have before you go off buying more.</li>

            <li> but it was not hard at all to figure out.</li>
            <li> (My only proviso would be to MEASURE first where you want to put this before you order it.</li>
            <li> The rack was seemingly large enough to accommodate my wife&#x27;s nail polish etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Larger than I expected (which is a plus!) and easy to assemble.</li>
            <li> The polishes are clearly displayed and neatly lined up.</li>
            <li> simple and straight to the point is what you are looking for</li>
            <li> No instructions were included, but might be useful in the future, especially the wrench</li>
            <li> dimensions are: 16.5&amp;#34; Length, 7 9/16&amp;#34; High, 7 15/16&#x27; Deep.&lt;br /&gt;Internal dimensions are: 1 3/8&amp;#34; deep per shelf x 16&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Quality racks, a little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> Would work in a kitchen cabinet to old your spices, or perhaps in the bathroom to hold smaller bottle of lotions etc.</li>
            <li> First of all it was broken in two areas right out of the box.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is plenty of room to store other makeup items on this rack if you don&#x27;t have that much nail polish, but the truth is, this was MADE for the nail polish devotee.</li>
            <li> However the shelves are large enough to hold other makeup bottles and cosmetic items which is convenient.</li>
            <li> Acrylic not as sturdy as I expected, One of the nuts has no threads, so I will have to get new screws and nuts to put it together.</li>
            <li> the nail polish fan, it doesn&#x27;t take much time to collect a few dozen bottles; half the time, it&#x27;s hard to know even what you have before you go off buying more.</li>
            <li> Some assembly is required and it took me a few minutes to figure out how the side panels are correctly attached to the main unit.</li>
            <li> I actually think you could think outside the box and use this for other things other than nail polish.</li>
            <li> Item arrived just as I expected.</li>
            <li> price was cheaper compared to some other beauty stores too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy and holds all of my polish, even some of the odd shaped bottles.  </li>
            <li> so I have added other manicure items (and a few small bottles of other beauty items) to the rack</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little wobbly though.</li>
            <li> It came missing a screw.</li>
            <li> just a few screws.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone looking to organize small containers of - whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really confused and wonder if this has happened to other people.</li>
            <li> In fact you might need a small wrench to hold the nut and a screw driver to screw it in, but if you do it too hard, you might crack the acrylic.  </li>
            <li> It did have a small piece broken off on one side</li>
            <li> When I received it, part was broken off and it didn&#x27;t come with the sides and screws</li>
            <li> It came broken was not Happy.</li>
            <li> And also it was put together very poorly</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Item arrived just as I expected. Nice quality and customer service. Would do business with them again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> My daughter is a budding nail tech, she has more colors than many nail salons!  Now that we&#x27;ve seen the product we will probably order another one!</li>
            <li> It came missing a screw. The plastic seems sturdy enough but not even.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product to make all polishes visible. I did not like my existing storage. So glad I found this product. #2excited</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t that many things in the world that make you step back and just say, &#x27;Wow!&#x27;, and you sure wouldn&#x27;t expect you could feel that way about a nail polish rack - but this acrylic nail polish holder will do that to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the nail polish fan, it doesn&#x27;t take much time to collect a few dozen bottles; half the time, it&#x27;s hard to know even what you have before you go off buying more. This nail polish organizer will totally solve THAT problem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make no mistake. This is a BIG organizer (easy to assemble), but then, that&#x27;s part of why the quality is so evident. If you have a large nail polish collection, this is exactly the thing you need to show it off. The tiered, raised display makes it easy to pick and choose, even among dozens of bottles. Imagine organizing your polishes by color, shade and hue - this would be a bit of boudoir art on your dressing table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is plenty of room to store other makeup items on this rack if you don&#x27;t have that much nail polish, but the truth is, this was MADE for the nail polish devotee. It&#x27;s the perfect finishing touch to showing off and organizing a nail polish collection. In terms of quality, looks and practicality, I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough! (My only proviso would be to MEASURE first where you want to put this before you order it. It IS bigger than you think it is.)</li>
            <li> As a member of a Keeble Outlets consumer test program, I have received this product at a significant discount. My comments are my own and are not influenced by Keeble Outlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail polish rack was simple to put together. No instructions were included, but a picture might have been helpful. The display rack looked like it had a couple cracks, but they might just be deep scratches. It is very sturdy and the quality is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work in a nail salon and this is perfect to hold our collection of nail polishes.  We considered using it to display business cards, but we didn&#x27;t have the space in the reception area to set the rack. So we&#x27;re using it as intended and already have the rack full!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and is very helpful in organizing holding and displaying nail polish.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Just wish could hold a few more polishes.</li>
            <li> This is a great nail polish rack that I can put nail polish and other items for my nails on.  It is much larger than I expected but very sturdy and attractive looking.  I will definitely buy other items from this seller because their items are great quality and they do exactly what you expect it to do.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what iwanted. Love it</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish rack! It holds so many polishes for such a great price! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I didn&#x27;t come with any instructions on how to assemble it.</li>
            <li> Larger than I expected (which is a plus!) and easy to assemble. I actually think you could think outside the box and use this for other things other than nail polish.

            <li> My wife enjoys doing her nails while watching TV at nite. She sometimes cannot find the color nail polish she wants...probably because it is in a large basket filled will bottles of polish. So...I got this product for her. We are both very happy with this solution. The display is much larger than it appears on Amazon and now the basket is gone!  The polishes are clearly displayed and neatly lined up. Some assembly is required and it took me a few minutes to figure out how the side panels are correctly attached to the main unit. (Instructions were not included.) But overall this was a great purchase. Thanks Keeble Outlets for offering this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a tester display for my aromatherapy products &amp; it&#x27;s worked out beautifully! Great quality &amp; design!</li>
            <li> Acrylic not as sturdy as I expected, One of the nuts has no threads, so I will have to get new screws and nuts to put it together.</li>
            <li> Very easy to assemble...just a few screws. Organized my polish collection perfectly! ! Now I can see all of my colors!</li>
            <li> Arrived with a chip out of it but didn&#x27;t affect the overall rack once put together.  I did not return and am happy that all my nail polish bottles fit with no problem.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic way to store my nail polish! Quality racks, a little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> First of all it was broken in two areas right out of the box. Required taping with packing tape to repair. Assembly besides the repair was very simple. No tools required. It takes up quite a bit of space. However the shelves are large enough to hold other makeup bottles and cosmetic items which is convenient. Great for someone who was super into nail art and had a lot of counter or cupboard space.</li>
            <li> I really love this.  Perfect for storing nail polish and lip sticks.  Uncluttered daughters dresser quickly !!</li>
            <li> Awesome quailty and price!</li>
            <li> When I received it, part was broken off and it didn&#x27;t come with the sides and screws so it&#x27;s not useable.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, all of my nail polishes fit perfectly. It was able to fit 68 polishes in addition to 5 skinny bottles. There were no directions for assembly but it was not hard at all to figure out.</li>
            <li> As a member of a consumer test program, I have received this product at a significant discount. My comments are my own and are not being influenced.    I love things that are multi-purpose. What made me want to test this nail-polish rack was the hope it could be used for more. It definitely can! Even the space underneath the rack is great for storing larger bottles and tubes that will not fit on each individual shelf.    I found that my Acquarella Water-Based Nail Polish fit with plenty of extra room, and with a little creativity, I was even able to make my Lauren Brooke Creme Foundation (on its side) rest on the rack. There was a plethora of spots for eye shadow/liquid liner, cotton rounds, and so much more. Best of all, one of the nicest features of this rack is that the shelves are perfectly sized for my essential oils collection. So now I not only have room for personal toiletries and makeup, I also have room for essential oils - even in 1 oz. bottles.    The organizer fits very nicely in the bathroom and has cleared up a lot of counter space for me. I didn&#x27;t have much room to begin with there, so it has fulfilled its purpose and then some. It looks very nice - not to mention how much easier it makes regular picking up and cleaning the counter. Bottom, unbiased line: if you like multi-purpose items and are creative with how you fit things together, this is a great rack to keep your counter neat.</li>
            <li> It serves the purpose for which I bought it.  It did have a small piece broken off on one side but it does not hinder the use of the item.  Good product.  Not flimsy plastic, good and sturdy.</li>
            <li> A great way to display polishes. Nicole by OPI isn&#x27;t a great fit in it, but just a minor glitch in an otherwise great organizer.</li>
            <li> I thought there were supposed to be pieces that I was to put together, but when my package came there was only one piece. The nail polish stand doesn&#x27;t stand upright on its own since the top part was only sent. I&#x27;m really confused and wonder if this has happened to other people.</li>
            <li> It came broken was not Happy.And also it was put together very poorly</li>
            <li> As a member of a Keeble Outlets consumer test program, I have received this product at a significant discount. My comments are my own and are not influenced by Keeble Outlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the quality of the clear acrylic stand.  It would be an excellent display rack on top of a nail station or display case.  The dimensions are a bit off.  Actual dimensions are:&lt;br /&gt;External dimensions are: 16.5&amp;#34; Length, 7 9/16&amp;#34; High, 7 15/16&#x27; Deep.&lt;br /&gt;Internal dimensions are: 1 3/8&amp;#34; deep per shelf x 16&amp;#34; length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to put together by hand, no screw driver needed.  In fact you might need a small wrench to hold the nut and a screw driver to screw it in, but if you do it too hard, you might crack the acrylic.  No instructions were included, but might be useful in the future, especially the wrench size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not intended for this use, but might good to know, it does not fit spice jars, but does fit food coloring bottles and the little tubs of color for decorating cakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the product!  Might be nice to make one with an internal shelf depth dimension of just under 2&amp;#34; for spice jars!</li>
            <li> This is a great rack that puts your nail polish on display, I was tired of keeping my nail products in a basket. After putting my polish in the rack, I realized that it is also perfect for clippers, emery boards and so on so I have added other manicure items (and a few small bottles of other beauty items) to the rack and it looks great. You could probably add jewelry. I am so happy with this polish rack! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of a Keeble Outlets consumer test program, I have received this product at a significant discount. My comments are my own and are not influenced by Keeble Outlets.</li>
            <li> My daughter has many nail polish and makeup bottles so we bought this for her.  She loves it, everything is lined up neatly in one place.  Because it is clear, you can focus on the nice colors she owns.  Looks very pretty on her dresser.&lt;br /&gt;The price was cheaper compared to some other beauty stores too.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made.  It&#x27;s perfect for my nail polish, lip sticks, and lip glosses/\.</li>
            <li> Easy to put together - large - sturdy  Glad I bought it!!!</li>
            <li> As a member of keeble I have been asked to review this product and by no means is my review biased in any way..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said... I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for displaying all my polishes neatly!</li>
            <li> As a member of Keeble Outlets, I received this product at a significant discount.  My comments are my own and are not influenced.&lt;br /&gt;My nail polish rack arrived timely in perfect condition.  It was super easy to put together and required no tools.  It&#x27;s sturdy and holds all of my polish, even some of the odd shaped bottles.  I am actually thinking of ordering one for the nieces.  They&#x27;re nail polish hoarders as well.</li>

My comments are my own and are not influenced by Keeble Outlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This nail polish rack is the way to go! Super easy to put together and organize all your nail polish. Even if you can&#x27;t fit all your polish on one rack, buying a second one and lining them up side by side is a snap! I personally love the clear plastic as my young daughter was able to &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; on it and truly make it her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If simple and straight to the point is what you are looking for, this is the way to go.</li>

My comments are my own and are not influenced by Keeble Outlets&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;  That said, I bought this rack to help my wife organize her nail polish, cosmetics etc. The rack arrived and was easily assembled. The rack was seemingly large enough to accommodate my wife&#x27;s nail polish etc.&lt;br /&gt;  After sitting on the bathroom vanity for a week, my daughter promptly stole it for her room. she completely filled it up and has commented how much she like it(she will probably need another)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product, delivered on time and as promised.</li>
            <li> Was able to store all of my bottles of nail polish, and all of my daily regimen of cosmetics and creams. Easily put together, no tools were needed. Perfect size.</li>
            <li> Great product. It holds just about all my polish bottles. However, the four screws did not come with the stand.  I had to get inventive to get it together. I used tie backs.  It&#x27;s a little wobbly though. But I love the stand.</li>
