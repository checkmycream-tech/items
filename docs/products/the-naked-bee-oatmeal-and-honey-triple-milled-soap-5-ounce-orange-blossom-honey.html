            <li> This soap is great! It is pricey but overall it is a great natural soap. My daughter had rough skin on her stomach, sides and back. At the time we were using dove for sensitive skin. I figured that it was a good option but it wasn&#x27;t getting any better. Doctor said use think greasy lotions to help but that just burned her skin when applied. It would be very red some days and irritating to her. My first bar was an impulse buy at a hardware store where they had a display. Within a week her skin was soft and smooth. So, I ordered 2 cases and haven&#x27;t looked back. Our whole family uses it now and I can tell a major difference in the skin on my arms, especially in the winter when I would get some minor dry patches. They are no more! Highly recommend!!</li>

            <li> Found this soap at a little gift shop. I have very bad combination eczema and psoriasis and have to be careful what products I use. Tried this and found that I don&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;take a break&amp;#34; from it like some others of similar ingredients.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap, the scent is pleasant and not too strong. The soap cleans well and rinses well.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of oranges in the shower! Good lather too!</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing this soap again. Wonderful</li>

            <li> My whole family loves the smell!</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  The smell is intoxicating.  The lather is luxurious.  The ingredients are not harmful to your skin.  Buying it in the six pack saves you money and I will never tire of this great soap.  Love, love, love it.</li>

            <li> Excellent, my skin feels so soft and smooth after shower, not at all dried out. Smells nice too!</li>
            <li> Great soap! Rich lather and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This soap smells wonderful and lasts at least twice as long as the store-bought brand we were using.  The primary reason I bought it was because it is all-natural and free of additives.  I didn&#x27;t even realize it was triple-milled when I bought it!  We will continue to use this soap as long as it&#x27;s made.</li>
            <li> Love this soap- has exfoliation qualities and the scent cannot be beat. Great products in all the Naked Bee items.&lt;br /&gt;Shipper great...............</li>
            <li> Enjoy this soap, works and last longer than most commercially available soaps.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery is always quick and arives in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the price.</li>
            <li> This is a very good all natural soap, leaves your skin feeling fresh and clean, smells great.  Reminds me of Florida which is where I am from.  I use this on my 24 month old.  He at one point had a couple little dry patches of skin near his right elbow and left knee, but since I started using this they have cleared up and went away.  The oatmeal adds a gentle exfoliator which is not abrasive at all especially for a toddler.</li>
