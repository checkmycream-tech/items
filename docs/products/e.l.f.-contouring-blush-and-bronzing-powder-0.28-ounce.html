            <li>that&#x27;s good for darker skin tones.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the Sleek makeup contour face kit</li>

            <li>I must say I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase!</li>
            <li>The Blush Reminds Me Of Sleeks Blush Rose Gold In A Way.</li>
            <li>I would have liked one with a brush.</li>
            <li>If you love make up this is a good buy because you could do so many thing with it.</li>
            <li>The shade is fine for my slightly fair Indian skin tone.</li>
            <li>gives a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best contouring bronzer I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>looks pretty good blended in, im fair and use the lighter color for contouring.</li>
            <li>It is very light...</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li>I already love elf products</li>
            <li>I truly love this contour/blush powder.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m In Love with this product.</li>
            <li>But I played with it and love the color - it stayed on all day.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li>then you will love this product.  </li>
            <li>It would be better if the included a highlight color instead</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t sure you want to commit to the Nars version you can try this out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so smooth and glides on with ease!</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>I cant keep it light or go deepe with it by applting more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a newbie to makeup and its easy for me to use</li>
            <li>It gets stuck in one place and doesn&#x27;t spread too easily.</li>
            <li>On me, it blended in well and didn&#x27;t just look like huge specs of glitter...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>They are both also very pigmented, but can be blended very easily.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m 22, so my skin is pretty smooth.</li>
            <li>The dark powder work&#x27;s great for contouring.</li>
            <li>Down to the product itself: Love it!!</li>
            <li>it more natural and cheaper.</li>
            <li>but it was worth the money just for the blush.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite anymore, as I don&#x27;t use bronzers very often, but comes in nicely when I do want to do a little bronzing.</li>
            <li>Really great duo for a small price.  </li>
            <li>First things first</li>
            <li>I have med to dark brown skin with golden and red under tones, and the bronzer shows up on me beautifully.</li>
            <li>Its my first Elf purchase and</li>
            <li>So I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this for someone with fine lines or deep scaring from acne.</li>
            <li>I heard so much hype about the Covergirl Ebony Bronze powder</li>
            <li>I Really Like It.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like the contour color...</li>
            <li>I really like the color of these powders.</li>
            <li>They compliment my blue eyes, light ivory and brown hair.</li>
            <li>The whole point of contouring the face</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>but honestly I think that this isn&#x27;t as harsh of a contour as the covergirl....</li>
            <li>It works well as a bronzer/contour but it can come off pretty dark on my fair skin, so I have to apply it carefully.  </li>
            <li>Gives a soft highlight without bringing too much attention to the areas you need.</li>
            <li>This powder is nicely saturated with color though, no need to cake it on, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant because the color on the box is not the color of the blush - the actual color is more &#x27;brown&#x27; and on the box</li>
            <li>My only complain is the powders have a little more shimmer than I wanted.</li>
            <li>Natural look,  non chalky.</li>
            <li>i to make it look naturally shaped.</li>
            <li>This is more subtle, and it builds up gradually.</li>
            <li>and I have to really blend that sucker out to make sure I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m auditioning for a broadway musical of eccentric clowns.</li>
            <li>Reading the reviews I expected a semi-glittery compact, so I was prepared for that, but it was SO MUCH DARKER than in the photos, and even the box it came in!</li>
            <li>it looked a little more &#x27;pink&#x27;.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s slightly too dark for me, very powerful and agressive, thank you so much though.</li>
            <li>recommend you get this product and don&#x27;t spend too much on any other highlighter.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> So yeah... First things first, they are NOT matte. Both shades have a shimmer to them. But it&#x27;s ok... On me, it blended in well and didn&#x27;t just look like huge specs of glitter... Although I&#x27;m 22, so my skin is pretty smooth. So I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this for someone with fine lines or deep scaring from acne. I have med to dark brown skin with golden and red under tones, and the bronzer shows up on me beautifully. I think is a good buy and the pans are a good size. They are both also very pigmented, but can be blended very easily. Also you don&#x27;t have to press hard to get the product off on your brush. Just tap it.</li>
            <li> I already love elf products so I knew this was going to be a great product but this product went above and beyond my expectation. I thought this would be a 10 from a 1 out of 10 but its a 20!!! I&#x27;m a newbie to makeup and its easy for me to use so anybody can use it lol!! I truly love this contour/blush powder. I am a woman of color (NC50 or NW45 in MAC) and it is like a heaven sent contour powder. I heard so much hype about the Covergirl Ebony Bronze powder but honestly I think that this isn&#x27;t as harsh of a contour as the covergirl....it more natural and cheaper. Win win situation here come on lol. The blush is good for highlighting or just to go on the cheeks..gives a nice healthy glow. Please if you are a woman of color give this a try and I promise it won&#x27;t let you down.</li>
            <li> My favorite blush! Great colors also!</li>
            <li> looks pretty good blended in, im fair and use the lighter color for contouring. perfect color for me</li>
            <li> I use this each time I apply my makeup I&#x27;m In Love with this product. Its my first Elf purchase and I must say I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase! I&#x27;m running a bit low so I will be purchasing again soon.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant because the color on the box is not the color of the blush - the actual color is more &#x27;brown&#x27; and on the box it looked a little more &#x27;pink&#x27;. But I played with it and love the color - it stayed on all day. I did however use a primer.</li>
            <li> If you love make up this is a good buy because you could do so many thing with it. WORKS AS EYE SHADOW TOO</li>
            <li> Gives a soft highlight without bringing too much attention to the areas you need.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for highlighting and contouring I luv the peachy color it has a glitter highlight to it which makes it glow and stand out and the price was perfect!</li>
            <li> I just think this product is &amp;#34;so so&amp;#34;. The colors have shimmer in them, and I prefer to not use shimmer when I&#x27;m contouring the cheeks. It looks unnatural to me.</li>
            <li> I Really Like It. I Got Turks Caicos. The Contour Powder Does Have Shimmer But Not That Bad. The Blush Reminds Me Of Sleeks Blush Rose Gold In A Way. I Like It</li>
            <li> Finally a blush and bronzer that&#x27;s good for darker skin tones. I&#x27;ve tried CoverGirl Queen Collection Bronzer and it looks like reddish clay on my skin and I have to really blend that sucker out to make sure I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m auditioning for a broadway musical of eccentric clowns. This is more subtle, and it builds up gradually. I don&#x27;t need a lot to contour my face. This is by far the best contouring bronzer I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ve heard of bronzers where the sun hits the face and you have the shimmer effect, but since I have darker skin, i need to shape my face, not make it look shimmery lol. If I want shine I can either sweat, use an eye brightener or use a highlighter.</li>
            <li> The blush color is wonderful!! Don&#x27;t really like the contour color...but it was worth the money just for the blush.</li>
            <li> Nothing else out there like it for this price!</li>
            <li> This one comes without any brush. I would have liked one with a brush. The application is not very uniform. It gets stuck in one place and doesn&#x27;t spread too easily. The shade is fine for my slightly fair Indian skin tone.</li>
            <li> Alot darker than expected .</li>
            <li> Excellent Seller....Great Product!</li>
            <li> Great packaging, bubble rap, tracking number upon shipping confirmation, arrived before estimated date. Can&#x27;t get any better than this. Down to the product itself: Love it!! Natural look,  non chalky.</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed by the shade this came in. Reading the reviews I expected a semi-glittery compact, so I was prepared for that, but it was SO MUCH DARKER than in the photos, and even the box it came in! I&#x27;m including a photo in the review so everyone can see it. The &amp;#34;pinkish&amp;#34; tint is just as brown as the other, and the darker one is very pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still going to use it, but you CANNOT, unless you are way over contouring, use this for an everyday look..</li>
            <li> If you are a Diva that loves make-up lke me then you will love this product.  The darker side is PERFECT for highlighting under the cheekbones, chin &amp; forehead. It is very light...just dap a tiny bit onto brush and blen away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you get this product and don&#x27;t spend too much on any other highlighter. It makes a great cut to my cheekbones.</li>
            <li> The dark powder work&#x27;s great for contouring. I cant keep it light or go deepe with it by applting more.  I reallty like it. however, the blush powder looks ashy on me. I&#x27;m brown skin with red undertones. I don&#x27;t use the blush. Wish I could then I wouldn&#x27;t have to carry a separate blush. It would be better if the included a highlight color instead</li>
            <li> I really like the color of these powders. They compliment my blue eyes, light ivory and brown hair. My only complain is the powders have a little more shimmer than I wanted. The whole point of contouring the face i to make it look naturally shaped. I feel like the shimmer(although slight) detracts from a natural look. This powder is nicely saturated with color though, no need to cake it on, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I really like this product it&#x27;s perfect for everyday use.  Not as good as the Sleek makeup contour face kit but I still use it.</li>
            <li> I use few time notice that the colors is too dark for yum skin...</li>
            <li> Really great duo for a small price.  If you aren&#x27;t sure you want to commit to the Nars version you can try this out.

            <li> for that price, very good stuff!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so smooth and glides on with ease! I love it</li>
            <li> Love but it&#x27;s slightly too dark for me, very powerful and agressive, thank you so much though.</li>
