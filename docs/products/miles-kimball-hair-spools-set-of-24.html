    <ol>
            <li>Wife asked for these for a stocking stuffer and says they work great!</li>
            <li>Awesome</li>
            <li>Even though the quality is very good, I recommend closing and re-opening them to break them in.  </li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great idea...</li>
            <li>( which i liked ).</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with these rollers.</li>
            <li>This is probably going to become a popular item since I have posted my experience on Google+., if you are thinking about trying them...</li>
            <li>and they were wonderful, but these need to be re-designed completely.  </li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The ones I bought about 3 years ago were thinner and more flexible and easier to use and did not crack</li>
            <li>but for now I will come up with som creative hair styles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend a lot on them.</li>
            <li>If you liked the original, you will like these.</li>
            <li>Should have known it was too cheap and good to be true.</li>
            <li>They are very cheap, so cheap that I just got them today, tried one of them, and it has now split.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad these were cheap.  </li>
            <li>The plastic is cheap, not at all \\&quot;rubbery\\&quot; but those that did not break (about 12) did manage to hold onto hair and curl it.</li>
            <li>but it would cost me more than it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>I was initially excited to get these, however, of the 24 spools 4 of them broke immediately as I attempted to secure them onto my hair.  </li>
            <li>Not as soft as the original ones I used many, many years ago.</li>
            <li>curl hair very well and are very comfortable to sleep on</li>
            <li>The only good thing about them is that they didn&#x27;t cost a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess it is true</li>
            <li>They are easy to sleep in, easy to use, inexpensive and you get a decent amount in the package.</li>
            <li>The ones from my childhood were bigger, more pliable and just generally more functional.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>We love finding new uses for vintage products</li>
            <li>So much fun to use these again.</li>
            <li>These are probably about an inch in size and would be best on short fine hair (i.e., a small child).  </li>
            <li>so they fall right out of your hair.  </li>
            <li>so even if you can get your hair wound around them, it slides right out.  </li>
            <li>probably work much better on short hair.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have 11 of the original soft plastic Spoolies and these don&#x27;t compare at all.</li>
            <li>I remember them to be large</li>
            <li>They are all 1 size which is fine if you want tiny curls.</li>
            <li>nice little hair spoolies to have ...</li>
            <li>These have little plastic frays at the seams and are kind of flimsy</li>
            <li>I really want to find these hair spools in a size I can use,  </li>
            <li>Hers were made much nicer and sturdier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m kind of worried about how these will hold up over a few uses.</li>
            <li>Product was new; as described b Seller.</li>
            <li>Those that survived the first night showed stress marks indicating that they likely would not survive another use.  </li>
            <li>the set also pretty much stays the next day, only relaxed a bit.</li>
            <li>I ordered these  few days ago and received them quickly!</li>
            <li>Used to have them when I was young</li>
            <li>(natural 4c hair)</li>
            <li>They were too small, and I thought that I was purchasing the original Spoolie size rollers.  </li>

            <li> (natural 4c hair)</li>
            <li> They were too small, and I thought that I was purchasing the original Spoolie size rollers.  </li>
            <li> these spools have to be wound several times to keep them in place securely, and each one only holds a small strand of hair, so it takes quite a few spools to set medium length hairstyles.  </li>
            <li> did not meet my needs, not as i pictured, even though i used them many years ago, quality of item is very poor , my hair is thin and i was unable to close the product as in times before when i used them, they do not close good, very  very disatisfied with them, a waste of my money</li>
            <li> I also suggest that if you have long hair, but the larger size.  </li>
            <li> much too hard to use on short hair.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t work in my hair because it is way to long .and</li>
            <li> In addition, due to the size of these spools you will likely need two packs to do almost anyone&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I was hoping they would be a little bigger.</li>
            <li> Product was à little different than It was when I was à child, but It worked quite well.</li>
            <li> Great idea, terrible execution.  </li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> on the plus side---they curl the hair extremely rapidly.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it.  </li>
            <li> The spools don&#x27;t close tightly</li>
            <li> I have long hair and the smaller rollers are useless to me.</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The curler cracks after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> The plastic is too hard as well, and they are hard to flip closed.  </li>
            <li> but I found it to be too small  </li>
            <li> They were too small.</li>
            <li> They were too small and would not stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> These curkers are made with a plastic that is too thick and too stiff.</li>
            <li> Crap they fall right off.  </li>
            <li> Too small, hard to wrap hair around.</li>
            <li> They are VERY small and the surface is VERY slick....</li>
            <li> , the rubber was thicker, these were way too thin.</li>
            <li> She says they are a bit difficult to get in place but would order again.</li>
            <li> Have very thin hair, won&#x27;t stay in hair.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I started rolling my little girls hair and one by one the rollers started to split.</li>
            <li> and they were worthless.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> nice little hair spoolies to have ... thx</li>
            <li> I used it to roll my hair but I found it to be too small  I remember them to be large</li>
            <li> I was initially excited to get these, however, of the 24 spools 4 of them broke immediately as I attempted to secure them onto my hair.  Those that survived the first night showed stress marks indicating that they likely would not survive another use.  The only good thing about them is that they didn&#x27;t cost a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend these for use.</li>
            <li> these spools have to be wound several times to keep them in place securely, and each one only holds a small strand of hair, so it takes quite a few spools to set medium length hairstyles.  probably work much better on short hair.  on the plus side---they curl the hair extremely rapidly.  two hours, and your hair is &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; curled.  the set also pretty much stays the next day, only relaxed a bit. ( which i liked ).</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Just as I wanted! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Below expectations.  Used to have them when I was young so bought to use on my granddaughters hair and they were worthless.  The rubber part that fold over the hair after it is wound up does not hold the hair, not matter what amount you try.  They just fall out.  So, I was given a refund but not for the postage and they told me just to throw the hair spools away.  Waste of time and money</li>
            <li> Bought them as a gift for my mother in law. she loves them.</li>
            <li> Wife asked for these for a stocking stuffer and says they work great!</li>
            <li> I really want to find these hair spools in a size I can use,  These are probably about an inch in size and would be best on short fine hair (i.e., a small child).  In addition, due to the size of these spools you will likely need two packs to do almost anyone&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Too small, hard to wrap hair around. I remember when I was younger they were easier to use, the rubber was thicker, these were way too thin.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t work in my hair because it is way to long .and the curlers kept coming out</li>
            <li> They are all 1 size which is fine if you want tiny curls. I was hoping they would be a little bigger. Not as soft as the original ones I used many, many years ago. Need to come in larger sizes with some type of holding coating around the spool to keep hair on the spool. Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Tiny, does not hold hair and brittle.</li>
            <li> The spools don&#x27;t close tightly so they fall right out of your hair.  Great idea, terrible execution.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered these. She says they are a bit difficult to get in place but would order again. She likes them.</li>
            <li> We have found another use for them. We keep necklaces from tangling while traveling by wrapping the chains around the spools. We love finding new uses for vintage products</li>
            <li> curl hair very well and are very comfortable to sleep on</li>
            <li> Bought these for my granddaughter whose hair is to her shoulders.  They worked not at all, falling out almost before we could get them in.  The ones from my childhood were bigger, more pliable and just generally more functional.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. As expected.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I started rolling my little girls hair and one by one the rollers started to split. The plastic is cheap, not at all \\&quot;rubbery\\&quot; but those that did not break (about 12) did manage to hold onto hair and curl it.</li>
            <li> Just as I remembered!  Even though the quality is very good, I recommend closing and re-opening them to break them in.  I also suggest that if you have long hair, but the larger size.  If you liked the original, you will like these.</li>
            <li> They were too small. Is there a larger set of them? I like the concept!</li>
            <li> These curkers are made with a plastic that is too thick and too stiff. The curler cracks after just a few uses. The ones I bought about 3 years ago were thinner and more flexible and easier to use and did not crack</li>
            <li> They were too small and would not stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> A friend had purchased these but must have bought from another site.  Hers were made much nicer and sturdier. These have little plastic frays at the seams and are kind of flimsy</li>
            <li> I ordered these  few days ago and received them quickly! I put them to work that night! I am thrilled with these rollers. They are easy to sleep in, easy to use, inexpensive and you get a decent amount in the package. I only wish they came in sizes (Sm, Med, Lg) but for now I will come up with som creative hair styles. This is probably going to become a popular item since I have posted my experience on Google+., if you are thinking about trying them...get&#x27;em while you can. (natural 4c hair)</li>
            <li> Product was à little different than It was when I was à child, but It worked quite well.</li>
            <li> Have very thin hair, won&#x27;t stay in hair.</li>
            <li> Takes me back to younger days when life was so very different. So much fun to use these again. Awesome</li>
            <li> Besides opening the package and finding 5 disfigured pieces?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m kind of worried about how these will hold up over a few uses. I have 11 of the original soft plastic Spoolies and these don&#x27;t compare at all. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend a lot on them.</li>
            <li> did not meet my needs, not as i pictured, even though i used them many years ago, quality of item is very poor , my hair is thin and i was unable to close the product as in times before when i used them, they do not close good, very  very disatisfied with them, a waste of my money</li>
            <li> Product was new; as described b Seller. I used Spoolies in the 1960s as a preteen - I was amazed by their presence in the 2000s.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping! Just as described! Thanks!</li>
            <li> much too hard to use on short hair.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for these curlers for ages. Great price.</li>
            <li> They are very cheap, so cheap that I just got them today, tried one of them, and it has now split.  I guess it is true, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.  I am so glad these were cheap.  I would send them back but it would cost me more than it&#x27;s worth.  They are VERY small and the surface is VERY slick....so even if you can get your hair wound around them, it slides right out.  The plastic is too hard as well, and they are hard to flip closed.  It&#x27;s a great idea...I used to have some heated curlers that operated this way and they were wonderful, but these need to be re-designed completely.  Save your money.  I don&#x27;t think these would work on any hair type.</li>
            <li> Crap they fall right off.  Should have known it was too cheap and good to be true.</li>
            <li> They were too small, and I thought that I was purchasing the original Spoolie size rollers.  I have long hair and the smaller rollers are useless to me.</li>
