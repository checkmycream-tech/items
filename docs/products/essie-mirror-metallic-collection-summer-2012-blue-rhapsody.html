            <li>I tend to vary my favorite color choice a lot, and have found that the best way to do this is through the color of my nails.</li>

            <li>and they are good quality.</li>
            <li>LOVE this color!  </li>
            <li>The combination is stunning!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also goes on smooth and provides great coverage.  </li>
            <li>but it comes off very easily</li>

            <li>Just love this product.</li>
            <li>I love Bessie polishes</li>
            <li>Love the color...</li>
            <li>Seems to be more of a spring color</li>
            <li>Essie has become a favorite brand of mine-beautiful colors,</li>
            <li>love the sparkly color</li>
            <li>That is a great thing about this particular color-</li>
            <li>Love this color and it arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>A beautiful color :) definitely recommend for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to pay drugstore prices!</li>
            <li>This is such a beautiful polish.</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful shade of blue.</li>
            <li>Very pretty metallic color!  </li>
            <li>This polish (as well as all the Essie metallic polishes) not only works great for nail stamping</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a frosty or glittery polish at all - it is a smooth, mirror-like polish.</li>
            <li>This color is great...very true to the picture.  </li>
            <li>Even though I am wearing it in Winter 2013, I feel very chic (/SHēk/).&lt;br /&gt;Essie makes magic polish.</li>
            <li>I have been so pleased sense trying the Essie polish, in my opinion it holds up as well as the gel polishes &amp; the metallic&#x27;s in particular are very forgiving.  </li>
            <li>Polish stays on nice long time without chipping, even on my toes during sandal weather.</li>
            <li>It covers in just one coat and dries very fast.</li>
            <li>First this order arrived so fast!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful shade of pale blue, and even though I&#x27;m not a Tolkein nerd, it immediately reminded me of Galadriel in LOTR as portrayed by Cate Blanchett.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast reliable affordable</li>
            <li>really like this color</li>
            <li>and I am surprised considering it is Essie.</li>
            <li>me, it took 2 coats for full opacity, with touch ups in a few spots.</li>
            <li>but I live in a rural area and cant find them.&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
            <li>Looks just like the picture, came quickly, no regrets!</li>

            <li> Great product. My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Looks just like the picture, came quickly, no regrets! A beautiful color :) definitely recommend for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to pay drugstore prices!</li>
            <li> I like the color but it comes off very easily and I am surprised considering it is Essie. If i didn&#x27;t like the color I would rate it one star.</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful polish. I started off just buying the gold metallic polish because I wanted to see if it would work with my nail stamps. I&#x27;m very happy to say it worked great. This polish (as well as all the Essie metallic polishes) not only works great for nail stamping but it&#x27;s beautiful on it&#x27;s own too. It is a beautiful shade of blue. It covers in just one coat and dries very fast. I would definitely recommend this polish to others.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to experiment with some different colors. I don&#x27;t think the metallic  aspect of this color worked for me.</li>
            <li> This color is great...very true to the picture.  It looks like ice blue colored aluminum foil.  Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also goes on smooth and provides great coverage.  You really just need one coat - although I usually do 2 to add intensity of color.</li>
            <li> LOVE this color!  Polish stays on nice long time without chipping, even on my toes during sandal weather.</li>
            <li> Love this color and it arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> I have tired many nail polishes and for a while had even started using the gels because I was so sick of regular polish that chipped.  I have been so pleased sense trying the Essie polish, in my opinion it holds up as well as the gel polishes &amp; the metallic&#x27;s in particular are very forgiving.  Just love this product.</li>
            <li> All cheesiness aside, when Essie included this in their &amp;#34;Mirror Metallic Collection,&amp;#34; they were not kidding! The finish on this polish, even without a topcoat, is a lustrous, otherworldly shine. It&#x27;s a beautiful shade of pale blue, and even though I&#x27;m not a Tolkein nerd, it immediately reminded me of Galadriel in LOTR as portrayed by Cate Blanchett.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it took 2 coats for full opacity, with touch ups in a few spots. I would definitely recommend using a ridge filler prior to applying, as the mirror shine fully enhances any imperfections one may have on their nails.</li>
            <li> First this order arrived so fast! Great service!&lt;br /&gt; Now about the product. I love Bessie polishes but I live in a rural area and cant find them.&lt;br /&gt;was happy to find on Amazon and at such a great price.&lt;br /&gt; The mirror color polishes are beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;One coat gives you a perfect polished nail that has great shine.&lt;br /&gt;couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Love the color...you can wear it with anything.</li>
            <li> Even though I am wearing it in Winter 2013, I feel very chic (/SHēk/).&lt;br /&gt;Essie makes magic polish. I will definitely use up this bottle.</li>
            <li> Fast reliable affordable</li>
            <li> Very pretty metallic color!  Seems to be more of a spring color but I am still going to wear it this summer... essie has great nail polishes and they are good quality.</li>
            <li> I tend to vary my favorite color choice a lot, and have found that the best way to do this is through the color of my nails. Essie has become a favorite brand of mine-beautiful colors, long-lasting, incredible shine.this particular shade is outstanding. Currently i am wearing it on my left index finger, with the rest of nails in another shade by Essie-a lilac one. The combination is stunning! That is a great thing about this particular color- there are so many possibilities!! I will be using this shade in a variety of ways for a lon g time!!</li>
            <li> really like this color</li>
            <li> love the sparkly color</li>
            <li> I had a manicure this summer - forgot the name of it, and have been searching ever since.  3 bottles of blue polish later, I finally found it.  This isn&#x27;t a frosty or glittery polish at all - it is a smooth, mirror-like polish.</li>
