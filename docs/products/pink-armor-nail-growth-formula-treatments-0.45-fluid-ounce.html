            <li>This product is awesome and has transformed my nails for the better.  </li>
            <li>Best product I&#x27;ve ever used&lt;br /&gt;Never had so many compliments on my nails.  </li>
            <li>This is the most wonderful nail polish, treatment I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>And today the gals at my ladies luncheon asked how I managed to keep my nails looking so nice!</li>
            <li>so I tried this product and am thrilled with my results!</li>
            <li>came to Amazon and purchased three bottles of this miracle nail polish and gifted one to my best friend.  </li>
            <li>They are strong and in amazing shape!!!!</li>
            <li>Bright</li>
            <li>Years ago, I did acrylic and loved the length and design options, but it destroyed my nail beds.</li>
            <li>So that might be a good approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>use Sally Hansen cuticle oil (cheap and the best of all I&#x27;ve tried) and take biotin for nails, hair, skin (Costco).</li>
            <li>I just know that my nails look soo good</li>
            <li>I wish I could give a good review</li>
            <li>But once it arrived, I loved it and use it often.</li>
            <li>Loved it.  </li>
            <li>I HAD USED IT BEFORE AND FOUND IT TO BE AS GOOD AS I REMEMBERED.</li>
            <li>my nails look good?</li>
            <li>My nails so good</li>
            <li>It is so good</li>
            <li>My nails were gorgeous ...</li>
            <li>, my nails still look really good.  </li>
            <li>for the good things-First-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very happy customer and hope this item is always available.  </li>
            <li>I have heard good and not so good from others.</li>
            <li>Which is good for me.</li>
            <li>Not as good as vinylux</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a week and have loved the way my nails feel.</li>
            <li>I loved the \\&quot;look\\&quot; of the Shellac</li>
            <li>My nails look good and feel good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is great to have pretty nails &amp; toes, &amp; the best is they seem to stay healthy even after you take the polish off!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve researched the nail gel trend, and although having polish that does not peel sounds awesome, is it worth ruining your nails for?</li>
            <li>I have been very satisfied.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, I am glad I found it.</li>
            <li>I have never been so pleased!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I am so pleased, I stocked piled some bottles!  </li>
            <li>For me, this stuff is magical!</li>
            <li>I hope they keep making this stuff because I like it even better than a gel manicure from a salon!</li>
            <li>Since I have been using this product my nails look lovely and no chipping, peeling or yellowing!</li>
            <li>My favorite !</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I thought ,&amp;#34; ok, that deserves a review !</li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and, the best part, easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>My nails look great after using this so strong ... thumbs up</li>
            <li>This is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>My sister had Amazing nails.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This nail polish it is like a drug, it looks amazing but in the end your nails will die.</li>
            <li>This item is amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing</li>
            <li>It makes my nails look amazing.</li>
            <li>I decided to get a bottle and do it on my own.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d like to say that they are nice nails now.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly nice color - Bottles are always misleading because the color you see is not quite how it&#x27;ll be on your nails.</li>
            <li>I was in awe at how nice the nails looked.</li>
            <li>the end of the day, to each their own,</li>
            <li>and I am more than happy and satisfied with this</li>
            <li>/&gt;haven&#x27;t seen the infomercial, so did my own thing:</li>
            <li>and she really liked it.</li>
            <li>as soon as they started looking good one or more would break &amp; i would start all over.</li>
            <li>Nice pinkish color when applied, but did not get any additional hardened protection.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a good substitute, although it does cost more.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products over the years to strengthen my nails and to make them look good.</li>
            <li>Telling me how nice they looked.</li>
            <li>Was looking forward to good results after seeing many commercials on TV.  </li>
            <li>I never heard anything again about my order and to be honest</li>
            <li>was on they  own website</li>
            <li>but my husband did remark at how nice it made my nails look.</li>
            <li>it is a nice nail gel</li>
            <li>I bought three bottles in case I liked it and couldn&#x27;t find it again.</li>
            <li>without success.&lt;br /&gt;After 9 months of trying to grow my own....</li>
            <li>I am so thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my honest</li>
            <li>This stuff is the absolute best!</li>
            <li>My husband does my nails, he was an Esthetician/manicurist and had his own salon until he retired and found this product for me.  </li>
            <li>I really liked how it made my nails look, and it did make them feel stronger.</li>
            <li>This is a nice treatment for nails</li>
            <li>kind of flu like, but no fever.  </li>
            <li>In 4-6 weeks my nails have some length and have never been this nice on their own.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is awesome, have bought it for years and will keep buying it as long as it exist,it is great for your nails</li>
            <li>If you want your nails growing super fast and looking great, go get yourself some Perfect Formula nail polish.  </li>
            <li>My nails are strong, healthy and look great.</li>
            <li>This is a good nail protector, but it&#x27;s NOT as strong as gel.</li>
            <li>I figured I could easily refund it if it wasn&#x27;t any good.</li>
            <li>Your nails become very strong and tint color gives nail beds</li>
            <li>When I have this polish on, my nails are very strong.  </li>
            <li>This product did not stay on my nails and peeled off very easily.</li>
            <li>My nails are strong, smooth and beautiful.</li>
            <li>They look more amazing than they have in years.</li>
            <li>My nails are beautiful for the first time in years.</li>
            <li>I think this is the best product I have ever used to grow my natural nails.</li>
            <li>It was great the first day, the colour is really nice</li>
            <li>sooo easy to take off!</li>
            <li>and my nails grew out -- strong!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t submit very many reviews but felt strongly about this</li>
            <li>this polish is so so strong!</li>
            <li>However, I will say it is very shiny and bright and does look good from that stand-point</li>
            <li>I find this to be a good, cheaper alternative to the perfect pink gel from Sephora.</li>
            <li>but my nails look pretty great now.</li>
            <li>very cheap price</li>
            <li>I find it very cheap at bed bath and beyond with my 20 percent coupon</li>
            <li>Wonderful product for keeping your nails strong and makes polish last for so many days!</li>
            <li>Nice looking nails, strong and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very good to use under a professional manicure.</li>
            <li>so I thought one more time</li>
            <li>Better than going to a nail salon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plan to purchase more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased better products from Sally&#x27;s or Ulta.</li>
            <li>Tried this in hopes it would protect my nails better.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Hard as Nails&amp;#34; from any drugstore would work as well or better.</li>
            <li>ok i did order this product from someone else</li>
            <li>i am sure you will see some results</li>
            <li>Glad I heard about PA and like others said....</li>
            <li>Now they are longer, smooth, and have a nice finish to them.  </li>
            <li>I use this as a top coat for my at-home manicure every two weeks.</li>
            <li>Better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It was all they said it was and more.</li>
            <li>took awhile to get but love the product</li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>also wanted to add that when I removed this polish, my nails seemed to be more drier and brittle.</li>
            <li>I got my nails done at the salon for many years and it completly ruined my nails.  </li>
            <li>However, the results of 1-2 coats is actually a really lovely &amp;#34;step</li>
            <li>with some adjustments in how I use the product, I might find I get even better results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll look much better when you have no lines or cracks in your nails.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>is a site with healthy polish:&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>Life saver for sure.</li>
            <li>FOR THEM TO GROW OUT MORE</li>
            <li>those years we have tried so many things for her.</li>
            <li>; rarely has a good association in our books...</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s able to put nail polish on them again.</li>
            <li>decided to take the plunge and soooo glad I</li>
            <li>u better do it..</li>
            <li>Just love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I could not be more pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this polish.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff...</li>
            <li>and hard!!!!I love the color</li>
            <li>My 3 favorite things are: 1.</li>
            <li>With Nail polish it is even more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My nails are now showing more curves .</li>
            <li>I love this product and feel better about wearing my rings instead of hiding my hands</li>
            <li>As for the whitening not so sure but longer and stonger</li>
            <li>Asking me what I was doing and where could they purchase the product.&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sandra</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>I have not been able to grow my nails out in years unless I use a gel type polish.  </li>
            <li>Ok</li>
            <li>It hardens just like the ones from the Salon, Just put a layer a day to get better results.</li>
            <li>Once you try it you will love it.</li>
            <li>Also I wore some nail polish with this as a top coat for over a week</li>
            <li>love that the Nail Armor price doesn&#x27;t break the bank</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Shellac and love the look but</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many layer I applied because I would add one when I thought about it.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s helping more than than hurt.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS</li>
            <li>I can get two weeks or more out of my polish now.</li>
            <li>I might have to touch up the tips after a week or more</li>
            <li>I will no longer need to pay for manicures and can maintain lovely looking nails myself.</li>
            <li>But, overall, this is a beautiful polish and reccommended to all! :)</li>
            <li>While my nails were damaged when I stopped, most of that damage was gone in about a year.</li>
            <li>Under medium indoor lighting, my nails look healthy...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed my nails do look better, and seem to be stronger.</li>
            <li>home online shopping is more my style</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>My nails dont seem any better with it than it  </li>
            <li>I thought the word &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; suggested it would be thicker and add more to my nails</li>
            <li>Or put the money you are considering spending on this product toward a better one.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>I  love this nail polish</li>
            <li>but I must say that I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li>My review is not based on which of the two is better.  </li>
            <li>All I know is that the one from Sephora is more</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 bottles, the shipping expense was greater than the item.  </li>
            <li>Then I used this product and my nails looks healthy than ever.</li>
            <li>Hansen nail growth for many years</li>
            <li>it will do some damage, to your healthy nails</li>
            <li>Enjoying health nail and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>When washing dishes or doing anything that requires you to have your hands soaking a lot, it&#x27;s always a better to wear gloves.</li>
            <li>and my nails were still splitting at the top of my nail.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used more products that I can remember, in attempts to strengthen them.  </li>
            <li>I plan to purchase more.</li>
            <li>Others that I know that have tried it, love it.</li>
            <li>I type 10 hours sometimes more a day.  </li>
            <li>, my nails look healthy.  </li>
            <li>It is thicker than most polish</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I do not know what will happen when the peeling gets to the top of my nail bed</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I have tried many products to strengthen them....</li>
            <li>The product does what it says it will do, and my nails have never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how my nails look but it peeled after the 2 days of applying.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months, and, if anything, my nails are more brittle than before.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t believe my nails were even more beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it was just ok.</li>
            <li>you can also put your favorite nail polish over it as well.</li>
            <li>My nails look better and stronger and are growing.</li>
            <li>It helped me get rid of my split nail which lasted for more than 10 years and according to doctors, couldn&#x27;t be cured.</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>It is okay for a couple of days</li>
            <li>I just love the look of my nails with this stuff on.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>and it was lovely...</li>
            <li>They look 100% better -</li>
            <li>I like many of the others here never saw the tv ads for this but saw it in the store in the &amp;#34;as seen on TV &amp;#34; section.</li>
            <li>I also love the feel of my nails.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Sally Hansen does a better job of hardening the nails.  </li>
            <li>i love this stuff</li>
            <li>VERY speedy delivery and great product</li>
            <li>but oh well, just try it yourself and find out, dont take my advice if you dont want it, but you should buy this product somewhere like walmart where it&#x27;s more affordable that way</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have had extremely healthy nails</li>
            <li>all of my life (so healthy that people always asked what I used on my nails), until 2 years ago when I got gel Shellac Nail polish in a salon.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for over 2 months and see great results my nails have not broken or snagged since I started to use it.</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>My nails are lovely.  </li>
            <li>Nausea, headache, stomach ache, diarrhea -all of those symptoms and MORE are indicated in formaldehyde allergy.  </li>
            <li>Conditions nails better than Sally H. products.  </li>
            <li>Love It!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>yes, but I would assume that since it filled in the cracks and splits my nails will be able to grow without catching on stuff and ripping.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>it looks healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle and absolutely love this product!!!</li>
            <li>I bought this product on a whim and my nails have grown for the first time in years!!!</li>
            <li>- they all do a beautiful job of brightening the nails, but the problem with most of them is that they peel off in sheets after some kind of water exposure, especially after showering or swimming.</li>
            <li>I applied it immediately and was very excited with results.</li>
            <li>I thought my beautiful healthy natural nails had been doomed forever.</li>
            <li>I like the nice clean glossy look.</li>
            <li>When I first ordered this product, I thought I was getting a good deal at two bottles for the price of one.  </li>
            <li>Best product I have bought in a long time.</li>
            <li>I am happy to report that as of day 5, I am applying the product under the tips of my newly grown nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product has great advertising but doesn&#x27;t live up to</li>
            <li>Keeps them strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>I used to use Loreal Grow Strong but haven&#x27;t been able to find it for years.</li>
            <li>this product keeps the nails strong somewhat,but not as i expected,you have to use it more frequentlythan advertized by the advertizer</li>
            <li>every 2-3 days , they are strong healthy looking,people don&#x27;t believe I do it myself.</li>
            <li>Pink Armor is especially effective for restoring damaged nails after many years of using gel/acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I bought it at Walmart the 1st time i paid $10 and loved it so much i bought another one</li>
            <li>If it peels off the tips because of dishes, cleaning, etc, I just apply more to the tips and it is fine.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this polish is that it dries quickly!</li>
            <li>Product is very good, do dishes and not have to redo your nails like with regular nail polish.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m definitely happy with it so far.  </li>
            <li>so far this has helped a great deal.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Clear, pretty, and works great!</li>
            <li>I love holding them to the light and admiring them like some vain teenager.</li>
            <li>PINK ARMOR nail gel is the best nail stuff i have used.</li>
            <li>I can say this was the best $10 that I have spent.</li>
            <li>And most importantly it make my nail look</li>
            <li>I think it is more important that I warn people that this could happen.  </li>
            <li>This Pink Armour is great!</li>
            <li>This is the best nail polish/ hardener that I have ever had that is long lasting and beautiful.</li>
            <li>This product is not at all as good as it is advertised to be and the price is way to high!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really looks good on my nails.</li>
            <li>Really suprised how good it is.</li>
            <li>After using pink armor for a week my nails looked excellent and strong.</li>
            <li>If she touched her nail or bumped it it would split and she was in significant pain and discomfort for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>But under bright lights and sunshine (I live in Arizona!)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your nail stronger, easily peels off.</li>
            <li>They still break too easily.</li>
            <li>It dries very quickly, BUT---</li>
            <li>It does not strengthen your nails and chips and scraches off easily.  </li>
            <li>Peeled off my nails easily</li>
            <li>and it dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>You will see results very very quickly.  </li>
            <li>and my nails have weakened, splitting easily.</li>
            <li>No breaking, splitting, or bending easily as before.</li>
            <li>This stuff dries VERY quickly</li>
            <li>My nails started to grow out very quickly and stronger</li>
            <li>It stays on well and comes off easily.  </li>
            <li>My nails have always chipped and peeled easily.  </li>
            <li>My nails take a beating at work and break easily.</li>
            <li>Removal was easy, Acetone remover..</li>
            <li>The cost sky rocketed from $10 to $30 very quickly &amp; out of frustration I hung up.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and dries within 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>This product makes my nails stay strong and not peel.</li>
            <li>I found that this did not make my nails as strong as I would like.  </li>
            <li>My nails have never been so strong</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought sally hansen strong as nails, bought her a garlic nail polish that promised to cure her ailments, took her to get nail treatments and nothing...</li>
            <li>but it did make them strong.</li>
            <li>My coworker saw my nails and asked what have I been using and why are my nails do strong.</li>
            <li>and you could feel immediately how your nail are protected and strong.</li>
            <li>I have never had strong nails ever.  </li>
            <li>I would polich them to keep them strong but because I type all day my nails will crack and break.</li>
            <li>and I can see that my nails are shining and strong.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve searched for products that promised they would make my nails strong and they haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>My nails are now strong and the peeling has ceased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid more for the special nail stuff.</li>
            <li>Back to beautiful nails.</li>
            <li>I recently had my nails done at the salon - UV activated gel tips - it looked beautiful.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li>Fine to use as an undercoat for your polish.</li>
            <li>Best product that I&#x27;ve tried of this type, and costs less.</li>
            <li>Great for my nails, My nails are long an healthy.</li>
            <li>I now have strong nails and enjoy doing my nails at home.</li>
            <li>As a top coat, super efficient.</li>
            <li>Stay on for a long time and the nail looks good!</li>
            <li>Is this really the answer for easy and nice looking nails?</li>
            <li>long, strong and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I tried Pink Armor over a month ago and am THRILLED to finally have a wonderful full set of my own nails.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s huge.</li>
            <li>I also want to mention that it protects my nails from breakage and has made a huge difference in the growth and strength of my nails.</li>
            <li>But I honestly have never had such amazing nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>liked how it makes nails look more natural though...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product once a week and saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li>but so far I am more impressed than anything I have bought in the last 8 years!</li>
            <li>I wonder if that is what makes it light up.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>The reason I state this is because this review is going to sound like its paid for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Her praise for this product was so great that she went to their site to leave a personal review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nails stay strong and clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried gel nails, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect some polish in a bottle to work like the gel that needs to be baked in the UV light.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a great product especially for my customers who do not like color on their nails.</li>
            <li>On the otherhand, this doesn&#x27;t really promote nail growth, but it makes it look really nice.</li>
            <li>get one free and</li>
            <li>if you ordered that day you also received a free manicure set.</li>
            <li>It felt just like gel polish, smooth and shiny -</li>
            <li>Smooth, shinny, and</li>
            <li>, it filled in the cracks and splits)</li>
            <li>No polish I have ever used is this smooth.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely the best nail strengthener/hardener/long lasting gel polish I have ever used.</li>
            <li>After drying my hands I went into a room that had lots of light and was really pleased with the fact that my nails still had that fresh painted look, heck they almost looked like they were still wet!&lt;br</li>
            <li>My nails looks beautiful and I have never had nails this long without breakage.</li>
            <li>So far so good, after a week.</li>
            <li>With this product my nails have grown so long and beautiful people stop to compliment my nails.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>so far so good</li>
            <li>they are long and beautiful</li>
            <li>My nails stopped peeling and have grown so strong, healthy and pretty.  </li>
            <li>I finally have strong nails - and they&#x27;re my own!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Dries quickly too so good for busy working moms like me!</li>
            <li>So when I saw this, I am pretty sure I made an audible scoffing sound.</li>
            <li>which is pretty good being that your nails go through so much in a week.</li>
            <li>Thanks to years of taking glucosamine/chrondriton/msm, I have very strong nails.</li>
            <li>They had a special, buy one get one free of anything in that aisle, so I thought, why not?  </li>
            <li>I now use Burt&#x27;s Bees cuticle cream (love that stuff!) and have generally healthy nails that go through cycles of strength, likely reflecting my nutrition and stress.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the soaking that destroyed my nails.</li>
            <li>First time used and glad to find it.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about this product</li>
            <li>you for such a nice invention!</li>
            <li>I never expected my nails to look as good as they do so soon.</li>
            <li>first I put it on top of the Sensationail gel (that I couldn&#x27;t get off)....</li>
            <li>I love it so much, I bought 6 bottles and another 3 for my sister-in-law to try!  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try it as I have a permanent split in two of my nails</li>
            <li>love, love, love this stuff - my nails have actually started to grow using this.</li>
            <li>I do not want my polish to last 2 weeks - I like to change color more than that - but always liked the shine and the no chipping.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice pink sheen to it that looks nice and natural.&lt;br /&gt;10/1/13  </li>
            <li>I DO hand wash dishes without gloves and work in the yard without gloves and clean the house without gloves.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Application: Once a week I use an enriched nail polish remover to clean it up and repaint.</li>
            <li>So clean.</li>
            <li>I also tried similar products-but this is by far the best!!!!</li>
            <li>I have used so many products, went to numerous salons to get acrylic and gel nails because I felt my nails would never grow on their own.</li>
            <li>I love the way Pink Armor makes my nails look bright.</li>
            <li>March 22: ok this stuff is pretty awesome :) it has lasted me a little over a week and ten times better than any nail polish that ive ever used in my life.</li>
            <li>However, I have two coast on right now and all my nails feel rather strong, which is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Applies VERY easily and dries super fast - Super yay for this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to soak or do anything special to remove it weekly.</li>
            <li>nothing special.  </li>
            <li>I typically use OPI polish but wanted to see how this did on a lower priced polish and Color show has some great spring/summer colors out right now:)</li>
            <li>Was bummed out but quickly became excited when I found it in CVS.</li>
            <li>they could break easy at anytime when they get in the  Certain length I find couldn&#x27;t find any Solution to stop it!</li>
            <li>I never really had great nails to begin with</li>
            <li>mY NAILS ARE HAPPY WITH THIS PINK ARMOR.  </li>
            <li>At first the nails just looked great (same as Sally Hanson)</li>
            <li>Instead they actually looked really, really good.</li>
            <li>But even if you don&#x27;t think it helps your nails,  you should try it just for the cool look your nails will have.</li>
            <li>Lasts a full week without re-application.  </li>
            <li>Mostly nail polish peels off, so I don&#x27;t do it very often.  </li>
            <li>Good product, especially for an infomercial find.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard and read too many horror stories about nail gels to ever try the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Now, if its supposed to go on and hold up like true salon cured gel, then I don&#x27;t think this is the stuff to do it.</li>
            <li>I agree with the folks who said they loved the look especially in the sunlight, and how quickly it dries.  </li>
            <li>Strong enough to put your hands in a bed of rocks, which out the worry of chipping a nail&amp;#34; but honestly what woman would do that.</li>
            <li>i have put new 2  coats on each week &amp; have  long - strong and  beautiful nails</li>
            <li>Now my nails are strong and pretty.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have strong lucious nails in the first place...</li>
            <li>I can put it on quickly and close it up</li>
            <li>I can apply it quickly just about anywhere.</li>
            <li>and I will have to do a quick touch up before I go to work.  </li>
            <li>and I will have to do a quick touch up before I go to work.  </li>
            <li>It stays on, wears super well!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product works wonders and I have been able to maintain nice nails since I started using pink armor.  </li>
            <li>the nail would peel off and would tear to the quick ...</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call the color fluorescent but more light pinkish unless I&#x27;m in blue light where they are almost lavender.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because it isn&#x27;t the concrete barricade for the nails that the name suggests, but overall I am very glad I made this purchase!</li>
            <li>My nails do have a pinkish tone, look very healthy, and my nails are soooooooo long right now!</li>
            <li>My nails no longer peel or split, and finally at 41 I have a beautiful set of NATURAL nails.</li>
            <li>few years ago I tried the gel polish fad at the salons with a great deal of hope.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s concentrated in the bottle, so that bright pink color was a bit off-putting to me.</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth the $10.00.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to grow my nails because they are to soft.</li>
            <li>claims on most of the bottles...not the natural stuff.</li>
            <li>WOW am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>thinning and damaging them to the point where it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>That was fun having nails I could use as screwdrivers(ha).</li>
            <li>But I have most definitely made more progress in the last 9 months than I&#x27;d been able to do in 10 or 12 years</li>
            <li>and I will use Gellous instead, a much better nail strengthener that lasts a good week at least.</li>
            <li>For the summer I do my own white tips and use this over it.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Then I put on a  clear sealing top coat that I use.  </li>
            <li>When this product first came out, I was hesitant to buy it and wondered if it&#x27;s claim to grow your nails was in fact true.  </li>
            <li>my nails have NEVER looked better in my young</li>
            <li>But I do love the way this makes your nails look so pink and healthy.</li>
            <li>When used as directed this actually does strengthen you nails nicely.</li>
            <li>So far I love this product and would buy again.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s rare</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the product entirely or partially, I love what introducing this to my life has done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend completely.</li>
            <li>So the product would peel off &amp; I could never enjoy a nice looking manicure for more than a day or two.</li>
            <li>Just developed fungus under one of my long beautiful nail.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it was virtually free, after the 2nd day, I bought another bottle to make sure I don&#x27;t run out, ever.  </li>
            <li>About 2 years ago, nail polish began peeling and chipping off the day after I applied it, completely off most nails within 4 days.</li>
            <li>My nails were destroyed after getting a gel manicure for a wedding.&lt;br /&gt;After buying this product I put a fresh coat on each Sunday.</li>
            <li>Overall looks nice and works well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Sally Hansen product, as well a others, but I&#x27;ve never had success with those.</li>
            <li>but they looks so good with just the pink armor that I stick to that.  </li>
            <li>The Pink Armor is a good product for the nails and toes.</li>
            <li>I saw this product in Walgreen&#x27;s and thought it worth a try.  </li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t reapply every day--maybe just once per week, and then do a fresh coat every week.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the look of natural nails as the product claims.</li>
            <li>I got this product cheaper at Wal-Mart and thought I would try it and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>it makes my nails real strong and lets them grown long.</li>
            <li>There are so many other products that work so much better.</li>
            <li>I type all day at work; this is the first time ever I have had to trim my nails because their length interfered with my ability to type as quickly as I do.</li>
            <li>It dries quick, stays on, does not peel, looks pretty.</li>
            <li>After I remove the polish I wash my hands with warm soapy water and use an old toothbrush to scrub them clean (a little toothpaste on the toothbrush works wonders to keep your nails healthy and clean).</li>
            <li>do like the way my nails look after painting them with pink armor, but as the saying goes, if it sounds too good to be true then it probably is.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be able to open a can of soda with your tip</li>
            <li>But even for a short period of time, it appears this is at least as good as a very good strengthening polish and possibly as good as a basic gel, all without the time commitment, costs and potential damage.  </li>
            <li>look goo; nails on right hand don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I have about 7 or 8 coats on right now</li>
            <li>I try this item right away</li>
            <li>Darn right they do.</li>
            <li>I bought this but didn&#x27;t use it right away.  </li>
            <li>My package came right on time about 3 days from my order date.</li>
            <li>So my salon applied a &amp;#34;miracle product&amp;#34; they said would &amp;#34;fix me right up&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>On both the polish appears to have just peeled right off.  </li>
            <li>I do my own French manicures and it lasted me a whole week!</li>
            <li>For the first time in probably 10 years, I actually look like I have a nice manicure.  </li>
            <li>My mother, who has the same kind of nails (thanks for the genes, mom!) could not get a result out of this.</li>
            <li>(although it&#x27;s not the cheapest either, but it&#x27;s way more affordable than Dior) &amp; that it&#x27;s readily available at most local drugstores (as well as here on Amazon for almost the same price).</li>
            <li>I wanted to add, there is something in the ingrediants that when I put my nails under a UV light to dry, they light up like neon!  </li>
            <li>After several applications my nails looked and felt super healthy.</li>
            <li>last week I was actually able to have a French manicure for the first time in too many years to count!  </li>
            <li>The first night I came home with it, I applied 3 coats to my nails and was amazed at how quickly my nails dried and looked so good.</li>
            <li>Love it, cheaper than the other brand n just as easy to use.</li>
            <li>Its not available in a lot of colors yet, but you can always put a coat of your favorite color on top of it.</li>
            <li>Add also the fact that the pink color is great to wear when you want a natural look.</li>
            <li>I am a 70 year old woman with easily split nails, with ridges. .</li>
            <li>Because of their attractive natural look I wore Pink Armour alone.  </li>
            <li>My nails have always been soft and easily broke.  </li>
            <li>- This is a HUGE one because most &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; claims are going to come with a high price tag that isn&#x27;t just financial.</li>
            <li>it dries VERY fast.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it really helps to keep nails stronger or not, but it goes on smoothly, dries fast, and leaves a nice purplish pink hue on your nails.  </li>
            <li>am going to say that I am very impressed with the fact that I did my nails about 2 hours before bedtime and was surprised that my nails did dry in a very short amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Nails are strong with nice shine and natural pink color.</li>
            <li>I have had a big toenail that consistently split down the center since I injured it as an aerobics instructor 20 yrs ago.&lt;br /&gt;After using this polish for several weeks on my toes, the nail is perfectly healthy (no split!!), &amp; I have a perfect 10 toes again.</li>
            <li>After that I tried a huge variety of polishes meant to strengthen and protect natural nails, including whatever Sally Hansen had to offer.</li>
            <li>Pink Armor is amazing.</li>
            <li>some kept my nails better than others but it was still a daily application.</li>
            <li>and it gave my nails a nice pink colour which shows up when you go out in the sunlight</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Both seems about the same for strengthening, but THIS ONE is much better at stopping splitting and getting rid of ridges.</li>
            <li>After trying many products, I have finally found one that works.  </li>
            <li>Works as well as the higher priced gel.</li>
            <li>BUT with Pink Armor I know have nice nails.</li>
            <li>It held up pretty well all things considered.</li>
            <li>First, it does NOT make your nails look as advertised on TV or in ads.  </li>
            <li>I love this and couldn&#x27;t find it locally</li>
            <li>This peeled the first time I took a shower, the morning after applying it.  </li>
            <li>I have gone back for two more bottles and will be using this product for years to come.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m usually very picky!</li>
            <li>and this one does exactly that!&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>the first time I used it as I said before it was a couple of hours before I went to bed.  </li>
            <li>Just because I love nail products I would probably purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars because it does make my nails pretty,</li>
            <li>The nail restorer works exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>So I looked up pictures of peeling nails and sure enough my nails looked just like the pictures.  </li>
            <li>It performs best alone with 2 to 3 normal coats (after a lite buff to reduce ridges) or as a base coat then two light color polish applications and then a generous top coat.</li>
            <li>I use this as a top coat on my french manicure....</li>
            <li>It dries SO FAST!</li>
            <li>I noticed her nails looked so healthy and ask where she got her last manicure.</li>
            <li>It definitely makes the nail look really healthy.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Pink Armor for just over a month now, changing the polish each week, and I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I do believe it makes your nails not only look healthy</li>
            <li>I keep bottles of it and if you add enough layers under or on top of polish you can sometimes peel it off without having to use remover.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s likely that I&#x27;ve been more aware of the damage to my nails, and that thinking has made my nail usage to be gentler.</li>
            <li>I love this type of optical brightening nail product &amp; have tried many different kinds, from very low end</li>
            <li>Yes it does make your nails look pretty and the beds pinker and the tips</li>
            <li>I have ordered several more bottles</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;ve been wearing this for about 2 weeks now, and for me, I do like this polish over others I&#x27;ve tried recently.</li>
            <li>Pink Armor has enabled me to have my own nails.  </li>
            <li>With that being said, this is not the first time that I have let my nails \\&quot;breathe\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>However this is the first time that I have let them \\&quot;breathe\\&quot; and the nail product has helped to make my nails stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First off-</li>
            <li>When I first began using it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it for only a couple of weeks, and so far, I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do as it claims to make the nails look pink or the tips look whiter, but it gives them a nice sheen.</li>
            <li>Love Pink Armor Nail growth I have bought several of this item, bought one for my daughter for Christmas and she is thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>She used to have very yellow nails-now they look healthy.</li>
            <li>I tried many different types of products claiming miracle results to no avail.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t enhance the whites of your nails like the higher priced gel formula.  </li>
            <li>At first, my nails peeled a bit, but I kept using it any way.</li>
            <li>I applied 3 coats the first time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my first compliment yesterday</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>love this product definitely recommend it</li>
            <li>it goes on really pretty and makes your nails shiny.</li>
            <li>It really makes my nails look like I just walked out of the salon with a fresh manicure.</li>
            <li>I will definitely use more of this product.</li>
            <li>but I can attest to my own use of Pink Armor Nail Gel polish.  </li>
            <li>It DOES give my nails a \\&quot;pink\\&quot; tone, almost flourescent in color but that color is more noticeable when I am outside in the sunlight.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway this product did exactly what the Box said it would.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>I wish I could buff then out a little more to be smooth right now.</li>
            <li>This is the first and only product that has given me absolutely long beautiful strong nails with white tips.  </li>
            <li>They are strong &amp; hard &amp; have grown to a nice length.</li>
            <li>but now, they&#x27;re long and beautiful and this gives the right tint of pink.</li>
            <li>To my amazement, my nails looked bright, pink and new.</li>
            <li>My one frustration is the nail beds are healthy and the cuticles are decent when I remember to care for them, but the nails never stay nice consistently and definitely never get long.</li>
            <li>so I took the bottle with me and while my husband was driving I quickly applied a fresh coat over the old one.</li>
            <li>I also LOVE the color very nice pink pale.</li>
            <li>know there are many who will simply believe this is an isolated case (and it might well be) but it is worth doing a test on one finger (maybe a pinky) for a free weeks to see if you have a similar reaction.  </li>
            <li>I usually re-do my nails every week , this polish really makes the French manicure look awesome!  </li>
            <li>but with 1 or 2 coats of Nail Armor they come alive with a perky, fresh, youthful, clean, healthy pink glow that looks natural, &amp; particularly vibrant in bright daylight &amp; sunlight (this product will also glow white under blacklight).</li>
            <li>Mine are better for sure but not as hard.</li>
            <li>For repeat applications I always take off the old coat and clean my hands.</li>
            <li>I have very brittle nails that are constantly splitting and will not keep nail polish on for more then 2 days.</li>
            <li>I had hopes that this gel would be as good as the more expensive brand, but it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li>You can get \\&quot;Pink Nail Magic\\&quot; at Sally&#x27;s for $7.99 and is a far superior product.</li>
            <li>I feel pretty certain</li>
            <li>my nail became discolored and scratched from too much coloring, my sister bought for me this pink armor gel, it does really make nail look better and shinier, and its good defence to layer your nail before put on other nail color.</li>
            <li>So I decided to go natural again and used a special polish (Nailtiques/Nailtek) to repair the damage.</li>
            <li>At this point, all I am looking for are nice looking nails that have a little white tip and look healthy.</li>
            <li>and I have Never Been able to Grow my nails long.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and natural!  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to see the Pink Armor Nail Gel be available on-line, since my local WalMartt store seemed to be out of it permanently.</li>
            <li>Try to go without polish for a few weeks and you will be very pleased.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s subtle, and most notable in sunlight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Three months later her nails are long and healthy and strong.</li>
            <li>You can apply it to the whole nail and it automatically make the fleshy part of your nail look more pink and the tips look more white.</li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t wear colored polish, my nails look healthy, shiny and they are long!</li>
            <li>On day eight, I removed the polish easily, and again painted two coats as described above.</li>
            <li>But it comes off easily with regular polish remover.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for several weeks and my nails have never looked this good or been this long.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this will make your nails strong enough to grow.</li>
            <li>This product is the easiest way to have a beautiful, natural manicure with the least effort.</li>
            <li>I have my hands in dishwater ever single day (more than once)</li>
            <li>I bought this from CVS purely for use of the color.</li>
            <li>I am not able to use too many nail products as I am sensitive to many chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I took off the acrylics and in just a few short months, I have beautiful real nails.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used this for over a month now and for the first time in my life, my nails are long and strong.</li>
            <li>I actually only take it all off, ( with regular nail polish remover), when I start to see a good amount of new nail growth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest, I also began taking 2 capsules of gelatin daily not long afterwards as well.  </li>
            <li>advice is to file, buff, and shine your nails first with any tool you can find (Revlon has a decent one) and paint your nails with this afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had pretty nails, but as I got older my nails became brittle and split all the time.</li>
            <li>While I do agree the price is very HIGH, it doesn&#x27;t affect the performance of the product, so it does not affect my rating.    </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have as much durable staying power as the ones mentioned above, but it will generally last me a good 5 days of vigorous wear &amp; tear throughout my work week, with only minor chips (I keep my nails very short), especially if I wear it under Dior Gel Coat (my favorite strong top coat that has a lot of endurance).</li>
            <li>right after I using it I started notice something my nails starting to grew very out quickly and stronger</li>
            <li>My nails do grow fast on their own but this makes them grow just a little bit faster.</li>
            <li>The other great thing about it is that it makes your nails go from yucky yellow to a beautiful pale pink.</li>
            <li>my niece Bob this and told me it has really worked on her nails and her nails are stronger and longer</li>
            <li>I will let you know if it really does the job for me</li>
            <li>I have put this product through the paces and found it to be very beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this time i buffed my nails before aplication and it lasted  about 3 days.so i decide to use it like twice a week for 4wks straight</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really have to</li>
            <li>Drys quickly, absolutely does not peep or chip and my nail feel stronger</li>
            <li>Thanks to this stuff...</li>
            <li>haha)</li>
            <li>Once again, it&#x27;s fast and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My nails feel so much stronger.</li>
            <li>too much and your nails will have a purple color to them, and look as though they are under a UV lamp.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>To my absolute shock, this stuff is a nail miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li>so much so that I turned to acrylics for a while.  </li>
            <li>Then I moved on to gel which was much easier</li>
            <li>But the combination has been very productive for me.  </li>
            <li>it brightens the whole nail and tips.</li>
            <li>I love the Pink Armor.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use nail polish and really have no nail \\&quot;problems\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>tHANKS</li>
            <li>really NOTHING</li>
            <li>I love Pink Armor.  </li>
            <li>I started by removing my french manicure, washed my hands and lightly rubbed alcohol on each nail before I started.  </li>
            <li>The formula really grows my nails.</li>
            <li>but it seems to be working very well protecting my nails from chips.</li>
            <li>I have tried just about every reasonably priced,(under $15),</li>
            <li>so much so, that when I go to get a pedicure, I am repeatedly asked by the nail techs if my nails are mine, and when I tell them yes, they want to know what I used.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how to rate something that is in this category</li>
            <li>If it changes, then I&#x27;ll put it on this website -- thanks</li>
            <li>I fell in love with Pink Armor for a while.  </li>
            <li>and I really use my hands.</li>
            <li>Chipped really fast.</li>
            <li>Pink Armor gives your nails a nice, healthy pink glow with a professional look, as the end result.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>really like this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>This product has really helped my brittle nails to thicken and harden.</li>
            <li>One of the reasons I like this product is you do not have to use acetone to soak the product off, it dries fast and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>This is like a gel manicure straight from home.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I needed a nail fix anyway and figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>it really the product?</li>
            <li>I found another brand in The Vermont Country Store catalogue that really  works.</li>
            <li>This is one product that really helps my nail to grow.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>My nails are growing and look much healthier.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Pink Gel Coat for years because I love the look on my nails (pinker nail beds, whiter nail tips)</li>
            <li>Many people compare this product to one sold by Sephora called Pink Gel or something like that.  </li>
            <li>The seller is fast and reliable.</li>
            <li>I can finally really grow my nails out</li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>The manicure lasts the whole week &amp; never chips.  </li>
            <li>This product is for real.</li>
            <li>I very</li>
            <li>Fast and efficient delivery.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m even growing out one nail that is very damaged and never grows well.</li>
            <li>They were still a bit bendy but so much thicker and stronger.</li>
            <li>Thanks nail armor.</li>
            <li>and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I was looking for somewhere to write a review because I really like this.</li>
            <li>The Pink Armor nail gel is okay.</li>
            <li>I love the Pink Armor nail gel.</li>
            <li>My nails look much brighter.</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>it really works, try it and see for yourself please wash hands and nails before use as</li>
            <li>I was ready to give up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d pay 4 times that much......</li>
            <li>recommend this product to anyone who wants to take care of their nails.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I had to put one coat every day, and its washing off vert fast</li>
            <li>Really grips nail surface.  </li>
            <li>As a nurse, hands in water and gloves all the time, this really helps.</li>
            <li>My nails are very shinny like salon gel finish.  </li>
            <li>The soaking and scraping of my nails really threw me off..</li>
            <li>, I am also going to paint them with maybelline color show in coral crush and use Pink Armour as a top coat.</li>
            <li>I tend to have rather white tips naturally, so even without effort the result is lovely.</li>
            <li>so I can wear it a few more days before cleaning them off and reapplying three fresh coats.</li>
            <li>Gave it to my daughter to try and her nails were amazing in just two weeks or less!  </li>
            <li>Has a pretty pink shade and keeps my nails strong and shiny.</li>
            <li>Does not stay on long, chips easily.</li>
            <li>I also do like the light pink tint it gives my nails when I just want a natural clean look.</li>
            <li>My nails have never been this long and strong.  </li>
            <li>This product is truly a blessing to my nails and they have been able to grow.&lt;br /&gt;The color is a very light pink, just a little brighter than the nail pink of healthy nails.</li>
            <li>You have to put it under top edge of nail (just as the other techiques say)</li>
            <li>and I put more on every other day.</li>
            <li>This product, along with CND Solar Oil nourishing treatment and CND Cuticle Eraser, has brought my nails back to their original health and vitality.  </li>
            <li>I love this product,comparable to other but for 1/3 of the price.</li>
            <li>where other polishes won&#x27;t, a 5 because my nails do look better, and a 3 for the color</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product to help my manicure last longer.</li>
            <li>It has helped better then other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>Also completely by accident, I found out it gives off a nice white kight under a black light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid as much for decent nail polish.</li>
            <li>I once used to enjoy and ordered my first bottle of Pink Armor Nail Gel.  </li>
            <li>a clean french manicure look</li>
            <li>I think that was the main reason for so much damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All of my nails are nice &amp; long at one time &amp; have been so for quiet</li>
            <li>The Nailtiques line was decent enough for the original repair work, but I couldn&#x27;t be bothered to keep applying</li>
            <li>My nails weren&#x27;t the best to begin with (thin and would curve under when long) but they didn&#x27;t peel!</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>As long as it is available, I&#x27;ll keep buying it.  </li>
            <li>But last winter I decided to really concentrate on getting back the healthy nails</li>
            <li>honest  - for  past 3 weeks  </li>
            <li>I appreciate that the bottle is the customary 1/2 ounce size that all nailpolishes used to be, whereas nowadays many companies are scrimping down to 1/3 ounce &amp; raising prices.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was never able to grow my nails, but now that I am  using Pink Armor, my nails have grown and are nice and strong.  </li>
            <li>that products live up to their hype but this one really does.</li>
            <li>My nails are very ridged, so I lightly buff them, file them, then apply the Pink Armor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I HAVE ALMOST FINISHED HALF THE BOTTLE AND LOVE THE WAY</li>
            <li>In less than a week the splitting stopped and my nails looked healthy.</li>
            <li>The Sally Hansen products work much better for less money.</li>
            <li>PINK GEL COAT works far better.  </li>
            <li>tint).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to find that Pink Armor doesn&#x27;t peel off instantly either!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying the look of this product even more than my expensive Dior Nail Glow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more clear than pink.</li>
            <li>Today I have 1 more completely naked nail and one 1/2 naked nail.  </li>
            <li>never have i ever had anything close to decent nails.</li>
            <li>You can apply several coats quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love the color, a pink manicured clear look.</li>
            <li>This is the only formula I have tried in many years that actually delivers what it promises.  </li>
            <li>I actually think regular polish would work better.</li>
            <li>I was in the process of removing my gel nails which made my real ones very soft.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it begins to peel after your very first shower, especially upon the edges of your nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recomment  this produce to anyone having problems growing nails.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly \\&quot;hands down.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>And more simple than other techiques that have you putting 5 coats on in the first sitting.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure, that I have little time to spare.</li>
            <li>Its not that good as I expect, it works but very very slow, so</li>
            <li>First let me start by saying my nails are pretty healthy, decent length and occasionally break in the most inconvenient place.</li>
            <li>started with clean, dry damaged nails 5 days ago.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;d think that wasn&#x27;t too much to ask, but so far it has been!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had my 20% coupon ready for action that day.</li>
            <li>I put on this nail gel to clean dry nails....</li>
            <li>about the 4th week i forgot to remove it mid-week and noticed after 7 days if my nail bumped something it would break off like a chunk of concrete.</li>
            <li>which makes my husband happy since it is expensive, Lolllllll.</li>
            <li>light pink.. hides chips...</li>
            <li>Love the clear pink, it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li>Normal smell</li>
            <li>I love it and recommend it to anyone having trouble with brittle nails.</li>
            <li>If I owed a nail shop, I would stock this as my secret weapon for successfully transioning those clients requesting to go from gel or synthetic nails, to natural.</li>
            <li>it was fantastic for the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li>You cannot rub your freshly painted nails in a pile of rocks and expect it not to scratch- come on who actually believed that anyway.  </li>
            <li>Love this but it wont last long.</li>
            <li>This was no different than putting on a topcoat and it didn&#x27;t keep my nails from splitting, Kind of expensive for a top coat .</li>
            <li>well worth the ten dollars you pay</li>
            <li>I LOVE that I can apply the polish in minutes, with no complicated rules, and have it dry fast enough to move on to the next &amp;#34;mom-ergency&amp;#34; without scraping off polish or messing up my nails.</li>
            <li>Which brings me to the next issue:  this states it comes off easily with regular nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li>It dries super fast, by the time I am done with the second hand the first is already dry.</li>
            <li>I will put it on the in the night and it would peel right off the next day ....</li>
            <li>I never had strong nails in my life and now have to file them down every week to keep the growth under control.</li>
            <li>well worth the cost as others with problem nails can probably back me up for spending small fortunes to get healthy nails.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a little pricey, and I don&#x27;t know that I would have noticed results at all if I were trying to grow my nails out &amp;#34;super long&amp;#34;, but overall, I think that this product did a nice job.</li>
            <li>I had planned to go out on New Years Day</li>
            <li>Never had any come off, just added another layer or two after the new growth started to peek out.  </li>
            <li>Dries quick, lasts much longer than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This made my nails stronger in just a few days and 2 months later my nails are amazing.</li>
            <li>I will be back for more pink armor gel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick to dry</li>
            <li>She it worked as expected and that she would like to get more in the future.</li>
            <li>I slap on one coat of Pink Armor, two coats of my favorite nail polish (Revlon or Avon) and one coat of Pink Armor as a top coat and let them dry in UV lamp for at least 3 minutes or more.  </li>
            <li>Pink Armor allows me to have pretty nails for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>the nails are pink and the white looks healthy.</li>
            <li>I removed Pink Armor from my nails last night and already feel better today.  </li>
            <li>I was not planning on getting them done again and was really upset to see how much damage was done to my nails in a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Had another manicure and used this as a base and top coat, and my nails never looked so good.</li>
            <li>It is good to use for a base and top coat.  </li>
            <li>I just sat here and read about 30 reviews and while most are positive, I was a bit surprised at the negative ones.  </li>
            <li>I have very soft nails and have always worn acrylics.  </li>
            <li>Key is to keep using it consistently.</li>
            <li>My nails were splitting more than usual.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s just like a regular clear tint of nail polish that you can find at the drugstores for much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to really like this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>funny... nails on left hand</li>
            <li>I used it daily for the first wk then took off and reapplied on a weekly basis.  </li>
            <li>People are always looking for that &amp;#34;Miracle Product&amp;#34; that will do EXACTLY what the tv commercial says it will do.  </li>
            <li>I applied two coats for the first time and about 30 minutes later went and hand washed come cups and silverware that were in my kitchen sink.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised Amazon would offer this!</li>
            <li>This product hardens and protects only when wearing the product (but still works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried).</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was initially skeptical &amp; I&#x27;m glad this turned out to be a great product (for me at least).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done the dishes, some yard work, housecleaning, computer work, and NOTHING happened to my manicure - it looked the same as it did the first day</li>
            <li>but first I try a  different  </li>
            <li>Since I began using this product I actually have pretty nails</li>
            <li>and wow!</li>
            <li>I use a colored nail polish first, and then put the gel on last.  </li>
            <li>First it was just a couple, but now all of them have peeled and are painfully short.</li>
            <li>I definitely saw an improvement during the first 2 months  of use.  </li>
            <li>So far its working for me!  </li>
            <li>Was so excited when I finally ordered it but only for a hot second.</li>
            <li>It performs exactly the same and is a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Also leaves them with a really cool pink hue.</li>
            <li>It makes my nails hard and strong!</li>
            <li>For me, after only 4 weeks of use, my nails are once again strong, and long!  </li>
            <li>I have recently been using the alcohol wipes to clean off any oils prior to applying polish and that has extended my polish wear by a day or two.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the brush detached from the top and every time I open it, I have to unstick the brush from the bottle and screw it back into the top.</li>
            <li>It does show a slight shade of pink on your nails but the tips are noticeably whiter, I liked the color...</li>
            <li>I was told the next morning I couldn&#x27;t cancel &amp; was quickly harassed with phone calls about extra costs that were already in place &amp; would be charged to my card automatically?  </li>
            <li>They were so dry that I had to let me nails grow out before they looked right again.</li>
            <li>(Dior Nail Glow $24, it&#x27;s fantastic but very expensive...&amp; the most expensive of all is Perfect Formula Pink Gel Coat</li>
            <li>but I had enough of a free edge that was strong (as opposed to being cracked, splitting, peeling, broken which has been my norm for ages)</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products for my weak, soft nails, nothing really worked.</li>
            <li>I bought this after seeing it on tv and thought at the very least it would give my nails a nice finished look as they grew.</li>
            <li>it makes them look healthy and shiny &amp; they feel hard.</li>
            <li>You can buy a bottle of clear tint nail polish and you wouldn&#x27;t notice the difference.</li>
            <li>up&amp;#34; from clear polish.</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s basically clear also helps</li>
            <li>All this stuff is, is clear nail polish.  </li>
            <li>(so would clear polish).  </li>
            <li>only con I&#x27;ve found is that putting more than two coats of the Pink Armor nail gel on your nails makes for a very funky pink color.</li>
            <li>Go to Walmart &amp; buy clear coat for $4</li>
            <li>I use it because I like a natural look.  </li>
            <li>I moved on to natural nail approaches.</li>
            <li>Now being reasonable, this has only been a week.</li>
            <li>But considering the claim of &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;, I was ready for possible damage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the second bottle and really like this product.</li>
            <li>I  WILL Tell You I am 49 years old</li>
            <li>Today is the first time I am applying color along with it so cannot comment on how long color stays on using this.  </li>
            <li>I am a swimmer and have soft nail beds.  </li>
            <li>This nail formula has allowed me to grow my natural nails again.</li>
            <li>This has made them look healthier and natural.</li>
            <li>kinda takes away the \\&quot;natural healthy\\&quot; look.    </li>
            <li>My nails are no longer soft, brittle or peeling.</li>
            <li>It really works because I notice something about a week later.</li>
            <li>IT HAS HELPED MY NAILS, THEY ARE NORMALLY SOFT AND PEEL</li>
            <li>This item is used frequently.</li>
            <li>The polish stayed on in chipped for about a week until I had to take it off much longer than my polish regularly stayed on.</li>
            <li>and I have natural soft nail.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t find the Sally Hansen Clear Tint nail polish of old, every one is trying to do the nail gel thing.  </li>
            <li>What a big surprise this nail polish is, it really works for me.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>so idk how fast it makes your nails grow, but i will update on anything else later on.</li>
            <li>and I have a 3 year old, work, and go to school and workout.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, I didn&#x27;t see the commercial but this product has really helped me.</li>
            <li>Now I am not so self conscious about my nails while they are growing out naturally.</li>
            <li>Cheaper when bought directly from TV.</li>
            <li>Imagine, in only a few days, my nails had become healthy and stronger.</li>
            <li>This is the best base coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>A thick top coat like Dior Gel Coat works well to turn ridges into glass-like</li>
            <li>I have had very dry brittle nails that split right up in to the bed of the nail.</li>
            <li>I have also noted that the original polish was a very deep pink and the latest bottle has hardly any tint to it.</li>
            <li>Especially if you have a French tip white pen with a coat or two over it, the pink sheen, when outside, is soooo pretty and my nails are seriously strong, not bending what-so-ever, and getting long quick.  </li>
            <li>and when the 2nd hand is painted the first hand is dry and ready for another coat.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally strong nails &amp; although the product makes them pretty, 5 have broken since using the product.</li>
            <li>Oh my, when will my nails come back to normal?!?</li>
            <li>I was surprised that the texture is very much like the Blue Cross clear that I used years ago.  </li>
            <li>The simple clear (and the French top coats) that they sold were, in my opinion, as good as (and much less expensive than)</li>
            <li>It did dry quickly, but I still waited about 10 minutes before applying the second coat.</li>
            <li>I have in the past tried many different products to help with splitting nails,  so far this product is working.  </li>
            <li>The Pink Armor last as long as 3 or more weeks without chipping.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, it makes your nail shiny and tough to break, and much harder to chip !!</li>
            <li>and yes, this polish helps, but no better than a cheap bottle of clear polish you can buy anywhere.  </li>
            <li>I do not think that this makes my nails any stronger than normal nail polish definitely not as strong as actual gel nail polish that has to be cured with a UV light</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t peel like so many other Sally Hanson, Revlon, OPI and other salon products</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle at CVS, like others I&#x27;ve been loyal to Sally Hansen, the miracle growth with silk fibers specifically has worked well for years of on and off getting gel/acrylic nails, after this last time I swore off the fakeys and decided to grow out my natural nails again, saw the Pink Armor at my local CVS and thought what the heck, I had extra bucks</li>
            <li>My nails have finally grown to a decent length and stay that way.  </li>
            <li>The Pink Armour Nail Gel Polish has performed better for me than any other polish I have used of any price!</li>
            <li>I paint one hand then the other right away</li>
            <li>I had high hopes that this might finally be the answer to my problem nails.  </li>
            <li>but I have seen an improvement in my nails which are ruined from getting the Pink and White at my local salon (they do a fabulous job).  </li>
            <li>My nails were consistently peeling from biting, rough usage, and dishwashing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ive been ising the product every week with 3 coats.....its soo pretty and pink....</li>
            <li>After the first application??!!&lt;br /&gt;I kept it on for 5 days as the instructions read - the Pink armor did not peel or chip during that time - and I work a lot with water and chemicals.</li>
            <li>The secret to its best performance is to use it as a base coat AND top coat.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to dent my nails at the edge because they were so soft and now they&#x27;re tough stuff!&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Blue Cross $3) to very high end</li>
            <li>(I tried one new product and it was not the same)</li>
            <li>I really like this product and have bought two bottles in the last five months and am still using the second bottle.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product that finally got my very frail nails to strengthen.</li>
            <li>It worked in terms of polish actually lasting and my nails looking nice for awhile, but my poor nail beds were destroyed when I soaked off the polish.</li>
            <li>I use two coats as a base, apply a color, then use two more coats as a top coat.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my nails strong and thick.</li>
            <li>One bottle arrived empty but the other was fine.  </li>
            <li>I use it alone, with no other product.</li>
            <li>It has strengthened my nails and helped them to grow as no other product has.  </li>
            <li>no chips.and is pretty without any other polish .</li>
            <li>That wasn&#x27;t the case as I could barely even notice it on my nails after 2 coats!  </li>
            <li>will definitely continue to use this if for nothing else the quick dry time, week long staying power and pretty pink color.</li>
            <li>It left my nails pretty dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>I reapply every other day and after 5-6 days or extra abuse I remove it and reapply fresh.  </li>
            <li>Even the little chips that were there at the tips  of my nails were smoothed out by just applying this fresh coat</li>
            <li>I lucked out and found this product on a clearance end cap at a Dollar General store for $7</li>
            <li>But when you open the bottle, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll clear the room like you would with remover or some of the gel products.</li>
            <li>This is the same as a $.99 bottle of clear polish from a dollar store.  </li>
            <li>Upon removing the polish it became clear that what had actually happened</li>
            <li>I barely use it nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I damaged my nail beds a while back from doing manicures too frequently.  </li>
            <li>I work in health care and wash my hands constantly, the Gel polish alone has lasted 5 to 7 days before I remove completely and start over.</li>
            <li>I really like the pink armor nail growth.</li>
            <li>Only time will tell if my nails return to an unblemished look.</li>
            <li>I got fast results from Pink Armor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this product for nail growth/ anti-breakage but for a 2 minute complete faux french mani?</li>
            <li>,it really does turn the nail bed pink and the whites are whiter</li>
            <li>Now it is directly on my bare nails.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny, especially when you consider that it cost no more than the nail polishes that I normally buy.was a couple of hours before I went to bed.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny, especially when you consider that it cost no more than the nail polishes that I normally buy.</li>
            <li>Pink Armor is the first product I&#x27;ve used that actually has made a difference in the strength and appearance of my nails.  </li>
            <li>The smalles downside, you have to be careful not to get bubbles in the application, but that&#x27;s easy to avoid if you&#x27;re slow and steady.</li>
            <li>while it does keep your nails healthy, using in on a nail with fungus seems to make the issue worse.</li>
            <li>My nails held up better with just the regular base and top coat.</li>
            <li>It was great at first, but one of my nails broke and I realized my nails were peeling and cracking very badly.</li>
            <li>I even applied it in the car recently and by the time I drove to the store, I had NO worries about it being dry and ready to go.</li>
            <li>Obviously the number of coats you apply with affect dry time, but 1 coat dries almost immediately and 1-2 is still very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Polish peels off after a few hours, or if you&#x27;re lucky, the next day.  </li>
            <li>The only negative is that it does have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>At first I thought the scratches might be due to the orange stick I used to push my cuticles back</li>
            <li>and it really worked for me, so i would suggest to other people give it a chance as i did....</li>
            <li>I had yellowish brittle nails due to too much nail polish use.</li>
            <li>Right now my nails are such a mess from a thyroid problem</li>
            <li>(takes about 5-10 minutes that includes both hands and dry time) then one coat every other day just to keep it fresh looking.  </li>
            <li>and the whites start far before the tip of my nail, likely because I bit my nails when I was younger.</li>
            <li>Suddenly I began noticing what looked like white scratches on my natural nails when I removed it with OPI lacquer remover.  </li>
            <li>I have spent so much money on different nail products over the years with no changes in my nails</li>
            <li>I use a white stick under your nails and it looks like a professional French manicure.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Those who have peeling soon after use are for the most part using it alone or with only one or two thin coats.</li>
            <li>I like the product for the most part BUT was not happy when I walked into my local drug store</li>
            <li>The first week, the tips began peeling a little on day four</li>
            <li>but after 6 months of getting Shellac, my nails started to break easily and be weak.  </li>
            <li>Any other hard as nails product would have to be better than this.</li>
            <li>, the pink color is a weird, almost neon pinkish lavender with really bright white tips...</li>
            <li>I bought some clear and French nail polish from Blue Cross Beauty Products while visiting Hawaii quite some years ago.  </li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t plug a product, but this one is worth recommending.</li>
            <li>- I have never had a problem with the polish peeling off unless I apply in the day and use hot water within a few hours.  </li>
            <li>Its worth 4-5 dollars but no more.</li>
            <li>if it doesn&#x27;t peel or scratch off on the first day of applying after its dried for hours and from repeatedly washing my hands</li>
            <li>I am 49 years old and have NEVER had long nails!  </li>
            <li>I usually put 3 coats on right away</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to sculptured nails, badly, so I haven&#x27;t been able to have pretty nails like my friends and family members that get theirs done...</li>
            <li>You just brush on and let dry completely.</li>
            <li>background: I have thin, easily breakable nails that peel and turn up</li>
            <li>I have always had thin brittle nails that split and break easily</li>
            <li>Within a few weeks I could determine a positive difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had gel nails for 7 years and my real nails were a mess when I took them off.  </li>
            <li>this is not true because it&#x27;s absolutely nothing like the salon gel nails.</li>
            <li>It may have helped slightly, but not any better than any other similar product that is a lot lot cheaper than $10.98 for a little bottle.</li>
            <li>It is totally clear, your nail beds do NOT look pink at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear with a pink tint.</li>
            <li>In the box there were 2 bottle of Pink Armor, 2 bottles of clear nail polish and 2 Manicure sets which by the way look cheaper than a set you can purchase at the 99 cent stores.</li>
            <li>like I had been doing, I applied 1 coat of pink armour and a clear topcoat.</li>
            <li>It looked clear but when I went outside, it has a neat pink sheen.  </li>

            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used&lt;br /&gt;Never had so many compliments on my nails.  </li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful nail polish, treatment I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> And today the gals at my ladies luncheon asked how I managed to keep my nails looking so nice!</li>
            <li> so I tried this product and am thrilled with my results!</li>
            <li> came to Amazon and purchased three bottles of this miracle nail polish and gifted one to my best friend.  </li>
            <li> They are strong and in amazing shape!!!!</li>
            <li> Bright</li>
            <li> Years ago, I did acrylic and loved the length and design options, but it destroyed my nail beds.</li>
            <li> So that might be a good approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> use Sally Hansen cuticle oil (cheap and the best of all I&#x27;ve tried) and take biotin for nails, hair, skin (Costco).</li>
            <li> I just know that my nails look soo good</li>
            <li> I wish I could give a good review</li>
            <li> But once it arrived, I loved it and use it often.</li>
            <li> Loved it.  </li>
            <li> I HAD USED IT BEFORE AND FOUND IT TO BE AS GOOD AS I REMEMBERED.</li>
            <li> my nails look good?</li>
            <li> My nails so good</li>
            <li> It is so good</li>
            <li> My nails were gorgeous ...</li>
            <li> , my nails still look really good.  </li>
            <li> for the good things-First-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very happy customer and hope this item is always available.  </li>
            <li> I have heard good and not so good from others.</li>
            <li> Which is good for me.</li>
            <li> Not as good as vinylux</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a week and have loved the way my nails feel.</li>
            <li> I loved the \\&quot;look\\&quot; of the Shellac</li>
            <li> My nails look good and feel good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is great to have pretty nails &amp; toes, &amp; the best is they seem to stay healthy even after you take the polish off!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve researched the nail gel trend, and although having polish that does not peel sounds awesome, is it worth ruining your nails for?</li>
            <li> I have been very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I am glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I have never been so pleased!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased, I stocked piled some bottles!  </li>
            <li> For me, this stuff is magical!</li>
            <li> I hope they keep making this stuff because I like it even better than a gel manicure from a salon!</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this product my nails look lovely and no chipping, peeling or yellowing!</li>

            <li> I decided to get a bottle and do it on my own.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d like to say that they are nice nails now.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly nice color - Bottles are always misleading because the color you see is not quite how it&#x27;ll be on your nails.</li>
            <li> I was in awe at how nice the nails looked.</li>
            <li> the end of the day, to each their own,</li>
            <li> and I am more than happy and satisfied with this</li>
            <li> /&gt;haven&#x27;t seen the infomercial, so did my own thing:</li>
            <li> and she really liked it.</li>
            <li> as soon as they started looking good one or more would break &amp; i would start all over.</li>
            <li> Nice pinkish color when applied, but did not get any additional hardened protection.  </li>
            <li> I think this is a good substitute, although it does cost more.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products over the years to strengthen my nails and to make them look good.</li>
            <li> Telling me how nice they looked.</li>
            <li> Was looking forward to good results after seeing many commercials on TV.  </li>
            <li> I never heard anything again about my order and to be honest</li>
            <li> was on they  own website</li>
            <li> but my husband did remark at how nice it made my nails look.</li>
            <li> it is a nice nail gel</li>
            <li> I bought three bottles in case I liked it and couldn&#x27;t find it again.</li>
            <li> without success.&lt;br /&gt;After 9 months of trying to grow my own....</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my honest</li>
            <li> This stuff is the absolute best!</li>
            <li> My husband does my nails, he was an Esthetician/manicurist and had his own salon until he retired and found this product for me.  </li>
            <li> I really liked how it made my nails look, and it did make them feel stronger.</li>
            <li> This is a nice treatment for nails</li>
            <li> kind of flu like, but no fever.  </li>
            <li> In 4-6 weeks my nails have some length and have never been this nice on their own.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome, have bought it for years and will keep buying it as long as it exist,it is great for your nails</li>
            <li> If you want your nails growing super fast and looking great, go get yourself some Perfect Formula nail polish.  </li>
            <li> My nails are strong, healthy and look great.</li>
            <li> This is a good nail protector, but it&#x27;s NOT as strong as gel.</li>
            <li> I figured I could easily refund it if it wasn&#x27;t any good.</li>
            <li> Your nails become very strong and tint color gives nail beds</li>
            <li> When I have this polish on, my nails are very strong.  </li>
            <li> This product did not stay on my nails and peeled off very easily.</li>
            <li> My nails are strong, smooth and beautiful.</li>
            <li> They look more amazing than they have in years.</li>
            <li> My nails are beautiful for the first time in years.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best product I have ever used to grow my natural nails.</li>
            <li> It was great the first day, the colour is really nice</li>
            <li> sooo easy to take off!</li>
            <li> and my nails grew out -- strong!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t submit very many reviews but felt strongly about this</li>
            <li> this polish is so so strong!</li>
            <li> However, I will say it is very shiny and bright and does look good from that stand-point</li>
            <li> I find this to be a good, cheaper alternative to the perfect pink gel from Sephora.</li>
            <li> but my nails look pretty great now.</li>
            <li> very cheap price</li>
            <li> I find it very cheap at bed bath and beyond with my 20 percent coupon</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for keeping your nails strong and makes polish last for so many days!</li>
            <li> Nice looking nails, strong and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very good to use under a professional manicure.</li>
            <li> so I thought one more time</li>
            <li> Better than going to a nail salon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plan to purchase more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased better products from Sally&#x27;s or Ulta.</li>
            <li> Tried this in hopes it would protect my nails better.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Hard as Nails&amp;#34; from any drugstore would work as well or better.</li>
            <li> ok i did order this product from someone else</li>
            <li> i am sure you will see some results</li>
            <li> Glad I heard about PA and like others said....</li>
            <li> Now they are longer, smooth, and have a nice finish to them.  </li>
            <li> I use this as a top coat for my at-home manicure every two weeks.</li>
            <li> Better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It was all they said it was and more.</li>
            <li> took awhile to get but love the product</li>
            <li> Just ok.</li>
            <li> also wanted to add that when I removed this polish, my nails seemed to be more drier and brittle.</li>
            <li> I got my nails done at the salon for many years and it completly ruined my nails.  </li>
            <li> However, the results of 1-2 coats is actually a really lovely &amp;#34;step</li>
            <li> with some adjustments in how I use the product, I might find I get even better results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll look much better when you have no lines or cracks in your nails.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> is a site with healthy polish:&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Life saver for sure.</li>
            <li> FOR THEM TO GROW OUT MORE</li>
            <li> those years we have tried so many things for her.</li>
            <li> ; rarely has a good association in our books...</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s able to put nail polish on them again.</li>
            <li> decided to take the plunge and soooo glad I</li>
            <li> u better do it..</li>
            <li> Just love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I could not be more pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this polish.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff...</li>
            <li> and hard!!!!I love the color</li>
            <li> My 3 favorite things are: 1.</li>
            <li> With Nail polish it is even more noticeable.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My nails are now showing more curves .</li>
            <li> I love this product and feel better about wearing my rings instead of hiding my hands</li>
            <li> As for the whitening not so sure but longer and stonger</li>
            <li> Asking me what I was doing and where could they purchase the product.&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sandra</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> I have not been able to grow my nails out in years unless I use a gel type polish.  </li>
            <li> Ok</li>
            <li> It hardens just like the ones from the Salon, Just put a layer a day to get better results.</li>
            <li> Once you try it you will love it.</li>
            <li> Also I wore some nail polish with this as a top coat for over a week</li>
            <li> love that the Nail Armor price doesn&#x27;t break the bank</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Shellac and love the look but</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many layer I applied because I would add one when I thought about it.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s helping more than than hurt.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS</li>
            <li> I can get two weeks or more out of my polish now.</li>
            <li> I might have to touch up the tips after a week or more</li>
            <li> I will no longer need to pay for manicures and can maintain lovely looking nails myself.</li>
            <li> But, overall, this is a beautiful polish and reccommended to all! :)</li>
            <li> While my nails were damaged when I stopped, most of that damage was gone in about a year.</li>
            <li> Under medium indoor lighting, my nails look healthy...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed my nails do look better, and seem to be stronger.</li>
            <li> home online shopping is more my style</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> My nails dont seem any better with it than it  </li>
            <li> I thought the word &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; suggested it would be thicker and add more to my nails</li>
            <li> Or put the money you are considering spending on this product toward a better one.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> I  love this nail polish</li>
            <li> but I must say that I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li> My review is not based on which of the two is better.  </li>
            <li> All I know is that the one from Sephora is more</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 bottles, the shipping expense was greater than the item.  </li>
            <li> Then I used this product and my nails looks healthy than ever.</li>
            <li> Hansen nail growth for many years</li>
            <li> it will do some damage, to your healthy nails</li>
            <li> Enjoying health nail and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> When washing dishes or doing anything that requires you to have your hands soaking a lot, it&#x27;s always a better to wear gloves.</li>
            <li> and my nails were still splitting at the top of my nail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used more products that I can remember, in attempts to strengthen them.  </li>
            <li> I plan to purchase more.</li>
            <li> Others that I know that have tried it, love it.</li>
            <li> I type 10 hours sometimes more a day.  </li>
            <li> , my nails look healthy.  </li>
            <li> It is thicker than most polish</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I do not know what will happen when the peeling gets to the top of my nail bed</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to strengthen them....</li>
            <li> The product does what it says it will do, and my nails have never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how my nails look but it peeled after the 2 days of applying.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months, and, if anything, my nails are more brittle than before.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t believe my nails were even more beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was just ok.</li>
            <li> you can also put your favorite nail polish over it as well.</li>
            <li> My nails look better and stronger and are growing.</li>
            <li> It helped me get rid of my split nail which lasted for more than 10 years and according to doctors, couldn&#x27;t be cured.</li>
            <li> i love this product.</li>
            <li> It is okay for a couple of days</li>
            <li> I just love the look of my nails with this stuff on.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> and it was lovely...</li>
            <li> They look 100% better -</li>
            <li> I like many of the others here never saw the tv ads for this but saw it in the store in the &amp;#34;as seen on TV &amp;#34; section.</li>
            <li> I also love the feel of my nails.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Sally Hansen does a better job of hardening the nails.  </li>
            <li> i love this stuff</li>
            <li> VERY speedy delivery and great product</li>
            <li> but oh well, just try it yourself and find out, dont take my advice if you dont want it, but you should buy this product somewhere like walmart where it&#x27;s more affordable that way</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have had extremely healthy nails</li>
            <li> all of my life (so healthy that people always asked what I used on my nails), until 2 years ago when I got gel Shellac Nail polish in a salon.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 2 months and see great results my nails have not broken or snagged since I started to use it.</li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> My nails are lovely.  </li>
            <li> Nausea, headache, stomach ache, diarrhea -all of those symptoms and MORE are indicated in formaldehyde allergy.  </li>
            <li> Conditions nails better than Sally H. products.  </li>
            <li> Love It!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> yes, but I would assume that since it filled in the cracks and splits my nails will be able to grow without catching on stuff and ripping.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> it looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle and absolutely love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim and my nails have grown for the first time in years!!!</li>
            <li> - they all do a beautiful job of brightening the nails, but the problem with most of them is that they peel off in sheets after some kind of water exposure, especially after showering or swimming.</li>
            <li> I applied it immediately and was very excited with results.</li>
            <li> I thought my beautiful healthy natural nails had been doomed forever.</li>
            <li> I like the nice clean glossy look.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this product, I thought I was getting a good deal at two bottles for the price of one.  </li>
            <li> Best product I have bought in a long time.</li>
            <li> I am happy to report that as of day 5, I am applying the product under the tips of my newly grown nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product has great advertising but doesn&#x27;t live up to</li>
            <li> Keeps them strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> I used to use Loreal Grow Strong but haven&#x27;t been able to find it for years.</li>
            <li> this product keeps the nails strong somewhat,but not as i expected,you have to use it more frequentlythan advertized by the advertizer</li>
            <li> every 2-3 days , they are strong healthy looking,people don&#x27;t believe I do it myself.</li>
            <li> Pink Armor is especially effective for restoring damaged nails after many years of using gel/acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I bought it at Walmart the 1st time i paid $10 and loved it so much i bought another one</li>
            <li> If it peels off the tips because of dishes, cleaning, etc, I just apply more to the tips and it is fine.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this polish is that it dries quickly!</li>
            <li> Product is very good, do dishes and not have to redo your nails like with regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m definitely happy with it so far.  </li>
            <li> so far this has helped a great deal.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Clear, pretty, and works great!</li>
            <li> I love holding them to the light and admiring them like some vain teenager.</li>
            <li> PINK ARMOR nail gel is the best nail stuff i have used.</li>
            <li> I can say this was the best $10 that I have spent.</li>
            <li> And most importantly it make my nail look</li>
            <li> I think it is more important that I warn people that this could happen.  </li>
            <li> This Pink Armour is great!</li>
            <li> This is the best nail polish/ hardener that I have ever had that is long lasting and beautiful.</li>
            <li> This product is not at all as good as it is advertised to be and the price is way to high!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really looks good on my nails.</li>
            <li> Really suprised how good it is.</li>
            <li> After using pink armor for a week my nails looked excellent and strong.</li>
            <li> If she touched her nail or bumped it it would split and she was in significant pain and discomfort for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> But under bright lights and sunshine (I live in Arizona!)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your nail stronger, easily peels off.</li>
            <li> They still break too easily.</li>
            <li> It dries very quickly, BUT---</li>
            <li> It does not strengthen your nails and chips and scraches off easily.  </li>
            <li> Peeled off my nails easily</li>
            <li> and it dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> You will see results very very quickly.  </li>
            <li> and my nails have weakened, splitting easily.</li>
            <li> No breaking, splitting, or bending easily as before.</li>
            <li> This stuff dries VERY quickly</li>
            <li> My nails started to grow out very quickly and stronger</li>
            <li> It stays on well and comes off easily.  </li>
            <li> My nails have always chipped and peeled easily.  </li>
            <li> My nails take a beating at work and break easily.</li>
            <li> Removal was easy, Acetone remover..</li>
            <li> The cost sky rocketed from $10 to $30 very quickly &amp; out of frustration I hung up.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and dries within 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> This product makes my nails stay strong and not peel.</li>
            <li> I found that this did not make my nails as strong as I would like.  </li>
            <li> My nails have never been so strong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought sally hansen strong as nails, bought her a garlic nail polish that promised to cure her ailments, took her to get nail treatments and nothing...</li>
            <li> but it did make them strong.</li>
            <li> My coworker saw my nails and asked what have I been using and why are my nails do strong.</li>
            <li> and you could feel immediately how your nail are protected and strong.</li>
            <li> I have never had strong nails ever.  </li>
            <li> I would polich them to keep them strong but because I type all day my nails will crack and break.</li>
            <li> and I can see that my nails are shining and strong.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve searched for products that promised they would make my nails strong and they haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My nails are now strong and the peeling has ceased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid more for the special nail stuff.</li>
            <li> Back to beautiful nails.</li>
            <li> I recently had my nails done at the salon - UV activated gel tips - it looked beautiful.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li> Fine to use as an undercoat for your polish.</li>
            <li> Best product that I&#x27;ve tried of this type, and costs less.</li>
            <li> Great for my nails, My nails are long an healthy.</li>
            <li> I now have strong nails and enjoy doing my nails at home.</li>
            <li> As a top coat, super efficient.</li>
            <li> Stay on for a long time and the nail looks good!</li>
            <li> Is this really the answer for easy and nice looking nails?</li>
            <li> long, strong and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I tried Pink Armor over a month ago and am THRILLED to finally have a wonderful full set of my own nails.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s huge.</li>
            <li> I also want to mention that it protects my nails from breakage and has made a huge difference in the growth and strength of my nails.</li>
            <li> But I honestly have never had such amazing nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> liked how it makes nails look more natural though...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product once a week and saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li> but so far I am more impressed than anything I have bought in the last 8 years!</li>
            <li> I wonder if that is what makes it light up.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> The reason I state this is because this review is going to sound like its paid for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Her praise for this product was so great that she went to their site to leave a personal review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nails stay strong and clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried gel nails, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect some polish in a bottle to work like the gel that needs to be baked in the UV light.  </li>
            <li> I think this is a great product especially for my customers who do not like color on their nails.</li>
            <li> On the otherhand, this doesn&#x27;t really promote nail growth, but it makes it look really nice.</li>
            <li> get one free and</li>
            <li> if you ordered that day you also received a free manicure set.</li>
            <li> It felt just like gel polish, smooth and shiny -</li>
            <li> Smooth, shinny, and</li>
            <li> , it filled in the cracks and splits)</li>
            <li> No polish I have ever used is this smooth.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely the best nail strengthener/hardener/long lasting gel polish I have ever used.</li>
            <li> After drying my hands I went into a room that had lots of light and was really pleased with the fact that my nails still had that fresh painted look, heck they almost looked like they were still wet!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My nails looks beautiful and I have never had nails this long without breakage.</li>
            <li> So far so good, after a week.</li>
            <li> With this product my nails have grown so long and beautiful people stop to compliment my nails.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> so far so good</li>
            <li> they are long and beautiful</li>
            <li> My nails stopped peeling and have grown so strong, healthy and pretty.  </li>
            <li> I finally have strong nails - and they&#x27;re my own!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Dries quickly too so good for busy working moms like me!</li>
            <li> So when I saw this, I am pretty sure I made an audible scoffing sound.</li>
            <li> which is pretty good being that your nails go through so much in a week.</li>
            <li> Thanks to years of taking glucosamine/chrondriton/msm, I have very strong nails.</li>
            <li> They had a special, buy one get one free of anything in that aisle, so I thought, why not?  </li>
            <li> I now use Burt&#x27;s Bees cuticle cream (love that stuff!) and have generally healthy nails that go through cycles of strength, likely reflecting my nutrition and stress.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the soaking that destroyed my nails.</li>
            <li> First time used and glad to find it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product</li>
            <li> you for such a nice invention!</li>
            <li> I never expected my nails to look as good as they do so soon.</li>
            <li> first I put it on top of the Sensationail gel (that I couldn&#x27;t get off)....</li>
            <li> I love it so much, I bought 6 bottles and another 3 for my sister-in-law to try!  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try it as I have a permanent split in two of my nails</li>
            <li> love, love, love this stuff - my nails have actually started to grow using this.</li>
            <li> I do not want my polish to last 2 weeks - I like to change color more than that - but always liked the shine and the no chipping.</li>
            <li> It does have a nice pink sheen to it that looks nice and natural.&lt;br /&gt;10/1/13  </li>
            <li> I DO hand wash dishes without gloves and work in the yard without gloves and clean the house without gloves.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Application: Once a week I use an enriched nail polish remover to clean it up and repaint.</li>
            <li> So clean.</li>
            <li> I also tried similar products-but this is by far the best!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used so many products, went to numerous salons to get acrylic and gel nails because I felt my nails would never grow on their own.</li>
            <li> I love the way Pink Armor makes my nails look bright.</li>
            <li> March 22: ok this stuff is pretty awesome :) it has lasted me a little over a week and ten times better than any nail polish that ive ever used in my life.</li>
            <li> However, I have two coast on right now and all my nails feel rather strong, which is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Applies VERY easily and dries super fast - Super yay for this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to soak or do anything special to remove it weekly.</li>
            <li> nothing special.  </li>
            <li> I typically use OPI polish but wanted to see how this did on a lower priced polish and Color show has some great spring/summer colors out right now:)</li>
            <li> Was bummed out but quickly became excited when I found it in CVS.</li>
            <li> they could break easy at anytime when they get in the  Certain length I find couldn&#x27;t find any Solution to stop it!</li>
            <li> I never really had great nails to begin with</li>
            <li> mY NAILS ARE HAPPY WITH THIS PINK ARMOR.  </li>
            <li> At first the nails just looked great (same as Sally Hanson)</li>
            <li> Instead they actually looked really, really good.</li>
            <li> But even if you don&#x27;t think it helps your nails,  you should try it just for the cool look your nails will have.</li>
            <li> Lasts a full week without re-application.  </li>
            <li> Mostly nail polish peels off, so I don&#x27;t do it very often.  </li>
            <li> Good product, especially for an infomercial find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard and read too many horror stories about nail gels to ever try the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Now, if its supposed to go on and hold up like true salon cured gel, then I don&#x27;t think this is the stuff to do it.</li>
            <li> I agree with the folks who said they loved the look especially in the sunlight, and how quickly it dries.  </li>
            <li> Strong enough to put your hands in a bed of rocks, which out the worry of chipping a nail&amp;#34; but honestly what woman would do that.</li>
            <li> i have put new 2  coats on each week &amp; have  long - strong and  beautiful nails</li>
            <li> Now my nails are strong and pretty.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have strong lucious nails in the first place...</li>
            <li> I can put it on quickly and close it up</li>
            <li> I can apply it quickly just about anywhere.</li>
            <li> and I will have to do a quick touch up before I go to work.  </li>
            <li> and I will have to do a quick touch up before I go to work.  </li>
            <li> It stays on, wears super well!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product works wonders and I have been able to maintain nice nails since I started using pink armor.  </li>
            <li> the nail would peel off and would tear to the quick ...</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call the color fluorescent but more light pinkish unless I&#x27;m in blue light where they are almost lavender.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because it isn&#x27;t the concrete barricade for the nails that the name suggests, but overall I am very glad I made this purchase!</li>
            <li> My nails do have a pinkish tone, look very healthy, and my nails are soooooooo long right now!</li>
            <li> My nails no longer peel or split, and finally at 41 I have a beautiful set of NATURAL nails.</li>
            <li> few years ago I tried the gel polish fad at the salons with a great deal of hope.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s concentrated in the bottle, so that bright pink color was a bit off-putting to me.</li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth the $10.00.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to grow my nails because they are to soft.</li>
            <li> claims on most of the bottles...not the natural stuff.</li>
            <li> WOW am I glad I did.</li>
            <li> thinning and damaging them to the point where it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> That was fun having nails I could use as screwdrivers(ha).</li>
            <li> But I have most definitely made more progress in the last 9 months than I&#x27;d been able to do in 10 or 12 years</li>
            <li> and I will use Gellous instead, a much better nail strengthener that lasts a good week at least.</li>
            <li> For the summer I do my own white tips and use this over it.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Then I put on a  clear sealing top coat that I use.  </li>
            <li> When this product first came out, I was hesitant to buy it and wondered if it&#x27;s claim to grow your nails was in fact true.  </li>
            <li> my nails have NEVER looked better in my young</li>
            <li> But I do love the way this makes your nails look so pink and healthy.</li>
            <li> When used as directed this actually does strengthen you nails nicely.</li>
            <li> So far I love this product and would buy again.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s rare</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the product entirely or partially, I love what introducing this to my life has done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend completely.</li>
            <li> So the product would peel off &amp; I could never enjoy a nice looking manicure for more than a day or two.</li>
            <li> Just developed fungus under one of my long beautiful nail.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it was virtually free, after the 2nd day, I bought another bottle to make sure I don&#x27;t run out, ever.  </li>
            <li> About 2 years ago, nail polish began peeling and chipping off the day after I applied it, completely off most nails within 4 days.</li>
            <li> My nails were destroyed after getting a gel manicure for a wedding.&lt;br /&gt;After buying this product I put a fresh coat on each Sunday.</li>
            <li> Overall looks nice and works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Sally Hansen product, as well a others, but I&#x27;ve never had success with those.</li>
            <li> but they looks so good with just the pink armor that I stick to that.  </li>
            <li> The Pink Armor is a good product for the nails and toes.</li>
            <li> I saw this product in Walgreen&#x27;s and thought it worth a try.  </li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t reapply every day--maybe just once per week, and then do a fresh coat every week.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the look of natural nails as the product claims.</li>
            <li> I got this product cheaper at Wal-Mart and thought I would try it and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> it makes my nails real strong and lets them grown long.</li>
            <li> There are so many other products that work so much better.</li>
            <li> I type all day at work; this is the first time ever I have had to trim my nails because their length interfered with my ability to type as quickly as I do.</li>
            <li> It dries quick, stays on, does not peel, looks pretty.</li>
            <li> After I remove the polish I wash my hands with warm soapy water and use an old toothbrush to scrub them clean (a little toothpaste on the toothbrush works wonders to keep your nails healthy and clean).</li>
            <li> do like the way my nails look after painting them with pink armor, but as the saying goes, if it sounds too good to be true then it probably is.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be able to open a can of soda with your tip</li>
            <li> But even for a short period of time, it appears this is at least as good as a very good strengthening polish and possibly as good as a basic gel, all without the time commitment, costs and potential damage.  </li>
            <li> look goo; nails on right hand don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I have about 7 or 8 coats on right now</li>
            <li> I try this item right away</li>
            <li> Darn right they do.</li>
            <li> I bought this but didn&#x27;t use it right away.  </li>
            <li> My package came right on time about 3 days from my order date.</li>
            <li> So my salon applied a &amp;#34;miracle product&amp;#34; they said would &amp;#34;fix me right up&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> On both the polish appears to have just peeled right off.  </li>
            <li> I do my own French manicures and it lasted me a whole week!</li>
            <li> For the first time in probably 10 years, I actually look like I have a nice manicure.  </li>
            <li> My mother, who has the same kind of nails (thanks for the genes, mom!) could not get a result out of this.</li>
            <li> (although it&#x27;s not the cheapest either, but it&#x27;s way more affordable than Dior) &amp; that it&#x27;s readily available at most local drugstores (as well as here on Amazon for almost the same price).</li>
            <li> I wanted to add, there is something in the ingrediants that when I put my nails under a UV light to dry, they light up like neon!  </li>
            <li> After several applications my nails looked and felt super healthy.</li>
            <li> last week I was actually able to have a French manicure for the first time in too many years to count!  </li>
            <li> The first night I came home with it, I applied 3 coats to my nails and was amazed at how quickly my nails dried and looked so good.</li>
            <li> Love it, cheaper than the other brand n just as easy to use.</li>
            <li> Its not available in a lot of colors yet, but you can always put a coat of your favorite color on top of it.</li>
            <li> Add also the fact that the pink color is great to wear when you want a natural look.</li>
            <li> I am a 70 year old woman with easily split nails, with ridges. .</li>
            <li> Because of their attractive natural look I wore Pink Armour alone.  </li>
            <li> My nails have always been soft and easily broke.  </li>
            <li> - This is a HUGE one because most &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; claims are going to come with a high price tag that isn&#x27;t just financial.</li>
            <li> it dries VERY fast.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it really helps to keep nails stronger or not, but it goes on smoothly, dries fast, and leaves a nice purplish pink hue on your nails.  </li>
            <li> am going to say that I am very impressed with the fact that I did my nails about 2 hours before bedtime and was surprised that my nails did dry in a very short amount of time.  </li>
            <li> Nails are strong with nice shine and natural pink color.</li>
            <li> I have had a big toenail that consistently split down the center since I injured it as an aerobics instructor 20 yrs ago.&lt;br /&gt;After using this polish for several weeks on my toes, the nail is perfectly healthy (no split!!), &amp; I have a perfect 10 toes again.</li>
            <li> After that I tried a huge variety of polishes meant to strengthen and protect natural nails, including whatever Sally Hansen had to offer.</li>
            <li> Pink Armor is amazing.</li>
            <li> some kept my nails better than others but it was still a daily application.</li>
            <li> and it gave my nails a nice pink colour which shows up when you go out in the sunlight</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Both seems about the same for strengthening, but THIS ONE is much better at stopping splitting and getting rid of ridges.</li>
            <li> After trying many products, I have finally found one that works.  </li>
            <li> Works as well as the higher priced gel.</li>
            <li> BUT with Pink Armor I know have nice nails.</li>
            <li> It held up pretty well all things considered.</li>
            <li> First, it does NOT make your nails look as advertised on TV or in ads.  </li>
            <li> I love this and couldn&#x27;t find it locally</li>
            <li> This peeled the first time I took a shower, the morning after applying it.  </li>
            <li> I have gone back for two more bottles and will be using this product for years to come.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m usually very picky!</li>
            <li> and this one does exactly that!&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> the first time I used it as I said before it was a couple of hours before I went to bed.  </li>
            <li> Just because I love nail products I would probably purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because it does make my nails pretty,</li>
            <li> The nail restorer works exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> So I looked up pictures of peeling nails and sure enough my nails looked just like the pictures.  </li>
            <li> It performs best alone with 2 to 3 normal coats (after a lite buff to reduce ridges) or as a base coat then two light color polish applications and then a generous top coat.</li>
            <li> I use this as a top coat on my french manicure....</li>
            <li> It dries SO FAST!</li>
            <li> I noticed her nails looked so healthy and ask where she got her last manicure.</li>
            <li> It definitely makes the nail look really healthy.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Pink Armor for just over a month now, changing the polish each week, and I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li> I do believe it makes your nails not only look healthy</li>
            <li> I keep bottles of it and if you add enough layers under or on top of polish you can sometimes peel it off without having to use remover.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s likely that I&#x27;ve been more aware of the damage to my nails, and that thinking has made my nail usage to be gentler.</li>
            <li> I love this type of optical brightening nail product &amp; have tried many different kinds, from very low end</li>
            <li> Yes it does make your nails look pretty and the beds pinker and the tips</li>
            <li> I have ordered several more bottles</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve been wearing this for about 2 weeks now, and for me, I do like this polish over others I&#x27;ve tried recently.</li>
            <li> Pink Armor has enabled me to have my own nails.  </li>
            <li> With that being said, this is not the first time that I have let my nails \\&quot;breathe\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> However this is the first time that I have let them \\&quot;breathe\\&quot; and the nail product has helped to make my nails stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First off-</li>
            <li> When I first began using it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it for only a couple of weeks, and so far, I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do as it claims to make the nails look pink or the tips look whiter, but it gives them a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> Love Pink Armor Nail growth I have bought several of this item, bought one for my daughter for Christmas and she is thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> She used to have very yellow nails-now they look healthy.</li>
            <li> I tried many different types of products claiming miracle results to no avail.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t enhance the whites of your nails like the higher priced gel formula.  </li>
            <li> At first, my nails peeled a bit, but I kept using it any way.</li>
            <li> I applied 3 coats the first time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my first compliment yesterday</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> love this product definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> it goes on really pretty and makes your nails shiny.</li>
            <li> It really makes my nails look like I just walked out of the salon with a fresh manicure.</li>
            <li> I will definitely use more of this product.</li>
            <li> but I can attest to my own use of Pink Armor Nail Gel polish.  </li>
            <li> It DOES give my nails a \\&quot;pink\\&quot; tone, almost flourescent in color but that color is more noticeable when I am outside in the sunlight.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway this product did exactly what the Box said it would.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> I wish I could buff then out a little more to be smooth right now.</li>
            <li> This is the first and only product that has given me absolutely long beautiful strong nails with white tips.  </li>
            <li> They are strong &amp; hard &amp; have grown to a nice length.</li>
            <li> but now, they&#x27;re long and beautiful and this gives the right tint of pink.</li>
            <li> To my amazement, my nails looked bright, pink and new.</li>
            <li> My one frustration is the nail beds are healthy and the cuticles are decent when I remember to care for them, but the nails never stay nice consistently and definitely never get long.</li>
            <li> so I took the bottle with me and while my husband was driving I quickly applied a fresh coat over the old one.</li>
            <li> I also LOVE the color very nice pink pale.</li>
            <li> know there are many who will simply believe this is an isolated case (and it might well be) but it is worth doing a test on one finger (maybe a pinky) for a free weeks to see if you have a similar reaction.  </li>
            <li> I usually re-do my nails every week , this polish really makes the French manicure look awesome!  </li>
            <li> but with 1 or 2 coats of Nail Armor they come alive with a perky, fresh, youthful, clean, healthy pink glow that looks natural, &amp; particularly vibrant in bright daylight &amp; sunlight (this product will also glow white under blacklight).</li>
            <li> Mine are better for sure but not as hard.</li>
            <li> For repeat applications I always take off the old coat and clean my hands.</li>
            <li> I have very brittle nails that are constantly splitting and will not keep nail polish on for more then 2 days.</li>
            <li> I had hopes that this gel would be as good as the more expensive brand, but it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li> You can get \\&quot;Pink Nail Magic\\&quot; at Sally&#x27;s for $7.99 and is a far superior product.</li>
            <li> I feel pretty certain</li>
            <li> my nail became discolored and scratched from too much coloring, my sister bought for me this pink armor gel, it does really make nail look better and shinier, and its good defence to layer your nail before put on other nail color.</li>
            <li> So I decided to go natural again and used a special polish (Nailtiques/Nailtek) to repair the damage.</li>
            <li> At this point, all I am looking for are nice looking nails that have a little white tip and look healthy.</li>
            <li> and I have Never Been able to Grow my nails long.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and natural!  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to see the Pink Armor Nail Gel be available on-line, since my local WalMartt store seemed to be out of it permanently.</li>
            <li> Try to go without polish for a few weeks and you will be very pleased.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s subtle, and most notable in sunlight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Three months later her nails are long and healthy and strong.</li>
            <li> You can apply it to the whole nail and it automatically make the fleshy part of your nail look more pink and the tips look more white.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t wear colored polish, my nails look healthy, shiny and they are long!</li>
            <li> On day eight, I removed the polish easily, and again painted two coats as described above.</li>
            <li> But it comes off easily with regular polish remover.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for several weeks and my nails have never looked this good or been this long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this will make your nails strong enough to grow.</li>
            <li> This product is the easiest way to have a beautiful, natural manicure with the least effort.</li>
            <li> I have my hands in dishwater ever single day (more than once)</li>
            <li> I bought this from CVS purely for use of the color.</li>
            <li> I am not able to use too many nail products as I am sensitive to many chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I took off the acrylics and in just a few short months, I have beautiful real nails.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used this for over a month now and for the first time in my life, my nails are long and strong.</li>
            <li> I actually only take it all off, ( with regular nail polish remover), when I start to see a good amount of new nail growth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest, I also began taking 2 capsules of gelatin daily not long afterwards as well.  </li>
            <li> advice is to file, buff, and shine your nails first with any tool you can find (Revlon has a decent one) and paint your nails with this afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had pretty nails, but as I got older my nails became brittle and split all the time.</li>
            <li> While I do agree the price is very HIGH, it doesn&#x27;t affect the performance of the product, so it does not affect my rating.    </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have as much durable staying power as the ones mentioned above, but it will generally last me a good 5 days of vigorous wear &amp; tear throughout my work week, with only minor chips (I keep my nails very short), especially if I wear it under Dior Gel Coat (my favorite strong top coat that has a lot of endurance).</li>
            <li> right after I using it I started notice something my nails starting to grew very out quickly and stronger</li>
            <li> My nails do grow fast on their own but this makes them grow just a little bit faster.</li>
            <li> The other great thing about it is that it makes your nails go from yucky yellow to a beautiful pale pink.</li>
            <li> my niece Bob this and told me it has really worked on her nails and her nails are stronger and longer</li>
            <li> I will let you know if it really does the job for me</li>
            <li> I have put this product through the paces and found it to be very beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this time i buffed my nails before aplication and it lasted  about 3 days.so i decide to use it like twice a week for 4wks straight</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really have to</li>
            <li> Drys quickly, absolutely does not peep or chip and my nail feel stronger</li>
            <li> Thanks to this stuff...</li>
            <li> haha)</li>
            <li> Once again, it&#x27;s fast and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My nails feel so much stronger.</li>
            <li> too much and your nails will have a purple color to them, and look as though they are under a UV lamp.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> To my absolute shock, this stuff is a nail miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li> so much so that I turned to acrylics for a while.  </li>
            <li> Then I moved on to gel which was much easier</li>
            <li> But the combination has been very productive for me.  </li>
            <li> it brightens the whole nail and tips.</li>
            <li> I love the Pink Armor.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use nail polish and really have no nail \\&quot;problems\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> tHANKS</li>
            <li> really NOTHING</li>
            <li> I love Pink Armor.  </li>
            <li> I started by removing my french manicure, washed my hands and lightly rubbed alcohol on each nail before I started.  </li>
            <li> The formula really grows my nails.</li>
            <li> but it seems to be working very well protecting my nails from chips.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every reasonably priced,(under $15),</li>
            <li> so much so, that when I go to get a pedicure, I am repeatedly asked by the nail techs if my nails are mine, and when I tell them yes, they want to know what I used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how to rate something that is in this category</li>
            <li> If it changes, then I&#x27;ll put it on this website -- thanks</li>
            <li> I fell in love with Pink Armor for a while.  </li>
            <li> and I really use my hands.</li>
            <li> Chipped really fast.</li>
            <li> Pink Armor gives your nails a nice, healthy pink glow with a professional look, as the end result.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> really like this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> This product has really helped my brittle nails to thicken and harden.</li>
            <li> One of the reasons I like this product is you do not have to use acetone to soak the product off, it dries fast and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> This is like a gel manicure straight from home.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I needed a nail fix anyway and figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> it really the product?</li>
            <li> I found another brand in The Vermont Country Store catalogue that really  works.</li>
            <li> This is one product that really helps my nail to grow.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> My nails are growing and look much healthier.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Pink Gel Coat for years because I love the look on my nails (pinker nail beds, whiter nail tips)</li>
            <li> Many people compare this product to one sold by Sephora called Pink Gel or something like that.  </li>
            <li> The seller is fast and reliable.</li>
            <li> I can finally really grow my nails out</li>
            <li> This product really works.  </li>
            <li> The manicure lasts the whole week &amp; never chips.  </li>
            <li> This product is for real.</li>
            <li> I very</li>
            <li> Fast and efficient delivery.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m even growing out one nail that is very damaged and never grows well.</li>
            <li> They were still a bit bendy but so much thicker and stronger.</li>
            <li> Thanks nail armor.</li>
            <li> and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for somewhere to write a review because I really like this.</li>
            <li> The Pink Armor nail gel is okay.</li>
            <li> I love the Pink Armor nail gel.</li>
            <li> My nails look much brighter.</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> it really works, try it and see for yourself please wash hands and nails before use as</li>
            <li> I was ready to give up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d pay 4 times that much......</li>
            <li> recommend this product to anyone who wants to take care of their nails.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I had to put one coat every day, and its washing off vert fast</li>
            <li> Really grips nail surface.  </li>
            <li> As a nurse, hands in water and gloves all the time, this really helps.</li>
            <li> My nails are very shinny like salon gel finish.  </li>
            <li> The soaking and scraping of my nails really threw me off..</li>
            <li> , I am also going to paint them with maybelline color show in coral crush and use Pink Armour as a top coat.</li>
            <li> I tend to have rather white tips naturally, so even without effort the result is lovely.</li>
            <li> so I can wear it a few more days before cleaning them off and reapplying three fresh coats.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my daughter to try and her nails were amazing in just two weeks or less!  </li>
            <li> Has a pretty pink shade and keeps my nails strong and shiny.</li>
            <li> Does not stay on long, chips easily.</li>
            <li> I also do like the light pink tint it gives my nails when I just want a natural clean look.</li>
            <li> My nails have never been this long and strong.  </li>
            <li> This product is truly a blessing to my nails and they have been able to grow.&lt;br /&gt;The color is a very light pink, just a little brighter than the nail pink of healthy nails.</li>
            <li> You have to put it under top edge of nail (just as the other techiques say)</li>
            <li> and I put more on every other day.</li>
            <li> This product, along with CND Solar Oil nourishing treatment and CND Cuticle Eraser, has brought my nails back to their original health and vitality.  </li>
            <li> I love this product,comparable to other but for 1/3 of the price.</li>
            <li> where other polishes won&#x27;t, a 5 because my nails do look better, and a 3 for the color</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product to help my manicure last longer.</li>
            <li> It has helped better then other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Also completely by accident, I found out it gives off a nice white kight under a black light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid as much for decent nail polish.</li>
            <li> I once used to enjoy and ordered my first bottle of Pink Armor Nail Gel.  </li>
            <li> a clean french manicure look</li>
            <li> I think that was the main reason for so much damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All of my nails are nice &amp; long at one time &amp; have been so for quiet</li>
            <li> The Nailtiques line was decent enough for the original repair work, but I couldn&#x27;t be bothered to keep applying</li>
            <li> My nails weren&#x27;t the best to begin with (thin and would curve under when long) but they didn&#x27;t peel!</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> As long as it is available, I&#x27;ll keep buying it.  </li>
            <li> But last winter I decided to really concentrate on getting back the healthy nails</li>
            <li> honest  - for  past 3 weeks  </li>
            <li> I appreciate that the bottle is the customary 1/2 ounce size that all nailpolishes used to be, whereas nowadays many companies are scrimping down to 1/3 ounce &amp; raising prices.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was never able to grow my nails, but now that I am  using Pink Armor, my nails have grown and are nice and strong.  </li>
            <li> that products live up to their hype but this one really does.</li>
            <li> My nails are very ridged, so I lightly buff them, file them, then apply the Pink Armor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I HAVE ALMOST FINISHED HALF THE BOTTLE AND LOVE THE WAY</li>
            <li> In less than a week the splitting stopped and my nails looked healthy.</li>
            <li> The Sally Hansen products work much better for less money.</li>
            <li> PINK GEL COAT works far better.  </li>
            <li> tint).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to find that Pink Armor doesn&#x27;t peel off instantly either!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying the look of this product even more than my expensive Dior Nail Glow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more clear than pink.</li>
            <li> Today I have 1 more completely naked nail and one 1/2 naked nail.  </li>
            <li> never have i ever had anything close to decent nails.</li>
            <li> You can apply several coats quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love the color, a pink manicured clear look.</li>
            <li> This is the only formula I have tried in many years that actually delivers what it promises.  </li>
            <li> I actually think regular polish would work better.</li>
            <li> I was in the process of removing my gel nails which made my real ones very soft.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it begins to peel after your very first shower, especially upon the edges of your nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recomment  this produce to anyone having problems growing nails.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly \\&quot;hands down.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> And more simple than other techiques that have you putting 5 coats on in the first sitting.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure, that I have little time to spare.</li>
            <li> Its not that good as I expect, it works but very very slow, so</li>
            <li> First let me start by saying my nails are pretty healthy, decent length and occasionally break in the most inconvenient place.</li>
            <li> started with clean, dry damaged nails 5 days ago.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think that wasn&#x27;t too much to ask, but so far it has been!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had my 20% coupon ready for action that day.</li>
            <li> I put on this nail gel to clean dry nails....</li>
            <li> about the 4th week i forgot to remove it mid-week and noticed after 7 days if my nail bumped something it would break off like a chunk of concrete.</li>
            <li> which makes my husband happy since it is expensive, Lolllllll.</li>
            <li> light pink.. hides chips...</li>
            <li> Love the clear pink, it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li> Normal smell</li>
            <li> I love it and recommend it to anyone having trouble with brittle nails.</li>
            <li> If I owed a nail shop, I would stock this as my secret weapon for successfully transioning those clients requesting to go from gel or synthetic nails, to natural.</li>
            <li> it was fantastic for the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li> You cannot rub your freshly painted nails in a pile of rocks and expect it not to scratch- come on who actually believed that anyway.  </li>
            <li> Love this but it wont last long.</li>
            <li> This was no different than putting on a topcoat and it didn&#x27;t keep my nails from splitting, Kind of expensive for a top coat .</li>
            <li> well worth the ten dollars you pay</li>
            <li> I LOVE that I can apply the polish in minutes, with no complicated rules, and have it dry fast enough to move on to the next &amp;#34;mom-ergency&amp;#34; without scraping off polish or messing up my nails.</li>
            <li> Which brings me to the next issue:  this states it comes off easily with regular nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li> It dries super fast, by the time I am done with the second hand the first is already dry.</li>
            <li> I will put it on the in the night and it would peel right off the next day ....</li>
            <li> I never had strong nails in my life and now have to file them down every week to keep the growth under control.</li>
            <li> well worth the cost as others with problem nails can probably back me up for spending small fortunes to get healthy nails.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little pricey, and I don&#x27;t know that I would have noticed results at all if I were trying to grow my nails out &amp;#34;super long&amp;#34;, but overall, I think that this product did a nice job.</li>
            <li> I had planned to go out on New Years Day</li>
            <li> Never had any come off, just added another layer or two after the new growth started to peek out.  </li>
            <li> Dries quick, lasts much longer than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This made my nails stronger in just a few days and 2 months later my nails are amazing.</li>
            <li> I will be back for more pink armor gel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick to dry</li>
            <li> She it worked as expected and that she would like to get more in the future.</li>
            <li> I slap on one coat of Pink Armor, two coats of my favorite nail polish (Revlon or Avon) and one coat of Pink Armor as a top coat and let them dry in UV lamp for at least 3 minutes or more.  </li>
            <li> Pink Armor allows me to have pretty nails for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> the nails are pink and the white looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I removed Pink Armor from my nails last night and already feel better today.  </li>
            <li> I was not planning on getting them done again and was really upset to see how much damage was done to my nails in a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Had another manicure and used this as a base and top coat, and my nails never looked so good.</li>
            <li> It is good to use for a base and top coat.  </li>
            <li> I just sat here and read about 30 reviews and while most are positive, I was a bit surprised at the negative ones.  </li>
            <li> I have very soft nails and have always worn acrylics.  </li>
            <li> Key is to keep using it consistently.</li>
            <li> My nails were splitting more than usual.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just like a regular clear tint of nail polish that you can find at the drugstores for much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to really like this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> funny... nails on left hand</li>
            <li> I used it daily for the first wk then took off and reapplied on a weekly basis.  </li>
            <li> People are always looking for that &amp;#34;Miracle Product&amp;#34; that will do EXACTLY what the tv commercial says it will do.  </li>
            <li> I applied two coats for the first time and about 30 minutes later went and hand washed come cups and silverware that were in my kitchen sink.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised Amazon would offer this!</li>
            <li> This product hardens and protects only when wearing the product (but still works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was initially skeptical &amp; I&#x27;m glad this turned out to be a great product (for me at least).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done the dishes, some yard work, housecleaning, computer work, and NOTHING happened to my manicure - it looked the same as it did the first day</li>
            <li> but first I try a  different  </li>
            <li> Since I began using this product I actually have pretty nails</li>
            <li> and wow!</li>
            <li> I use a colored nail polish first, and then put the gel on last.  </li>
            <li> First it was just a couple, but now all of them have peeled and are painfully short.</li>
            <li> I definitely saw an improvement during the first 2 months  of use.  </li>
            <li> So far its working for me!  </li>
            <li> Was so excited when I finally ordered it but only for a hot second.</li>
            <li> It performs exactly the same and is a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Also leaves them with a really cool pink hue.</li>
            <li> It makes my nails hard and strong!</li>
            <li> For me, after only 4 weeks of use, my nails are once again strong, and long!  </li>
            <li> I have recently been using the alcohol wipes to clean off any oils prior to applying polish and that has extended my polish wear by a day or two.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the brush detached from the top and every time I open it, I have to unstick the brush from the bottle and screw it back into the top.</li>
            <li> It does show a slight shade of pink on your nails but the tips are noticeably whiter, I liked the color...</li>
            <li> I was told the next morning I couldn&#x27;t cancel &amp; was quickly harassed with phone calls about extra costs that were already in place &amp; would be charged to my card automatically?  </li>
            <li> They were so dry that I had to let me nails grow out before they looked right again.</li>
            <li> (Dior Nail Glow $24, it&#x27;s fantastic but very expensive...&amp; the most expensive of all is Perfect Formula Pink Gel Coat</li>
            <li> but I had enough of a free edge that was strong (as opposed to being cracked, splitting, peeling, broken which has been my norm for ages)</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products for my weak, soft nails, nothing really worked.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing it on tv and thought at the very least it would give my nails a nice finished look as they grew.</li>
            <li> it makes them look healthy and shiny &amp; they feel hard.</li>
            <li> You can buy a bottle of clear tint nail polish and you wouldn&#x27;t notice the difference.</li>
            <li> up&amp;#34; from clear polish.</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s basically clear also helps</li>
            <li> All this stuff is, is clear nail polish.  </li>
            <li> (so would clear polish).  </li>
            <li> only con I&#x27;ve found is that putting more than two coats of the Pink Armor nail gel on your nails makes for a very funky pink color.</li>
            <li> Go to Walmart &amp; buy clear coat for $4</li>
            <li> I use it because I like a natural look.  </li>
            <li> I moved on to natural nail approaches.</li>
            <li> Now being reasonable, this has only been a week.</li>
            <li> But considering the claim of &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;, I was ready for possible damage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the second bottle and really like this product.</li>
            <li> I  WILL Tell You I am 49 years old</li>
            <li> Today is the first time I am applying color along with it so cannot comment on how long color stays on using this.  </li>
            <li> I am a swimmer and have soft nail beds.  </li>
            <li> This nail formula has allowed me to grow my natural nails again.</li>
            <li> This has made them look healthier and natural.</li>
            <li> kinda takes away the \\&quot;natural healthy\\&quot; look.    </li>
            <li> My nails are no longer soft, brittle or peeling.</li>
            <li> It really works because I notice something about a week later.</li>
            <li> IT HAS HELPED MY NAILS, THEY ARE NORMALLY SOFT AND PEEL</li>
            <li> This item is used frequently.</li>
            <li> The polish stayed on in chipped for about a week until I had to take it off much longer than my polish regularly stayed on.</li>
            <li> and I have natural soft nail.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t find the Sally Hansen Clear Tint nail polish of old, every one is trying to do the nail gel thing.  </li>
            <li> What a big surprise this nail polish is, it really works for me.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> so idk how fast it makes your nails grow, but i will update on anything else later on.</li>
            <li> and I have a 3 year old, work, and go to school and workout.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, I didn&#x27;t see the commercial but this product has really helped me.</li>
            <li> Now I am not so self conscious about my nails while they are growing out naturally.</li>
            <li> Cheaper when bought directly from TV.</li>
            <li> Imagine, in only a few days, my nails had become healthy and stronger.</li>
            <li> This is the best base coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> A thick top coat like Dior Gel Coat works well to turn ridges into glass-like</li>
            <li> I have had very dry brittle nails that split right up in to the bed of the nail.</li>
            <li> I have also noted that the original polish was a very deep pink and the latest bottle has hardly any tint to it.</li>
            <li> Especially if you have a French tip white pen with a coat or two over it, the pink sheen, when outside, is soooo pretty and my nails are seriously strong, not bending what-so-ever, and getting long quick.  </li>
            <li> and when the 2nd hand is painted the first hand is dry and ready for another coat.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally strong nails &amp; although the product makes them pretty, 5 have broken since using the product.</li>
            <li> Oh my, when will my nails come back to normal?!?</li>
            <li> I was surprised that the texture is very much like the Blue Cross clear that I used years ago.  </li>
            <li> The simple clear (and the French top coats) that they sold were, in my opinion, as good as (and much less expensive than)</li>
            <li> It did dry quickly, but I still waited about 10 minutes before applying the second coat.</li>
            <li> I have in the past tried many different products to help with splitting nails,  so far this product is working.  </li>
            <li> The Pink Armor last as long as 3 or more weeks without chipping.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, it makes your nail shiny and tough to break, and much harder to chip !!</li>
            <li> and yes, this polish helps, but no better than a cheap bottle of clear polish you can buy anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I do not think that this makes my nails any stronger than normal nail polish definitely not as strong as actual gel nail polish that has to be cured with a UV light</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t peel like so many other Sally Hanson, Revlon, OPI and other salon products</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle at CVS, like others I&#x27;ve been loyal to Sally Hansen, the miracle growth with silk fibers specifically has worked well for years of on and off getting gel/acrylic nails, after this last time I swore off the fakeys and decided to grow out my natural nails again, saw the Pink Armor at my local CVS and thought what the heck, I had extra bucks</li>
            <li> My nails have finally grown to a decent length and stay that way.  </li>
            <li> The Pink Armour Nail Gel Polish has performed better for me than any other polish I have used of any price!</li>
            <li> I paint one hand then the other right away</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that this might finally be the answer to my problem nails.  </li>
            <li> but I have seen an improvement in my nails which are ruined from getting the Pink and White at my local salon (they do a fabulous job).  </li>
            <li> My nails were consistently peeling from biting, rough usage, and dishwashing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ive been ising the product every week with 3 coats.....its soo pretty and pink....</li>
            <li> After the first application??!!&lt;br /&gt;I kept it on for 5 days as the instructions read - the Pink armor did not peel or chip during that time - and I work a lot with water and chemicals.</li>
            <li> The secret to its best performance is to use it as a base coat AND top coat.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to dent my nails at the edge because they were so soft and now they&#x27;re tough stuff!&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Blue Cross $3) to very high end</li>
            <li> (I tried one new product and it was not the same)</li>
            <li> I really like this product and have bought two bottles in the last five months and am still using the second bottle.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product that finally got my very frail nails to strengthen.</li>
            <li> It worked in terms of polish actually lasting and my nails looking nice for awhile, but my poor nail beds were destroyed when I soaked off the polish.</li>
            <li> I use two coats as a base, apply a color, then use two more coats as a top coat.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my nails strong and thick.</li>
            <li> One bottle arrived empty but the other was fine.  </li>
            <li> I use it alone, with no other product.</li>
            <li> It has strengthened my nails and helped them to grow as no other product has.  </li>
            <li> no chips.and is pretty without any other polish .</li>
            <li> That wasn&#x27;t the case as I could barely even notice it on my nails after 2 coats!  </li>
            <li> will definitely continue to use this if for nothing else the quick dry time, week long staying power and pretty pink color.</li>
            <li> It left my nails pretty dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I reapply every other day and after 5-6 days or extra abuse I remove it and reapply fresh.  </li>
            <li> Even the little chips that were there at the tips  of my nails were smoothed out by just applying this fresh coat</li>
            <li> I lucked out and found this product on a clearance end cap at a Dollar General store for $7</li>
            <li> But when you open the bottle, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll clear the room like you would with remover or some of the gel products.</li>
            <li> This is the same as a $.99 bottle of clear polish from a dollar store.  </li>
            <li> Upon removing the polish it became clear that what had actually happened</li>
            <li> I barely use it nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I damaged my nail beds a while back from doing manicures too frequently.  </li>
            <li> I work in health care and wash my hands constantly, the Gel polish alone has lasted 5 to 7 days before I remove completely and start over.</li>
            <li> I really like the pink armor nail growth.</li>
            <li> Only time will tell if my nails return to an unblemished look.</li>
            <li> I got fast results from Pink Armor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product for nail growth/ anti-breakage but for a 2 minute complete faux french mani?</li>
            <li> ,it really does turn the nail bed pink and the whites are whiter</li>
            <li> Now it is directly on my bare nails.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny, especially when you consider that it cost no more than the nail polishes that I normally buy.was a couple of hours before I went to bed.  </li>
            <li> It is worth every penny, especially when you consider that it cost no more than the nail polishes that I normally buy.</li>
            <li> Pink Armor is the first product I&#x27;ve used that actually has made a difference in the strength and appearance of my nails.  </li>
            <li> The smalles downside, you have to be careful not to get bubbles in the application, but that&#x27;s easy to avoid if you&#x27;re slow and steady.</li>
            <li> while it does keep your nails healthy, using in on a nail with fungus seems to make the issue worse.</li>
            <li> My nails held up better with just the regular base and top coat.</li>
            <li> It was great at first, but one of my nails broke and I realized my nails were peeling and cracking very badly.</li>
            <li> I even applied it in the car recently and by the time I drove to the store, I had NO worries about it being dry and ready to go.</li>
            <li> Obviously the number of coats you apply with affect dry time, but 1 coat dries almost immediately and 1-2 is still very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Polish peels off after a few hours, or if you&#x27;re lucky, the next day.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that it does have a strong smell.</li>
            <li> At first I thought the scratches might be due to the orange stick I used to push my cuticles back</li>
            <li> and it really worked for me, so i would suggest to other people give it a chance as i did....</li>
            <li> I had yellowish brittle nails due to too much nail polish use.</li>
            <li> Right now my nails are such a mess from a thyroid problem</li>
            <li> (takes about 5-10 minutes that includes both hands and dry time) then one coat every other day just to keep it fresh looking.  </li>
            <li> and the whites start far before the tip of my nail, likely because I bit my nails when I was younger.</li>
            <li> Suddenly I began noticing what looked like white scratches on my natural nails when I removed it with OPI lacquer remover.  </li>
            <li> I have spent so much money on different nail products over the years with no changes in my nails</li>
            <li> I use a white stick under your nails and it looks like a professional French manicure.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Those who have peeling soon after use are for the most part using it alone or with only one or two thin coats.</li>
            <li> I like the product for the most part BUT was not happy when I walked into my local drug store</li>
            <li> The first week, the tips began peeling a little on day four</li>
            <li> but after 6 months of getting Shellac, my nails started to break easily and be weak.  </li>
            <li> Any other hard as nails product would have to be better than this.</li>
            <li> , the pink color is a weird, almost neon pinkish lavender with really bright white tips...</li>
            <li> I bought some clear and French nail polish from Blue Cross Beauty Products while visiting Hawaii quite some years ago.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t plug a product, but this one is worth recommending.</li>
            <li> - I have never had a problem with the polish peeling off unless I apply in the day and use hot water within a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Its worth 4-5 dollars but no more.</li>
            <li> if it doesn&#x27;t peel or scratch off on the first day of applying after its dried for hours and from repeatedly washing my hands</li>
            <li> I am 49 years old and have NEVER had long nails!  </li>
            <li> I usually put 3 coats on right away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to sculptured nails, badly, so I haven&#x27;t been able to have pretty nails like my friends and family members that get theirs done...</li>
            <li> You just brush on and let dry completely.</li>
            <li> background: I have thin, easily breakable nails that peel and turn up</li>
            <li> I have always had thin brittle nails that split and break easily</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks I could determine a positive difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had gel nails for 7 years and my real nails were a mess when I took them off.  </li>
            <li> this is not true because it&#x27;s absolutely nothing like the salon gel nails.</li>
            <li> It may have helped slightly, but not any better than any other similar product that is a lot lot cheaper than $10.98 for a little bottle.</li>
            <li> It is totally clear, your nail beds do NOT look pink at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear with a pink tint.</li>
            <li> In the box there were 2 bottle of Pink Armor, 2 bottles of clear nail polish and 2 Manicure sets which by the way look cheaper than a set you can purchase at the 99 cent stores.</li>
            <li> like I had been doing, I applied 1 coat of pink armour and a clear topcoat.</li>
            <li> It looked clear but when I went outside, it has a neat pink sheen.  </li>
            <li> I apply a base coat of the Pink Armor, then a coat of a more opaque nail polish like Wishful Pinking, then a top coat of Pink Armor.</li>
            <li> decent stuff, can&#x27;t say whether it works better or worse than similar products, it does have a slight pink tint.</li>
            <li> (It doesn&#x27;t look like a gel manicure, the formula is very thin &amp; any ridges or imperfections in the nail will show through despite multiple coats, but the color is lovely.</li>
            <li> My nails were still weak and full of ridges.  </li>
            <li> I have never had nice nails (which is why I started fake nails) until now!  </li>
            <li> This is pretty odd for me and have not noticed it with any other products.</li>
            <li> I have thin, brittle nails, that will break and rip down to the bed without polish and chip with regular top coats.</li>
            <li> My nails were fine, just thin and would curl a bit on the end if I let them get very long.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE the way my painted nails look, they are pinkish (almost fluorescent) not sure if the whites are whiter but at least they do not turn \\&quot;orangeish or yellowish\\</li>
            <li> While not a super miracle, I&#x27;m finding that pink armour, which I have been using for 3 weeks, really has improved my nails.  </li>
            <li> The next day I applied a third coat and allowed that to dry 15 minutes before using my hands.</li>
            <li> They have always been very, very short and super thin.  </li>
            <li> At least it didn&#x27;t work the first week.</li>
            <li> That being said, I purchased my first bottle with common sense and not expecting the miracle that others seemed to be searching for.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Every time I find something that really works, it usually gets taken off the market or production is discontinues.  </li>
            <li> I really like this stuff I have had troubles growing my nails in the past</li>
            <li> and when i tried it i was furious, because it did not last long on my nails at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;4) Removes well with regular remover - I appreciate this because I don&#x27;t have time to monkey around with soaking</li>
            <li> I actually file my nails because they grow too long, not because they break.  </li>
            <li> It hardenes you nails, giving them a long lasting shine and duresse.</li>
            <li> I had flat nails like men.</li>
            <li> actually grow so long that I have to cut them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again this is a review of Pink Armor not Pink Gel from Sephora.</li>
            <li> They were a mess until I started using Pink Armor--it really works.  </li>
            <li> Best result with very thin Pink Armour coat, only one, then very thin color coat.</li>
            <li> last very long.</li>
            <li> A few days later, I tried to deliberately break one of my nails that had become so soft after removing the acrylic</li>
            <li> What some people don&#x27;t realize is that when  you have long nails there are some things that you simply just can not do, that is the price you pay for having long nails.  </li>
            <li> I have been using only pink armor for two years now,people ask me if I just had a French manicure</li>
            <li> This can be removed with normal nail polish remover ( I do use acetone based remover not sure if Non acetone remover would work the same)</li>
            <li> Recently, I purchased the last package of the Pink Armor Nail Gel from the Walgreen&#x27;s in my neighborhood.  </li>
            <li> I typically stay away from everything but basic manicures on my natural nails, I did however decide to try a Gel manicure (on natural nails) a few months ago and found the removal process to be a nail damaging nightmare.</li>
            <li> what not, it usually peeled off the very first day from just a little scratching.</li>
            <li> right now I am afraid I will take to much</li>
            <li> I washed my hands thoroughly, leaving them to air dry for at least 15 minutes, then applied the first coat.</li>
            <li> In less than 2 weeks my bare nails are stronger, almost &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; and have grown enough that I have to file them!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put on plain base coat/top coats before for a &amp;#34;natural look&amp;#34;, but nothing makes my short stubby hands as beautiful as this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Last longer on nails than other similar producs ( nailtique).  </li>
            <li> The formaldehyde ingredient really pushed my rating down, and don&#x27;t think people should use this without researching a little bit.</li>
            <li> Your nails don&#x27;t turn yellow like the usual clear</li>
            <li> To the negative reviewers, I think you might be using too much, it will peel if over applied.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from cheap to expensive nail hardeners to try and improve them, all without any luck.</li>
            <li> it really does what it says it does, I am elderly and it is common for my age groups nails to split and peel.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend Pink Armor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never writen a review before but pink armor has helped not only my nails grow, but it keeps my polish on for a week!</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change is removing the pink tinge.  </li>
            <li> Will be buying for a long tme.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re so long.</li>
            <li> Pink Armor has only peeled off 1 time since I have used it.  </li>
            <li> It may be because I put on multiple coats and then got my hands wet</li>
            <li> I have always had difficulty growing long nails, they would grow but crack &amp; peel all the time.</li>
            <li> I have never had long nails and ever since using this product</li>
            <li> my nails are long</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd week using Pink Armour</li>
            <li> My nails no longer peel or bend as long as I&#x27;m wearing this.</li>
            <li> but now I can&#x27;t wait to find an excuse to show them off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my experience, the only products that don&#x27;t peel off with water exposure are Dior Nail Glow (pink optical tint) &amp; Zeva Nail</li>
            <li> I spent all of last summer wearing Dior Nail Glow exclusively &amp; now I find myself choosing Nail Armor all the time instead.</li>
            <li> Now that I learned what I did, I am back to Pink Armor.</li>
            <li> they get too long</li>
            <li> It took a long time for me to receive the product</li>
            <li> A co worker of my saw the TV commercial for Pink Armor and told me about it.  </li>
            <li> I received an email saying Pink Armor was on back order 2 days after I placed my order.  </li>
            <li> so this is a review of the product NOT the actual pink armor official site.  </li>
            <li> They are growing well and the pink armor makes it look like I almost have a french manicure.</li>
            <li> Then I remembered the forgotten bottle of Pink Armor at the back of the cabinet.</li>
            <li> My nails which are usually long and whitish in color</li>
            <li> The only drawback would be the pink color.  </li>
            <li> I recommend Pink Armor to anyone who has the same problem.</li>
            <li> I finally discovered Pink Armor and within 2 weeks, saw a difference.</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> It does not stay on as long as gel Shellac.  </li>
            <li> I did not order Pink Armor via phone or internet but bought at my local Target store.  </li>
            <li> It fills in ridges and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> she told me for the first few applications take it off after just a few days and reapply it so that is what I&#x27;m about to do</li>
            <li> This Pink Armor Nail Gel is a poor product, full of damaging ingredients to your nails.  </li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of Pink Armor and tried it out the first time with one coat, (it is quite thick)</li>
            <li> After using Pink Armor polish for one month my nails had grown longer than they had in years without breaking, and the white dry lines were gone.</li>
            <li> The trick is that you must apply a minimum of 3 coats the first time and then keep adding every other day to build up the hard gel layers.</li>
            <li> i mean really.</li>
            <li> When that happened, it took too long for nails to dry.</li>
            <li> If you already suffer from every other nail polish peeling off your mail, don&#x27;t expect this to be any different.</li>
            <li> It chips off like any other, especially if you have to put your hands in water for any length of time.  </li>
            <li> I take off the polish every other week and start over with the same process.  </li>
            <li> tried various other gels and strengtheners to no avail.</li>
            <li> I have finally found a nail polish , other than Gel polish, that stays on my nails.</li>
            <li> Took a really long time!</li>
            <li> I have long nails again!</li>
            <li> I had the same peeling/chipping problem as some other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I applied several coats, and removing it took a little elbow grease (or something stronger than regular nail polish remover).  </li>
            <li> If you can find a little white pencil for under your nail tips your nails look french tipped.</li>
            <li> As for any other benefits, such as stronger nails, I didn&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li> Two coats initially, then one coat every other day.</li>
            <li> about a few days later i found pink armour nail gel on discount at dollar general.....</li>
            <li> Any other product, I would have multiple breaks (not just one).</li>
            <li> I constantly wash my hands in water or do dishes and other things and</li>
            <li> Hope they make this product for a very long time.</li>
            <li> My nails don&#x27;t dry out and look damaged when the polish is removed.</li>
            <li> It is so glossy it looks like it still isn&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li> I then let that dry for two hours before putting my hands in any water.</li>
            <li> I either use two coats and let dry under the UV lamp.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product that really works for my thin, brittle,  peeling nails.  </li>
            <li> It does start to peel after a few days, but I expected that because I use alcohol-based sanitizer on my hands frequently at work.</li>
            <li> It chips very easily, peels off which then takes some of a weak nail with it, and it is very thick.</li>
            <li> I was using a similar product at $30 a bottle, this product does the exact same thing, only less expensive.  </li>
            <li> : take it off after one week, let nails breathe overnight, then put on a single coat.</li>
            <li> I normally do not fill out reviews</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on as long as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased SO many things to try and help my nails - and at this point am very skeptical of any claims.  </li>
            <li> however I don&#x27;t want another person to become a victim</li>
            <li> My nails resisted breaking as long as the pink armour was on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using Pink Armor as long as they are making it.</li>
            <li> I looked down &amp; had a \\&quot;naked</li>
            <li> The polish also leaves a pretty pink tint while making your nails tough &amp; healthy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always had weak nails that split and crack when they reached a certain length.</li>
            <li> But if you want a fabulous base coat or stronger, smoother, shiny natural nails, then this is your product!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;Nails do seem slightly stronger only when painted.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> My nails peel in layers half way back on the nails</li>
            <li> the next day half of it was gone.</li>
            <li> and I play sports where regular nail polish chips in less than a day.</li>
            <li> so I put two coats of Pink Armor and let my feet dry in a UV lamp.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on using this product for a long time to come, especially if I can find it for that price again (less than a bottle of OPI!)</li>
            <li> I missed the 5 day mark and another nail grew under my nail and now my nail is a big mess..</li>
            <li> I have been reapplying when it suggest to, and my weak, brittle nails have become much stronger.  </li>
            <li> Also the color has only a slight pink color.  </li>
            <li> The nail underneath is extremely thin (a level above the skin) and very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> the quick dry time, week long staying power and pretty pink color.ands and base coats and even a salon manicure peels off in a few days unless it is the UV cure Gel polish).</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to give my nails a little extra strength.</li>
            <li> They have short, little beds and are not much thicker than tissue paper.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m hard on my nails with frequent hand washing.</li>
            <li> so I spent my $10 at Walgreens</li>
            <li> and I have had pink armor on for almost a week</li>
            <li> will continue to use Pink Armor.  </li>
            <li> A lady at walmart told me about pink armor.</li>
            <li> Pink armor nail gel.</li>
            <li> I used pink armor for a month as directed.  </li>
            <li> I tried pink armor for two weeks, and my nails immediately started splitting and peeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week, I have continued to reapply, but it keeps peeling off my jail in one peice.</li>
            <li> enhance the pink color of your nails.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line on Pink Armor-</li>
            <li> I tried Nailtiques for 3 weeks with minimal effect.</li>
            <li> Within a month my nails were stronger and harder.  </li>
            <li> I bought Pink Armor over a week now from the Office Depot.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because I didn&#x27;t see anything that resembled pink on my nails</li>
            <li> I also used the Pink Armor by itself, and it does make my nails look shiny.  </li>
            <li> I read a couple of reviews where people said Pink Armor had caused their nails to peel.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give pink armor</li>
            <li> With each coat it seemed to get harder and harder</li>
            <li> The Pink Armor was recommended by a friend.</li>
            <li> I saw Pink Armor on tv and thought about trying</li>
            <li> so I thought I would try Pink Armor.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Pink Armour for about 2 months.  </li>
            <li> Only been using this for a few days, but I already see a difference in my nails.</li>
            <li> Pink Armor Nail Gel helps so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took off my tips and my real nails started to grow but were paper thin.</li>
            <li> I went to get a manni and pedi and had them use my Pink Armor nail polish</li>
            <li> B00B8Z2LRQ Pink Armor Nail Gel</li>
            <li> I like the pink sheen on the nails.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s a pain to apply it everyday and remove it every week, especially it</li>
            <li> I saw the Pink Armor and decided to give it a try.    </li>
            <li> Not really as described/advertised.</li>
            <li> After taking off my acrylic nails, I tried Pink Armor.  </li>
            <li> found Pink Armour in a pharmacy and doubted for 1/3 the price</li>
            <li> &#x27;s how I used Pink Armor.  </li>
            <li> I had to use acetone to remove the Pink Armor and re coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Pink Armor.com offered buy one bottle for $10</li>
            <li> it was the Pink Armor Order.</li>
            <li> I called the Pink Armor customer service and was told there is nothing they can do</li>
            <li> , this is a scam do not give Pink Armor.com</li>
            <li> the pink armor is the answer I try get it on tv</li>
            <li> Instead of applying 2 coats of pink armour</li>
            <li> /&gt;The pink color</li>
            <li> and I consider myself rough on my hands.</li>
            <li> not really thinking it would work</li>
            <li> I cleaned my nails, and put on 2 coats of the Pink Armor.</li>
            <li> I applied Pink Armor and have not have 1 breakage in my nails since.</li>
            <li> I bought pink armor because my nails were breaking.</li>
            <li> I assumed it was the nail polish lifting from my finger and so removed it a few days later to to reapply.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to give Pink Armor nail gel a try.</li>
            <li> I do my nails twice a week and Pink Armor lasts well between applications.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pink Armor for four months.  </li>
            <li> I have seen some improvement with my nail, but not the results that I expected.</li>
            <li> And the finish does not show as pink</li>
            <li> I had \\&quot;acrylic\\&quot; and \\&quot;pink gel\\&quot; nails put on for 25 years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;And then I found PINK ARMOR.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> tried Pink Armor Nail Gel - for a fraction of the price of salon nails.</li>
            <li> B00B8Z2LRQ Pink Armor Nail Gel</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of Pink Armor as a gift.</li>
            <li> Glossy pink tinted gel-nail finish.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to cancel my card &amp; still got &amp; paid for the Pink Armor.  </li>
            <li> Pink Armor works great...for about a month.  </li>
            <li> I thought I might as well try Pink Armour since I needed something for my nails and have tried everything....</li>
            <li> After wearing salon hard gel nails for a few months my nails were thin as paper, discolored, splitting into the quick - in short: a total mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reminiscent of what you might have with a subtle french manicure.</li>
            <li> and I saw no results other than the pink shine.  </li>
            <li> The color is not exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> (he used to complain about how my thin nails would be particularly scratchy).</li>
            <li> My typical manicures are lasting longer than a few days.</li>
            <li> Pink Armor Nail Gel is not anywhere close to what the advertisement said it was!</li>
            <li> I have not had any chipping or peeling as stated in other reviews.</li>
            <li> I have to reapply about every other day to keep my Polish from chipping</li>
            <li> and it was extremely smelly.</li>
            <li> i recommend people go out to other places and buy this product as it has literally transformed my nail life.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t read the other reviews and I am not one to post them, but when I am searching I always read the reviews</li>
            <li> Unbelievable is one of the only words I can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> every other polish I ever tried chipped within 24 hours due to my bend-y nails.</li>
            <li> I add no more than that second</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t apply any other nail color because I wanted to see what it would look like alone and didn&#x27;t want my end result to be affected by another product.  </li>
            <li> Color me PINK!</li>
            <li> absolutely no chips for three weeks!</li>
            <li> I cannot say this about any other product I have used.</li>
            <li> It also does stay on longer than other polishes.</li>
            <li> like I&#x27;ve always wanted to without them breaking and cracking every other day.  </li>
            <li> But no soaking for 20 minutes like with UV cure gel polish, just put on a cotton ball and rub off like any other nail</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn it for over a week before and only had one small area that peeled away.</li>
            <li> I painted them twice a week and within about 10 days I actually had nails past my fingertips.</li>
            <li> I placed this item in my cart and accidentally removed it when purchasing a bunch of other items.  </li>
            <li> I convinced myself this was a fluke and kept in on my other fingers...bad move.  </li>
            <li> You then have to go through the polish and gel again due to the growth of your nails.  </li>
            <li> manicure is lasting longer than usually does</li>
            <li> It started peeling on day 1 and all I did was sit on the couch; so it can&#x27;t be said that I made it peel from washing dishes or doing other chores with my hands.</li>
            <li> PINK ARMOR NAIL GEL ROCKS!</li>
            <li> I even used a color over the polish and it seems to make the color polish last longer then usual.</li>
            <li> I have gotten these results with any other nail hardeners.</li>
            <li> I was in Ross the other day and saw this stuff for $6.99, I had seen the infomercials and decided why not...</li>
            <li> The reason I did not give it five stars is because I have only been using it a very few weeks..</li>
            <li> As other users mentioned, there is an odd pink color, but not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> I expected this product to be as hard as the gel nails just like the commercial advertises)--</li>
            <li> (I will not say this product is a miracle, I did have a nail tear last week but it was not as bad as my usual tears are, I reapplied the product and the nail is growing fine).</li>
            <li> I still used the Pink Armor as the base and top coat</li>
            <li> I have used this with my darkest color polishes that show chips immediately without the Pink Armour but with it as a base coat and top coat...</li>
            <li> I had my nails done at a salon and had them use the pink armor as the base coat and top coat as it advertises.</li>
            <li> It has not chipped and with the slight pink tint</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several weeks, and it actually made my nails worse.</li>
            <li> but this is the first time my nails have grown so long without ripping or tearing a crazy amount</li>
            <li> After coming back and seeing some of the other negative reviews, I was terrified to try to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I will admit, however, that I have never ued this product in conjunction with other nail polish, so I can&#x27;t say how it works as a base or top coat.  </li>
            <li> Approximately 2 - 2 1/2 weeks later I noticed a very slight white patch in the center of one of my thumbnails.</li>
            <li> There is a slight pink to them, but it&#x27;s REALLY slight.  </li>
            <li> but the Sally stuff always felt goopy and hard to apply or it simply didn&#x27;t do what I&#x27;d hoped it&#x27;d do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to work hard to get it off using regular remover, and even then, it was like there was still a softened layer on my nails that I had to scrape off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why so many people are giving this product bad reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not worth the money for the results, or lack of results I got.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Nail polish should also not be stored in the bathroom because of the changes of temperature but in a dark place.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money at all.  </li>
            <li> I can grow my usually brittle nails long now and no peeling.  </li>
            <li> This is really NOT worth the $10.</li>
            <li> I had fake acrylic nails on for about three weeks when I removed them my real nails  </li>
            <li> I know if I reapply pink armor a few times a week</li>
            <li> I use it as a base coat and a top coat every time I change my nail polish (about once a week).</li>
            <li> My natural nails were always thin, splitting, peeling, etc.</li>
            <li> I have used many brands and base coats and</li>
            <li> They chipped, broke and split far worse than ever before using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li> Got this at bed bath and beyond and used it as a base and top coat</li>
            <li> So I limit it to a base and top coat.</li>
            <li> I use this as a base coat then add my colored polish over top of it.</li>
            <li> The gel would peel off quickly, in some places, and then be impossible to take off in other places.</li>
            <li> I apply additional coats over my pale pink polish and remove and redo once a week.  </li>
            <li> i filed them all down</li>
            <li> I have even had to shape them down because they are getting longer than I want.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!!  </li>
            <li> I mean, who actually believes that you can rub your nails on a bed of rocks and not get a scratch.</li>
            <li> the goo thickens and is unusable after a few weeks (compared to every other polish or treatment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The next morning the finish was dented and chipped after had been dried and hard for 10 hours the day before.</li>
            <li> My bare nails look very dull &amp; blah</li>
            <li> can not believe all of the bad reviews,my nails never peel nor does the polish,it is worth every dime I have spent on it....</li>
            <li> I have a slight addiction to &amp;#34;As Seen</li>
            <li> In less than a month my nails are longer and stronger that they have EVER been.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could give it less than one star.</li>
            <li> They peel less, for one thing.</li>
            <li> But then... I bought this and used it diligently for about a month or a month and a half...</li>
            <li> The overall effect is subtle yet noticeable.</li>
            <li> I prefer to wear clear/clear-pink polish, but have been unable to find the darker pink tinted, clear polish in my area.</li>
            <li> Before using this product my nails were slightly brittle.  </li>
            <li> I paid 3 less at walmart.</li>
            <li> For a year and half, I went to my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; products with Sally Hansen.  </li>
            <li> When I finally decided to give up the false nails, my own were very thin, had ridges, and constantly split, to the point where they were painful</li>
            <li> My nails were splitting and breaking and now they are long and hard.  </li>
            <li> BUT NOW THEY ARE HARD AND LONG</li>
            <li> So not true.  </li>
            <li> Years of acrylic and shellac nails have destroyed my nails leaving me with ridges and a mess.  </li>
            <li> wore acrylics for many years due to awful natural nails that were too weak to grow.</li>
            <li> I have used just about every nail strengthener on the  market and sorry to say that Pink ARMOUR  appears to be no different than the other products,</li>
            <li> my entire life, im talking about damaged matrix hardly any nail!</li>
            <li> i have read some other reviews  on the other site and it was negative</li>
            <li> Helps my sad, old  brittle nails!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Put too little</li>
            <li> I noticed my nails got a bit stronger, less brittle, and less breaking and peeling - so that was an added bonus!  </li>
            <li> compleatly covers the little nicks and tears in your nails and protects them....</li>
            <li> For the past week, I&#x27;ve added another coat every other day, and I&#x27;ve had no problem with peeling, chipping, etc.     </li>
            <li> However, the corners of my nails do peel a little on occasion.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, no more Pink Armor for me!</li>
            <li> Strengthen and protect, my nail beds had a little lift and that is gone after three days.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Her nails are very hard after using it for several weeks.</li>
            <li> My nails don&#x27;t grow long because they are thin and sharp</li>
            <li> this really does seem to do the job and has helped to protect my weak, breakable nails!!</li>
            <li> bottle is not very aesthetically pleasing and is hard to keep a grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expected this product to be as hard as gel nails (</li>
            <li> I work at a fast food restaurant and cannot have artificial nails.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It was hanging on a shelf in a local CVS and it was approximately $10.</li>
            <li> Wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Just like when I were stockings I am not going to sit on a cement park bench because I know that it will destroy them.  </li>
            <li> My nails are thin, tend to be deeply ridged, and peel.  </li>
            <li> Had quite a bit of trouble getting the product here.</li>
            <li> I get quite a few compliments on my nails now.  </li>
            <li> Will redress this product in a few months to let you know what&#x27; s doing.  </li>
            <li> but now I know after reading information on the web, NOT TO WASH MY HANDS after taking the polish off but to put the polish back on using a THIN COAT...</li>
            <li> I use this with Revlon no light manicure.</li>
            <li> even a salon manicure peels off in a few days unless it is the UV cure Gel polish).</li>
            <li> I was shock, I  been has my hands in the water to wash dishes and do the house chores everyday a lot  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of money</li>
            <li> Before they were thin and broke constantly, even with polish or nail hardeners on them.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Soon after that I found my nails in the same poor condition.  </li>
            <li> I have had trouble growing my nails for years.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I will follow up with ya&#x27;ll in a few days or as soon as my polish starts to chip.</li>
            <li> I have since learned to put on 1 coat evey other day, allowing at least 4 hours before I get my hands in water, and it has never peeled again.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this product due to sum of the negative reviews&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not sure it is actually improving my nail health, or just creating a bit of a tough barrier.  </li>
            <li> But, not easy to find.  </li>
            <li> I have had trouble in the past with polish chipping and my nails splitting.  </li>
            <li> purposely did not wear rubber gloves for dishwashing, and I washed my hair 4 times during this 5 day period to see if the product would break down and peel as stated in the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> ,it doesn&#x27;t seems to for me because I have a very thin and weak brittle, they are very fuddle</li>
            <li> I could neither afford to keep doing such an expensive treatment nor to keep destroying my nails in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do thin coats and let it dry thoroughly in between.</li>
            <li> My natural nails have always been so thin and weak.... constant peeling and unable to  keep any length to them.  </li>
            <li> The ends of my nails chipped terribly after I put it on, much more than usual, and the stuff started peeling off after a few days.</li>
            <li> my nails have been thin and very flaky at the tips I have literally spent thousands of dollars on over the counter and Internet nail products some of them very expensive.</li>
            <li> I had acrylic nails for over 30 years and knew when I removed them I would have very weak and fragile nails.</li>
            <li> I swim everyday and even that hasn&#x27;t affected the rock hard finish it has created.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why people are giving it bad reviews they probably expect too much from it.</li>
            <li> today cleaned my hands thoroughly and there is one small chip on the tip of a nail.</li>
            <li> You can add another coat within minutes, but I usually add another coat each morning.  </li>
            <li> I Have Never seen this advertised so not sure what &amp;#34;they claim&amp;#34; it to do...</li>
            <li> despite other negative reviews, I must rave about this product!</li>
            <li> Usually when I do my nails at night and go to bed</li>
            <li> Usually when I do my nails at night and go to bed</li>
            <li> just disappointed it was for such a short time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> Nails still break and split as usual.</li>
            <li> In the past, they always broke before I had to trim them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I work in a small salon</li>
            <li> I usually remove everything once a week and start over.  </li>
            <li> I put 99% alcohol on a cotton swab and wipe my nails to make sure all oil is removed, then I paint them and it usually lasts a week without peeling off (I have had a terrible time getting nail polish to NOT peel off my nails</li>
            <li> No more gel manicure for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still do get small snags on the tips,depending on what I&#x27;m doing; but all in all, my nails are growing out as they did when I had shellacs on.</li>
            <li> Then I got lazy and did not reapply a coat even once a week</li>
            <li> She told me the secret: pink armor.</li>
            <li> I am a survivor of Acrylic Nail, Gel Nails, Shellac Nails, of which all those artificial procedures damage your natural nails.</li>
            <li> No more chipping, splitting, or breaking.  </li>
            <li> This is like a very, very thin coat of acrylic (like regular acrylic nails), but isn&#x27;t thick at all.</li>
            <li> Extends the life of the Revlon Gel manicure by days and days and my nails bad badf shape will peel with normal polish in one day</li>
            <li> I let it sit on my bathroom counter for over a month mad every time I looked at my Ten bucks wasted.</li>
            <li> the past, I&#x27;ve had acrylic nails, and this product is no way as thick as acrylic powder.  </li>
            <li> It was painful and now my nail is only half there..</li>
            <li> the SH Hard</li>
            <li> I also find that it does make the nails appear brighter, but that does dull after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> and my nails feel hard.  </li>
            <li> I tried Sally Hansen hard as wraps...and it peels off.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe, I didn&#x27;t think it will happen</li>
            <li> It was hard on my nails too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this is hard to scratch off unless you dig in really hard</li>
            <li> When I use Pink Armor as a base coat, I can put on 2 coats of any nail polish, and a week later I hardly have any chipped nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised there were a couple of bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> but remember your nails will not grow after one application try it  at least 4wks ...</li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s how it performs.  </li>
            <li> and I see growth at least two or three days after each application.</li>
            <li> Common sense tells you that it this nail gel did everything that the ad said then it would sell for 10 times what it is priced at.  </li>
            <li> For some leaving negative reviews, user error may be a factor, and no product will ever satisfy everyone.</li>
            <li> Rude customer service.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed that, at least not yet.  </li>
            <li> I have to dispute these negative comments.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews here.</li>
            <li> the negative reviews about it peeling off when you wash your hands, of course it will.</li>
            <li> Common sense.</li>
            <li> I personally am in LUV with the flourecent pink color it gives your nails, but hate taking an hour to take them off everyweek.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Your nails stay looking &amp;#34;just polished&amp;#34; for at least a week.  </li>
            <li> They look hydrated and the ridges have been reduced by at least 50%.</li>
            <li> I disagree with the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews of this product, using it for years and wouldn&#x27;t use any other.love</li>
            <li> I have nails that would peel (a common problem) and nothing I had used resolved this.  </li>
            <li> In the bottle it becomes too thick  to use after opening and having for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It will peel if you pick at it after you get on really thick</li>
            <li> putting it on too thick.</li>
            <li> If you lay it on too thick it will peel off.</li>
            <li> Now this stuff isn&#x27;t thick like gel, but it does work.</li>
            <li> I like this polish, it works and it doesn&#x27;t get thick before you get to the bottom of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Will continue to purchase and sing the praises of pink armour!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not very happy at all would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> and I mean ALWAYS peel and chip within 24 hours of application and c)</li>
            <li> &quot; if you paint your nails you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Definately recommend this product for anyone who needs to get their nails back after using fake nails!</li>
            <li> However, I started feeling progressively bad over the past several weeks...</li>
            <li> One of the splits was very small</li>
            <li> and it actually has the terrible opposite effect!  </li>
            <li> To my surprise this paints on thin like a polish but dries hard like a gel.</li>
            <li> I disagree entirely with the bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> Not good.  </li>
            <li> So sorry I wasted my money on this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered with ugly, thin, splitting weak nails my entire life.</li>
            <li> I read the raves of others saying this would help weak nails grow.  </li>
            <li> I have always had weak nails,</li>
            <li> I disappointed when it peeled off the next day after showering.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with weak, brittle nails that chip or splinter</li>
            <li> My nails are weak, split and have ridges.</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks!</li>
            <li> This alone does not have the strength to keep my weak acrylic damaged nails from bending and braking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and it has worked well on my weak, brittle nails</li>
            <li> I had weak brittle nails, after using Nail Armor for a week or two my nails were noticeably stronger.</li>
            <li> Im very hard on my hands and</li>
            <li> I am very hard on my hands and wash them all through the day.</li>
            <li> Please note, for me, when I take it off, my nails are still thin  and weak.</li>
            <li> My nails are thin and weak . .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!!</li>
            <li> but that i did not have the time to redo my nail as intructed by PINK ARMOR and my naills broke, crack, exfoliate, and even if you cut them it still bad  and not going to help.</li>
            <li> Did not help in fact it seemed to make my nails worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and not one nail has broken.</li>
            <li> My nails were worse after I used this product.  </li>
            <li> I am not happy.  </li>
            <li> I bought a few bottles because I am afraid it could be discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I eat poorly and have brittle nails, and I think this will help me</li>
            <li> It even wears well as a base coat under color to prevent yellow stains in my nails.</li>
            <li> The secret is to apply 2 coats at night time and then one coat every day for a week - then start all over again.</li>
            <li> In fact my Mom reminds me they&#x27;ve been paper thin since birth.  </li>
            <li> My nails have always cracked but a lot worse with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> This was total crap.</li>
            <li> They used to be thin and break a lot.</li>
            <li> But I need to wait a week or so before doing that my nas are so thin</li>
            <li> Then my nails started peeling worse than they did before, splitting, cracking, and breaking, worse than before using the product.  </li>
            <li> I used to wear false nails, now my grow</li>
            <li> From the looks of it, i wouldn&#x27;t give this product a bad rating because when i used any other brand of polish that was supposed to protect your nails and</li>
            <li> I have had weak nails all my life and always had fake nails, but tired of having fill-ins</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually have peeling problems with my nails but what a disappointment your product is.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a senior citizen and usually have very dry nails that always break and look awful.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the pink either by itself or with a base coat...</li>
            <li> I have been doing fake nails at home for a year and my nails were very weak and thin.  </li>
            <li> Would give negative stars if I could!!</li>
            <li> I tried at least 10 products, both inexpensive and very expensive, for over a year.</li>
            <li> have very weak, peeling nails.</li>
            <li> It is NOT SAFE!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive and did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Am sorry</li>
            <li> My nails look fake</li>
            <li> Skeptical was an understatement</li>
            <li> I decided I would give it another shot one night when I was bored this time I applied 3 coats to each nail while watching a movie.</li>
            <li> Expensive and did not do what it was supposed to, peeled off after 1-2 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My expensive nail polish still peels off when I wash dishes.</li>
            <li> I had to stop getting them done as it does get expensive</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> I have tried any number of products to help out my sad, sad nails.</li>
            <li> I felt like they must have sent the wrong bottle.  </li>
            <li> Scary to think that you buy a product to strengthen your nails</li>
            <li> Expensive, but I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I asked her why she got \\&quot;fake nails?\\</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to any woman who doesn&#x27;t want to use fake nails or go to the salon.</li>
            <li> I was so mad that I wanted to write the company a letter demanding they stop there false advertisement of this nail gel.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, brittle, cracking nails.</li>
            <li> Could be because I have very thin and tend-to-peel nails.</li>
            <li> I have very thin nails that peel like paper.</li>
            <li> However, my nails are very thin and brittle even though I take vitamins.  </li>
            <li> I hate being duped and don&#x27;t usually make hasty decisions on products I buy, however, my kids were fighting and driving me nuts in Walmart</li>
            <li> have really horrible, weak, brittle, thin nails.</li>
            <li> My nails are growing like crazy.</li>
            <li> I have used fake nails a lot!</li>
            <li> it works wonders, even with fake nail damage!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product despite some of the bad reviews it received.  </li>
            <li> I hope there is recovery here because my nails have never looked this bad ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li> so I ended up making a bad choice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the bad reviews, but this has worked wonders on my nails.  </li>
            <li> I have bad nails.</li>
            <li> i dont know why people are giving this product a bad review?</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I looked at the billing invoice.  </li>
            <li> but I image it will be painful.</li>
            <li> I purchased this nail gel for my horribly brittle/breaking nails; however it made them worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Cutting them does not help!  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed that none of them helped.  </li>
            <li> , what you can do is use it as a base coat.</li>
            <li> I put it for base and topcoat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It contains formaldehyde, I simply hate</li>
            <li> I HATE that.</li>
            <li> This stuff is crap.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crap.</li>
            <li> MY NAILS HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS BAD!</li>
            <li> I showed them to my husband and he was shocked and immediately said whatever you&#x27;re using, QUIT!  </li>

            <li> IWAR acrylics until 8 years ago. my nails have been thin and very flaky at the tips I have literally spent thousands of dollars on over the counter and Internet nail products some of them very expensive. some kept my nails better than others but it was still a daily application. my niece Bob this and told me it has really worked on her nails and her nails are stronger and longer so I thought one more time I&#x27;ll try another product so I spent my $10 at Walgreens and I have had pink armor on for almost a week I reapplied once or twice worked in my yard today cleaned my hands thoroughly and there is one small chip on the tip of a nail. she told me for the first few applications take it off after just a few days and reapply it so that is what I&#x27;m about to do I will let you know if it really does the job for me but so far I am more impressed than anything I have bought in the last 8 years! Is this really the answer for easy and nice looking nails? it may just be it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and it&#x27;s amazing! Keeps my nails strong and thick. Key is to keep using it consistently. Even when I have my gel on my nails i put some over the gel and under my nails so they get coated.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to pay for acrylic nails anymore. Within weeks,long strong,nails! Better than going to a nail salon.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love it, cheaper than the other brand n just as easy to use. Plan to purchase more when needed!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Lyn B</li>
            <li> Pink Armor Nail Gel is not anywhere close to what the advertisement said it was! I&#x27;ve purchased better products from Sally&#x27;s or Ulta. Tried this in hopes it would protect my nails better. It did not! &amp;#34;Hard as Nails&amp;#34; from any drugstore would work as well or better. Save your money!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product despite some of the bad reviews it received.  I am thankful I bought it.  I am on day 5.  I have put this product through the paces and found it to be very beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;I started with clean, dry damaged nails 5 days ago.  I applied 2 coats of product with drying time in between.  My nails were so short that I couldn&#x27;t apply the product under the tips.  I am happy to report that as of day 5, I am applying the product under the tips of my newly grown nails.&lt;br /&gt;I purposely did not wear rubber gloves for dishwashing, and I washed my hair 4 times during this 5 day period to see if the product would break down and peel as stated in the negative reviews.  This did not happen for me.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use Pink Armor.  It&#x27; a great product, and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> ok i did order this product from someone else and when i tried it i was furious, because it did not last long on my nails at all. I will put it on the in the night and it would peel right off the next day .... so i was going to throw it away but after a couple of days i decided to try it again this time i buffed my nails before aplication and it lasted  about 3 days.so i decide to use it like twice a week for 4wks straight and i must admit i did see a difference in my nails,they grew stronger and they was not chipping as they use to and it gave my nails a nice pink colour which shows up when you go out in the sunlight, what you can do is use it as a base coat. i have read some other reviews  on the other site and it was negative but i tried it and it really worked for me, so i would suggest to other people give it a chance as i did....but remember your nails will not grow after one application try it  at least 4wks ... i am sure you will see some results</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous ways that I found on the Internet that claimed to be like the shellac in the salon, without the curing. I do not want my polish to last 2 weeks - I like to change color more than that - but always liked the shine and the no chipping. None of the ways I tried worked. The next morning the finish was dented and chipped after had been dried and hard for 10 hours the day before. A lady at walmart told me about pink armor. I have never been so pleased! I do my own French manicures and it lasted me a whole week! Would have been longer but I toolkit off. I put it for base and topcoat. Did the white on my tips and just used the PA for over it. My nails do have a pinkish tone, look very healthy, and my nails are soooooooo long right now! They look more amazing than they have in years. Glad I heard about PA and like others said....sooo easy to take off! And more simple than other techiques that have you putting 5 coats on in the first sitting. You have to put it under top edge of nail (just as the other techiques say) and I put more on every other day. Don&#x27;t really have to but I just do. Great product!</li>
            <li> While not a super miracle, I&#x27;m finding that pink armour, which I have been using for 3 weeks, really has improved my nails.  I&#x27;m a senior citizen and usually have very dry nails that always break and look awful.  Now they are longer, smooth, and have a nice finish to them.  It is easy to use and, the best part, easy to remove.  And I think the price is great.</li>
            <li> Great to help nail growth. Doesn&#x27;t stay on as long as expected. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Helps my sad, old  brittle nails!  But, not easy to find.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Did not help in fact it seemed to make my nails worse.</li>
            <li> Nail Envy makes my nails grow faster.  Both seems about the same for strengthening, but THIS ONE is much better at stopping splitting and getting rid of ridges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and not one nail has broken.</li>
            <li> After trying many products, I have finally found one that works.  My nails were splitting and peeling. One coat put on by my cousin, lasted 10 days. No splitting. Had another manicure and used this as a base and top coat, and my nails never looked so good. Longer, stronger and no splitting.</li>
            <li> I have thin, brittle nails, that will break and rip down to the bed without polish and chip with regular top coats. I use this as a top coat for my at-home manicure every two weeks. I type all day at work; this is the first time ever I have had to trim my nails because their length interfered with my ability to type as quickly as I do. I&#x27;ve used it twice, as I do my manicure every two weeks. Worth the $10.00.</li>
            <li> I found this in the \\&quot;As Seen on TV\\&quot; section of my local Walgreens and decided to give it a try. Having never seen the infomercial or any advance press, I had no preconceived expectations. I absolutely love it! I have been using it for several weeks and my nails have never looked this good or been this long. I use it alone, with no other product. I take off and reapply about once a week and may add a coat or two during the week if needed. I have not had any chipping or peeling as stated in other reviews. My nails are strong, healthy and look great. I definitely recommend Pink Armor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never writen a review before but pink armor has helped not only my nails grow, but it keeps my polish on for a week! That&#x27;s huge. I have to reapply about every other day to keep my Polish from chipping but I&#x27;ve never come across another product that could keep my polish on after washing dishes or showering, let alone a week later. When I don&#x27;t wear colored polish, my nails look healthy, shiny and they are long! I know if I reapply pink armor a few times a week my nails won&#x27;t break and my polish won&#x27;t chip. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Great protection for my nails. Keeps them strong and healthy. I order 4 at a time because it works so well!</li>
            <li> Had acrylic nails for 15 years.  They were a mess until I started using Pink Armor--it really works.  Bonus too--it whitens your nail bed too.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Better than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My nails were splitting more than usual. I had no change in diet that I could think of. I saw this nail gel ad and thought I would give it a try. It was all they said it was and more. They are growing out stronger than before. I won&#x27;t be with out it.</li>
            <li> Love the clear pink, it&#x27;s natural.  Drys quickly, absolutely does not peep or chip and my nail feel stronger</li>
            <li> I used this and all it did was make my nails peel.  My nails were worse after I used this product.  Would never recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I know this nail gel works because I had it applied at the nail salon over several months.  I decided to get a bottle and do it on my own.</li>
            <li> took awhile to get but love the product</li>
            <li> Just ok. Nothing to brag on. The product will bubble and peel after washing my hands a lot. Also, it started to get gooey and gummy. When that happened, it took too long for nails to dry.</li>
            <li> Pink armor nail gel. Works as well as the higher priced gel. I will be back for more pink armor gel.</li>
            <li> Absolutely useless. It doesn&#x27;t make your nail stronger, easily peels off. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> this does not do as it claims.PINK GEL COAT works far better.  I wish is did not open this so I could send it back</li>
            <li> You can buy a bottle of clear tint nail polish and you wouldn&#x27;t notice the difference. I bought this because it was advertised that it would make your nail beds pinker and your tips whiter.&lt;br /&gt;Did not see that at all.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just like a regular clear tint of nail polish that you can find at the drugstores for much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to really like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to add that when I removed this polish, my nails seemed to be more drier and brittle.</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome, have bought it for years and will keep buying it as long as it exist,it is great for your nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to grow my nails because they are to soft. BUT with Pink Armor I know have nice nails.</li>
            <li> I heard about this and I thought I would try it. I was very disappointed. It&#x27;s expensive and did not work for me. The ends of my nails chipped terribly after I put it on, much more than usual, and the stuff started peeling off after a few days. I would not recommend it to anyone. Any other hard as nails product would have to be better than this. It&#x27;s just not worth the money for the results, or lack of results I got. A big rip off!</li>
            <li> I use it because I like a natural look.  I reapply every other day and after 5-6 days or extra abuse I remove it and reapply fresh.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle.</li>
            <li> My nails have never been stronger!  It chips but anything beside Acryllic is going to with the wear n tear of a womans day, Unless you have someone else to do all your laundry, dishes, housework!  I suggest acryllic to you all.  I disagree entirely with the bad reviews.  I got my nails done at the salon for many years and it completly ruined my nails.  I never really had great nails to begin with but I&#x27;d like to say that they are nice nails now.  Thanks to this stuff...</li>
            <li> NOTE: This is a review for the product only, not the seller. This was purchased locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My background: I have thin, easily breakable nails that peel and turn up and the whites start far before the tip of my nail, likely because I bit my nails when I was younger. Years ago, I did acrylic and loved the length and design options, but it destroyed my nail beds. So I decided to go natural again and used a special polish (Nailtiques/Nailtek) to repair the damage. After that I tried a huge variety of polishes meant to strengthen and protect natural nails, including whatever Sally Hansen had to offer. The Nailtiques line was decent enough for the original repair work, but I couldn&#x27;t be bothered to keep applying and it was extremely smelly. I will grant you I&#x27;m not the best polish applicator (I admit user error, haha) but the Sally stuff always felt goopy and hard to apply or it simply didn&#x27;t do what I&#x27;d hoped it&#x27;d do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago I tried the gel polish fad at the salons with a great deal of hope. I thought it&#x27;d be my answer. It worked in terms of polish actually lasting and my nails looking nice for awhile, but my poor nail beds were destroyed when I soaked off the polish. I could neither afford to keep doing such an expensive treatment nor to keep destroying my nails in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I moved on to natural nail approaches. I now use Burt&#x27;s Bees cuticle cream (love that stuff!) and have generally healthy nails that go through cycles of strength, likely reflecting my nutrition and stress. My one frustration is the nail beds are healthy and the cuticles are decent when I remember to care for them, but the nails never stay nice consistently and definitely never get long. They still break too easily. At this point, all I am looking for are nice looking nails that have a little white tip and look healthy. You&#x27;d think that wasn&#x27;t too much to ask, but so far it has been!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter &amp;#34;Pink Armor&amp;#34;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on a whim. Nothing else has impressed me thus far...not the SH Hard as Nails line, not the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; claims on most of the bottles...not the natural stuff. So when I saw this, I am pretty sure I made an audible scoffing sound. But I won&#x27;t lie. I have a slight addiction to &amp;#34;As Seen On TV&amp;#34; stuff, so I took a closer look. It was hanging on a shelf in a local CVS and it was approximately $10. I&#x27;ve paid more for the special nail stuff. I&#x27;ve paid as much for decent nail polish. I had my 20% coupon ready for action that day. I thought WHY NOT?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And WOW am I glad I did. I have only used this stuff for a week, but here are my observations so far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Surprisingly nice color - Bottles are always misleading because the color you see is not quite how it&#x27;ll be on your nails. It&#x27;s concentrated in the bottle, so that bright pink color was a bit off-putting to me. However, the results of 1-2 coats is actually a really lovely &amp;#34;step up&amp;#34; from clear polish. It&#x27;s reminiscent of what you might have with a subtle french manicure. As a matter of fact, I might try the white nail pencil sometime and see if I can get that effect. I tend to have rather white tips naturally, so even without effort the result is lovely. So don&#x27;t be mislead by the name and the color you see in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Normal smell - It&#x27;s polish. It has chemicals. It&#x27;s going to smell. But when you open the bottle, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll clear the room like you would with remover or some of the gel products. I like that I can put it on quickly and close it up and I don&#x27;t have husband or kids complaining that I must&#x27;ve done my nails. Excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Applies VERY easily and dries super fast - Super yay for this. I mentioned the husband and kids in #2. So you can glean from that, I&#x27;m sure, that I have little time to spare. I LOVE that I can apply the polish in minutes, with no complicated rules, and have it dry fast enough to move on to the next &amp;#34;mom-ergency&amp;#34; without scraping off polish or messing up my nails. The fact that it&#x27;s basically clear also helps so it&#x27;s quite forgiving if I do push it. I can apply it quickly just about anywhere. I even applied it in the car recently and by the time I drove to the store, I had NO worries about it being dry and ready to go. Obviously the number of coats you apply with affect dry time, but 1 coat dries almost immediately and 1-2 is still very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Removes well with regular remover - I appreciate this because I don&#x27;t have time to monkey around with soaking and I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the soaking that destroyed my nails. This acts like regular polish. I happen to have acetone remover that I&#x27;m using, so I can&#x27;t confirm non-acetone. But that&#x27;s fine with me. I like that I don&#x27;t have to soak or do anything special to remove it weekly. Once again, it&#x27;s fast and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Doesn&#x27;t appear to damage - This is a HUGE one because most &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; claims are going to come with a high price tag that isn&#x27;t just financial. In my experience, anything truly gel will hurt my nail beds...thinning and damaging them to the point where it isn&#x27;t worth it. I kept this polish on one week and removed it yesterday. I was in awe at how nice the nails looked. Just like it was regular polish. Now being reasonable, this has only been a week. But considering the claim of &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;, I was ready for possible damage. Instead they actually looked really, really good. Works for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Doesn&#x27;t prevent all breaks - Here is where we need a BIG dose of reality. There is always a trade-off. This is a good nail protector, but it&#x27;s NOT as strong as gel. At least it didn&#x27;t work the first week. I will come back and update in the following weeks if things change. The edges of my thumb nail broke off before the week was over. So I&#x27;ll need to keep that in mind. However, I have two coast on right now and all my nails feel rather strong, which is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ionly had 1-2 coats on last week and I put my hands in a LOT of water and abused my nails constantly, as is my daily M.O. It held up pretty well all things considered. I also didn&#x27;t take the time to apply as well as I could have, such as wiping off oil on my nails (which keeps the polish from adhering).  I also didn&#x27;t add coats as I went. This week I put one coat on yesterday and then after washing dishes this morning, I added another coat. I can immediately feel a difference. So that might be a good approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So with some adjustments in how I use the product, I might find I get even better results. But even for a short period of time, it appears this is at least as good as a very good strengthening polish and possibly as good as a basic gel, all without the time commitment, costs and potential damage.  I gave it 4 stars because it isn&#x27;t the concrete barricade for the nails that the name suggests, but overall I am very glad I made this purchase! I will come back and add a star if things change.</li>
            <li> All this stuff is, is clear nail polish.  At least that&#x27;s how it performs.  First, it does NOT make your nails look as advertised on TV or in ads.  It is totally clear, your nail beds do NOT look pink at all.  However, I will say it is very shiny and bright and does look good from that stand-point (so would clear polish).  It dries very quickly, BUT---and this is a big BUT to me--it starts peeling the very next day which is a deal breaker for me.  I&#x27;m anal and can&#x27;t leave peeling polish alone, so then it all has to come off. Which brings me to the next issue:  this states it comes off easily with regular nail polish remover.  So not true.  I had to work hard to get it off using regular remover, and even then, it was like there was still a softened layer on my nails that I had to scrape off.  I&#x27;ve researched the nail gel trend, and although having polish that does not peel sounds awesome, is it worth ruining your nails for?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!! It does not strengthen your nails and chips and scraches off easily.  If you want your nails growing super fast and looking great, go get yourself some Perfect Formula nail polish.  It is absolutely the best nail strengthener/hardener/long lasting gel polish I have ever used. Put it on and remove and redo once a week to continually nourish your nails. Within 2 weeks you won&#x27;t believe the difference in the length of your nails. Its not available in a lot of colors yet, but you can always put a coat of your favorite color on top of it.</li>
            <li> I used pink armor for a month as directed.  it ate my nails and they&#x27;re still breaking.  they are disintegrating as they grow out.  because they are jagged, they catch on everything.  MY NAILS HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS BAD!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. My nails were fine, just thin and would curl a bit on the end if I let them get very long. I tried pink armor for two weeks, and my nails immediately started splitting and peeling. After coming back and seeing some of the other negative reviews, I was terrified to try to keep using it. Since I used it, my nails are growing slower, too. They seem traumatized. I&#x27;m very disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> If you already suffer from every other nail polish peeling off your mail, don&#x27;t expect this to be any different. I bought this at my CVS. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week, I have continued to reapply, but it keeps peeling off my jail in one peice. Wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I have been using armor for a month. My nails feel so much stronger. So happy with this product. Finally found a product that works.</li>
            <li> works great.  I was never able to grow my nails, but now that I am  using Pink Armor, my nails have grown and are nice and strong.  Would highly recomment  this produce to anyone having problems growing nails.</li>
            <li> this really does seem to do the job and has helped to protect my weak, breakable nails!!</li>
            <li> funny... nails on left hand look goo; nails on right hand don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 years now, so I would think my review would hold some weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the way my nails look after painting them with pink armor, but as the saying goes, if it sounds too good to be true then it probably is.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be able to open a can of soda with your tip, that&#x27;s ludacris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;Nails do seem slightly stronger only when painted.&lt;br /&gt;Does make nails appear healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Does enhance the pink color of your nails.&lt;br /&gt;Does shine like a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Does seem to help nails grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;Put too little and it won&#x27;t do anything but give you a bit of shine.&lt;br /&gt;Put too much and your nails will have a purple color to them, and look as though they are under a UV lamp.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t last very long. In fact, it begins to peel after your very first shower, especially upon the edges of your nails.&lt;br /&gt;It contains formaldehyde, I simply hate this.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is not very aesthetically pleasing and is hard to keep a grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, to each their own, but I thought my opinion might be helpful. The formaldehyde ingredient really pushed my rating down, and don&#x27;t think people should use this without researching a little bit. I barely use it nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to file, buff, and shine your nails first with any tool you can find (Revlon has a decent one) and paint your nails with this afterwards. It&#x27;ll look much better when you have no lines or cracks in your nails.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that covers the ridges in my nails.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. In the bottle it becomes too thick  to use after opening and having for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I saw this product at the store and thought I would give it a try.  I could not believe how my nails responded.  I used it daily for the first wk then took off and reapplied on a weekly basis.  In less than a month my nails are longer and stronger that they have EVER been.  I am so pleased, I stocked piled some bottles!  :)  The only thing I would change is removing the pink tinge.  Will be buying for a long tme.  Am sorry others have not shared my experience.</li>
            <li> This product makes my nails stay strong and not peel.</li>
            <li> I always get suckered in to the as seen on TV products and they never work. I bought this, already accepting it wouldn&#x27;t work, cause I have tried everything to fix my nails and nothing has worked. To my absolute shock, this stuff is a nail miracle in a bottle. My nails look fake they&#x27;re so long. I&#x27;m blow away!</li>
            <li> I lucked out and found this product on a clearance end cap at a Dollar General store for $7 and I&#x27;m definitely happy with it so far.  I am a nail tech and I damaged my nail beds a while back from doing manicures too frequently.  This product, along with CND Solar Oil nourishing treatment and CND Cuticle Eraser, has brought my nails back to their original health and vitality.  I&#x27;m planning on using this product for a long time to come, especially if I can find it for that price again (less than a bottle of OPI!)</li>
            <li> I read the raves of others saying this would help weak nails grow.  I have always had weak nails, so much so that I turned to acrylics for a while.  That was fun having nails I could use as screwdrivers(ha). Then I moved on to gel which was much easier and I could do them myself.  However, you still have to keep up with it regularly and removal was torture, and it left them even weaker.  Now I am taking some supplements for arthritis that are supposed to have the side effect of strengthening your hair and nails. So I am in the process of growing them out after removing the gel to see if anything has changed.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line on Pink Armor- nothing special.  It chips off like any other, especially if you have to put your hands in water for any length of time.  Maybe that&#x27;s why they tell you to put it on daily. It does have a nice pink sheen to it that looks nice and natural.&lt;br /&gt;10/1/13  Update. I wanted to add, there is something in the ingrediants that when I put my nails under a UV light to dry, they light up like neon!  This is pretty odd for me and have not noticed it with any other products. Some people are worried about the formaldehyde- which is one of the ingrediants. I wonder if that is what makes it light up.&lt;br /&gt;Here is a site with healthy polish:&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Not only did this not keep my nails from chipping, it caused them to split into layers and peel off. Will not buy this again!</li>
            <li> Peeled off my nails easily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased SO many things to try and help my nails - and at this point am very skeptical of any claims.  But last winter I decided to really concentrate on getting back the healthy nails I once used to enjoy and ordered my first bottle of Pink Armor Nail Gel.  Within a few weeks I could determine a positive difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I also began taking 2 capsules of gelatin daily not long afterwards as well.  But the combination has been very productive for me.  Bear in mind, it takes months for our fingernails to grow all the way from the cuticle to the tip.  But I have most definitely made more progress in the last 9 months than I&#x27;d been able to do in 10 or 12 years previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just last week I was actually able to have a French manicure for the first time in too many years to count!  I still used the Pink Armor as the base and top coat (I&#x27;m not giving that up!) but I had enough of a free edge that was strong (as opposed to being cracked, splitting, peeling, broken which has been my norm for ages) that I&#x27;ve maintained the French tip for a week - yeah!</li>
            <li> Real nice gel nail polish without the lights. Your nails become very strong and tint color gives nail beds a clean french manicure look it brightens the whole nail and tips. Best product for nails.</li>
            <li> I had gel nails for 7 years and my real nails were a mess when I took them off.  I tried Nailtiques for 3 weeks with minimal effect. This made my nails stronger in just a few days and 2 months later my nails are amazing.</li>
            <li> Great nail hardener. I love this and couldn&#x27;t find it locally so I bought it on amazon. Life saver for sure.</li>
            <li> This peeled the first time I took a shower, the morning after applying it.  I didn&#x27;t buy from this seller so it&#x27;s just the product I&#x27;m criticizing.  This is going back and I will use Gellous instead, a much better nail strengthener that lasts a good week at least.</li>
            <li> My fav &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; . I work in a salon, soa and beauty store.....i recommend people go out to other places and buy this product as it has literally transformed my nail life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear with a pink tint.</li>
            <li> I love the Pink Armor.  I don&#x27;t use nail polish and really have no nail \\&quot;problems\\&quot;.  I like how natural, but shiny the Pink Armor is.  I think it makes my nail whites look whiter than no polish and makes the pinks look pinker. I like that it dries VERY fast.  I like that it lasts me weeks.  I DO hand wash dishes without gloves and work in the yard without gloves and clean the house without gloves.  I take this off with remover before I need to file my nails -- every 1-2 weeks -- and I feel that it is \\&quot;still going strong\\&quot; when I remove it.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it less than one star. This stayed on my nails one day. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have in the past tried many different products to help with splitting nails,  so far this product is working.  The reason I did not give it five stars is because I have only been using it a very few weeks.. By the way I have given it to others and they also like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the second bottle and really like this product. I agree with the folks who said they loved the look especially in the sunlight, and how quickly it dries.  You can add another coat within minutes, but I usually add another coat each morning.  I also think it helps fill in ridges. It will peel if you pick at it after you get on really thick or if you keep your hands in water a lot..just use your kitchen gloves as you should anyway. My nails peel in layers half way back on the nails no matter what I do, but this keeps those layers from coming off. I have not seen the infomercial so I don&#x27;t know what outrageous claims they make, but in practical terms, it does work. I will keep buying it unless something changes. But even if you don&#x27;t think it helps your nails,  you should try it just for the cool look your nails will have.</li>
            <li> I found that this did not make my nails as strong as I would like.  I was looking for something to keep them from peeling, this did not work.</li>
            <li> mY NAILS ARE HAPPY WITH THIS PINK ARMOR.  wAITING FOR THEM TO GROW OUT MORE AND i WILL KNOW THAT THE ARMOR IS WORKING. tHANKS</li>
            <li> I started using this on both my feet and hands.  Within a month my nails were stronger and harder.  For the summer I do my own white tips and use this over it.  I have had the manicure last for two weeks with no peeling at all.  I usually re-do my nails every week , this polish really makes the French manicure look awesome!  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I had not seen any television ads for this product and came upon this product at Ross..... very cheap price &amp; so I thought I would try it.  My natural nails have always been so thin and weak.... constant peeling and unable to  keep any length to them.  Years of acrylic and shellac nails have destroyed my nails leaving me with ridges and a mess.  I put on this nail gel to clean dry nails.... two coats.  Then I put on a  clear sealing top coat that I use.  My nails stopped peeling and have grown so strong, healthy and pretty.  I take off the polish every other week and start over with the same process.  I will never wear acrylics again..... this product is wonderful! Just keep it up and don&#x27;t worry..... in record time your nails will be beautiful again!</li>
            <li> this is the only nail hardener that doesn&#x27;t flake off. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now. I put on two coat on day one, repeated by one coat for a week then i remove it and start all over. my nails are growing and they look good!</li>
            <li> I Have Never seen this advertised so not sure what &amp;#34;they claim&amp;#34; it to do... I  WILL Tell You I am 49 years old and I have Never Been able to Grow my nails long. They have always been very, very short and super thin.  I noticed this on the shelf at a local pharmacy.  I did not purchase from Amazon, but my bottle is getting low so I&#x27;m online trying to get a cheaper deal. I cannot believe the difference in my nails in a months time.. I will continue stocking up on this product, for it has truly made a BIG DIFFERENCE IN STRENGTHING My Nails.  I apply 2 coats each time I apply. Today is the first time I am applying color along with it so cannot comment on how long color stays on using this.  I work in health care and wash my hands constantly, the Gel polish alone has lasted 5 to 7 days before I remove completely and start over. I haven&#x27;t read the other reviews and I am not one to post them, but when I am searching I always read the reviews so I wanted to write and tell you WORKS FOR ME!</li>
            <li> I really like the pink armor nail growth. My nails have never been so strong and I see growth at least two or three days after each application.</li>
            <li> Polish peels off after a few hours, or if you&#x27;re lucky, the next day.  Don&#x27;t waste your money. So there.</li>
            <li> Your nails don&#x27;t turn yellow like the usual clear polish.&lt;br /&gt;It stays on and doesn&#x27;t peel off after a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;You have to remove with polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect anything to HEEL your nails though, if they chip, peel or crack.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;&#x27;ll have to take supplements for that.</li>
            <li> It has strengthened my nails and helped them to grow as no other product has.  I love it and recommend it to anyone having trouble with brittle nails.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable is one of the only words I can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now before I start my review note this this is an amazon verified purchase. The reason I state this is because this review is going to sound like its paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item for my mother who has had severe issues with her nails for years now. Her nails were chipping, breaking, brittle and breaking off below the skinline to expose her flesh underneath. If she touched her nail or bumped it it would split and she was in significant pain and discomfort for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over those years we have tried so many things for her. I&#x27;ve bought sally hansen strong as nails, bought her a garlic nail polish that promised to cure her ailments, took her to get nail treatments and nothing... really NOTHING worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I came across this and she and I joked we&#x27;d try it. &amp;#34;as seen on tv&amp;#34; rarely has a good association in our books... but as a last effort I purchased this for her before I moved away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three months later her nails are long and healthy and strong. No chipping, no breaking and she&#x27;s able to put nail polish on them again. Her praise for this product was so great that she went to their site to leave a personal review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I never would have thought that this product would work. Skeptical was an understatement but I am eating my words and I am more than happy and satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a sidenote: if you have nail fungus I do not recommend you use this. My SO and I bought one for ourselves after my mother&#x27;s praise and while it does keep your nails healthy, using in on a nail with fungus seems to make the issue worse.</li>
            <li> Wear this every day.  Nails stay strong and clean.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I used this after I decided it was time to let my nails rest from having gel on them.&lt;br /&gt;It helped strengthen my nails and got them looking nice again!</li>
            <li> When this product first came out, I was hesitant to buy it and wondered if it&#x27;s claim to grow your nails was in fact true.  Well, it is!  My nails were splitting and breaking and now they are long and hard.  I love Pink Armor.  On my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought Pink Armor over a week now from the Office Depot. I did not go there to buy this product, but it caught my attention in the As Seen on Tv section and picked it up without even giving it second thoughts. The first night I came home with it, I applied 3 coats to my nails and was amazed at how quickly my nails dried and looked so good. A few days later, I tried to deliberately break one of my nails that had become so soft after removing the acrylic but I could not. Imagine, in only a few days, my nails had become healthy and stronger. I had planned to go out on New Years Day but I did not get the chance to remove the old Pink Armor and redo my nails so I took the bottle with me and while my husband was driving I quickly applied a fresh coat over the old one. To my amazement, my nails looked bright, pink and new. Even the little chips that were there at the tips  of my nails were smoothed out by just applying this fresh coat so I can wear it a few more days before cleaning them off and reapplying three fresh coats. This is the best nail polish/ hardener that I have ever had that is long lasting and beautiful. It beats Sally Hansen every time. I must tell you that I am sold.</li>
            <li> despite other negative reviews, I must rave about this product! wore acrylics for many years due to awful natural nails that were too weak to grow. tried various other gels and strengtheners to no avail. saw this at a drug store, checked here for reviews. decided to take the plunge and soooo glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;haven&#x27;t seen the infomercial, so did my own thing: cleaned nails and put on one coat. every other polish I ever tried chipped within 24 hours due to my bend-y nails. this lasted 10 days with NO chips. holy moly! put on a second coat just to see how that was. OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;current routine: take it off after one week, let nails breathe overnight, then put on a single coat. mid-week, add another coat. perfecto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;apparently the infomerical says to add a coat a day for a week (?). IMO any time you have multiple coats of any polish, it&#x27;s going to chip and come off. I add no more than that second coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Sally Hansen cuticle oil (cheap and the best of all I&#x27;ve tried) and take biotin for nails, hair, skin (Costco). my nails have NEVER looked better in my young 66 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say go for it! I have gone back for two more bottles and will be using this product for years to come.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised there were a couple of bad reviews.  I found this polish at CVS and decided to give it a try.  This product is awesome and has transformed my nails for the better.  Very pretty and natural!  Lasts a full week without re-application.  I will always be a fan!  I&#x27;m saving this product in my amazon cart so that I never forget or run out.  The best polish ever and I&#x27;m usually very picky!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this will make your nails strong enough to grow. Right now my nails are such a mess from a thyroid problem I don&#x27;t think anything will help the quit peeling and splitting. But I do love the way this makes your nails look so pink and healthy. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> It works great..only thing is, everytime I open it to use it, the brush falls out of the lid......this is my second bottle so I know it works, but this bottle is awful....if I could exchange it I would....any help here?</li>
            <li> I just sat here and read about 30 reviews and while most are positive, I was a bit surprised at the negative ones.  People are always looking for that &amp;#34;Miracle Product&amp;#34; that will do EXACTLY what the tv commercial says it will do.  Common sense tells you that it this nail gel did everything that the ad said then it would sell for 10 times what it is priced at.  That being said, I purchased my first bottle with common sense and not expecting the miracle that others seemed to be searching for.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to say that I am very impressed with the fact that I did my nails about 2 hours before bedtime and was surprised that my nails did dry in a very short amount of time.  I didn&#x27;t apply any other nail color because I wanted to see what it would look like alone and didn&#x27;t want my end result to be affected by another product.  I started by removing my french manicure, washed my hands and lightly rubbed alcohol on each nail before I started.  I applied two coats for the first time and about 30 minutes later went and hand washed come cups and silverware that were in my kitchen sink.  After drying my hands I went into a room that had lots of light and was really pleased with the fact that my nails still had that fresh painted look, heck they almost looked like they were still wet!&lt;br /&gt;While I do try to take care of my nails sometimes things happen and I will chip a nail when I open my car door or when I try to open  my sliding glass door to our patio.  What some people don&#x27;t realize is that when  you have long nails there are some things that you simply just can not do, that is the price you pay for having long nails.  Just like when I were stockings I am not going to sit on a cement park bench because I know that it will destroy them.  I do not expect this product to make my nails &amp;#34;invincible&amp;#34; I just want a nail polish that will look the way it looks after I apply it and this one does exactly that!&lt;br /&gt;After the first time I used it as I said before it was a couple of hours before I went to bed.  Usually when I do my nails at night and go to bed a couple of hours later it always ends up the next morning that I have smudges on my nails and I will have to do a quick touch up before I go to work.  When I woke the next morning, not only were there no smudges but they still looked like I had just applied it!&lt;br /&gt;So, I will not only recommend this product to any and everyone that likes to polish their nails.  I will be using this product each and every time I do my nails.  It is worth every penny, especially when you consider that it cost no more than the nail polishes that I normally buy.was a couple of hours before I went to bed.

            <li> Horrible! When they say take off within 5 days u better do it.. I missed the 5 day mark and another nail grew under my nail and now my nail is a big mess.. It was painful and now my nail is only half there..</li>
            <li> I got this for a gift b/c my grandmom asked for it.  After reading the ingredients though, it has formaldehyde in it.  Probably not the best thing for nails!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely amazing.  My nails have never been this long and strong.  I actually left it on for three weeks.  Never had any come off, just added another layer or two after the new growth started to peek out.  Gave it to my daughter to try and her nails were amazing in just two weeks or less!  We are sold and I am giving a bottle to all the ladies on my Christmas list for stocking stuffers!</li>
            <li> Great product. Will recommend.</li>
            <li> Heals up and hardens your nails when they are damaged. Also leaves them with a really cool pink hue. Just love this stuff. It&#x27;s also very good to use under a professional manicure. My nails don&#x27;t dry out and look damaged when the polish is removed.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  The formula really grows my nails.</li>
            <li> I just recently received this product and have only been using it a short time but it seems to be working very well protecting my nails from chips.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because I didn&#x27;t see anything that resembled pink on my nails but it did make them strong. Just because I love nail products I would probably purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> I put two coats on last night.  Took a shower today and it&#x27;s peeling off.  I am not happy.  I gave it two stars because it does make my nails pretty, just disappointed it was for such a short time.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.  I have had trouble in the past with polish chipping and my nails splitting.  I put this on a week ago and it&#x27;s still great, no chips or peals. I work in an office and type quite a bit, I&#x27;ve done dishes and housework and the polish has still held up after a week of wear. I highly recommend it.  Color me PINK!</li>
            <li> I love this product,comparable to other but for 1/3 of the price.Nails are strong with nice shine and natural pink color.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.  The nail restorer works exactly as advertised and I could not be more pleased with the results.  Pink Armor is especially effective for restoring damaged nails after many years of using gel/acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> I used this product as the directions called for and I saw no results other than the pink shine.  I did NOTJING to make my nails stronger.....VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!! NEVER BUY IT AGAIN...WAISTE OF MONEY</li>
            <li> My nails are stronger with this product. My coworker saw my nails and asked what have I been using and why are my nails do strong. We are nurses and constantly wash our hands. If I could show you a pic of before and after you&#x27;d be amazed.  I recommend this product to someone else. Without a doubt.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this review by statig that I did not purchase this from Amazon, from the website, or infomercial.  I found this at KMart.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about 3 months now and I love it. I have finally found a nail polish , other than Gel polish, that stays on my nails. My nails are thin, tend to be deeply ridged, and peel.  I have tried just about every reasonably priced,(under $15), nail polish I could find, but it always peeled off in a couple of days.  Pink Armor has only peeled off 1 time since I have used it.  It may be because I put on multiple coats and then got my hands wet a couple of hours later.  I have since learned to put on 1 coat evey other day, allowing at least 4 hours before I get my hands in water, and it has never peeled again. My nails no longer peel or split, and finally at 41 I have a beautiful set of NATURAL nails. so much so, that when I go to get a pedicure, I am repeatedly asked by the nail techs if my nails are mine, and when I tell them yes, they want to know what I used. If I owed a nail shop, I would stock this as my secret weapon for successfully transioning those clients requesting to go from gel or synthetic nails, to natural. For some leaving negative reviews, user error may be a factor, and no product will ever satisfy everyone. I also find that it does make the nails appear brighter, but that does dull after a couple of days. However, if you add another coat, they brighten back up. I actually only take it all off, ( with regular nail polish remover), when I start to see a good amount of new nail growth.  I will admit, however, that I have never ued this product in conjunction with other nail polish, so I can&#x27;t say how it works as a base or top coat.  I just know that my nails look soo good now I can&#x27;t bear to cover them with a color. I am definately going to stock up on this polish, I so don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how to rate something that is in this category but I believe it&#x27;s what they say it is today.  If it changes, then I&#x27;ll put it on this website -- thanks</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to give my nails a little extra strength. Because my nails are &amp;#34;active&amp;#34; length, I can say that I have noticed a change in them. They peel less, for one thing. Add also the fact that the pink color is great to wear when you want a natural look. It works well as a topcoat, too. I thought it was a little pricey, and I don&#x27;t know that I would have noticed results at all if I were trying to grow my nails out &amp;#34;super long&amp;#34;, but overall, I think that this product did a nice job.</li>
            <li> I have very soft nails and have always worn acrylics.  I took off the acrylics and in just a few short months, I have beautiful real nails.  Highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see the infomercial.  I found this at CVS in the &amp;#34;As Seen on TV&amp;#34; aisle.  They had a special, buy one get one free of anything in that aisle, so I thought, why not?  This is the best base coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t peel like so many other Sally Hanson, Revlon, OPI and other salon products I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  When I use Pink Armor as a base coat, I can put on 2 coats of any nail polish, and a week later I hardly have any chipped nails.  I also used the Pink Armor by itself, and it does make my nails look shiny.  I noticed my nails got a bit stronger, less brittle, and less breaking and peeling - so that was an added bonus!  My nails are very ridged, so I lightly buff them, file them, then apply the Pink Armor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I&#x27;ve had acrylic nails, and this product is no way as thick as acrylic powder.  It&#x27;s also not as damaging.  I&#x27;ve never tried gel nails, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect some polish in a bottle to work like the gel that needs to be baked in the UV light.  If this is your expectation, then just keep paying $50 dollars every two weeks  at the nail salon for gel nails.  But if you want a fabulous base coat or stronger, smoother, shiny natural nails, then this is your product!!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with Pink Armor for a while.  My nails seemed stronger and were growing longer without breaking for months.  Suddenly I began noticing what looked like white scratches on my natural nails when I removed it with OPI lacquer remover.  At first I thought the scratches might be due to the orange stick I used to push my cuticles back so I began using q-tips instead of the cuticle stick.  But then in addition to what looked like scratches I began noticing bigger white splotches forming on several nails.  I read a couple of reviews where people said Pink Armor had caused their nails to peel.  So I looked up pictures of peeling nails and sure enough my nails looked just like the pictures.  The last time I removed it the condition of my nails scared me.  I showed them to my husband and he was shocked and immediately said whatever you&#x27;re using, QUIT!  I cut them all short and am now babying them by using products to soften and repair cuticles and nails.  It will take months for all the irregular white places to grow out.  I feel pretty certain this is a result of using PA because I have never had this problem before and it started after I began using it.  I wish I could give a good review but the current condition of my nails tells me it doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Only time will tell if my nails return to an unblemished look.</li>
            <li> Does not stay on long, chips easily. Rude customer service. Would not use this product again. That&#x27;s all I can say about this company and product</li>
            <li> When used as directed this actually does strengthen you nails nicely. I would definitely recommend it and buy it again</li>
            <li> Had quite a bit of trouble getting the product here. Took a really long time! But once it arrived, I loved it and use it often.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t plug a product, but this one is worth recommending. I tried this at my mother in law&#x27;s house.  Loved it.  I went home and ordered here on Amazon, and it was wonderful... my nails haven&#x27;t looked this good in years!  I just bought my mom some last week!  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this polish.  It is the only polish I have used that does what it advertises to do.  My nails do not turn yellow with week after week of use.  I actually file my nails because they grow too long, not because they break.  Plus, you can also use your color polish with it.  I bought a few bottles because I am afraid it could be discontinued.  Every time I find something that really works, it usually gets taken off the market or production is discontinues.  Hope that does not happen here.</li>
            <li> I HAD USED IT BEFORE AND FOUND IT TO BE AS GOOD AS I REMEMBERED.</li>
            <li> This Polish Is Magic.&lt;br /&gt;It Makes Your Nail Tips White,Makes Them Hard,Healthy.I LOVE&amp;#60;LOVE&amp;#60;LOVE This Stuff.</li>
            <li> Bought this at a Marshall&#x27;s store on a whim.  It&#x27;s quick to dry and my nails feel hard.  It looked clear but when I went outside, it has a neat pink sheen.  Mostly nail polish peels off, so I don&#x27;t do it very often.  I tried Sally Hansen hard as wraps...and it peels off.  I think it must depend on personal  body chemistry, because some people say this peels.  I haven&#x27;t noticed that, at least not yet.  So far I love this product and would buy again.  I eat poorly and have brittle nails, and I think this will help me</li>
            <li> I could NEVER get my nails to grow....this stuff works....compleatly covers the little nicks and tears in your nails and protects them....I also LOVE the color very nice pink pale.</li>
            <li> First time used and glad to find it. Product is very good, do dishes and not have to redo your nails like with regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> After a  couple weeks use, I can say it appears to stay on well and gives a feeling of protection for nails. I do a lot of gardening and yard work, house painting, caring for animals and only the smallest chip/wear on a couple nail tips. As other users mentioned, there is an odd pink color, but not a deal breaker. Too soon to tell about growth claim, even though my nails seem a tad longer!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my Mom and she really liked it. She it worked as expected and that she would like to get more in the future.</li>
            <li> It hardenes you nails, giving them a long lasting shine and duresse. I recomand it to Anyone that has bryttle nayls.</li>
            <li> I have to dispute these negative comments. The Pink Armour Nail Gel Polish has performed better for me than any other polish I have used of any price! The secret to its best performance is to use it as a base coat AND top coat. I have used this with my darkest color polishes that show chips immediately without the Pink Armour but with it as a base coat and top coat...absolutely no chips for three weeks! I cannot say this about any other product I have used. Those who have peeling soon after use are for the most part using it alone or with only one or two thin coats. It performs best alone with 2 to 3 normal coats (after a lite buff to reduce ridges) or as a base coat then two light color polish applications and then a generous top coat. Don&#x27;t over do your layers but make them ample enough to make the coats last. I also want to mention that it protects my nails from breakage and has made a huge difference in the growth and strength of my nails. All in all, for me, it has been an excellent product.</li>
            <li> My Mom had great nails.  My sister had Amazing nails.  I never did.  Ever.  Splitting.  Breaking.  Not good.  But then... I bought this and used it diligently for about a month or a month and a half... and my nails grew out -- strong!  I type every day and still my nails have held up.  Now, I actually have to trim them back.  I get quite a few compliments on my nails now.  I really like this product and have bought two bottles in the last five months and am still using the second bottle.  It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have long nails again! I used to use Loreal Grow Strong but haven&#x27;t been able to find it for years. I have my hands in water a lot and am into gardening and I really use my hands. My nails have been short, brittle and I could not grow them no matter what I used but now, they&#x27;re long and beautiful and this gives the right tint of pink. I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews here. For me, this stuff is magical!</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions it works. My nails grow and look great. But you have to change it weekly.</li>
            <li> I use this as a top coat on my french manicure....don&#x27;t know if it helps my nails get stronger, but I like the shine.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff... I have always had difficulty growing long nails, they would grow but crack &amp; peel all the time. I have tried different things that claimed to keep your nails from peeling &amp; breaking but nothing ever worked. as soon as they started looking good one or more would break &amp; i would start all over. I decided to give pink armor a try &amp; my nails have stopped peeling &amp; breaking. All of my nails are nice &amp; long at one time &amp; have been so for quiet a while now. I am very happy with the results</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of Pink Armor and tried it out the first time with one coat, (it is quite thick) so I thought that it would be just like armor, boy was I disappointed when it peeled off the next day after showering. I was so mad that I wanted to write the company a letter demanding they stop there false advertisement of this nail gel. I let it sit on my bathroom counter for over a month mad every time I looked at my Ten bucks wasted. I decided I would give it another shot one night when I was bored this time I applied 3 coats to each nail while watching a movie. The next day after my shower I noticed that I didn&#x27;t have any peeling at all. A couple of days later I decided to apply another coat, and 2 days later another coat. With each coat it seemed to get harder and harder and it dries very quickly. I have about 7 or 8 coats on right now and it has been 2 weeks with no splits or peeling or rips or tears. I swim everyday and even that hasn&#x27;t affected the rock hard finish it has created.  My nails looks beautiful and I have never had nails this long without breakage. This stuff is amazing! The trick is that you must apply a minimum of 3 coats the first time and then keep adding every other day to build up the hard gel layers. The other great thing about it is that it makes your nails go from yucky yellow to a beautiful pale pink. I hope they keep making this stuff because I like it even better than a gel manicure from a salon!</li>
            <li> I swim 5 days per week in chlorine and my nail polish always flakes, chips and turns yellow. Since I have been using this product my nails look lovely and no chipping, peeling or yellowing! I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I have never had long nails and ever since using this product my nails are long and hard!!!!I love the color and it saves me tons of money!!I can not believe all of the bad reviews,my nails never peel nor does the polish,it is worth every dime I have spent on it....I hope it is forever in stores!!!! Linda Morin</li>
            <li> Chipped really fast. the next day half of it was gone. Did not improve my nails at all. i would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, brittle, cracking nails. I have used fake nails a lot! Just a week ago I took off the last set. And went to look for something to help! So far so good, after a week. My 3 favorite things are: 1. The color is AMAZING!! 2. It dries SO FAST! 3. It stays on, wears super well!&lt;br /&gt;I will defiantly update after using for a month.</li>
            <li> I bought this from CVS purely for use of the color. To my surprise this paints on thin like a polish but dries hard like a gel. I have been plagued with weak, brittle nails that chip or splinter and this polish has put an end to all of that. This product is truly a blessing to my nails and they have been able to grow.&lt;br /&gt;The color is a very light pink, just a little brighter than the nail pink of healthy nails. I have recommend this product to everyone and I moved enough by it to get online and leave a comment here which is something I never do. Have a wonderful day everyone</li>
            <li> The Pink Armor was recommended by a friend. I noticed her nails looked so healthy and ask where she got her last manicure. She told me she had given herself the manicure and recommended the product. Pink Armor gives your nails a nice, healthy pink glow with a professional look, as the end result.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> It definitely makes the nail look really healthy.  Whites are whiter.  Shine is great.  The jury is out on whether or not this actually strengthens the nails.  For now, I will continue to use it and monitor nail growth and see if it resolves the cracking/splitting issues I have had with my nails.</li>
            <li> I r problems with my nails and so far this has helped a great deal.  They do not peel or split as they did.</li>
            <li> This junk has ruined my fingernails.  I did not know it contained Formaldehyde when I ordered it.  I had been warned never to use anything with that in it!  At first the nails just looked great (same as Sally Hanson) then they started flaking off and breaking until now I have no nails at all and still they keep flaking off!  I am surprised Amazon would offer this!</li>
            <li> It is working well for me.  Will redress this product in a few months to let you know what&#x27; s doing.  So far, I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Nice pinkish color when applied, but did not get any additional hardened protection.  Nails still break and split as usual.</li>
            <li> I like the product for the most part BUT was not happy when I walked into my local drug store and  it was there. Cheaper &amp; with no shipping cost.</li>
            <li> My nails look like they are french tip. But no way does it last a week or two. After days it is chipped off. With Nail polish it is even more noticeable. I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I am a swimmer and have soft nail beds.  This product works wonders and I have been able to maintain nice nails since I started using pink armor.  To the negative reviewers, I think you might be using too much, it will peel if over applied.  One coat does the trick, my nails are stronger than ever.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily. I love it. Has a pretty pink shade and keeps my nails strong and shiny. Have my mom hooked on it now too. I bought it after months of gel polish damage. Now my nails are strong and pretty.</li>
            <li> I really like it. It was recommended to me by a co-worker who loves it. Her nails are very hard after using it for several weeks. Mine are better for sure but not as hard. Could be because I have very thin and tend-to-peel nails. My favorite thing about this polish is that it dries quickly! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I always had problems with splitting nails. I had flat nails like men. I&#x27;ve only been using this for 2 months and my nails no longer split. My nails are now showing more curves . I love this product and feel better about wearing my rings instead of hiding my hands</li>
            <li> I have been wearing acrylics for years and decided to take them off about 3 years ago.  Since then I have tried every nail strenthing product to no avail.  My nails were still weak and full of ridges.  I saw Pink Armor on tv and thought about trying but the reviews were so mixed I decided against it.  I stumbled across this product again in a pharmacy and decided to give it a try.  I have been using Pink Armor for just over a month now, changing the polish each week, and I am thrilled.  The ridges have gone and my nails are longer and stronger.  I take it off each Saturday and reapply on Sunday.  As for the whitening not so sure but longer and stonger nails ABSOLUTELY!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I use it as a base coat and a top coat every time I change my nail polish (about once a week). It makes my nails hard and strong! Would defenitaly recommend to anyone having problems with their nails constantly breaking.</li>
            <li> I bought some clear and French nail polish from Blue Cross Beauty Products while visiting Hawaii quite some years ago.  The simple clear (and the French top coats) that they sold were, in my opinion, as good as (and much less expensive than) the \\&quot;gel\\&quot; coats being advertised now.  However, I have been unable to reach Blue Cross to order more (I tried one new product and it was not the same) so I thought I would try Pink Armor.  I was surprised that the texture is very much like the Blue Cross clear that I used years ago.  I think this is a good substitute, although it does cost more.</li>
            <li> I try this item right away and you could feel immediately how your nail are protected and strong. Stay on for a long time and the nail looks good!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t submit very many reviews but felt strongly about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very weak, peeling nails. This is my 2nd week using Pink Armour and I already see a difference. My nails feel stronger and they are actually longer than before I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend trying it out.</li>
            <li> this product keeps the nails strong somewhat,but not as i expected,you have to use it more frequentlythan advertized by the advertizer</li>
            <li> I have tried many products over the years to strengthen my nails and to make them look good. I got fast results from Pink Armor.&lt;br /&gt;People started commenting on my nails including my granddaughter. Telling me how nice they looked. Asking me what I was doing and where could they purchase the product.&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sandra</li>
            <li> This product has really helped my brittle nails to thicken and harden.</li>
            <li> It works ! My favorite !</li>
            <li> Love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have really horrible, weak, brittle, thin nails. With this product my nails have grown so long and beautiful people stop to compliment my nails.&lt;br /&gt;They actually grow so long that I have to cut them. In the past, they always broke before I had to trim them.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s rare that products live up to their hype but this one really does.</li>
            <li> I have been using Pink Armour for about 2 months.  My nails are weak, split and have ridges. I am also a licensed Cosmetologist.  I have not been able to grow my nails out in years unless I use a gel type polish.  One of the reasons I like this product is you do not have to use acetone to soak the product off, it dries fast and is reasonably priced.  I would recommend this product to anyone wishing to grow their nails longer and need help filling in the ridges.</li>
            <li> Ok so.....I specifically looked up the reviews on this products after using for 6 months now. I am a manicurist and decided to try this product. I think this is a great product especially for my customers who do not like color on their nails. A couple of my customers now purchase it for themselves. I work in a small salon and I found the shellac was damaging after a while to their nails. This product has been a great alternative. I, myself use it faithfully. I do believe it makes your nails not only look healthy but my nails look pretty great now. Thumbs up from me.</li>
            <li> This works amazing! I have the thinnest, weakest nails ever. They bend backwards and forwards, and are constantly peeling, splitting, and breaking.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from cheap to expensive nail hardeners to try and improve them, all without any luck. A friend was raving about this one day, so I decided to order it and give it a try. It truly does work great!  My nails no longer peel or bend as long as I&#x27;m wearing this. Please note, for me, when I take it off, my nails are still thin  and weak. This product hardens and protects only when wearing the product (but still works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried). This is like a very, very thin coat of acrylic (like regular acrylic nails), but isn&#x27;t thick at all. I use two coats which works perfectly! Clear, pretty, and works great!</li>
            <li> This is like a gel manicure straight from home. It hardens just like the ones from the Salon, Just put a layer a day to get better results. To keep from going to the salon ever, keep a bottle around always.</li>
            <li> I will not use anything else! This nail formula has allowed me to grow my natural nails again. I keep bottles of it and if you add enough layers under or on top of polish you can sometimes peel it off without having to use remover.</li>
            <li> I had yellowish brittle nails due to too much nail polish use. This has made them look healthier and natural. Dries quickly too so good for busy working moms like me!</li>
            <li> I have to review this product. I found it for like ten bucks at Target about a month ago, having never heard of it before. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I needed a nail fix anyway and figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt. My nails were consistently peeling from biting, rough usage, and dishwashing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I started using them -- just this product, I can&#x27;t stop staring at them. I&#x27;ve put on plain base coat/top coats before for a &amp;#34;natural look&amp;#34;, but nothing makes my short stubby hands as beautiful as this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application: Once a week I use an enriched nail polish remover to clean it up and repaint. I retouch here and there when I notice the edges exposing themselves again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it really the product?: Maybe, maybe not. It&#x27;s likely that I&#x27;ve been more aware of the damage to my nails, and that thinking has made my nail usage to be gentler. But my nails are now at a practical yet feminine length, and they aren&#x27;t as flexible as they used to be -- I used to be able to dent my nails at the edge because they were so soft and now they&#x27;re tough stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do my nails look good?: Darn right they do. My boyfriend loves how they look now (he used to complain about how my thin nails would be particularly scratchy). There is a slight pink to them, but it&#x27;s REALLY slight.  They&#x27;re as fleshy as your nail beds, and make your nails look *liquid shiny*. I love holding them to the light and admiring them like some vain teenager. But I honestly have never had such amazing nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to retake photos if my nails showed up in an instagram or snapchat but now I can&#x27;t wait to find an excuse to show them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether it&#x27;s the product entirely or partially, I love what introducing this to my life has done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend completely.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Everyone asks me where I get my nails done.. I tell them I do them myself.and tell everyone they have to go and buy this polish..I will never buy another gel.but this one</li>
            <li> Its amazing! Once you try it you will love it. It is so glossy it looks like it still isn&#x27;t dry but it is. Also I wore some nail polish with this as a top coat for over a week and it didn&#x27;t chip until the last day and I play sports where regular nail polish chips in less than a day.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this product &amp; bought it at my local Rite Aid for $10 when I saw it. I figured I could easily refund it if it wasn&#x27;t any good. I love this type of optical brightening nail product &amp; have tried many different kinds, from very low end (Blue Cross $3) to very high end (Dior Nail Glow $24, it&#x27;s fantastic but very expensive...&amp; the most expensive of all is Perfect Formula Pink Gel Coat $30 yikes!) - they all do a beautiful job of brightening the nails, but the problem with most of them is that they peel off in sheets after some kind of water exposure, especially after showering or swimming. So the product would peel off &amp; I could never enjoy a nice looking manicure for more than a day or two. I HATE that. In my experience, the only products that don&#x27;t peel off with water exposure are Dior Nail Glow (pink optical tint) &amp; Zeva Nail Bright (blue-ish optical tint).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to find that Pink Armor doesn&#x27;t peel off instantly either! It doesn&#x27;t have as much durable staying power as the ones mentioned above, but it will generally last me a good 5 days of vigorous wear &amp; tear throughout my work week, with only minor chips (I keep my nails very short), especially if I wear it under Dior Gel Coat (my favorite strong top coat that has a lot of endurance). My bare nails look very dull &amp; blah but with 1 or 2 coats of Nail Armor they come alive with a perky, fresh, youthful, clean, healthy pink glow that looks natural, &amp; particularly vibrant in bright daylight &amp; sunlight (this product will also glow white under blacklight). The overall effect is subtle yet noticeable. I&#x27;m enjoying the look of this product even more than my expensive Dior Nail Glow. I spent all of last summer wearing Dior Nail Glow exclusively &amp; now I find myself choosing Nail Armor all the time instead. It even wears well as a base coat under color to prevent yellow stains in my nails. This product is the easiest way to have a beautiful, natural manicure with the least effort. (It doesn&#x27;t look like a gel manicure, the formula is very thin &amp; any ridges or imperfections in the nail will show through despite multiple coats, but the color is lovely. A thick top coat like Dior Gel Coat works well to turn ridges into glass-like smoothness.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the Nail Armor price doesn&#x27;t break the bank (although it&#x27;s not the cheapest either, but it&#x27;s way more affordable than Dior) &amp; that it&#x27;s readily available at most local drugstores (as well as here on Amazon for almost the same price). I appreciate that the bottle is the customary 1/2 ounce size that all nailpolishes used to be, whereas nowadays many companies are scrimping down to 1/3 ounce &amp; raising prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially skeptical &amp; I&#x27;m glad this turned out to be a great product (for me at least). I will continue to buy it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> Was looking forward to good results after seeing many commercials on TV.  Did not happen.  My nails continued to peel after following the directions to a T.  I found another brand in The Vermont Country Store catalogue that really  works. Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I bought it at Walmart the 1st time i paid $10 and loved it so much i bought another one but since it was now $5 I bought 3. I have spent so much money on different nail products over the years with no changes in my nails and I have never written a review of a product BUT this stuff works. 2 thumbs up. PINK ARMOR nail gel is the best nail stuff i have used. My nails so good and I can tap my nails I am so HAPPY.</li>
            <li> I am 49 years old and have NEVER had long nails!  I have suffered with ugly, thin, splitting weak nails my entire life. This is the first and only product that has given me absolutely long beautiful strong nails with white tips.  The secret is to apply 2 coats at night time and then one coat every day for a week - then start all over again. You will see results very very quickly.  Best time to apply is at night before bed - I have never had a problem with the polish peeling off unless I apply in the day and use hot water within a few hours.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle and absolutely love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I have had very dry brittle nails that split right up in to the bed of the nail. After using Pink Armor polish for one month my nails had grown longer than they had in years without breaking, and the white dry lines were gone. Later it didn&#x27;t seem to work as well but now I know after reading information on the web, NOT TO WASH MY HANDS after taking the polish off but to put the polish back on using a THIN COAT...another mistake I was making... putting it on too thick. Nail polish should also not be stored in the bathroom because of the changes of temperature but in a dark place. I just took off the UV Gel I had done in a salon that didn&#x27;t even last a week, chipped off the edges and peeled from the cuticle. Now that I learned what I did, I am back to Pink Armor.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to see the Pink Armor Nail Gel be available on-line, since my local WalMartt store seemed to be out of it permanently.</li>
            <li> I have never had strong nails ever.  In fact my Mom reminds me they&#x27;ve been paper thin since birth.  I&#x27;ve tried Shellac and love the look but the weight of all the layers made them crack off very low on the nail bed.  I bought this but didn&#x27;t use it right away.  Started last week and now have longer stronger nails.  I wouldn&#x27;t call the color fluorescent but more light pinkish unless I&#x27;m in blue light where they are almost lavender.  I don&#x27;t know how many layer I applied because I would add one when I thought about it.  It did start to peel off here and there but it&#x27;s helping more than than hurt.  I definitely didn&#x27;t have to use acetone as with Shellac, although I could just pick that off too.  I prefer not to overtly damage my nails with chemicals.  Despite the peeling and $9 price I will buy again.  I&#x27;ve seen it cheaper online.</li>
            <li> I never had strong nails in my life and now have to file them down every week to keep the growth under control. Got my mom and best friend to start using it too. One piece of advice, follow the directions! Do thin coats and let it dry thoroughly in between. If you lay it on too thick it will peel off.</li>
            <li> Only been using this for a few days, but I already see a difference in my nails. Great!</li>
            <li> did not like this at all. Expensive and did not do what it was supposed to, peeled off after 1-2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was more expensive than I wanted to pay, especially since it did not do what it was supposed to. Peeled off after only 1-2 days.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have always had fragile nails and Pink Armor Nail Gel helps so much.&lt;br /&gt;to the negative reviews about it peeling off when you wash your hands, of course it will. Common sense. My expensive nail polish still peels off when I wash dishes. It&#x27;s best to use before bed. If you are always using your hands, like myself especially being an artist, I can&#x27;t ever wear nail polish on my hands.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used&lt;br /&gt;Never had so many compliments on my nails.  I&#x27;m even having to cut them.....they get too long and oh, so white.  Now, here&#x27;s my question......been using for about a year.  Just developed fungus under one of my long beautiful nail.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone else have this problem??????  I&#x27;m so disappointed.  I LOVE THIS STUFF!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Any suggestions about getting rid of fungus???????&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think, after a year, it had anything to do with this product.  Hope to hear from others&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I have been wearing tips for years and decided to give my nail bed a break. I took off my tips and my real nails started to grow but were paper thin. I would polich them to keep them strong but because I type all day my nails will crack and break. I was looking on line and saw this product. I read all the review and decided what the hell I&#x27;ll buy it to see if it works. My package came right on time about 3 days from my order date. I cleaned my nails and put on 2 coats. I went to the gym and work and I can see that my nails are shining and strong. I went to get a manni and pedi and had them use my Pink Armor nail polish and you can see the difference on my nail bed. I can say this was the best $10 that I have spent. Now I know the commercial states &amp;#34; Strong enough to put your hands in a bed of rocks, which out the worry of chipping a nail&amp;#34; but honestly what woman would do that. Trust me spend the $10 and get great protection for your nail bed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is crap.  Yes it does make your nails look pretty and the beds pinker and the tips whiter BUT it cracks and breaks your nails so bad!!!  My nails have always cracked but a lot worse with this stuff.  Not worth the money at all.  It breaks and chips your nails but it hardens them till they are brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00B8Z2LRQ Pink Armor Nail Gel As Seen On TV]]</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle at CVS, like others I&#x27;ve been loyal to Sally Hansen, the miracle growth with silk fibers specifically has worked well for years of on and off getting gel/acrylic nails, after this last time I swore off the fakeys and decided to grow out my natural nails again, saw the Pink Armor at my local CVS and thought what the heck, I had extra bucks afterall so it was virtually free, after the 2nd day, I bought another bottle to make sure I don&#x27;t run out, ever.  It&#x27;s fantastic!!!!  Especially if you have a French tip white pen with a coat or two over it, the pink sheen, when outside, is soooo pretty and my nails are seriously strong, not bending what-so-ever, and getting long quick.  I have no idea why it&#x27;s not working for others, but can tell you from my experience it works wonders, even with fake nail damage!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at CVS and when I wento buy it again the store wasn&#x27;t carrying it. So I purchased it at Amazon and for cheaper too. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I can get two weeks or more out of my polish now. I might have to touch up the tips after a week or more but then it continues to last. I can even use darker colors or reds and they last.  I have told all my friends about it.</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful nail polish, treatment I have ever used.  It is so good I don&#x27;t go for manicures anymore.  It has stopped a damaged spot one  nail that continually broke.  It doesn&#x27;t break anymore</li>
            <li> I like the pink sheen on the nails.  It protects my nails from cracking and chipping.</li>
            <li> I am a 70 year old woman with easily split nails, with ridges. . I tried Pink Armor over a month ago and am THRILLED to finally have a wonderful full set of my own nails. I never saw an ad... Just saw a package at my Rite Aid for $9.99 and decided to try it. I apply additional coats over my pale pink polish and remove and redo once a week.  I have ordered several more bottles so I always have it on hand.  I will no longer need to pay for manicures and can maintain lovely looking nails myself.</li>
            <li> I have been using only pink armor for two years now,people ask me if I just had a French manicure it looks that great.I take off every 7 days then restart with 2 coats then 1Coat every 2-3 days , they are strong healthy looking,people don&#x27;t believe I do it myself. I find it very cheap at bed bath and beyond with my 20 percent coupon it&#x27;s only $7.00 yeah. I must be on bottle 8 now, everyone should try it and give it six weeks you&#x27;ll see the difference then and never change again Guarantee!!!!!! The best ,good luck, and beAutiful nails.p</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Once applied to your nails, these look gorgeous!!! However, it&#x27;s a pain to apply it everyday and remove it every week, especially it your nail polish remover isn&#x27;t that great. But, if you let your nails continue to grow without removing the armour, it looks hideous. On the otherhand, this doesn&#x27;t really promote nail growth, but it makes it look really nice. I personally am in LUV with the flourecent pink color it gives your nails, but hate taking an hour to take them off everyweek. But, overall, this is a beautiful polish and reccommended to all! :)</li>
            <li> A year away from the big 6-0 and my nails have weakened, splitting easily. I stopped wearing acrylic nails 10 years ago after wearing them for about 15 years. While my nails were damaged when I stopped, most of that damage was gone in about a year. About 2 years ago, nail polish began peeling and chipping off the day after I applied it, completely off most nails within 4 days. I have recently been using the alcohol wipes to clean off any oils prior to applying polish and that has extended my polish wear by a day or two. I prefer to wear clear/clear-pink polish, but have been unable to find the darker pink tinted, clear polish in my area. I saw the Pink Armor and decided to give it a try.    I washed my hands thoroughly, leaving them to air dry for at least 15 minutes, then applied the first coat. It did dry quickly, but I still waited about 10 minutes before applying the second coat. I then let that dry for two hours before putting my hands in any water. The next day I applied a third coat and allowed that to dry 15 minutes before using my hands. Two days later, the polish is still fully intact...no peeling or chipping.    The color is not exactly what I expected. Under medium indoor lighting, my nails look healthy...natural looking pink nails with brighter white tips. But under bright lights and sunshine (I live in Arizona!), the pink color is a weird, almost neon pinkish lavender with really bright white tips...kinda takes away the \\&quot;natural healthy\\&quot; look.    So I give it a 5 star for staying on my nails where other polishes won&#x27;t, a 5 because my nails do look better, and a 3 for the color. While I do agree the price is very HIGH, it doesn&#x27;t affect the performance of the product, so it does not affect my rating.    UPDATE: Okay, I&#x27;ve been wearing this for about 2 weeks now, and for me, I do like this polish over others I&#x27;ve tried recently. The first week, the tips began peeling a little on day four so I added another coat...problem solved. On day eight, I removed the polish easily, and again painted two coats as described above. For the past week, I&#x27;ve added another coat every other day, and I&#x27;ve had no problem with peeling, chipping, etc.     I&#x27;ve also noticed my nails do look better, and seem to be stronger. No breaking, splitting, or bending easily as before.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! It is the only thing I can put on my nails to make them grow. When I have this polish on, my nails are very strong.  Also the color has only a slight pink color.  It&#x27;s more clear than pink. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is one product that really helps my nail to grow.</li>
            <li> This really works. I used to wear false nails, now my grow so I have to trim them monthly. Can also purchase @ CVS, but home online shopping is more my style seeing I don&#x27;t drive.</li>
            <li> This product did not stay on my nails and peeled off very easily. I also do not believe that it did anything to strengthen my nails at all. Not really as described/advertised.</li>
            <li> I saw this product in a catalog went to the website and found out i could buy it at Walgreens. Got in my car drove to the store and bought it ... it was fantastic for the first few weeks.  It says to apply it twice a week so i put it on one day and left it for 3 then removed it and reapplied it. My nails were gorgeous ... long, strong and beautiful. about the 4th week i forgot to remove it mid-week and noticed after 7 days if my nail bumped something it would break off like a chunk of concrete. I removed the polish and let them breathe for a day or two and that is when i noticed my nails peeling. layer after layer the nail would peel off and would tear to the quick ... i filed them all down and now i cannot get them to grow and i have white spots on my nails ... i&#x27;m thinking it must have some of the same ingredients as sculpted nails so when they&#x27;re removed the nail bed is damaged for a while. I hope there is recovery here because my nails have never looked this bad ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has anyone experienced this?</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My nails are growing and look much healthier.  It takes time and if you use as directed, it DOES work.  It also does stay on longer than other polishes.</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks! It peels almost as soon as it dries.  My nails dont seem any better with it than it  did before I used it.  Water makes it peel even faster.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this online but in Walmart.  Total waste of money!!  This is the same as a $.99 bottle of clear polish from a dollar store.  I have always had thin brittle nails that split and break easily and yes, this polish helps, but no better than a cheap bottle of clear polish you can buy anywhere.  I thought the word &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; suggested it would be thicker and add more to my nails but it&#x27;s just as thin as a regular cheap nail polish, maybe even thinner.  Save your money and get 10 bottles of $.99 polish because in my opinion, it will work the same.  Or put the money you are considering spending on this product toward a better one. I hate being duped and don&#x27;t usually make hasty decisions on products I buy, however, my kids were fighting and driving me nuts in Walmart and I was under stress so I ended up making a bad choice.</li>
            <li> After taking off my acrylic nails, I tried Pink Armor.  My natural nails were always thin, splitting, peeling, etc. (that&#x27;s why I had acrylics).  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  Pink Armor has enabled me to have my own nails.  No peeling, splitting, etc. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and will never be without it.  I apply it every day, take it off after 7 days and start again. I think the people who pan this product have not used it as directed.</li>
            <li> This has been the best thing ever for my nails. I am ordering my 3rd bottle.  It has worked and I have tried everything.</li>
            <li> I  love this nail polish it makes my nails real strong and lets them grown long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Pink Gel Coat for years because I love the look on my nails (pinker nail beds, whiter nail tips) but a) didn&#x27;t like the $30+/ bottle price b) my nails always and I mean ALWAYS peel and chip within 24 hours of application and c) the goo thickens and is unusable after a few weeks (compared to every other polish or treatment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Pink Armour in a pharmacy and doubted for 1/3 the price, it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does! As a bonus, it doesn&#x27;t thicken as described above and extra-bonus? It dries in a snap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I still have to re-do my nails every day or two BUT I was already doing that. I do not recommend this product for nail growth/ anti-breakage but for a 2 minute complete faux french mani? Thank you, yes.</li>
            <li> Extends the life of the Revlon Gel manicure by days and days and my nails bad badf shape will peel with normal polish in one day I use this with Revlon no light manicure. This alone does not have the strength to keep my weak acrylic damaged nails from bending and braking.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this product, I thought I was getting a good deal at two bottles for the price of one.  After the initial buy, you have to pay $20 a bottle as opposed to $20 for two bottles.  It took a long time for me to receive the product but I must say that I am satisfied.  Of course it doesn&#x27;t work overnight.  I mean, who actually believes that you can rub your nails on a bed of rocks and not get a scratch. Puleeeze.  Many people compare this product to one sold by Sephora called Pink Gel or something like that.  My review is not based on which of the two is better.  All I know is that the one from Sephora is more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for several weeks and I must say that it does not work overnight but I have seen an improvement in my nails which are ruined from getting the Pink and White at my local salon (they do a fabulous job).  I had to stop getting them done as it does get expensive plus you need to let your nails \\&quot;breathe\\&quot;.  With that being said, this is not the first time that I have let my nails \\&quot;breathe\\&quot;.  However this is the first time that I have let them \\&quot;breathe\\&quot; and the nail product has helped to make my nails stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how I used Pink Armor.  For my feet during the winter, I don&#x27;t color my toenails as no one is going to see them so I put two coats of Pink Armor and let my feet dry in a UV lamp.  The Pink Armor last as long as 3 or more weeks without chipping.  I had to use acetone to remove the Pink Armor and re coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my nails I either use two coats and let dry under the UV lamp.  If I am feeling up to some pampering then I do this.  I slap on one coat of Pink Armor, two coats of my favorite nail polish (Revlon or Avon) and one coat of Pink Armor as a top coat and let them dry in UV lamp for at least 3 minutes or more.  If I am not reckless with my hands, the manicure can endure up to a week or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again this is a review of Pink Armor not Pink Gel from Sephora.</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of money.  It peeled off my nails when I was hand washing some dishes.  Do not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 bottles, the shipping expense was greater than the item.  One bottle arrived empty but the other was fine.  I used it and now at almost 2 weeks since applying it, my nails still look really good.  this seems to be a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Great Product! .. This stuff is awesome, works just like it claims to! Will be buying again and would make a great gift for others!</li>
            <li> i can not say enough about this product:  i had thin-brittle-weak nails  until  i used this product !  honest  - for  past 3 weeks  i have put new 2  coats on each week &amp; have  long - strong and  beautiful nails now  i even stopped biting mu cuticles -thank you for this product  -  please sell it in bulk if possible  though ??</li>
            <li> The seller is fast and reliable. The product does work and it does help your nails especially if you have discoloration nails. When using the product always have patience because it will take a while for the nails to get brighter and pinker.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with how well Pink Armor has been working on my nails and at such an affordable price!  I have been reapplying when it suggest to, and my weak, brittle nails have become much stronger.  I can finally really grow my nails out like I&#x27;ve always wanted to without them breaking and cracking every other day.  I also really enjoy the pink-glossy finish it leaves behind.  Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I normally do not fill out reviews however I don&#x27;t want another person to become a victim so I am taking the time to write this review.  A co worker of my saw the TV commercial for Pink Armor and told me about it.  Pink Armor.com offered buy one bottle for $10 get one free and if you ordered that day you also received a free manicure set. My coworker and I decided to split an order.  We placed the order in September 2012.  I received an email saying Pink Armor was on back order 2 days after I placed my order.  I never heard anything again about my order and to be honest I forgot about it.  6 months later March 2013 I received a package in the mail to my surprise it was the Pink Armor Order. In the box there were 2 bottle of Pink Armor, 2 bottles of clear nail polish and 2 Manicure sets which by the way look cheaper than a set you can purchase at the 99 cent stores. I was shocked when I looked at the billing invoice.  My credit card was charged $48.96!!! I called the Pink Armor customer service and was told there is nothing they can do but if I want I can send the package back I asked for a return label and was told I would have to pay for return shipping plus I would not be refunded the $14.98 I was charged for S&amp;H.  Don&#x27;t be fooled like I was, this is a scam do not give Pink Armor.com your credit card number like I did.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  Before using this product my nails were slightly brittle.  Then I used this product and my nails looks healthy than ever.</li>
            <li> I found this product in the \\&quot;as seen on TV\\&quot; section at Walgreens I did not order it online so this is a review of the product NOT the actual pink armor official site.  I have been using this for about a month and there are some great and some not so great things.  First off- You cannot rub your freshly painted nails in a pile of rocks and expect it not to scratch- come on who actually believed that anyway.  2nd- I do not think that this makes my nails any stronger than normal nail polish definitely not as strong as actual gel nail polish that has to be cured with a UV light but there are trade offs.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the good things-First- Absolutely LOVE the way my painted nails look, they are pinkish (almost fluorescent) not sure if the whites are whiter but at least they do not turn \\&quot;orangeish or yellowish\\&quot; if you paint your nails you know what I mean. 2nd- This stuff dries VERY quickly I paint one hand then the other right away and when the 2nd hand is painted the first hand is dry and ready for another coat.  I usually put 3 coats on right away (takes about 5-10 minutes that includes both hands and dry time) then one coat every other day just to keep it fresh looking.  I usually remove everything once a week and start over.  3rd- This can be removed with normal nail polish remover ( I do use acetone based remover not sure if Non acetone remover would work the same) But no soaking for 20 minutes like with UV cure gel polish, just put on a cotton ball and rub off like any other nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;NOTES- After I remove the polish I wash my hands with warm soapy water and use an old toothbrush to scrub them clean (a little toothpaste on the toothbrush works wonders to keep your nails healthy and clean). Before I re-polish my nails I put 99% alcohol on a cotton swab and wipe my nails to make sure all oil is removed, then I paint them and it usually lasts a week without peeling off (I have had a terrible time getting nail polish to NOT peel off my nails I have used many brands and base coats and even a salon manicure peels off in a few days unless it is the UV cure Gel polish). If you have the same problem try the alcohol step it might work with any polish.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use this if for nothing else the quick dry time, week long staying power and pretty pink color.ands and base coats and even a salon manicure peels off in a few days unless it is the UV cure Gel polish). If you have the same problem try the alcohol step it might work with any polish.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use this if for nothing else the quick dry time, week long staying power and pretty pink color.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail hardener on the market - I&#x27;ve tried them all.  I don&#x27;t understand all the bad reviews, but this has worked wonders on my nails.  I was using a similar product at $30 a bottle, this product does the exact same thing, only less expensive.  I use two coats as a base, apply a color, then use two more coats as a top coat.  I apply once or twice daily, repeat process in a week. The manicure lasts the whole week &amp; never chips.  I&#x27;ve done the dishes, some yard work, housecleaning, computer work, and NOTHING happened to my manicure - it looked the same as it did the first day I did my nails. I&#x27;m a very happy customer and hope this item is always available.  My nails are no longer soft, brittle or peeling. They are strong &amp; hard &amp; have grown to a nice length.</li>
            <li> It makes my nails shine and gives them a hardness without having to go to a salon every wee or so.</li>
            <li> After one day of applying the polish, it starts peeling and nails still break. It does not make them stronger as it suggests. I would like to return it.</li>
            <li> I have very thin nails that peel like paper. I bought this product on a whim and my nails have grown for the first time in years!!! It fills in the creases in my nails and protects them from everything....I am amazed girls!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews. My nails are beautiful for the first time in years. They are growing well and the pink armor makes it look like I almost have a french manicure. Love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff ruined my nails! They chipped, broke and split far worse than ever before using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Such a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;Chris Robert</li>
            <li> This product is not at all as good as it is advertised to be and the price is way to high!  Not very happy at all would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have used this before when I had a problem with my nails. I&#x27;ve always had pretty nails, but as I got older my nails became brittle and split all the time. This product is for real. My nails started growing again after using this.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my fingernails and I can truly say it has strengthened them. I would recommend this product and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> It really works because I notice something about a week later.My nails started to grow out very quickly and stronger well let  me you tell when all started out but first I try a  different  Sally  Hansen nail growth for many years,it doesn&#x27;t seems to for me because I have a very thin and weak brittle, they are very fuddle they could break easy at anytime when they get in the  Certain length I find couldn&#x27;t find any Solution to stop it! Until one day when I turn the Chunnel on the my tv and the solution that will help me they  the pink armor is the answer I try get it on tv but I waiting to patient,until they sold it on amazon the moment I though  they  wasn&#x27;t sold on amazon it on was on they  own website but finally I was shock they was sold on amazon, sooo I ordering on this online then I  a week right after I using it I started notice something my nails starting to grew very out quickly and stronger I was shock, I  been has my hands in the water to wash dishes and do the house chores everyday a lot  I very I just like amaze  what I just saw I wouldn&#x27;t have go back to nail salon ever again for awhile because all that stuff  they put on your nails it will do some damage, to your healthy nails I will to you  referral with this product  this a good  stuff!</li>
            <li> Great product!! When I first began using it I had the same peeling/chipping problem as some other reviewers. I did find a way to make it last longer without chipping.  Instead of applying 2 coats of pink armour like I had been doing, I applied 1 coat of pink armour and a clear topcoat. It&#x27;s been over a week with no chipping/peeling at all. Now this stuff isn&#x27;t thick like gel, but it does work. My nails resisted breaking as long as the pink armour was on. And most importantly it make my nail look like I went to the salon and had a manicure. You can apply it to the whole nail and it automatically make the fleshy part of your nail look more pink and the tips look more white. Love it!!</li>
            <li> This product has great advertising but doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s hype. Fine to use as an undercoat for your polish.</li>
            <li> My nails look great after using this so strong ... thumbs up</li>
            <li> Enjoying health nail and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest product for all week protection and conditioning nails. Fast and efficient delivery.</li>
            <li> My nails were destroyed after getting a gel manicure for a wedding.&lt;br /&gt;After buying this product I put a fresh coat on each Sunday. For repeat applications I always take off the old coat and clean my hands. With this process I haven&#x27;t had any irregular peeling issues. After three weeks my nails have returned to their former glory. No more gel manicure for me.&lt;br /&gt;The pink color it&#x27;s subtle, and most notable in sunlight. Overall looks nice and works well.</li>
            <li> I HAVE ALMOST FINISHED HALF THE BOTTLE AND LOVE THE WAY IT HAS HELPED MY NAILS, THEY ARE NORMALLY SOFT AND PEEL BUT NOW THEY ARE HARD AND LONG</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but I&#x27;ve used this for over a month now and for the first time in my life, my nails are long and strong. I&#x27;ve worn it for over a week before and only had one small area that peeled away. I&#x27;m allergic to sculptured nails, badly, so I haven&#x27;t been able to have pretty nails like my friends and family members that get theirs done...which makes my husband happy since it is expensive, Lolllllll. Pink Armor allows me to have pretty nails for the first time in my life. I&#x27;ve tried Sally Hansen product, as well a others, but I&#x27;ve never had success with those. When washing dishes or doing anything that requires you to have your hands soaking a lot, it&#x27;s always a better to wear gloves. I couldn&#x27;t tell you how well this would hold up if I didn&#x27;t wear gloves when washing dishes. All I know is it holds up well and I consider myself rough on my hands. I&#x27;ll never use anything else. Also, don&#x27;t know about it making my nail tips look whiter but my husband did remark at how nice it made my nails look.</li>
            <li> I have very brittle nails that are constantly splitting and will not keep nail polish on for more then 2 days. I thought this would work? I tried it and 2 days later it was peeling off and my nails were still splitting at the top of my nail. It did not seem to work for me but might for others. I have heard good and not so good from others. I think it depends on the individual.</li>
            <li> I like this polish, it works and it doesn&#x27;t get thick before you get to the bottom of the bottle.  I was also impressed with the way it stayed on all week.</li>
            <li> This nail polish it is like a drug, it looks amazing but in the end your nails will die. I used it and for 2 weeks it was great but that i did not have the time to redo my nail as intructed by PINK ARMOR and my naills broke, crack, exfoliate, and even if you cut them it still bad  and not going to help. I stop using it and after one month my nail are still destroyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry but this is not a choice unless you want to do your nails every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not recomend this product.</li>
            <li> This item is amazing it really does what it says it does, I am elderly and it is common for my age groups nails to split and peel.  Since I began using this product I actually have pretty nails again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Nail Armor</li>
            <li> protects my nails and helps them grow</li>
            <li> My nails are thin and weak . . forever splitting, cracking, and breaking.  I&#x27;ve used more products that I can remember, in attempts to strengthen them.  Pink Armor is the first product I&#x27;ve used that actually has made a difference in the strength and appearance of my nails.  It doesn&#x27;t chip or wear off.  I applied several coats, and removing it took a little elbow grease (or something stronger than regular nail polish remover).  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for only a couple of weeks, and so far, I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  I plan to purchase more.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product to help my manicure last longer. I had my nails done at a salon and had them use the pink armor as the base coat and top coat as it advertises. By the 2nd day, one of my nails peeled and by the end of the week, my nails were chipped. My nails held up better with just the regular base and top coat. I was very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this from a TV commercial, not through Amazon. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and it has worked well on my weak, brittle nails - they are growing out. I still do get small snags on the tips,depending on what I&#x27;m doing; but all in all, my nails are growing out as they did when I had shellacs on. It stays on well and comes off easily.  I am not sure it is actually improving my nail health, or just creating a bit of a tough barrier.  It doesn&#x27;t do as it claims to make the nails look pink or the tips look whiter, but it gives them a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> Best product that I&#x27;ve tried of this type, and costs less. Others that I know that have tried it, love it.</li>
            <li> I am not able to use too many nail products as I am sensitive to many chemicals.  I saw this at CVS recently and decided to try it.  For the first time in probably 10 years, I actually look like I have a nice manicure.  I type 10 hours sometimes more a day.  I have had this on my nails for 4 days now.  It has not chipped and with the slight pink tint, my nails look healthy.  I will purchase it again.  The only negative is that it does have a strong smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this from my local store. I have been very satisfied. It dries quick, stays on, does not peel, looks pretty. Im very hard on my hands and to date this is the best product for my nails. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product and now I&#x27;m disappointed. My nails chipped and broke by the 3rd week.  The polish kept chipping and I had to keep re-applying. It was a waste of money and I&#x27;m telling you not to make the same mistake I did!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products for my weak, soft nails, nothing really worked. I bought this gel not really thinking it would work but it does, beautifully. It is thicker than most polish so two coats seems to be enough. It doesn&#x27;t last a week for me but I&#x27;m hard on my nails with frequent hand washing. I&#x27;m even growing out one nail that is very damaged and never grows well. Amazing.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought me one of these a year so so ago and I have used it ever since.  Nice looking nails, strong and healthy looking. You can apply color over it but they looks so good with just the pink armor that I stick to that.  If you can find a little white pencil for under your nail tips your nails look french tipped.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff I have had troubles growing my nails in the past but this stuff works great</li>
            <li> After wearing salon hard gel nails for a few months my nails were thin as paper, discolored, splitting into the quick - in short: a total mess. So my salon applied a &amp;#34;miracle product&amp;#34; they said would &amp;#34;fix me right up&amp;#34;. B.S. Didn&#x27;t do anything except lighten my wallet. The splitting, peeling, snagging &amp; pain went on for weeks.  Then I remembered the forgotten bottle of Pink Armor at the back of the cabinet. I dug it out. I cleaned my nails, and put on 2 coats of the Pink Armor. In less than a week the splitting stopped and my nails looked healthy. And today the gals at my ladies luncheon asked how I managed to keep my nails looking so nice! Pink Armor is amazing. In less than 2 weeks my bare nails are stronger, almost &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; and have grown enough that I have to file them!! I&#x27;ll be using Pink Armor as long as they are making it. Period.</li>
            <li> I have tried any number of products to help out my sad, sad nails. They have short, little beds and are not much thicker than tissue paper. My mother, who has the same kind of nails (thanks for the genes, mom!) could not get a result out of this. It would peel almost within the hour of her painting it on. HOWEVER, I tried it and wow! I painted them twice a week and within about 10 days I actually had nails past my fingertips. They were still a bit bendy but so much thicker and stronger. And they continued to maintain for about three months. Then I got lazy and did not reapply a coat even once a week, all my nails were awful. (Of course, doing gardening without gloves does not help either.) But once I started using this once a week again, presto! Back to beautiful nails.</li>
            <li> This item is used frequently.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe, I didn&#x27;t think it will happen but my nails gotten healthier looking overnight!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for such a nice invention!</li>
            <li> I was in the process of removing my gel nails which made my real ones very soft.  I applied Pink Armor and have not have 1 breakage in my nails since.</li>
            <li> I bought pink armor because my nails were breaking. I used it for 8 weeks, and no improvement was there.&lt;br /&gt;I do not like the product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I am glad I found it. You put it on your nails once a week. After a couple of weeks you will notice your nails are getting longer. And they are not as brittle as they were before. Which is good for me. Thanks nail armor. :)</li>
            <li> Love this but it wont last long. After a month or two the gel will start bubbling when applied.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walmart about a month ago, and I have it on my nails at all times and my nails are stronger and grow faster. I have my hands in dishwater ever single day (more than once) and my manicure stays put. I don&#x27;t know why some people are having problems with it, for me it works wonders. My hands and nails go through a lot and I have always had brittle nails that as soon as any white would show they would split.</li>
            <li> The Pink Armor is a good product for the nails and toes. My typical manicures are lasting longer than a few days.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that this might finally be the answer to my problem nails.  It&#x27;s not, I felt like they must have sent the wrong bottle.  This was no different than putting on a topcoat and it didn&#x27;t keep my nails from splitting, Kind of expensive for a top coat .</li>
            <li> Got this at bed bath and beyond and used it as a base and top coat and it works very well. My nails used to chip all the time I wouldn&#x27;t even bother doing my nails because they would get chipped at work but this product worked wonders! The polish stayed on in chipped for about a week until I had to take it off much longer than my polish regularly stayed on. I was looking for somewhere to write a review because I really like this. Don&#x27;t know why people are giving it bad reviews they probably expect too much from it.</li>
            <li> Love Pink Armor Nail growth I have bought several of this item, bought one for my daughter for Christmas and she is thrilled with it.  I recommend it</li>
            <li> I placed this item in my cart and accidentally removed it when purchasing a bunch of other items.  Was bummed out but quickly became excited when I found it in CVS. I applied it immediately and was very excited with results. My nails which are usually long and whitish in color (i wanted them whiter) were transformed into a beautiful rosy color and looked the healthiest I have ever seen them. Because of their attractive natural look I wore Pink Armour alone.  Approximately 2 - 2 1/2 weeks later I noticed a very slight white patch in the center of one of my thumbnails. I assumed it was the nail polish lifting from my finger and so removed it a few days later to to reapply.  Upon removing the polish it became clear that what had actually happened , my nail was peeling deeply in the MIDDLE of my nail bed.  Ever the optimist I convinced myself this was a fluke and kept in on my other fingers...bad move.  I now have three fingers that have deep peels in the middle of my nail beds. I had to cut my nails as low as possible because it is obvious they would rip if they get caught on anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, each time I immerse my hands in water i have to use a cuticle trimmer to snip the nail in the middle of my finger.  The nail underneath is extremely thin (a level above the skin) and very sensitive.  My friends who have seen my fingers are mortified and actually told me i should sue. I think it is more important that I warn people that this could happen.  I use my hands a lot in conversation and have been hiding my hands because they are so unattractive and I catch people staring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there are many who will simply believe this is an isolated case (and it might well be) but it is worth doing a test on one finger (maybe a pinky) for a free weeks to see if you have a similar reaction.  I do not know what will happen when the peeling gets to the top of my nail bed but I image it will be painful. I hope this helps someone. Someone needs to figure out what is in this stuff. It is NOT SAFE!!! Would give negative stars if I could!!</li>
            <li> Got this yesterday and I love it,it really does turn the nail bed pink and the whites are whiter had this on since yesterday no chips.and is pretty without any other polish .</li>
            <li> I am a nurse&lt;br /&gt; and wash my hands a lot and I have natural soft nail. I have tried many products to strengthen them....but this product actually works with just one coat and leaving it on for weeks. Good product, especially for an infomercial find.</li>
            <li> The product does what it says it will do, and my nails have never looked better.  The only drawback would be the pink color.  I use a colored nail polish first, and then put the gel on last.  Your nails stay looking &amp;#34;just polished&amp;#34; for at least a week.  You then have to go through the polish and gel again due to the growth of your nails.  I don&#x27;t care for the pink either by itself or with a base coat...too pinky.</li>
            <li> Thanks to years of taking glucosamine/chrondriton/msm, I have very strong nails. However, the corners of my nails do peel a little on occasion. So I decided to give Pink Armor nail gel a try. I apply a base coat of the Pink Armor, then a coat of a more opaque nail polish like Wishful Pinking, then a top coat of Pink Armor. I get a look similar to the gel nail manicures I got at the salon years ago, without the hassle of the application and curing process. I do my nails twice a week and Pink Armor lasts well between applications. I will be buying more of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I&#x27;ve found is that putting more than two coats of the Pink Armor nail gel on your nails makes for a very funky pink color. So I limit it to a base and top coat.</li>
            <li> so far so good it seems to do what it says it does. manicure is lasting longer than usually does</li>
            <li> I love how my nails look but it peeled after the 2 days of applying. I can&#x27;t do the dishes without them peeling.</li>
            <li> Scary to think that you buy a product to strengthen your nails and it actually has the terrible opposite effect!  My nails were flimsy before but now they crack and peel continuously... One month after discontinued use.  Cutting them does not help!  Oh my, when will my nails come back to normal?!?</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff. Her nails don&#x27;t peel, chip, or break anymore. They grow longer, faster. She used to have very yellow nails-now they look healthy.</li>
            <li> My nails have always been soft and easily broke.  Saw commercial and after using once, I saw a difference.  Nails are stronger and appear prettier.  I would recommend anyone to try it.</li>
            <li> After 3 days, the polish on one of my nails peeled off in 1 sheet.  I looked down &amp; had a \\&quot;naked nail.\\&quot;  I repolished it last night thinking it was a fluke.  Today I have 1 more completely naked nail and one 1/2 naked nail.  On both the polish appears to have just peeled right off.  I&#x27;m done with this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I have horrible, problem nails with lots of ridges, peeling, chipping and splitting. I have been using this product for several weeks, and it actually made my nails worse. Don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li> it is a nice nail gel and i have seen some result, however it is not a wonder product as is implied</li>
            <li> I have had weak nails all my life and always had fake nails, but tired of having fill-ins so I tried this product and am thrilled with my results! I now have strong nails and enjoy doing my nails at home. I recommend Pink Armor to anyone who has the same problem.</li>
            <li> My nails have always chipped and peeled easily.  I saw this product in Walgreen&#x27;s and thought it worth a try.  However, I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months, and, if anything, my nails are more brittle than before.  However, I don&#x27;t reapply every day--maybe just once per week, and then do a fresh coat every week.</li>
            <li> Recently, I purchased the last package of the Pink Armor Nail Gel from the Walgreen&#x27;s in my neighborhood.  Oh my Lord!  I love it.  Two coats and white nail pencil underneath the nails and it&#x27;s supremely beautiful.  After a week, instead of cleaning the polish off, I simply applied another coat and I couldn&#x27;t believe my nails were even more beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came to Amazon and purchased three bottles of this miracle nail polish and gifted one to my best friend.  No wonder, I can&#x27;t find the Sally Hansen Clear Tint nail polish of old, every one is trying to do the nail gel thing.  I&#x27;ve heard and read too many horror stories about nail gels to ever try the real thing.  This Pink Armor Nail Gel, however, is my replacement of the nail polishes of old.  I hope to never be without it.</li>
            <li> My nails take a beating at work and break easily. I used to get my nails done with no chip gel polish at the salon, but they became damaged. I&#x27;ve been using Pink Armor for four months.  It helps prevent breakage, and my nails are healthier and longer. It does start to peel after a few days, but I expected that because I use alcohol-based sanitizer on my hands frequently at work.</li>
            <li> It may have helped slightly, but not any better than any other similar product that is a lot lot cheaper than $10.98 for a little bottle.</li>
            <li> The Pink Armor nail gel is okay. I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 months. I have seen some improvement with my nail, but not the results that I expected.</li>
            <li> it was just ok. didnt notice stronger nails.. liked how it makes nails look more natural though... light pink.. hides chips...</li>
            <li> As a top coat, super efficient. Dries quick, lasts much longer than other brands I&#x27;ve tried. The smalles downside, you have to be careful not to get bubbles in the application, but that&#x27;s easy to avoid if you&#x27;re slow and steady.</li>
            <li> I love the Pink Armor nail gel. Great for my nails, My nails are long an healthy. However, I found the product cheaper a Ross. Great product and you can also put your favorite nail polish over it as well.</li>
            <li> What a big surprise this nail polish is, it really works for me. My nails look better and stronger and are growing. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have deep ridges in my nails so they no longer hold nail polish. I tried many different types of products claiming miracle results to no avail. This was going to be my last purchase of any product making such claims as whitening the nail bed and minimizing ridges. I am so happy to announce that this product worked wonders for my nails. I apply two coats once a week and am on my third week of use. My nails look much brighter. They look hydrated and the ridges have been reduced by at least 50%. I absolutely love the look of natural nails as the product claims.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that finally got my very frail nails to strengthen. I had acrylic nails for over 30 years and knew when I removed them I would have very weak and fragile nails. I tried at least 10 products, both inexpensive and very expensive, for over a year. I finally discovered Pink Armor and within 2 weeks, saw a difference. You need to commit to this and use it weekly, removing every 4-5 days and re-applying. Try to go without polish for a few weeks and you will be very pleased.</li>
            <li> Not as good as vinylux</li>
            <li> Love it! It helped me get rid of my split nail which lasted for more than 10 years and according to doctors, couldn&#x27;t be cured. Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing it on tv and thought at the very least it would give my nails a nice finished look as they grew. That wasn&#x27;t the case as I could barely even notice it on my nails after 2 coats!  As for any other benefits, such as stronger nails, I didn&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but I would recommend it. Two coats initially, then one coat every other day. Remove after one week and start again. It really does work.</li>
            <li> Made my nails split..Only 2 of my nails ever split. but this made all split. I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great nail polish however it damages and thins out you&#x27;re nails after you stop using this product..</li>
            <li> it really works, try it and see for yourself please wash hands and nails before use as the nail polish remover hinders the products performance.</li>
            <li> Ive been a cronic nail biter my entire life, im talking about damaged matrix hardly any nail! It was gross. never have i ever had anything close to decent nails. I quit back in febuary about a few days later i found pink armour nail gel on discount at dollar general..... i love this product. I never expected my nails to look as good as they do so soon. Ive been ising the product every week with 3 coats.....its soo pretty and pink....i will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I had hopes that this gel would be as good as the more expensive brand, but it&#x27;s not.  It is okay for a couple of days but it doesn&#x27;t last.  And the finish does not show as pink so it doesn&#x27;t enhance the whites of your nails like the higher priced gel formula.  I tried!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it really helps to keep nails stronger or not, but it goes on smoothly, dries fast, and leaves a nice purplish pink hue on your nails.  You can apply several coats quickly.  My only complaint is that the brush detached from the top and every time I open it, I have to unstick the brush from the bottle and screw it back into the top.</li>
            <li> this product has restored my nails, thank you</li>
            <li> This was total crap. It started peeling on day 1 and all I did was sit on the couch; so it can&#x27;t be said that I made it peel from washing dishes or doing other chores with my hands. It was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have bad nails. This is helping a lot ( but it is not the miracle that some one might think it might be) that is why I gave it 4 stars. I do like the product. It has helped better then other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for keeping your nails strong and makes polish last for so many days! Would definitely recommend this product to anyone concerned about their appearance!</li>
            <li> I have not seen infomertials or advertisements for this stuff, but I got on sale and decided to try. I love the color, a pink manicured clear look. So clean. Now, if its supposed to go on and hold up like true salon cured gel, then I don&#x27;t think this is the stuff to do it. I just love the look of my nails with this stuff on. Its worth 4-5 dollars but no more.</li>
            <li> My mother and I got together for a weekend; she lives in a different state, so I hadn&#x27;t seen her for months. I saw how beautiful her nails were and I asked her why she got \\&quot;fake nails?\\&quot; She told me the secret: pink armor. I have always had weak nails that split and crack when they reached a certain length. I bought three bottles in case I liked it and couldn&#x27;t find it again. At first, my nails peeled a bit, but I kept using it any way. I am so glad I did. I do my nails 3 times per week and I apply it each time. After about one month, I was amazed at how beautiful they were. I have been so happy with this product! I recommend it highly \\&quot;hands down.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I purchased this nail gel for my horribly brittle/breaking nails; however it made them worse. After a day or so, the nail gel just peels off  of your nails. I was duped into getting this thinking \\&quot;Oh because it was on TV, it should work\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t know how anyone approved this product to be on TV. Do not waste your money. There are so many other products that work so much better.</li>
            <li> Between housework, taking care of an invalid and raising birds....I am very hard on my hands and wash them all through the day. I had \\&quot;acrylic\\&quot; and \\&quot;pink gel\\&quot; nails put on for 25 years.  When I finally decided to give up the false nails, my own were very thin, had ridges, and constantly split, to the point where they were painful and I had to put bandaids on them.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the SensatioNAIL system. The gel would peel off quickly, in some places, and then be impossible to take off in other places. It was hard on my nails too.&lt;br /&gt;I tried several Sally Hanson products....without success.&lt;br /&gt;After 9 months of trying to grow my own....I was ready to give up.&lt;br /&gt;And then I found PINK ARMOR.&lt;br /&gt;At first I put it on top of the Sensationail gel (that I couldn&#x27;t get off)....and just kept filling in the gaps as they grew out.  Now it is directly on my bare nails. I have not had a chip, split or break since I started using it. My nails are strong, smooth and beautiful. It stays on until I take it off. I use a white stick under your nails and it looks like a professional French manicure.&lt;br /&gt;I paid about $10 for it.  I&#x27;d pay 4 times that much......I am so thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> I recently had my nails done at the salon - UV activated gel tips - it looked beautiful. I even had it touched up - and it was lovely...&lt;br /&gt;but then when it came time to remove the gel - the underlying nail was damaged, brittle and chipping. My nails were a disaster!&lt;br /&gt;I vowed never to get it done again. But how to get beautiful nails? I don&#x27;t have strong lucious nails in the first place...&lt;br /&gt;I tried Pink Armor Nail Gel - for a fraction of the price of salon nails. I applied 3 coats the first time.&lt;br /&gt;It looked amazing! It felt just like gel polish, smooth and shiny - the nails are pink and the white looks healthy. After the first application??!!&lt;br /&gt;I kept it on for 5 days as the instructions read - the Pink armor did not peel or chip during that time - and I work a lot with water and chemicals. I removed with regular polish remover and applied another 3 coats. Some days I even put 4-5 coats on to get the gel look - it&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;My nails are actually growing out! They look 100% better - You can even touch up on day 3 for a beautiful glistened look to day 5 -&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone who wants to take care of their nails. PINK ARMOR NAIL GEL ROCKS! I finally have strong nails - and they&#x27;re my own! Buy it today! That&#x27;s my honest opinion![[ASIN:B00B8Z2LRQ Pink Armor Nail Gel As Seen On TV]]</li>
            <li> I like many of the others here never saw the tv ads for this but saw it in the store in the &amp;#34;as seen on TV &amp;#34; section. I had been using nailtiques formula 2 plus ($10 for 1/4 oz).  I&#x27;ve had peeling nails for years, they would actually peel into the nail bed. I know for me, this is an awesome product and well worth the cost as others with problem nails can probably back me up for spending small fortunes to get healthy nails. I can actually use my nails for scratching without worry of them flexing backwards, when I have this product on them. I also love the feel of my nails. Smooth, shinny, and yes like they have a coat of armour on them. Will continue to purchase and sing the praises of pink armour!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this product due to sum of the negative reviews&lt;br /&gt;WOW so glad I did !!!!! Amazing&lt;br /&gt;It does wat it&#x27;s supposed to do&lt;br /&gt;My nails were brittle&lt;br /&gt;Now they are long and beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Got my first compliment yesterday&lt;br /&gt;And I thought ,&amp;#34; ok, that deserves a review !&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This stuff is the absolute best! I have had a big toenail that consistently split down the center since I injured it as an aerobics instructor 20 yrs ago.&lt;br /&gt;After using this polish for several weeks on my toes, the nail is perfectly healthy (no split!!), &amp; I have a perfect 10 toes again. The polish also leaves a pretty pink tint while making your nails tough &amp; healthy.&lt;br /&gt;It is great to have pretty nails &amp; toes, &amp; the best is they seem to stay healthy even after you take the polish off!</li>
            <li> This is the only formula I have tried in many years that actually delivers what it promises.  My nails have finally grown to a decent length and stay that way.  Before they were thin and broke constantly, even with polish or nail hardeners on them.  I love this stuff.  Hope they never discontinue it.</li>
            <li> It was great at first, but one of my nails broke and I realized my nails were peeling and cracking very badly. They were so dry that I had to let me nails grow out before they looked right again. Bad stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I expected this product to be as hard as gel nails (as they advertised).  I&#x27;m here to tell you this is NOT the case.  Sally Hansen does a better job of hardening the nails.  I have had salon gel nails before and this product in no way mimics a salon gel nail treatment.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> People save your money!! Stop being sucked into to TV products that don&#x27;t work and you have to fight for years to get a refund. This Pink Armor Nail Gel is a poor product, full of damaging ingredients to your nails.  You can get \\&quot;Pink Nail Magic\\&quot; at Sally&#x27;s for $7.99 and is a far superior product.</li>
            <li> I had weak brittle nails, after using Nail Armor for a week or two my nails were noticeably stronger.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it makes your nail shiny and tough to break, and much harder to chip !!</li>
            <li> My nails don&#x27;t grow long because they are thin and sharp so I either cut them or they snag on things and break. After using pink armor for a week my nails looked excellent and strong. I paid 3 less at walmart. I even gave my mom a bottle. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am a survivor of Acrylic Nail, Gel Nails, Shellac Nails, of which all those artificial procedures damage your natural nails. This product has given me beautiful nails and I am a religious user of this product.  My husband does my nails, he was an Esthetician/manicurist and had his own salon until he retired and found this product for me.  Does not damage your nails and comes off with regular acetone nail polish remover.  Great product.</li>
            <li> One week after putting it on my nails started breaking off. The stuff started peeling off when I put my hand in water</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Fast Shipping. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of Pink Armor as a gift. I followed all directions on the package, and used it for about a month. I really liked how it made my nails look, and it did make them feel stronger. I was very happy with the product until I stopped using it for about two weeks. All of a sudden my nails started peeling. First it was just a couple, but now all of them have peeled and are painfully short. My nails weren&#x27;t the best to begin with (thin and would curve under when long) but they didn&#x27;t peel! I would not recommend this product, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I work at a fast food restaurant and cannot have artificial nails. Constantly washing my hands would ruin my cuticles and nails. This protects my nails and my nails are growing and look white as they grow. My nails are stronger. The only problem is because of washing my hands constantly I have to replace the nail polish on my nails every four days not once a week like the box says. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I definitely saw an improvement during the first 2 months  of use.  Soon after that I found my nails in the same poor condition.  I have also noted that the original polish was a very deep pink and the latest bottle has hardly any tint to it. Perhaos the formula has changed.  I have used just about every nail strengthener on the  market and sorry to say that Pink ARMOUR  appears to be no different than the other products,</li>
            <li> I always have had nail issues and thought this seemed great. I did not buy it online I actually bought it in CVS. It was great the first day, the colour is really nice and I do like the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; but it is no gel nor a protectant. It chips very easily, peels off which then takes some of a weak nail with it, and it is very thick. I actually think regular polish would work better.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble growing my nails for years. They get brittle at some point and break. Not with this stuff. I followed the instructions , and my nails look great. I&#x27;ve been using for about a year now. I also tried similar products-but this is by far the best!!!!</li>
            <li> Best product I have ever bought for strengthening and growing my nails.</li>
            <li> Best nail coat out there well worth the ten dollars you pay, only need 1 coat to keep polish on for weeks i love this stuff</li>
            <li> love this product definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> So far its working for me!  I even used a color over the polish and it seems to make the color polish last longer then usual. I have only used it 3 times, but I seems to be working for me. I also do like the light pink tint it gives my nails when I just want a natural clean look.</li>
            <li> This is a nice treatment for nails</li>
            <li> It does what it says.  After several applications my nails looked and felt super healthy.</li>
            <li> I have used so many products, went to numerous salons to get acrylic and gel nails because I felt my nails would never grow on their own. I have tried diet, oils, pills and everything else but this is the first time my nails have grown so long without ripping or tearing a crazy amount (I will not say this product is a miracle, I did have a nail tear last week but it was not as bad as my usual tears are, I reapplied the product and the nail is growing fine). I think this is the best product I have ever used to grow my natural nails. Any other product, I would have multiple breaks (not just one). I think this stuff is awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great.  I can grow my usually brittle nails long now and no peeling.  Wonderful stuff!  I&#x27;ve used several bottles and can&#x27;t imagine life without it.  Hope they make this product for a very long time.</li>
            <li> VERY speedy delivery and great product</li>
            <li> if it doesn&#x27;t peel or scratch off on the first day of applying after its dried for hours and from repeatedly washing my hands then i consider this awesome! it goes on really pretty and makes your nails shiny. i just started using it so idk how fast it makes your nails grow, but i will update on anything else later on. From the looks of it, i wouldn&#x27;t give this product a bad rating because when i used any other brand of polish that was supposed to protect your nails and what not, it usually peeled off the very first day from just a little scratching. this is hard to scratch off unless you dig in really hard and i dont see why anyone would want to, but that&#x27;s my two cents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE March 22: ok this stuff is pretty awesome :) it has lasted me a little over a week and ten times better than any nail polish that ive ever used in my life. I constantly wash my hands in water or do dishes and other things and this polish is so so strong! i have no complaints over it. i don&#x27;t know if it makes your nails grow faster or if it&#x27;s all in my head, but it&#x27;s almost like a shield at protecting your nails. i love it! i dont know why people are giving this product a bad review? i mean really. but oh well, just try it yourself and find out, dont take my advice if you dont want it, but you should buy this product somewhere like walmart where it&#x27;s more affordable that way you wont have to pay for shipping.</li>
            <li> The Sally Hansen products work much better for less money. This stuff peeled off after the second day. This is really NOT worth the $10.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why so many people are giving this product bad reviews. This product has worked wonders on my nails. They used to be thin and break a lot. Now they are a lot stronger and I have yet to chip or break them and I have a 3 year old, work, and go to school and workout. I&#x27;ve used the product once a week and saw a huge difference. I&#x27;m on second week. It really makes my nails look like I just walked out of the salon with a fresh manicure. It lasts about a week before it starts coming off which is pretty good being that your nails go through so much in a week. I got this product cheaper at Wal-Mart and thought I would try it and it&#x27;s worth it. My nails are longer and stronger and I&#x27;ve searched for products that promised they would make my nails strong and they haven&#x27;t. Great product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My nails do grow fast on their own but this makes them grow just a little bit faster. And has made my nails even stronger then what they already were. I use this as a base coat then add my colored polish over top of it. I think it works wonders. It dries super fast, by the time I am done with the second hand the first is already dry. I also find my bottles at Ross for $5 so I buy 2 or 3 at a time to keep it in stock in my home. One bottle lasts me 8 months to a year. I use it weekly on fingers and toes.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a week and have loved the way my nails feel. If it peels off the tips because of dishes, cleaning, etc, I just apply more to the tips and it is fine. I will definitely use more of this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I disagree with the negative reviews.  I did not see the TV ad but I can attest to my own use of Pink Armor Nail Gel polish.  I am 44.  I have used Sally Hansen products exclusively since I was 13.  I have had extremely healthy nails all of my life (so healthy that people always asked what I used on my nails), until 2 years ago when I got gel Shellac Nail polish in a salon.  I loved the \\&quot;look\\&quot; of the Shellac but after 6 months of getting Shellac, my nails started to break easily and be weak.  I think it was because of the Acetone Polish to remove the Shellac moreso than the Shellac.  For a year and half, I went to my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; products with Sally Hansen.  I was so disappointed that none of them helped.  I thought my beautiful healthy natural nails had been doomed forever. Then, one day in Wal-Mart I saw THIS product.  I tried it and loved it!  For me, after only 4 weeks of use, my nails are once again strong, and long!  My nails have not been in this good health for 2 years!  I am so happy about this I LOOKED for a place to write a review.  It DOES give my nails a \\&quot;pink\\&quot; tone, almost flourescent in color but that color is more noticeable when I am outside in the sunlight.  It is expensive and I do believe it should be priced more in line with regular nail polish.  It does not stay on as long as gel Shellac.  But it comes off easily with regular polish remover.  I used it as directed - one coat per day for 5 days, then remove and re-start the process.  I love it so much, I bought 6 bottles and another 3 for my sister-in-law to try!  I hope the manufacturers continue to sell this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 2 months and see great results my nails have not broken or snagged since I started to use it. I have gotten these results with any other nail hardeners. I have even had to shape them down because they are getting longer than I want. This is my staple product for my nails. Nothing like it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> i got it as one of my gift&#x27;s for mother&#x27;s this year... today is my second day and it&#x27;s really looks good on my nails. it makes them look healthy and shiny &amp; they feel hard. i&#x27;m going to take pictures and keep track of how they are doing and i will post another review at the end of the week...</li>
            <li> Love this item. Have been using it for about a year now. Works excellent to strengthen nails and help them grow.</li>
            <li> This stuff not only enhances the look of my nails, it also enhances their strength and integrity .  No more chipping, splitting, or breaking.  I don&#x27;t have to put on gloves for routine household jobs anymore.  My nails are practically impervious to formerly damaging substances and activities.  As long as it is available, I&#x27;ll keep buying it.  Finally, something that works as well as the manufacturer claims .  Yay!</li>
            <li> This gel does work and hardens the fingernails. I use it weekly You just brush on and let dry completely.</li>
            <li> I did not order Pink Armor via phone or internet but bought at my local Target store.  I was excited to try it as I have a permanent split in two of my nails so thought it might help.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and it has totally torn up my nails.  My nails are peeling, especially the two nails with the splits.  One of the splits was very small but now it has gotten longer and that nail is peeling as well. I don&#x27;t usually have peeling problems with my nails but what a disappointment your product is.  I will definitely be throwing away what&#x27;s left and will recommend to my friends not to use!</li>
            <li> Its not that good as I expect, it works but very very slow, so I had to put one coat every day, and its washing off vert fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months and it works great!  My nails are lovely.  However, I started feeling progressively bad over the past several weeks...kind of flu like, but no fever.  Just yucky - nausea, stomach ache, headache, diarrhea, fatigue.  CAUTION: This product contains FORMALDEHYDE.  Check the allergy symptoms yourself!  Nausea, headache, stomach ache, diarrhea -all of those symptoms and MORE are indicated in formaldehyde allergy.  I removed Pink Armor from my nails last night and already feel better today.  This is just a warning to those who may be unknowingly suffering. The product works, but how do you FEEL?  Unfortunately, no more Pink Armor for me!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have used this product and it works!.  It protects my nails from chipping and peeling, which helps them&lt;br /&gt;grow stronger.  My nails seem to grow faster, which is great.</li>
            <li> Conditions nails better than Sally H. products.  Really grips nail surface.  I love the way Pink Armor makes my nails look bright.</li>
            <li> Love It!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will continue to use it. Really suprised how good it is. As a nurse, hands in water and gloves all the time, this really helps.</li>
            <li> my nail became discolored and scratched from too much coloring, my sister bought for me this pink armor gel, it does really make nail look better and shinier, and its good defence to layer your nail before put on other nail color.</li>
            <li> So sorry I wasted my money on this stuff.  Buy Sally Hansen at a third of the price.  Have used it now for 3 months and don&#x27;t see any difference in my nails, whatsoever.  They still chip and crack.</li>
            <li> I expected this product to be as hard as the gel nails just like the commercial advertises)-- this is not true because it&#x27;s absolutely nothing like the salon gel nails. It chipped and peeled the very next day and I had to keep reapplying. I tried this for 4 weeks and there was no change.  This is nothing but nail polish.  I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I love this product.It makes my nails look amazing. Also completely by accident, I found out it gives off a nice white kight under a black light.</li>
            <li> I had fake acrylic nails on for about three weeks when I removed them my real nails  we&#x27;re ruined and yes I soaked them I did not pry them off as some people do.  I was not planning on getting them done again and was really upset to see how much damage was done to my nails in a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;I am not faulting the nail tech he did a great job I would recommend him to anyone.  However, my nails are very thin and brittle even though I take vitamins.  I think that was the main reason for so much damage.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway this product did exactly what the Box said it would.&lt;br /&gt;1.  Strengthen and protect, my nail beds had a little lift and that is gone after three days.&lt;br /&gt;2. Repairs and restores (it seams to have done that , it filled in the cracks and splits) to soon to know if it is just until they grow out or if it is for good.&lt;br /&gt;3. Promotes nail growth , again to soon to say 100% yes, but I would assume that since it filled in the cracks and splits my nails will be able to grow without catching on stuff and ripping.&lt;br /&gt;4. Glossy pink tinted gel-nail finish. 100% yes on that. My nails are very shinny like salon gel finish.  I wish I could buff then out a little more to be smooth right now. Then I don&#x27;t think anyone could tell it was just polish instead of salon gel nails.  But I need to wait a week or so before doing that my nas are so thin right now I am afraid I will take to much off.&lt;br /&gt;I will definatly be buying this product again.&lt;br /&gt;Again, I didn&#x27;t see the commercial but this product has really helped me. Now I am not so self conscious about my nails while they are growing out naturally. And, I will use this product even after my nails are healed. I like the nice clean glossy look.</li>
            <li> First let me start by saying my nails are pretty healthy, decent length and occasionally break in the most inconvenient place. I typically stay away from everything but basic manicures on my natural nails, I did however decide to try a Gel manicure (on natural nails) a few months ago and found the removal process to be a nail damaging nightmare. The soaking and scraping of my nails really threw me off.. Blah!! It left my nails pretty dry and brittle. Time cured that. I was in Ross the other day and saw this stuff for $6.99, I had seen the infomercials and decided why not... What lady isn&#x27;t looking for a bit of help!! I applied one coat, I started to see a bit of peeling on one nail the next day. The rest held up until I decided to take it off tonight. So it could be an application error on my part. Removal was easy, Acetone remover.. It does show a slight shade of pink on your nails but the tips are noticeably whiter, I liked the color... it looks healthy. I have read several reviews and have decided to use two coats tonight, I am also going to paint them with maybelline color show in coral crush and use Pink Armour as a top coat. I will follow up with ya&#x27;ll in a few days or as soon as my polish starts to chip. I typically use OPI polish but wanted to see how this did on a lower priced polish and Color show has some great spring/summer colors out right now:)</li>
            <li> I wanted this product since I saw the infomercial. Was so excited when I finally ordered it but only for a hot second. The sales person just kept badgering &amp; trying to add fees &amp; extras. The cost sky rocketed from $10 to $30 very quickly &amp; out of frustration I hung up. I was still charged with no confirmation #. I was told the next morning I couldn&#x27;t cancel &amp; was quickly harassed with phone calls about extra costs that were already in place &amp; would be charged to my card automatically?  This company is a scam. Do not do Any business with them. I ended up having to cancel my card &amp; still got &amp; paid for the Pink Armor.  I have naturally strong nails &amp; although the product makes them pretty, 5 have broken since using the product. It&#x27;s crap. Go to Walmart &amp; buy clear coat for $4</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sad brittle nails, I love the way this feels when you apply it. My nails look good and feel good.  It is good to use for a base and top coat.  No polish I have ever used is this smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a great product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everyone&lt;br /&gt;My 12 year old daughter loves it and it helps her nails to grow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that really works for my thin, brittle,  peeling nails.  Recommended to several students, including nail biters, and it worked for them also.  Does anyone use this under colored polish?  Every time i try, the polish bubbles.  Best result with very thin Pink Armour coat, only one, then very thin color coat. Don&#x27;t care, it is beautiful by itself. Hope it stays around forever.  Recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> love, love, love this stuff - my nails have actually started to grow using this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews of this product, using it for years and wouldn&#x27;t use any other.love it 💞💞</li>
            <li> Worked great until nails started to peel and break. Will take months to heal damage.</li>
            <li> This Pink Armour is great! It fills in ridges and lasts a long time. If you have your hands in water all the time, you might want to re-touch the tips of your nails. Wonderful product-- great price too!</li>
            <li> I find this to be a good, cheaper alternative to the perfect pink gel from Sephora. It performs exactly the same and is a fraction of the price. I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> decent stuff, can&#x27;t say whether it works better or worse than similar products, it does have a slight pink tint.</li>
            <li> Pink Armor works great...for about a month.  Then my nails started peeling worse than they did before, splitting, cracking, and breaking, worse than before using the product.  The slightest bump, and my nails break, layers peel off halfway up the nail bed. It&#x27;s turned into a nightmare.</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE!!  Doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Last longer on nails than other similar producs ( nailtique).  Easy to apply and dries within 2 minutes.  Will come back for this again. Cheaper when bought directly from TV.</li>
            <li> My nails are growing like crazy. They are strong and in amazing shape!!!! Very happy. I have tried everything.... Very happy!! Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been doing fake nails at home for a year and my nails were very weak and thin.  I have never had nice nails (which is why I started fake nails) until now!  I thought I might as well try Pink Armour since I needed something for my nails and have tried everything....I had nothing to lose.  In 4-6 weeks my nails have some length and have never been this nice on their own.  Definately recommend this product for anyone who needs to get their nails back after using fake nails!</li>
            <li> I started using this about 3 weeks ago.  I have nails that would peel (a common problem) and nothing I had used resolved this.  My nails are now strong and the peeling has ceased.  I recommend this to any woman who doesn&#x27;t want to use fake nails or go to the salon. Best product I have bought in a long time.</li>
