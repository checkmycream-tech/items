            <li>The cologne itself is great and smells just like my dad (who i bought it for).</li>
            <li>And they say it in a sexy manner!!  </li>
            <li>THe fragrance is just amazing!  </li>
            <li>It is the one fragrance that goes best with my body chemistry, and over the years I have received so many rave comments by lady friends that I have renamed it, \\&quot;babe-magnet\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>For me this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s worn it for decades and gets compliments all time time at how good he smells.  </li>
            <li>I smell good again.....</li>
            <li>Maybe one just can&#x27;t get good Lagerfeld at a good price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He has been wearing it for years &amp; paying MUCH MORE than this!</li>
            <li>But I love it!</li>
            <li>Love my man wearing Lagerfeld!</li>
            <li>Still love it!</li>
            <li>reasonably priced and delivery was excellent.</li>
            <li>It is nice having an exclusive in my world.</li>
            <li>Love this cologne my favorite !  </li>
            <li>Been using this cologne for 30 years and still love it</li>
            <li>I have used many others but always find myself ordering Lagerfeld  when I run out of the others.  </li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>and I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>Most women just absolutely love to smell this fragrance, either by itself on when worn by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would like to see Lagerfeld&#x27;s strength and longevity improved and would gladly pay more for it, if it were.</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>The favorite scent for my husband.</li>
            <li>so we&#x27;re glad that we can still find Lagerfeld on line.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for &#x27;longer than I can remember&#x27; (  :-)  ) ...</li>
            <li>We both love it.</li>
            <li>Have many designer colognes but like to mix it up.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed Lagerfeld fragrances for over 20 years.  </li>
            <li>this is some kind of fraud knockoff using the original name.  </li>
            <li>I think the most important issue is to find one you like and make it part of your signature for people how see you repeatedly.  </li>
            <li>It is an absolutely fantastic cologne, my favorite of all time.</li>
            <li>she liked so much!  </li>
            <li>I realize each person&#x27;s body chemistry is different, but for me this works splendidly.  </li>
            <li>ordering and shipping went smoothly.</li>
            <li>I hope it remains available.</li>
            <li>Is this the original?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Delia - it was worth it!  </li>
            <li>Do not buy this item if you are expecting the original scent.</li>
            <li>So other than the aesthetics being not as great, the product itself is fine.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I have been told by many (females) that it is a good fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Because of this, I have almost quit using Lagerfeld several times, but its fragrance is so good that I have kept using it anyway.</li>
            <li>I can remember loving the smell of old spice that my father always used.  </li>
            <li>But the classic circle on the top of the bottle was damaged during delivery  because the &amp;#34;bubble&amp;#34; wrap (which is more like three large bubble tubes of air) were deflated and did not hold the package in place inside the box.</li>
            <li>My second favorite fragrance I have worn off and on for many years.  </li>
            <li>You can do a quick search on the web and see this is the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I use to wear it many years ago when we first got married</li>
            <li>Now isn&#x27;t that why we wear cologne in the first place!  </li>
            <li>I was impressed with the longevity, but I grew tired of it and wanted it to fade.  </li>
            <li>Received in good time and was exactly as expected</li>
            <li>The scent is so sexually manly and unlike many of the other &amp;#34;male scents&amp;#34;  my husband can wear it year-round because it is not &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; in the summer.</li>
            <li>I gave it a sniff from the bottle and realized that it probably wasn&#x27;t the right cologne for me.  </li>
            <li>It has a very distinctive fragrance, very masculine and sophisticated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about that, but I am happy with mine.</li>
            <li>It is Lagerfeld Classic which does not smell like the original.</li>
            <li>Nice suave, not overwhelming strong.  </li>
            <li>It now takes about twice as much applied quantity to smell as strong as it did previously, and the smell fades much more quickly than before.</li>
            <li>AT HIGHER PRICE).&lt;br /&gt;DELIVERED</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon!</li>
            <li>My son has used this product for several years, he is always pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>First time I have ordered a product from Amazon that I will have to return.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband when we first dated in 1985.  </li>
            <li>We spent 23 years apart, and every time I smelled this fragrance, I instantly smiled and thought of him.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly as I remembered.  </li>
            <li>My husband had used Lagerfeld for several years now and I love it.</li>
            <li>I like the fragrance as much as the first time I encountered it --</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn and loved this scent for the past 30 years and always get a compliment,</li>
            <li>It is not a strong scent that seems out of place on a woman, but it&#x27;s definitely NOT flowery, so it&#x27;s perfect and classy for a man.</li>
            <li>A Classic - both of them!</li>
            <li>Very manly fragrance that gets noticed.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is the real macro</li>
            <li>Thanks again Amazon for supplying my needs without problems.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have used Lagerfeld for about 15 years and have stuck with it the whole time.</li>
            <li>really wanted to know how I picked the cologene</li>
            <li>Lagerfeld was the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I could not find this cologne in stores and was really happy to find it on Amazon - until I opened it up and sprayed some on my poor husband.</li>
            <li>Here is the only place I can buy the bigger bottle at such a great price.</li>
            <li>I Buy it in the spray bottle because it helps me not to use too much.</li>
            <li>my husband really enjoys this cologny husband really enjoys this cologne.</li>
            <li>I ordered this based on the high praises that I read and the reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I first picked up a bottle of Lagerfeld in Harrod&#x27;s/London in the early 80&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is truly a classic fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I have used Lagerfeld Classic Eau De Toilette for over 25 years.</li>
            <li>and she still loves this classic scent.</li>
            <li>Consider this a classic men&#x27;s fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Classic smell that I&#x27;ve used since I was in high school.  </li>
            <li>and I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>After many years working in IPR/TMK fraud, this item is NOT original or made by Lagerfeld.  </li>
            <li>but I will be buying a new bottle somewhere and tossing this one.  </li>
            <li>In response to the earlier post that Lagerfeld Classic is not the same as the original, it is indeed.  </li>
            <li>I COULDN&#x27;T GET BACK TO ORDER TO GET NUMBERS OR REASON FOR HIGHER PRICE.  </li>
            <li>It has a similar scent to the original, but only a shadow.  </li>
            <li>I have used this original product for years, and this one is just not right.</li>
            <li>This is my old standby cologne.  </li>
            <li>He only wants to use Lagerfeld because it compliments his body chemistry.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really get any compliments from wearing this cologne daily...</li>
            <li>This is an old fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>These women tell me this just by being near me...</li>
            <li>It is like drinking old Coke.  </li>
            <li>I am a woman, now in my early 60s, and have worn this scent off and on.  </li>
            <li>The version I remember had a terrific scent, and it was strong, so you had to use only a little at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When we got back together, it was natural to get it for him again.  </li>
            <li>cologne was flat nowhere near expected smell,I  have been using for at least 20 years, more like colored alcohol.</li>
            <li>I mean as soon as it was sprayed on it did not smell at all , I have to say Customer service at amazon took care of the problem very well thanks again</li>
            <li>one complaint, it doesn&#x27;t last as the original formula.</li>
            <li>its the one cologne that i have gotten the most complements on in the past 30 years, and ive tried quite a few</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It has a similar scent to the original, but only a shadow.  </li>
            <li> I have used this original product for years, and this one is just not right.</li>
            <li> This is my old standby cologne.  </li>
            <li> He only wants to use Lagerfeld because it compliments his body chemistry.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really get any compliments from wearing this cologne daily...</li>
            <li> This is an old fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> These women tell me this just by being near me...</li>
            <li> It is like drinking old Coke.  </li>
            <li> I am a woman, now in my early 60s, and have worn this scent off and on.  </li>
            <li> The version I remember had a terrific scent, and it was strong, so you had to use only a little at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When we got back together, it was natural to get it for him again.  </li>
            <li> cologne was flat nowhere near expected smell,I  have been using for at least 20 years, more like colored alcohol.</li>
            <li> I mean as soon as it was sprayed on it did not smell at all , I have to say Customer service at amazon took care of the problem very well thanks again</li>
            <li> one complaint, it doesn&#x27;t last as the original formula.</li>
            <li> its the one cologne that i have gotten the most complements on in the past 30 years, and ive tried quite a few</li>
            <li> The scent is almost nice but extremely weak with a noticeble alcohol smell that was not there in the past.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent does not change or turn during the day or evening and remains a subtle constant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean and fresh...</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Lagerfeld is and has always been my fav, wore it in the early 70&#x27;s, but a real 1 oz will cost at least 20 bucks, if you spend less, it&#x27;s still lagerfeld,</li>
            <li> BUT, it&#x27;s watered down, so the lasting effect is very very short.</li>
            <li> I have used four 8 ounce bottles plus several smaller bottles and usually receive compliments when wearing it.</li>
            <li> Prompt shipping and product was as expected.  </li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Extremely dissappointed.  </li>
            <li> I will seek other sources.</li>
            <li> there are no &#x27;off&#x27; scents that often plague other men&#x27;s colognes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t hate it, but I did not like it as much as most alternatives.  </li>
            <li> Missed having some, made this purchase and, as had been my previous experience, get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be scared off by this post, because it&#x27;s not true.  </li>
            <li> Not full strength smell.</li>
            <li> Even if it smelled the same the odor is weak.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers have complained about the strength of the scent.  </li>
            <li> Little disappointed after a colleague talked so much about this product, she could not even recognize the fragrance.</li>
            <li> It had gone bad - totally old, sour, spoiled, ammonia smell.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find in retail outlets lately</li>
            <li> Ornament on cap was broken when I opened it</li>
            <li> On another note, the cap of the bottle was broken when I opened the box.</li>
            <li> I think it shipped out in a broken state.  </li>
            <li> The color was off and the lid was broken - I should have known something was wrong.</li>
            <li> Printing on the bottle was wrong and the power of the scent is off.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed at the price for what used to be an expensive colonge.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is useless in this form.  </li>
            <li> It get one star because it doesn&#x27;t smell bad</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been disappointed!  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the strength and quality of the product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Been using this cologne for 30 years and still love it</li>
            <li> This is my old standby cologne.  I have used many others but always find myself ordering Lagerfeld  when I run out of the others.  Very manly fragrance that gets noticed.  Hey.....my wife likes it, so I like it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the real macro</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne.  He only wants to use Lagerfeld because it compliments his body chemistry.  He gets tons of compliments every time he&#x27;s in public.</li>
            <li> The price was unbeatable! Thank you for great service and the best prices!</li>
            <li> After many years working in IPR/TMK fraud, this item is NOT original or made by Lagerfeld.  Printing on the bottle was wrong and the power of the scent is off.  I have used this original product for years, and this one is just not right.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to get this cologne for my fianc&amp;eacute;e for a while. I finally got it and I love the way it smells. It is like an aphrodisiac. Thanks again Amazon for supplying my needs without problems.</li>
            <li> Is this the original? I thought it wasn&#x27;t being made anymore</li>
            <li> cologne was flat nowhere near expected smell,I  have been using for at least 20 years, more like colored alcohol.I cannot use or repurchase,USELESS!</li>
            <li> Prompt shipping and product was as expected.  Other reviewers have complained about the strength of the scent.  I&#x27;m not sure about that, but I am happy with mine.</li>
            <li> Great Product for a great price! My Husband loves this &amp; I do too!!!&lt;br /&gt;He has been wearing it for years &amp; paying MUCH MORE than this! Thanks</li>
            <li> I have used Lagerfeld for about 15 years and have stuck with it the whole time. It is the one fragrance that goes best with my body chemistry, and over the years I have received so many rave comments by lady friends that I have renamed it, \\&quot;babe-magnet\\&quot;. Most women just absolutely love to smell this fragrance, either by itself on when worn by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only adverse comment is that about 7-8 years ago I believe Lagerfeld&#x27;s manufacturer reduced its strength. It now takes about twice as much applied quantity to smell as strong as it did previously, and the smell fades much more quickly than before. Because of this, I have almost quit using Lagerfeld several times, but its fragrance is so good that I have kept using it anyway. I would like to see Lagerfeld&#x27;s strength and longevity improved and would gladly pay more for it, if it were.</li>
            <li> I first picked up a bottle of Lagerfeld in Harrod&#x27;s/London in the early 80&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then - I met Delia Parker of Bagshot, Surrey who changed my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She really wanted to know how I picked the cologene she liked so much!  Well,&lt;br /&gt;Delia - it was worth it!  And, I&#x27;ll never forget your!</li>
            <li> This is truly a classic fragrance.  I realize each person&#x27;s body chemistry is different, but for me this works splendidly.  And my wife loves it!</li>
            <li> Arrived in great shape and pricing was excellent!</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Lagerfeld was the real thing.  Just what my son wanted and it smells so good.&lt;br /&gt;Very reasonably priced and delivery was excellent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really get any compliments from wearing this cologne daily...But I love it! and at my age I will probably keep buying it till I die!</li>
            <li> Classic smell that I&#x27;ve used since I was in high school.  Get away from it occasionally and always come back.  Arrived as described and in great order.</li>
            <li> I just like this fragrance as a personal choice.  On the other hand, I have been told by many (females) that it is a good fragrance.  I think the most important issue is to find one you like and make it part of your signature for people how see you repeatedly.  I can remember loving the smell of old spice that my father always used.  I identified the smell with him.  For me this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> 10 of: Lagerfeld By Karl Lagerfeld For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 4.2 Ounces ..... this is the item as listed. Beware it is not Lagerfeld cologne!!!!! It is Lagerfeld Classic which does not smell like the original. Do not buy this item if you are expecting the original scent.</li>
            <li> great smelling cologne, been using for years and always get compliments...last all day</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Only cologne I ever wore that was complimented.  Ornament on cap was broken when I opened it but no impact on the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband; he has been a Lagerfeld fan for years. People have actually stopped him and asked the name of the fragrance he is wearing. The scent is so sexually manly and unlike many of the other &amp;#34;male scents&amp;#34;  my husband can wear it year-round because it is not &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; in the summer.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT WAS GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I DIDN&#x27;T LIKE,  THE PRICE UPPED WHEN I CLICKED TO ORDER,  APPROVAL WENT THROUGH  I COULDN&#x27;T GET BACK TO ORDER TO GET NUMBERS OR REASON FOR HIGHER PRICE.  HAD TO HOLD MY BREATH TILL BILLING CAME IN; (AT HIGHER PRICE).&lt;br /&gt;DELIVERED OK.</li>
            <li> My second favorite fragrance I have worn off and on for many years.  I recommend it for any man who is not in my area of the country.  It is nice having an exclusive in my world. LOL.</li>
            <li> The favorite scent for my husband. A Classic - both of them!</li>
            <li> I bought the cologne for my Husband and son for Christmas it had no smell at all I mean as soon as it was sprayed on it did not smell at all , I have to say Customer service at amazon took care of the problem very well thanks again</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on the high praises that I read and the reasonable price.  I gave it a sniff from the bottle and realized that it probably wasn&#x27;t the right cologne for me.  My wife gave it a sniff and then a snarl.  She wasn&#x27;t impressed.  I decided to wear it for a day because the smell can change over time.  I didn&#x27;t hate it, but I did not like it as much as most alternatives.  I will credit the cologne for sticking with me all day.  I was impressed with the longevity, but I grew tired of it and wanted it to fade.  It hung with me until I showered.  I probably won&#x27;t wear this again.  On another note, the cap of the bottle was broken when I opened the box. I don&#x27;t think it broke in the shipping process because it was packed in an oversized well padded box.  I think it shipped out in a broken state.  I&#x27;ll probably toss this out unless I can find someone to give it to who likes it.</li>
            <li> In response to the earlier post that Lagerfeld Classic is not the same as the original, it is indeed.  This is the same product they&#x27;ve made since the 70&#x27;s.  Don&#x27;t be scared off by this post, because it&#x27;s not true.  You can do a quick search on the web and see this is the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> What can I say. Been using this since the begin of life. This is an old fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Just one complaint, it doesn&#x27;t last as the original formula.</li>
            <li> I have used Lagerfeld Classic Eau De Toilette for over 25 years. It is an absolutely fantastic cologne, my favorite of all time. I have used four 8 ounce bottles plus several smaller bottles and usually receive compliments when wearing it. About to run out recently, I could not find any in local stores so I looked on line and purchased 2 bottles of 4.2 oz spray from Amazon on 8/15/14. Thank you Amazon, I hope you will continue carrying Lagerfeld, #30 on the all time listing of the 100 best men&#x27;s colognes.</li>
            <li> I personally can&#x27;t smell it on me!  But the kicker is that everywhere I go I get compliments from the lady&#x27;s that I smell GREAT!!!  These women tell me this just by being near me...total strangers, people at work and women that I know...they just say it!!! And they say it in a sexy manner!!  Now isn&#x27;t that why we wear cologne in the first place!  his is the best stuff I hve ever used!</li>
            <li> Not full strength smell.</li>
            <li> This is the only fragrance that my husband will wear.  He&#x27;s worn it for decades and gets compliments all time time at how good he smells.  Very hard to find in retail outlets lately so we&#x27;re glad that we can still find Lagerfeld on line.  Thanks amazon!</li>
            <li> The cologne itself is great and smells just like my dad (who i bought it for). But the classic circle on the top of the bottle was damaged during delivery  because the &amp;#34;bubble&amp;#34; wrap (which is more like three large bubble tubes of air) were deflated and did not hold the package in place inside the box. So other than the aesthetics being not as great, the product itself is fine.</li>
            <li> My son has used this product for several years, he is always pleased with it.  It is easier to shop on line from Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;for it then going to the mall.</li>
            <li> First time I have ordered a product from Amazon that I will have to return. I could not find this cologne in stores and was really happy to find it on Amazon - until I opened it up and sprayed some on my poor husband. The color was off and the lid was broken - I should have known something was wrong. It had gone bad - totally old, sour, spoiled, ammonia smell.</li>
            <li> its the one cologne that i have gotten the most complements on in the past 30 years, and ive tried quite a few, i keep some on hand all the time. its my go to cologne, plus its not overpowering like Polo.</li>
            <li> All excelent venezuela</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for &#x27;longer than I can remember&#x27; (  :-)  ) ... I like the fragrance as much as the first time I encountered it -- it&#x27;s never &#x27;overbearing&#x27; ... ordering and shipping went smoothly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband when we first dated in 1985.  THe fragrance is just amazing!  We spent 23 years apart, and every time I smelled this fragrance, I instantly smiled and thought of him.  When we got back together, it was natural to get it for him again.  It was exactly as I remembered.  When he&#x27;s out of town, I occasionally wear the fragrance just to stay emotionally close to him.  It is not a strong scent that seems out of place on a woman, but it&#x27;s definitely NOT flowery, so it&#x27;s perfect and classy for a man.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne my favorite !  I have given it to my man for years he loves it. I hope it remains available.</li>
            <li> Nice suave, not overwhelming strong.  My husband smells delicious.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn and loved this scent for the past 30 years and always get a compliment,</li>
            <li> My husband had used Lagerfeld for several years now and I love it. It has such a manly aroma, and yet is not overpowering. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this one!</li>
            <li> Excellent, would recommend</li>
            <li> Bought them for my father because he likes them.</li>
            <li> Lagerfeld is the best colone I have ever used. It last all day with just a morning spray. I have use it for years and I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using Lagerfeld for over 25 years. We both love it.</li>
            <li> Lagerfeld is and has always been my fav, wore it in the early 70&#x27;s, but a real 1 oz will cost at least 20 bucks, if you spend less, it&#x27;s still lagerfeld, BUT, it&#x27;s watered down, so the lasting effect is very very short.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend gave this to me for graduation,never changed. I graduated in 1984. Lots of compliments</li>
            <li> My wife recently bought this for me for Valentine&#x27;s Day. I use to wear it many years ago when we first got married and she still loves this classic scent. Have many designer colognes but like to mix it up.</li>
            <li> Love my man wearing Lagerfeld!</li>
            <li> I smell good again.....</li>
            <li> I buy this for my husband all the time. Here is the only place I can buy the bigger bottle at such a great price.</li>
            <li> Received in good time and was exactly as expected</li>
            <li> I have used this product all my life. I Buy it in the spray bottle because it helps me not to use too much. Just two shots of this is the correct amount. I don&#x27;t want people to smell me before I walk into the room. It&#x27;s the perfect dose and my girlfriend likes it. That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about.</li>
            <li> Extremely dissappointed.  I used to use this years ago, but I forgot about it.  My father reminded me, so I bought 2 bottles, one for each of us.  I was amazed at the price for what used to be an expensive colonge.  Now I know why.  The version I remember had a terrific scent, and it was strong, so you had to use only a little at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this version, I agree with another reviewer who said that it is &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34;.  It is like drinking old Coke.  It has a similar scent to the original, but only a shadow.  The scent is almost nice but extremely weak with a noticeble alcohol smell that was not there in the past.  The scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to wonder is this is some kind of fraud knockoff using the original name.  I think I will report it to Amazon.  This stuff is useless in this form.  I will seek other sources.</li>
            <li> I ordered Lagerfeld for my boyfriend after smelling it on a friend, months before Christmas.  I decided my boyfriend needed to smell the same way!!  I haven&#x27;t been disappointed!  Still love it!</li>
            <li> Been out of Lagerfeld for several years until I found it on Amazon. It has a very distinctive fragrance, very masculine and sophisticated. I hope I can continue to purchase it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed Lagerfeld fragrances for over 20 years.  I am a woman, now in my early 60s, and have worn this scent off and on.  Missed having some, made this purchase and, as had been my previous experience, get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> This was bought as a gift for my son.He deffinately like it a lot</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> I have used Lagerfeld for men for over 30 years and cannot find another cologne that i like as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using Lagerfeld for years and I bought this for the price.  I am very disappointed with the strength and quality of the product.  It smells different from what I still have and have used.  Even if it smelled the same the odor is weak.  It get one star because it doesn&#x27;t smell bad but I will be buying a new bottle somewhere and tossing this one.  Maybe one just can&#x27;t get good Lagerfeld at a good price.</li>
            <li> Consider this a classic men&#x27;s fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each time you spray or splash some of this fragrance, it has that sort of scent which captivates to some degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent does not change or turn during the day or evening and remains a subtle constant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean and fresh...there are no &#x27;off&#x27; scents that often plague other men&#x27;s colognes.</li>
            <li> my husband really enjoys this cologny husband really enjoys this cologne.</li>
            <li> Little disappointed after a colleague talked so much about this product, she could not even recognize the fragrance.</li>
