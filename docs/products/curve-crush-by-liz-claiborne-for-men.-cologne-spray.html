            <li>My husband liked it</li>
            <li>Thanks for the reviews...it helped me choose the perfect scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very sporty scent so its probably best to use outdoors, or</li>
            <li>This came out with as an expansion of the already popular Curve line of products for men and women.</li>
            <li>But it has a nice aroma to it.</li>
            <li>Kindly don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li>Though it is not for all men because every man has his own scent..</li>
            <li>I liked the smell of this cologne, but not 1 of the best, found the Curve Soul to be a bit better, but then again I tend to go for the more sweet smelling colognes.</li>
            <li>It arrived in perfect condition and was exactly like what I would have purchased for a lot more in the department stores.</li>
            <li>This mens cologne product has a strong aroma but pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Mine is real, and has a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t make it my primary scent, but is a good addition to any collection of colognes.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing too. :)</li>
            <li>Pretty good smelling cologne at a really good price.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite ( doesn&#x27;t allowed me to make 5 stars) but it deserve 10</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this cologne.</li>
            <li>No sooner is she gone then another woman approaches me and says \\&quot;I love that</li>
            <li>I just love this scent my husband wears it</li>
            <li>its orgasmic &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I just love it so damn</li>
            <li>I wear it casually most of the time.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>the Curve Crush smells much better</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a boy&#x27;s 16th birthday present - this is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I even use it sometimes :)</li>
            <li>An interesting scent by liz claiborne for men.</li>
            <li>I am glad I ordered this from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Received my product in a timely manner and was pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Love it on my husband.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>I love how this smells on my boyfriend..</li>
            <li>on him :) just got him another bottle for christmas</li>
            <li>I just love this Cologne</li>
            <li>Gets the job done and attracts compliments from many people.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li>I love shopping here.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on this fragrance.</li>
            <li>she is all over me now more than ever.</li>
            <li>so be sure that&#x27;s what you want.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how he smells before he leaves and when we go out.  </li>
            <li>HAHAHAHA!!!!</li>
            <li>Also, this product was delivered seriously fast!!!!</li>
            <li>We are a family who don&#x27;t like too many or too much smells - so this was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>Best smelling cologne I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nothing like the original Curve which none of the newer one&#x27;s will ever beat!</li>
            <li>This retains the smell so much better than Curve Wave, I&#x27;m guessing Curve Wave is just a very light and sweet scent.</li>
            <li>but it is huge, love the packaging,</li>
            <li>I decide to go on amazon, and I found the exact kind he wanted (Curve Crush), which they don&#x27;t sell in too many stores anymore.</li>
            <li>It leans more towards the cheap side.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, if it is sold by amazon you can bet that you will recieve it fast and in good condition.</li>
            <li>Smells good and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I like it because it has a nice fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>I love curve and how this one and the original smell like.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, not overpowering</li>
            <li>I am a person that does NOT like cologne or perfume that is strong.  </li>
            <li>This is something my son was looking for at the duty free shops and couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li>I said no, to which she replied with a sexy smile, \\&quot;Ohhh...</li>
            <li>This perfume smells fantastic and it lasts all day, literally.</li>
            <li>This cologne smells great, gets the ladies going, and you get a massive amount of it.</li>
            <li>It came really fast, and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Great packaging, and lasting effect.</li>
            <li>It used to be one of my favorite colognes back then, best for young adults.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;d spend my money on something else if I could go back in time, but it&#x27;s a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>and I have had it for years since I don&#x27;t use it much!!!</li>
            <li>I had made the mistake at Macy&#x27;s and bought the original Curve</li>
            <li>worth the money!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy it, it&#x27;s not the original</li>
            <li>but honestly I always get a new bottle when mine runs out.</li>
            <li>It does have a clean smell.</li>
            <li>It doesnt smell super cheap</li>
            <li>Not too strong, just right and lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li>scent is just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; but nothing special.</li>
            <li>If you want to attract that fine lady and you think you have the right manly scent that this cologne can accent then go for it.</li>
            <li>so I want something that is very inviting when dealing with customers but not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>so that was a good thing since it was a birthday present</li>
            <li>I ordered this as a present for my husband and he loved it, I was supposed to receive it on wednesday</li>
            <li>Unlike some dispensers, this one works very well and lasts many hours</li>
            <li>It smell kinda sweet</li>
            <li>I am looking for a nice masculine but majority sweet scent for my job.</li>
            <li>This is my least favorite Curve ever!!!</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really like the smell its okay maybe good for teen&#x27;s not so much of a manly smell</li>
            <li>at parties, but to each their own :-)&lt;br /&gt;This is a great scent and if you are considering buying this for the first time, you will not be disappointing.</li>
            <li>It has a &#x27;fresh citrus&#x27; scent to it that lingers on for hours.</li>
            <li>You shoud definetly buy this if you are looking for something worth the money.</li>
            <li>worth  colonge</li>
            <li>This is, so far, my favorite cologne on him.</li>
            <li>It came quickly &amp; was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>at any rate.. she is super hot</li>
            <li>it was out of the thing it comes with other than that it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>Overall, a good buy, and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Right on the spot😉.  </li>
            <li>but i realized now that they didn&#x27;t help me choose a right product.</li>
            <li>There are some fake crush sold out there, Luckily I picked the right one anda was perfect for the price.</li>
            <li>I buy him a large bottle every year, and it lasts quite some time!</li>
            <li>It arrived super fast</li>
            <li>likes it very much.</li>
            <li>This cologne has an amazing smell and last very long and believe me it will get u many complments each time  </li>
            <li>Works better with the ladies and leaves a lasting impression.</li>
            <li>It smells absolutely fantastic and yummy, so manly yet sweet, and totally not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I had already got him a present and didn&#x27;t want to spend too much more.</li>
            <li>is at first kinda like idk maybe spicy?</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>did not get any compliments from this cologne and the scent fades away so fast!</li>
            <li>Check it out, usually at christmas some resonably priced set come out, and on Amazon here their are some good prices as well.</li>
            <li>This scent has a little less spice scent than the original, and has more of a citrus or even rose scent to it.  </li>
            <li>I felt the original curve was to close to the old polo colonge, but this is a bit more light, and once worn a while has a more masculine scent despite initially having a little fruity flowery smell.  </li>
            <li>I think they can vastly improve on that issue by having a normal top to protect the atomizer part.</li>
            <li>BUT ON A  SERIOUS NOTE DUDE&#x27;S ,, REALLY GREAT STUFF,, WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT</li>
            <li>Wanted to try out Curve colonge for once and it does smell good but hardly noticable but</li>
            <li>I get more compliments from the ladies when I wear this then pretty much every other cologne I own which is crazy since this is the cheapest cologne/Perfum I own.</li>
            <li>no matter how much you use.</li>
            <li>thanks china</li>
            <li>AND SHIPPED FAST</li>
            <li>shipped fast</li>
            <li>It is real</li>
            <li>would buy again since it arrived fast</li>
            <li>Girls really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Not as much as my Armani</li>
            <li>very good!Received it on time.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Fast shipping to</li>
            <li>I wish it would last longer other than that it is good</li>
            <li>I was so excited, and it was only like $20!!!</li>
            <li>For this price just buy the original or try a different one!</li>
            <li>Once worn for a bit, a little more of the light musk/spice scent is present.  </li>
            <li>It smells Excellent and lasts all day compared to other colognes that last half a day.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is that I dint get the full kit.</li>
            <li>It smells okay and evaporates in less than 10 mins.</li>
            <li>Classic scent for men that never goes out of style.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit older</li>
            <li>I bought mine 2 years ago, and I&#x27;ve been using it more actively recently and still have a bit left.</li>
            <li>I love the little tin box it comes with</li>
            <li>It draws me in and I admit to hugging a few of my friends more often just because they were wearing that scent.</li>
            <li>This is the new go-to cologne for me.</li>
            <li>A slightly sweet, musky scent, this is a great evening cologne that would work equally well at a semi-formal dinner party or a casual night out on the town, especially in the fall and winter months.</li>
            <li>😒 USE VERY SPARINGLY UNTIL YOUR LADY FRIENDS OR SIGNIFICANT OTHER GET&#x27;S USED TO THIS COLOGNE!!</li>
            <li>Not sure what type of occasion this is appropriate for though.</li>
            <li>Case had a little damage but it is fine...</li>
            <li>i was paying 200% more for less at the local store.</li>
            <li>It might last longer, but for me I personally feel that the smell goes away to quick.</li>
            <li>but the Crush smells less strong and is a little sweet.</li>
            <li>I HAD TO HIDE IN THE BATHROOM,, AND WHEN I THOUGHT THE COAST WAS CLEAR, AND PEEKED-OUT THE DOOR,, SHE WAS EATING</li>
            <li>complete knock off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a man that likes to have a slightly masculine scent.</li>
            <li>This seemed old.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s an inexpensive scent that could be worn every day, but carries itself well enough to hobnob with the big name brands for a special occasion.</li>
            <li>I have been buying this product for several years now and highly recommend it to all men.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong smell and will last a few hours</li>
            <li>It is my new daily cologne.</li>
            <li>I really like this fragance, doesnt last long</li>
            <li>, I hope it really lasts long, for some reason I thought the bottle was going to be smaller</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this for the past couple years to just wear on regular days where I go out for a stroll or enjoy a day.</li>
            <li>THEN CHARGED THE DOOR,,😮 I BARELY GOT IT</li>
            <li>A bit overpowering when first put on, but settles down for a long-lasting scent.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> how amazing that smell was, I couldn&#x27;t stop talking about it.  </li>
            <li> Amazing Product.</li>
            <li> My husband liked it</li>
            <li> Thanks for the reviews...it helped me choose the perfect scent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very sporty scent so its probably best to use outdoors, or</li>
            <li> This came out with as an expansion of the already popular Curve line of products for men and women.</li>
            <li> But it has a nice aroma to it.</li>
            <li> Kindly don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> Though it is not for all men because every man has his own scent..</li>
            <li> I liked the smell of this cologne, but not 1 of the best, found the Curve Soul to be a bit better, but then again I tend to go for the more sweet smelling colognes.</li>
            <li> It arrived in perfect condition and was exactly like what I would have purchased for a lot more in the department stores.</li>
            <li> This mens cologne product has a strong aroma but pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Mine is real, and has a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t make it my primary scent, but is a good addition to any collection of colognes.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing too. :)</li>
            <li> Pretty good smelling cologne at a really good price.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite ( doesn&#x27;t allowed me to make 5 stars) but it deserve 10</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this cologne.</li>
            <li> No sooner is she gone then another woman approaches me and says \\&quot;I love that</li>
            <li> I just love this scent my husband wears it</li>
            <li> its orgasmic &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I just love it so damn</li>
            <li> I wear it casually most of the time.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> the Curve Crush smells much better</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a boy&#x27;s 16th birthday present - this is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I even use it sometimes :)</li>
            <li> An interesting scent by liz claiborne for men.</li>
            <li> I am glad I ordered this from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Received my product in a timely manner and was pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Love it on my husband.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> I love how this smells on my boyfriend..</li>
            <li> on him :) just got him another bottle for christmas</li>
            <li> I just love this Cologne</li>
            <li> Gets the job done and attracts compliments from many people.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li> I love shopping here.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on this fragrance.</li>
            <li> she is all over me now more than ever.</li>
            <li> so be sure that&#x27;s what you want.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how he smells before he leaves and when we go out.  </li>
            <li> HAHAHAHA!!!!</li>
            <li> Also, this product was delivered seriously fast!!!!</li>
            <li> We are a family who don&#x27;t like too many or too much smells - so this was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> Best smelling cologne I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nothing like the original Curve which none of the newer one&#x27;s will ever beat!</li>
            <li> This retains the smell so much better than Curve Wave, I&#x27;m guessing Curve Wave is just a very light and sweet scent.</li>
            <li> but it is huge, love the packaging,</li>
            <li> I decide to go on amazon, and I found the exact kind he wanted (Curve Crush), which they don&#x27;t sell in too many stores anymore.</li>
            <li> It leans more towards the cheap side.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , if it is sold by amazon you can bet that you will recieve it fast and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Smells good and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I like it because it has a nice fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> I love curve and how this one and the original smell like.</li>
            <li> Not too strong, not overpowering</li>
            <li> I am a person that does NOT like cologne or perfume that is strong.  </li>
            <li> This is something my son was looking for at the duty free shops and couldn&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li> I said no, to which she replied with a sexy smile, \\&quot;Ohhh...</li>
            <li> This perfume smells fantastic and it lasts all day, literally.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great, gets the ladies going, and you get a massive amount of it.</li>
            <li> It came really fast, and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Great packaging, and lasting effect.</li>
            <li> It used to be one of my favorite colognes back then, best for young adults.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;d spend my money on something else if I could go back in time, but it&#x27;s a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> and I have had it for years since I don&#x27;t use it much!!!</li>
            <li> I had made the mistake at Macy&#x27;s and bought the original Curve</li>
            <li> worth the money!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it, it&#x27;s not the original</li>
            <li> but honestly I always get a new bottle when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> It does have a clean smell.</li>
            <li> It doesnt smell super cheap</li>
            <li> Not too strong, just right and lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> scent is just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; but nothing special.</li>
            <li> If you want to attract that fine lady and you think you have the right manly scent that this cologne can accent then go for it.</li>
            <li> so I want something that is very inviting when dealing with customers but not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> so that was a good thing since it was a birthday present</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a present for my husband and he loved it, I was supposed to receive it on wednesday</li>
            <li> Unlike some dispensers, this one works very well and lasts many hours</li>
            <li> It smell kinda sweet</li>
            <li> I am looking for a nice masculine but majority sweet scent for my job.</li>
            <li> This is my least favorite Curve ever!!!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really like the smell its okay maybe good for teen&#x27;s not so much of a manly smell</li>
            <li> at parties, but to each their own :-)&lt;br /&gt;This is a great scent and if you are considering buying this for the first time, you will not be disappointing.</li>
            <li> It has a &#x27;fresh citrus&#x27; scent to it that lingers on for hours.</li>
            <li> You shoud definetly buy this if you are looking for something worth the money.</li>
            <li> worth  colonge</li>
            <li> This is, so far, my favorite cologne on him.</li>
            <li> It came quickly &amp; was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> at any rate.. she is super hot</li>
            <li> it was out of the thing it comes with other than that it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> Overall, a good buy, and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Right on the spot😉.  </li>
            <li> but i realized now that they didn&#x27;t help me choose a right product.</li>
            <li> There are some fake crush sold out there, Luckily I picked the right one anda was perfect for the price.</li>
            <li> I buy him a large bottle every year, and it lasts quite some time!</li>
            <li> It arrived super fast</li>
            <li> likes it very much.</li>
            <li> This cologne has an amazing smell and last very long and believe me it will get u many complments each time  </li>
            <li> Works better with the ladies and leaves a lasting impression.</li>
            <li> It smells absolutely fantastic and yummy, so manly yet sweet, and totally not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I had already got him a present and didn&#x27;t want to spend too much more.</li>
            <li> is at first kinda like idk maybe spicy?</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> did not get any compliments from this cologne and the scent fades away so fast!</li>
            <li> Check it out, usually at christmas some resonably priced set come out, and on Amazon here their are some good prices as well.</li>
            <li> This scent has a little less spice scent than the original, and has more of a citrus or even rose scent to it.  </li>
            <li> I felt the original curve was to close to the old polo colonge, but this is a bit more light, and once worn a while has a more masculine scent despite initially having a little fruity flowery smell.  </li>
            <li> I think they can vastly improve on that issue by having a normal top to protect the atomizer part.</li>
            <li> BUT ON A  SERIOUS NOTE DUDE&#x27;S ,, REALLY GREAT STUFF,, WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT</li>
            <li> Wanted to try out Curve colonge for once and it does smell good but hardly noticable but</li>
            <li> I get more compliments from the ladies when I wear this then pretty much every other cologne I own which is crazy since this is the cheapest cologne/Perfum I own.</li>
            <li> no matter how much you use.</li>
            <li> thanks china</li>
            <li> AND SHIPPED FAST</li>
            <li> shipped fast</li>
            <li> It is real</li>
            <li> would buy again since it arrived fast</li>
            <li> Girls really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Not as much as my Armani</li>
            <li> very good!Received it on time.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Fast shipping to</li>
            <li> I wish it would last longer other than that it is good</li>
            <li> I was so excited, and it was only like $20!!!</li>
            <li> For this price just buy the original or try a different one!</li>
            <li> Once worn for a bit, a little more of the light musk/spice scent is present.  </li>
            <li> It smells Excellent and lasts all day compared to other colognes that last half a day.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that I dint get the full kit.</li>
            <li> It smells okay and evaporates in less than 10 mins.</li>
            <li> Classic scent for men that never goes out of style.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit older</li>
            <li> I bought mine 2 years ago, and I&#x27;ve been using it more actively recently and still have a bit left.</li>
            <li> I love the little tin box it comes with</li>
            <li> It draws me in and I admit to hugging a few of my friends more often just because they were wearing that scent.</li>
            <li> This is the new go-to cologne for me.</li>
            <li> A slightly sweet, musky scent, this is a great evening cologne that would work equally well at a semi-formal dinner party or a casual night out on the town, especially in the fall and winter months.</li>
            <li> 😒 USE VERY SPARINGLY UNTIL YOUR LADY FRIENDS OR SIGNIFICANT OTHER GET&#x27;S USED TO THIS COLOGNE!!</li>
            <li> Not sure what type of occasion this is appropriate for though.</li>
            <li> Case had a little damage but it is fine...</li>
            <li> i was paying 200% more for less at the local store.</li>
            <li> It might last longer, but for me I personally feel that the smell goes away to quick.</li>
            <li> but the Crush smells less strong and is a little sweet.</li>
            <li> I HAD TO HIDE IN THE BATHROOM,, AND WHEN I THOUGHT THE COAST WAS CLEAR, AND PEEKED-OUT THE DOOR,, SHE WAS EATING</li>
            <li> complete knock off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man that likes to have a slightly masculine scent.</li>
            <li> This seemed old.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s an inexpensive scent that could be worn every day, but carries itself well enough to hobnob with the big name brands for a special occasion.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for several years now and highly recommend it to all men.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strong smell and will last a few hours</li>
            <li> It is my new daily cologne.</li>
            <li> I really like this fragance, doesnt last long</li>
            <li> , I hope it really lasts long, for some reason I thought the bottle was going to be smaller</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for the past couple years to just wear on regular days where I go out for a stroll or enjoy a day.</li>
            <li> THEN CHARGED THE DOOR,,😮 I BARELY GOT IT</li>
            <li> A bit overpowering when first put on, but settles down for a long-lasting scent.</li>
            <li> the smell doesnt last long....</li>
            <li> but the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It just took a long time to get here and arrived even later than the projected time frame.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more than casual, but less than formal, if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li> Out of all the colognes he has used in the past this is by far my fav.</li>
            <li> CLOSED</li>
            <li> I know he asked the dude what cologne he was wearing and a few weeks later</li>
            <li> Not much to say.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it was not marked better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really something I&#x27;d wear on a first date, though, as it&#x27;s quite easy to over-do it, and when that happens it&#x27;s very heavy, almost verging on sickening.</li>
            <li> I wanted the other curve the one with the orange tab</li>
            <li> I like the other Curve</li>
            <li> They should have a longer lasting flavor i mean fragance</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle, but definitely commanding.</li>
            <li> If put on to heavy, may smell a bit feminine.</li>
            <li> I smelled a guy in the airport walk past me wearing this cologne and melted, i immediately gushed to my boyfriend</li>
            <li> This version of Curve is hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> I went to the mall, and it was over $50 for a small bottle!</li>
            <li> seriously all my girlfriends love(d) it</li>
            <li> so when I get tired of using Curve Connect</li>
            <li> Very small, too expensive</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> cant go wrong with this item</li>
            <li> oh i&#x27;m just silly on the title</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a fancy, expensive cologne.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quite expensive.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt smell expensive.</li>
            <li> And for the price, it&#x27;s really hard to beat!!!  </li>
            <li> and it drives me crazy..</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this cologne after reading the reviews here making it seem amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m standing in line to buy this cologne when I beautiful blond woman in front of me turns around and asked me if I had ever tried Crush. I said no, to which she replied with a sexy smile, \\&quot;Ohhh...you&#x27;re going to like it\\&quot;! I&#x27;m thinking to myself, I&#x27;m liking it already. No sooner is she gone then another woman approaches me and says \\&quot;I love that, I&#x27;ve got to get some of that for my boyfriend\\&quot;. If Crush works this well inside the box, imagine how well it will work when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li> I just love this scent my husband wears it and it drives me crazy.. its orgasmic &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Was very pleased! It came quickly &amp; was exactly what I needed. This version of Curve is hard to find in stores so I was so happy to find it here and for a great price of course!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells fantastic and it lasts all day, literally. I just love it so damn much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will NOT be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be ordering again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The service was excellent, it reached in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order now and thank me later!</li>
            <li> It smells so great. I get a lot of compliments on it. Not sure what type of occasion this is appropriate for though. I wear it casually most of the time. To test...I sprayed this on one card and sprayed Curve Wave on another card and smelled them, then let them sit for 30 minutes to smell them again. This retains the smell so much better than Curve Wave, I&#x27;m guessing Curve Wave is just a very light and sweet scent. I&#x27;m a man that likes to have a slightly masculine scent. Works better with the ladies and leaves a lasting impression. I am looking for a nice masculine but majority sweet scent for my job. I work management so I want something that is very inviting when dealing with customers but not too overwhelming. Although it&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m looking for it&#x27;s a very great scent that I will continue to use. I like to switch up a lot so when I get tired of using Curve Connect I&#x27;ll use this.</li>
            <li> Smells great. shipped fast</li>
            <li> Love it.  Smells great.  It is real has I got it before for my boyfriend and decided to order another year later. Great price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a gift and it came without a lid. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very small, too expensive</li>
            <li> Arrived before  arriving date so that was a good thing since it was a birthday present and it smells really good would buy again since it arrived fast</li>
            <li> My husband liked it I was disappointed that it was not marked better I wanted the other curve the one with the orange tab I thought this one was it but it was not.</li>
            <li> I had bought Curve before but is wasn&#x27;t Curve Crush. I had made the mistake at Macy&#x27;s and bought the original Curve but after wearing it for a couple weeks I knew i had made a mistake. the Curve Crush smells much better don&#x27;t get me wrong I like the other Curve but the Crush smells less strong and is a little sweet.</li>
            <li> My son got this as a gift (he&#x27;s 15) - and it is a wonderful, light smell.  We are a family who don&#x27;t like too many or too much smells - so this was a pleasant surprise.  If you are looking for a boy&#x27;s 16th birthday present - this is wonderful.</li>
            <li> A slightly sweet, musky scent, this is a great evening cologne that would work equally well at a semi-formal dinner party or a casual night out on the town, especially in the fall and winter months. It&#x27;s not really something I&#x27;d wear on a first date, though, as it&#x27;s quite easy to over-do it, and when that happens it&#x27;s very heavy, almost verging on sickening. Overall, it&#x27;s an inexpensive scent that could be worn every day, but carries itself well enough to hobnob with the big name brands for a special occasion. I wouldn&#x27;t make it my primary scent, but is a good addition to any collection of colognes. Overall, a good buy, and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My guy wears this bottle of cologne that I get 6 or 7 years ago for my ex that never used it. The bottle is still perfectly good. It smells absolutely fantastic and yummy, so manly yet sweet, and totally not overpowering. Makes me purr any time he sprays it on.  Once he&#x27;s done with this bottle, he will definitely have another one in his Xmas stocking.</li>
            <li> Smells great, women love it. Everywhere I go people tell me how great I smell...</li>
            <li> works everytime, 60% of the time</li>
            <li> Thanks for the reviews...it helped me choose the perfect scent</li>
            <li> I will keep this short and to the point.&lt;br /&gt;This cologne is a very nice smelling cologne. It has a &#x27;fresh citrus&#x27; scent to it that lingers on for hours. For me, this cologne has stayed on me for around 6-8 hours. It&#x27;s a very sporty scent so its probably best to use outdoors, or at parties, but to each their own :-)&lt;br /&gt;This is a great scent and if you are considering buying this for the first time, you will not be disappointing.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great, gets the ladies going, and you get a massive amount of it. I&#x27;ll probably have this for 5 years before I run out, in which case, I&#x27;ll be back!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of it best cologne I ever bought! The after smell is also really good. You shoud definetly buy this if you are looking for something worth the money.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend wanted Curve for Christmas. I went to the mall, and it was over $50 for a small bottle! I had already got him a present and didn&#x27;t want to spend too much more. I decide to go on amazon, and I found the exact kind he wanted (Curve Crush), which they don&#x27;t sell in too many stores anymore. I was so excited, and it was only like $20!!! It came really fast, and smells amazing. I even use it sometimes :)</li>
            <li> It is a good quality product with a good price, nice fargancias that remain on the skin for polongado time. Recomeindo buying this brand of perfumes.</li>
            <li> Smells like always! Great product. Case had a little damage but it is fine...</li>
            <li> An interesting scent by liz claiborne for men. This came out with as an expansion of the already popular Curve line of products for men and women. I believe their are now about 5 different curve scents.  This scent has a little less spice scent than the original, and has more of a citrus or even rose scent to it.  If put on to heavy, may smell a bit feminine. Once worn for a bit, a little more of the light musk/spice scent is present.  I felt the original curve was to close to the old polo colonge, but this is a bit more light, and once worn a while has a more masculine scent despite initially having a little fruity flowery smell.  Check it out, usually at christmas some resonably priced set come out, and on Amazon here their are some good prices as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this after hearing about how good it it was without ever trying it, just as a cologne for work. for the price i was shocked at how good it was, and I even wear it sometimes when I go out on evenings instead of my more expensive ones</li>
            <li> Great product, amazing fragrance!! worth the money!</li>
            <li> Whenever I pass a guy wearing curve crush, let&#x27;s just say...I know.  I LOVE this scent! Any guy who wears it is immediately more attractive than he otherwise would have been. It draws me in and I admit to hugging a few of my friends more often just because they were wearing that scent.</li>
            <li> I like it. I wear it if I can&#x27;t decide what I want to wear for that day. Honestly, I&#x27;d spend my money on something else if I could go back in time, but it&#x27;s a nice fragrance. I have received compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Projection: Moderate&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: 7-8 Hours&lt;br /&gt;Smell: 4/10</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a present for my husband and he loved it, I was supposed to receive it on wednesday and I got it today, even faster than what they originaly estimated, it smells great, my husband sprayed some on his shirt like 2 hours ago and stil smells, I hope it really lasts long, for some reason I thought the bottle was going to be smaller but it is huge, love the packaging, cant go wrong with this item, if it is sold by amazon you can bet that you will recieve it fast and in good condition.</li>
            <li> GREAT FRAGRANCE , LIKE IT OVER MY POLO BLUE AND AQUA DI GIO</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my husband and he loved it. I am glad I ordered this from Amazon. Really great product by Liz Claiborne.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend and it smells delicious. It arrived super fast and I would recommend this product. Thank you</li>
            <li> This is a great scent that can be used in the daytime or evening. Girls really like it. It is my new daily cologne.</li>
            <li> oh i&#x27;m just silly on the title&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but seriously all my girlfriends love(d) it</li>
            <li> Received my product in a timely manner and was pleased with it.  It was as discribed and a good price. Would order from this place again.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Love it on my husband.</li>
            <li> Best smelling cologne I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time. This is the new go-to cologne for me. Not too strong, not overpowering</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Great Cologne. I love curve and how this one and the original smell like. I also like the boxes they come in this cologne is at first kinda like idk maybe spicy? But it has a nice aroma to it. It&#x27;s really great!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite men&#x27;s cologne. It smells Excellent and lasts all day compared to other colognes that last half a day. I have been buying this product for several years now and highly recommend it to all men. Actually, I use several of the &amp;#34;Liz Claiborne For Men&amp;#34; colognes as they are all quality products.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to any guy.. I love how this smells on my boyfriend.. Out of all the colognes he has used in the past this is by far my fav. on him :) just got him another bottle for christmas</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a fancy, expensive cologne. But, the ladies like it, and I like wearing it. A bit overpowering when first put on, but settles down for a long-lasting scent.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this cologne, and it smells really good. This is the best deal on it too - in stores it&#x27;s quite expensive. Thanks!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really like the smell its okay maybe good for teen&#x27;s not so much of a manly smell i used this twice and gave it away</li>
            <li> This bottle smells really good but the smell doesn&#x27;t last long. a couple of hours max and then it&#x27;s gone even from the clothes</li>
            <li> Not the greatest on me but its a good smell</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd bottle of this flavor. It matches my chemistry well and the ladies dig it. That is a win in my book.</li>
            <li> Pretty good smelling cologne at a really good price.</li>
            <li> Ahh I just love how it smells not to exaggerated and not to low. Right on the spot😉.  I&#x27;m defenetly buying another one. 👍</li>
            <li> I just love this Cologne</li>
            <li> It arrived in perfect condition and was exactly like what I would have purchased for a lot more in the department stores.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this cologne after reading the reviews here making it seem amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; but nothing special. It doesnt smell super cheap but it doesnt smell expensive. It leans more towards the cheap side.&lt;br /&gt;I did not get any compliments from this cologne and the scent fades away so fast! After 3 hours you cannot smell it unless you put your nose on your skin...&lt;br /&gt;I was going to return it but figured i will just keep it as part of my collection for reference.</li>
            <li> Great! as described!!!</li>
            <li> My son said the cologne was great.  It just took a long time to get here and arrived even later than the projected time frame.</li>
            <li> Great value for size of bottle!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Smells great and comes in a protective box</li>
            <li> This cologne has an amazing smell and last very long and believe me it will get u many complments each time  u wear it.</li>
            <li> I liked the smell of this cologne, but not 1 of the best, found the Curve Soul to be a bit better, but then again I tend to go for the more sweet smelling colognes.</li>
            <li> This cologne is very nice. Great packaging, and lasting effect.Unlike some dispensers, this one works very well and lasts many hours</li>
            <li> Classic scent for men that never goes out of style. It&#x27;s a bit older but honestly I always get a new bottle when mine runs out. Great cologne.</li>
            <li> My husband has worn this for 10 years, and I still love it on him! I buy him a large bottle every year, and it lasts quite some time!</li>
            <li> My son loves this stuff</li>
            <li> My favorite scent, it&#x27;s a keeper, very attractive to women. 100% recommended</li>
            <li> The wife loves the smell, and you can&#x27;t beat the price (I haven&#x27;t found it cheaper anywhere else anyway).  No complaints from me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for the past couple years to just wear on regular days where I go out for a stroll or enjoy a day. Gets the job done and attracts compliments from many people. Not as much as my Armani but it&#x27;s great for the money.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite cologne. Never disappoints. Smells amazing too. :)</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li> very good!Received it on time.&lt;br /&gt;Just buy it as a gift.and it is really a good gift.&lt;br /&gt;He likes it very much.</li>
            <li> I receive a lot of compliments from the ladies on this one!</li>
            <li> this is great cologne for my husband, he smells great with it on and i coulnt be happier with it</li>
            <li> It smells like stuff. Women have already started treating me nicer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it, it&#x27;s not the original</li>
            <li> This seemed old. Doesn&#x27;t smell like ones in store</li>
            <li> I smelled a guy in the airport walk past me wearing this cologne and melted, i immediately gushed to my boyfriend how amazing that smell was, I couldn&#x27;t stop talking about it.  Next thing I know he asked the dude what cologne he was wearing and a few weeks later has it himself.  The scent of this cologne makes me instantly head over heals, you could be that guy that never gets the girl, but i&#x27;m telling you coming from a girl, you will get the girls if you wear this scent!!</li>
            <li> Great price and love the scent.</li>
            <li> they loved it thank you</li>
            <li> I wish it would last longer other than that it is good it smells good, too!!! It might last longer, but for me I personally feel that the smell goes away to quick. I love the little tin box it comes with that&#x27;s what I use when I travel with the cologne.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this.I love shopping here.Fast shipping to</li>
            <li> Kindly don&#x27;t buy this. It smells okay and evaporates in less than 10 mins. I ordered after reading all the reviews but i realized now that they didn&#x27;t help me choose a right product.</li>
            <li> Good buy and satisfaction guaranteed. Smells good and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Got this for my son, he loves it.excellent price also, it sticks with him all day. Will buy again that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought mine 2 years ago, and I&#x27;ve been using it more actively recently and still have a bit left. Mine is real, and has a very pleasant smell. It used to be one of my favorite colognes back then, best for young adults.</li>
            <li> Curve colognes rule.  I like it because it has a nice fresh scent.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like a chemical like some colognes.</li>
            <li> Amazing Product. Fantastic Scent!!</li>
            <li> Have always loved this scent. My husband wears this, Sean Jean &amp; Aqua Dgio and is always receiving compliments from women.</li>
            <li> There are some fake crush sold out there, Luckily I picked the right one anda was perfect for the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  like smell  worth  colonge</li>
            <li> This is a very good smelling cologne, manly have already gotten a couple of compliments on it and I&#x27;ve only been wearing it for a couple of days now.  And for the price, it&#x27;s really hard to beat!!!  Also, this product was delivered seriously fast!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my least favorite Curve ever!!! Smells like soap only! It&#x27;s a strong smell and will last a few hours but it&#x27;s nothing like the original Curve which none of the newer one&#x27;s will ever beat! Would never buy this again and I have had it for years since I don&#x27;t use it much!!! For this price just buy the original or try a different one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on this fragrance. It&#x27;s subtle, but definitely commanding. I would recommend this to any type of guy. It&#x27;s more than casual, but less than formal, if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li> great price. i was paying 200% more for less at the local store. amazon hit this out the park with price.</li>
            <li> Though it is not for all men because every man has his own scent.. this works for me.. I got it to attract this lady that I produce shows on tv for. she&#x27;s the host. at any rate.. she is super hot and I got this cologne to grab her attention and its doing just that. she is all over me now more than ever. this was just the cherry on the sundae. If you want to attract that fine lady and you think you have the right manly scent that this cologne can accent then go for it. It smell kinda sweet so be sure that&#x27;s what you want.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic. the ladies love iT!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it personally but the hubs splashes it on and he is instantly 12% sexier.</li>
            <li> Not much to say. It makes me wanna rip my boyfriends clothes off. This is, so far, my favorite cologne on him.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne for years. Absolutely love it. Not too strong, just right and lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments from the ladies when I wear this then pretty much every other cologne I own which is crazy since this is the cheapest cologne/Perfum I own.</li>
            <li> I am a person that does NOT like cologne or perfume that is strong.  It gives me a headache.  This cologne smells so good.  My hubby leaves for work an hour before I do so I am still in bed when he leaves.  I absolutely love how he smells before he leaves and when we go out.  No headaches!</li>
            <li> This mens cologne product has a strong aroma but pleasant.  Shipping the product however is another story.  The product does not have a \\&quot;top\\&quot; to protect it when shipping; it has a \\&quot;clip\\&quot; type attachment that is supposed to keep the atomizer from spraying during shipping.  That \\&quot;clip\\&quot; does not work.  My product arrived timely but there had been some leakage.  I think they can vastly improve on that issue by having a normal top to protect the atomizer part.</li>
