            <li>The best way to use them is after you shower</li>

            <li>I am a VERY happy customer, and thrilled with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They just may not be good for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>But they&#x27;re good for thicker longer hair.</li>
            <li>It literally takes 5 minutes once you get the hang of it, for the most beautiful even curls, I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>It does take a lot of trial and error to learn the best way to use them, but once you get an idea of what works for you, they can be applied quickly and work reliably.</li>
            <li>I have to experiment more to give the product a fair chance, but they are good rollers.</li>
            <li>Love them!  </li>
            <li>The curlers do look really cute in!</li>

            <li>/&gt;**I have to add, I love that these are machine washable too!</li>
            <li>I added Aveda&#x27;s Smooth Infusion Style-Prep Smoother to my damp hair, and that was all I needed to have beautiful curls that lasted all day.</li>

            <li>/lock together because they do feel very secure on your head</li>
            <li>and they are VERY comfortable to sleep in...</li>
            <li>Ok, I haven&#x27;t rolled my hair in years.</li>
            <li>The curl lasts for two days, more if I didn&#x27;t bathe her.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to find these.  </li>
            <li>I had one package and needed more.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to read the directions</li>
            <li>The next morning my curls were perfect.  </li>
            <li>It is ideal for natural hair because I can curl my hair without the hassle or danger of adding heat to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love love love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the effects of this--&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>I do wish the set came with more-</li>
            <li>The curls are very resilient and are even great for 2 days.</li>
            <li>love them can sleep in them ...</li>
            <li>Needed to create ringlets for my daughter&#x27;s ballet - these created more of an abstract curl vs a defined ringlet.  </li>
            <li>Just like many &amp;#</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I love the rollers, wish they were in fatter sizes.</li>
            <li>However with shorter hair this would be better,</li>
            <li>These were fantastic from the start!  </li>
            <li>OKay....</li>
            <li>Not wear-to-work-or-a-nightclub cute (but</li>
            <li>Well, my hair is already curly, I was just hoping for a more tamed curl.  </li>
            <li>http://www.amazon.com/Conair-Styling-Essentials-Rollers-Curlers/dp/B009VGIHS6/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_bt_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;1SRZF2FD006RQCMVVQZT the conair pillow rollers better...</li>
            <li>I had been using a cut-off sock bun in my hair to give me some waves, and wanted a bit more curl.</li>
            <li>love them for traveling.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d have more of the longer rollers.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, they are not bad at all.</li>
            <li>The effect is shiny, soft, beautiful princess curls.  </li>
            <li>It took a fews times for me to learn how to do it quick and effectively.</li>
            <li>Have fun curling, you will love these!</li>
            <li>The do shrink my hair up to shoulder length and the result is a very full head of curls.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t carry them in most drugstores anymore, but are available through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I felt that the price is fair and the product works very well.</li>
            <li>I just snap them in while my hair is damp and do a combination of air and blow drying in the morning for quick lift and curl, very easy.</li>
            <li>I love them so much I almost want to buy more just in case they ever stop making them!</li>
            <li>Easy to sleep in.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put in.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are fairly easy to sleep in as well.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to put in, and they stay in.  </li>
            <li>Some people may find it easy, but not me.  </li>
            <li>Product shipped very quick.  </li>
            <li>The snap mechanism was surprisingly easy to use.</li>
            <li>would strongly advise anyone who desires curly hair to use old-fashioned foam rollers instead.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten decent looking curls once since I bought them a good while ago.</li>
            <li>When you have fine hair like mine, a full head of all-day curls is quite feat!</li>
            <li>The curls are beautiful and last all day with out any hair spray.</li>
            <li>ding them a star because there is no way the average (or excellent) woman is going to get the hair styles shown on the package.  </li>
            <li>and she sleeps just fine with them in.  </li>
            <li>So in short, I would not expect perfect results your first time.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to use and extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li>hair is fine.  </li>
            <li>So the fact that it takes me 15 minutes to put these in is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>They were comfortable for her to wear at night.</li>
            <li>I just figured this review would be more useful if you knew what type and length of hair I am using with this product.</li>
            <li>They were super easy to get in my hair, easy to close, held in hair well, and were comfortable to sleep in.  </li>
            <li>akin to those cute flip flops you wear right after getting a pedicure.  </li>
            <li>are super comfortable - and I like the cool animal print!</li>
            <li>It was super easy to put the rollers in.  </li>
            <li>did this on dry hair and let it sit for an hour while I got ready for work, the curls were awesome!  </li>
            <li>I love these rollers (they are a couple of dollars cheaper at Walgreens if you are willing to make the trip).  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>These rollers offer a much better curl than the Conair Hot Roller Set that I just purchased.  </li>
            <li>So I picked these up originally at a beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li>These are a great way to get heatless curls for long hair.  </li>
            <li>Mah - nothing to get excited over</li>
            <li>The good thing is they&#x27;re so soft it&#x27;s for the most part really comfy to sleep in.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to sleep on them, and it takes a great deal of time to blow dry your hair.    </li>
            <li>Then roll them in (using clean partings with a tail comb)</li>
            <li>-wild aside, they have been one of my favorite beauty sacrifices to make when I have been able to bring myself to do so.  </li>
            <li>when i took them out i was so happy to see my hair had more volume than usual and was super easy to style.  </li>
            <li>The plastic pins are much easier to wrap the hair around and the foam absorbs the hair better, unlike the slippery fabric.</li>
            <li>The Wrap Snap N Go Rollers definitely look well constructed with nice fabric, in a nice plastic zip case with very descriptive instruction booklet.  </li>
            <li>but once you get the hang of it they&#x27;re cool.</li>
            <li>If they made a larger size, those would be good for people with longer hair.  </li>
            <li>Waiste of money , puts wave in your hair it might give you good curls if you have super short hair or if you leave them in for days..........</li>
            <li>Normally my hair goes flat hours after curling with a hot iron or rollers, so this was excellent!</li>
            <li>They fall out right away even though I filled the directions.</li>
            <li>: No heat, fairly comfortable, cute leopard print (so my husband doesn&#x27;t totally run for the hills, yes, I can be cute with these... sort of), Snap clasp makes these worth purchase, you don&#x27;t have to use any clips or pins.  </li>
            <li>is only because the material used to cover them could be smoother or more satiny and would be better to protect the hair shaft (I sleep on a satin pillowcase and</li>
            <li>I guess they&#x27;re quick?</li>
            <li>work best left in overnight, and are the only rollers I can sleep in overnight.  </li>
            <li>These are good for long hair.  </li>
            <li>The good thing about this product, you are not adding extra damage to the hair by using hot rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t believe how easy these were to sleep on.</li>
            <li>In addition, the way they are installed differs more than you might think when you look at them, and that makes a very unexpected difference.  </li>
            <li>It keeps falling out if I don&#x27;t knot it before I snap it, but if done properly the curls are amazing.</li>
            <li>All in all, for $10, or $14 on amazon, they are well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love these soft bouncy curls.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that the curlers are soft and don&#x27;t burn your head.</li>
            <li>Most of the wayward curl problems I have experienced have been easily attributable to user error--in a fit of aggression, I either wind them too tight trying to pin the cranky little ends under to keep them in all night, or I don&#x27;t pay attention to which way</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to buy some more, though, because there&#x27;s no other product like it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice to give your hair a rest from heat processing of curling irons, flat irons etc.</li>
            <li>I was excited that one package curled my whole head</li>
            <li>The result is that they stay where you put them, which in my case was right around the crown of my head.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy, my 6 year old can do it.</li>
            <li>have used pillow rollers (of good quality, given the previously explored corners of the market) for some years, and all too-tight ringlets and spirals-gone</li>
            <li>and you can do it on a squirmy four year old amazingly quick!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!  </li>
            <li>(Use hot rollers for that.)</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Since the my hair will hold a perm forever, the curls stay intact pretty well</li>
            <li>I only used 4 curlers for my 1b,F/M,ii,MBL hair, and the cascade of curls is lovely.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t feel them at all when I was sleeping, they are so soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t want hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>There are no wires or tiny coils of rock-hard squished pillow and hair to jab you in the noggin all night, and they are piled neatly on the part of your head that, unless you are a skilled yogi, you are not using for sleeping anyway.  </li>
            <li>The curlers are fairly comfortable for sleeping and don&#x27;t look completely hideous.</li>
            <li>she listed a site she found on a technique of wrapping your hair in a head band, which gave me exactly what I was looking for:</li>
            <li>I am going to try these one more time, curling my hair around 2 or 3 of them to get a larger curl and see what happens.</li>
            <li>They are REALLY easy to put in, I mean super easy!</li>
            <li>I use a lot of different kinds of curlers, these are fun, and really easy.  </li>
            <li>but I would imagine if your hair texture is right, they would work very well that way.</li>
            <li>I seem to still be twisting them a bit too tight to make sure they are secure, but hey, I still learning.</li>
            <li>Add some root lifter or mousse and use on barely damp hair to maximize hold/volume and minimize dry time and you will be pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have to remember to leave the slightest bit of slack in the bottom few so that you don&#x27;t yank your precious locks as you hoist them up to the ones you will lock them into, to avoid yanking a couple hairs that didn&#x27;t have enough give, but that is an easy step and is also easy to correct: just unroll and retry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes me less than 20 minutes to put them in and they look really cute!</li>
            <li>Gives beautiful Victoria secret model curls overnight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a hot, sexy, loose type curled look.  </li>
            <li>For sleeping, I would suggest sleeping with pillow rollers, those are pretty comfy for sleeping and make great overnight curls on wet and dry</li>
            <li>then I tried leaving my precious sleep out of it and invested in a bonnet dryer, so that I could just blast the damp hair dry and get on with my day.  </li>
            <li>Many times I&#x27;ve shampooed in the morning, and worked just a bit of product through my hair and let it air dry, then roll it in the evening.  </li>
            <li>After buying pretty much every type on the market, including the cheap version of these,  I&#x27;ve finally settled with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>They gave me a nice tight curl.  </li>
            <li>The curls are big and beautiful, not the skinny old woman look of the old fashioned foam curlers, and if you roll them from the middle, you get ringlets!</li>
            <li>i curled my hair in big chunks on these and slept on them just fine.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair about mid-back length, and after I used these, the length of my hair stopped above my shoulders!  </li>
            <li>and these curlers work very well for all lengths .Curl</li>
            <li>I have hair to my shoulders, stick straight, and the curls, after sleeping in them,</li>
            <li>how much come in it?</li>
            <li>The curl is very bouncy.  </li>
            <li>so much so that I walked into a restaurant</li>
            <li>and it is ridiculously straight.</li>
            <li>my hair was VERY curly...</li>
            <li>They work better with wet hair, along with pieces of perm paper.</li>
            <li>These snap and wrap rollers make my life so much easier, and now I can rest assured my hair will look fabuluous in the morning</li>
            <li>no matter how much I toss and turn.</li>
            <li>The result isn&#x27;t fabulous, but it does work by creating some waves which are a definite improvement for me.</li>
            <li>These seem really durable and sturdy, and can be washed in the machine.  </li>
            <li>You really need to dampin the hair AND use some form of product if you have thicker hair</li>
            <li>There are no bendy spines, no bendy foam cores, and they have big hair-safe snaps at the ends, used to secure them.  </li>
            <li>(Note, I think I might try these for padding the next time I am trying to get comfortable and stable in a headstand in yoga class.)  </li>
            <li>It looks very \\&quot;spa-day chic,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The curl really varies depending on tightness of the curl and amount of hair used.  </li>
            <li>It is VERY helpful.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have much grip</li>
            <li>Too much heat fries my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also not a morning person who wants to spend an hour washing, drying and styling my hair in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway</li>
            <li>Even so, it&#x27;s important to snap the ends together on the outside - not against your scalp.  </li>
            <li>I use hair spray if it&#x27;s a windy or very humid day.  </li>
            <li>The curls are really nice, but they fall if you don&#x27;t use a product and have heavy</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the most comfortable curlers to sleep on, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re like sleeping without any curlers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pillow rollers, unlike many women in their other relationships, have backbones.  </li>
            <li>The snaps technically do work, because I tried them by just holding them down in my hands, under a light, not up in my hair, so I could see them better, and managed to snap them.  </li>
            <li>thanks i hop a decent amount is in it</li>
            <li>I have very long hair, and lots (fine texture).</li>
            <li>I recently purchased theses, to wear while sleeping (VERY COMFORTABLE), so I could sleep in an extra 30 min.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try these after seeing them at the drugstore to add some curl and volume up top and was expecting them to be a let down.</li>
            <li>I slept overnight with my satin sleep cap over the top to keep the frizzies down, and finger combed my hair after I took the curlers out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably be able to do it on someone else&#x27;s head if they were sitting down in front of me</li>
            <li>No matter how you lie down, the things are, for the most part, out of your way and non-disruptive to your sleep.  </li>
            <li>To their credit, they do produce a curl quickly on dry hair, but if you have layered hair, these are a huge chore to get rolled and keep in.  </li>
            <li>Mainly because rollers hurt to sleep in and they leave dents in my hair, which gives away the fact that my hair had been rolled.</li>
            <li>In a nutshell, they fix the primary flaws above, and add a couple unexpected benefits as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would love it if they could come out with different sizes of these curlers for different types of curls.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like little frizzy ringlets, so I put more hair on each stick, and get big full curls, like you would from a set of jumbo rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>these give a decent curl, not as easy to use as i would like, you do have to connect or thread one through the other to make them stay in.  </li>
            <li>I focus on the areas around my face and the top layer of my hair all the way around my part for a little boost.</li>
            <li>: You will get better at putting them in with a little time.  </li>
            <li>I bought them at Sally about a year ago and they work great for tight spiral curls that last all day long.</li>
            <li>bottom line is that for me, these curlers are great if you want tight spiral curls that last all day long.</li>
            <li>Nothing you would wear for the raw sake of being fashionable, but something you&#x27;re okay showing others as it suggests that you&#x27;re amidst a day of power-pampering yourself.  </li>
            <li>but there are some very key highlights that I think will prove important to those of you who have an existing love-hate relationship with a beauty product you spend a theoretical 1/3 of your life</li>
            <li>My hair is very straight and silky, and they would not stay in it for an hour let alone the entire night.</li>
            <li>Further, they are long and made entirely of foam, so you are not bound to wrapping the length of your hair around a miniscule square of foam and are free to wrap more loosely or in a manner to create spiral curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>am well aware that, heretofore, the gold standard for pillow rollers has been a happy malleable little center bit, upon which a forgiving block of foam is skewered, with the entire contraption being encased in a piece of grabby, softish material, either fuzzy fleecy stuff or something that looks to be part of a space blanket.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used them, I didn&#x27;t follow directions and interlock each stick, so I used some pin curl clips to hold them in place, which isn&#x27;t really necessary if you follow directions.  </li>
            <li>The curl from these is a bit tighter than the hot roller set that I have, but the hair looks loose, soft, and natural- compared to what happened with the hot roller</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair that is just above the bra strap.</li>
            <li>This led to more hair-pulling, oddly distributed curls, and wouldn&#x27;t really help those who get their beauty rest with one cheek or the the other planted in their real pillow...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Interleaving the rollers like a chain results in the creation of a Greek goddess-style halo of pillow rings, which is actually quite cool.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair with a very uneven curl pattern and lot of frizz, so I throw a perm in my hair about twice a year to help make it a bit more uniform</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a looser curl, its easy, just leave them in for less time!</li>
            <li>Once you snap the first one, when you roll the next roller and get ready to snap it insert the ends into the loop of the last roller and snap so the interconnect.  </li>
            <li>I am a black woman with thick hair to my shoulders and these rollers work great on my relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>to use and like it says, don&#x27;t wrap in wet head, hair won&#x27;t dry overnight for sure if you try that.</li>
            <li>They secure with a single plastic snap, and they lie in a malleable ring on the head that you can roll like rollers or wind in a spiral to create different curls.  </li>
            <li>, to make a terribly long story short (especially considering the low price point of these items), I am about to buy second and third stashes of these lovelies, lest they stop being available at a theater near me now that my love affair has begun.  </li>
            <li>But, for quick volume to flat roots and a little evening out of my curl, they are well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I tried the first time, sans instructions, to wind in a direction that would reduce the natural single half-roll down that is caused anytime you secure with looser rollers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are HIGHLY recommended for long haired people, they really work, and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Flashing back to my pillow rollers of yore, The thing I had to admit hating most was that it really was hard to sleep on the things.  </li>
            <li>The next morning, my hair was still very damp</li>
            <li>and they are totally surprised when I tell them they are my curlers.</li>
            <li>The curls looked so natural and soft and the coil held all day.  </li>
            <li>After looking at pictures of the longer hair, I knew that I needed some type of face framing device to really carry the extra length.  </li>
            <li>The rollers really work and they will give you lasting curls.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The unexpected benefit?  </li>
            <li>so if your hair is really soft or has layers they fall out sometimes.</li>
            <li>That is natural curl in the photos.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your time on these</li>
            <li>Some of the curls in the back were more limp.</li>
            <li>They are cheaper, much less trouble and produce more consistent curls.</li>
            <li>I was browsing Amazon last night, looking for a way to curl my hair without heat and without the stiff neck and shoulder soreness of most sleep-in curlers.</li>
            <li>I received a couple of compliments from a guy that I had seen several times with the straight hair, but he never said anything about how pretty I looked-- until seeing the soft loose curls from these</li>
            <li>With long hair, I was lucky to use 10 of the included 12 at a time, and their washable nature has me now using them when deep condition hair under heat, using them for an air-dry curl session, and piling my hair up into them with a misting of water or leave-in conditioner when I settle into a red-eye flight, keeping my hair under a hat or protected from the sun on a swimming day, etc.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These curled my hair more tightly by sleeping on them all night long.  </li>
            <li>I have better results when I wrap very small sections of my hair for spirals,</li>
            <li>Next time we used it, we made sure her hair was only slightly damp.  </li>
            <li>These were my first experience with rollers so for 1 it took a few days to really learn how to use them</li>
            <li>- it took me two times to get the right technique down - I only use 5 rollers for my whole head.</li>
            <li>I believe wholeheartedly that you will be converted quickly from traditional pillow rollers or rag rollers for a very small upfront investment, and achieve comfortable curls that last all day.  </li>
            <li>My third attempt I used spray on conditioner in place of mouse so curls would come out less frizzy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I would never curl my hair after getting this long, too much work and did not want to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also not thick enough.  </li>
            <li>with today&#x27;s fashions, that&#x27;s not entirely out of the realm of possibility), but cute enough to hit the grocery store, manicurist, post office, or to wear around for errands where you might actually see someone you know while you let them dry or keep your hair protected during deep conditioning treatments and the like.  </li>
            <li>These work very well when used with a drier on dry hair.</li>
            <li>The parts that did dry were VERY curly though.  </li>
            <li>But instead I got major tangles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been experimenting with the curlers with limited success to achieve looser, wavier curls and was actually hoping they might offer a larger curler to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ever since I got them I barely even use the flex-rods anymore.  </li>
            <li>They definitely do not work on hair that does not already have a natural curl to it.  </li>
            <li>For that you have to do them overnight, they won&#x27;t dry in a decent amount of time without an overhead dryer.  </li>
            <li>In our quest to develop spines, we apparently start, in some cases, with our pillow rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first time I used them, on wet hair with mouse added, I used 7 of the rollers and the next morning</li>
            <li>, I found myself trying to separate my hair differently, and concentrating my rolls to the left and right of center.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Best way to go, at least my favorite is to do them on my dry hair in the morning</li>
            <li>My hair loses curls easily when I use a curling iron but with these my curls lasts the entire day.</li>
            <li>It was kind of hard to get started wrapping because they&#x27;re so narrow.</li>
            <li>A couple loosened up but not a single curler fell out during sleep.</li>
            <li>For special events, we wash her hair, dry it and leave it a little damp, add Motions Foaming lotion.  </li>
            <li>If you are worried about putting hot curlers in a little girls hair, give these a whirl.</li>
            <li>Whosoever has the better lot in pillow-rolled life, the nubby little bumps created by mounting tiny little pillows to your skull at night does not for a resful night make.  </li>
            <li>simply take an elastic cloth headband and put it over your head (like a native american, or flapper), with slightly damp hair of course, and some product too, and you simply take the hair and wrap up over and down under the band, adding more hair to that piece as you wrap around to the back.  </li>
            <li>It takes a ton of product to keep a curl for a few hours (hence the over use the first time).</li>
            <li>You wrap your coil around the little foam bit, twist the wire lightly, and head to bed with your new alien hairdo to awake in the morning (or emerge from your bonnet dryer) with a headful of bouncy curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I am thinking that for more freedom to curls small and tight, I want another package of rollers.</li>
            <li>Too much product weighs down my hair.</li>
            <li>However, after using these little gems now for several restful nights, I am now quite aware of the fundamental design flaws that plague pillow rollers</li>
            <li>I wash, mousse, hold the hair up, hold the curler up to the middle of the strand, and wrap the hair around the curler first, tucking the end of my hair where it&#x27;ll be rolled, then roll the rest of it up, twisting extra tight, and snap.</li>
            <li>Goody makes excellent foam curlers that come in all different sizes; if you want tight spiral curls, you should buy this: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>purchased for my six year old with very long hair</li>
            <li>those things are loud and you basically sit pathetically tied to an outlet for a good hour (if you have hair past your mid-back like I do), totally unable to move about or carry on a conversation.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy to say that I was wrong!!</li>
            <li>I was dismayed to shed 20 or more helpless little hairs every time I yanked those suckers out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but as the new hair grows in the top is flat as a pancake and looks really awkward against the curls.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> They just may not be good for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> But they&#x27;re good for thicker longer hair.</li>
            <li> It literally takes 5 minutes once you get the hang of it, for the most beautiful even curls, I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> It does take a lot of trial and error to learn the best way to use them, but once you get an idea of what works for you, they can be applied quickly and work reliably.</li>

            <li> Ok, I haven&#x27;t rolled my hair in years.</li>
            <li> The curl lasts for two days, more if I didn&#x27;t bathe her.  </li>
            <li> I was glad to find these.  </li>
            <li> I had one package and needed more.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to read the directions</li>
            <li> The next morning my curls were perfect.  </li>
            <li> It is ideal for natural hair because I can curl my hair without the hassle or danger of adding heat to my hair.  </li>

            <li> I do wish the set came with more-</li>
            <li> The curls are very resilient and are even great for 2 days.</li>
            <li> love them can sleep in them ...</li>
            <li> Needed to create ringlets for my daughter&#x27;s ballet - these created more of an abstract curl vs a defined ringlet.  </li>
            <li> Just like many &amp;#</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I love the rollers, wish they were in fatter sizes.</li>
            <li> However with shorter hair this would be better,</li>
            <li> These were fantastic from the start!  </li>
            <li> OKay....</li>
            <li> Not wear-to-work-or-a-nightclub cute (but</li>
            <li> Well, my hair is already curly, I was just hoping for a more tamed curl.  </li>
            <li> http://www.amazon.com/Conair-Styling-Essentials-Rollers-Curlers/dp/B009VGIHS6/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_bt_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;1SRZF2FD006RQCMVVQZT the conair pillow rollers better...</li>
            <li> I had been using a cut-off sock bun in my hair to give me some waves, and wanted a bit more curl.</li>
            <li> love them for traveling.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d have more of the longer rollers.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, they are not bad at all.</li>
            <li> The effect is shiny, soft, beautiful princess curls.  </li>
            <li> It took a fews times for me to learn how to do it quick and effectively.</li>
            <li> Have fun curling, you will love these!</li>
            <li> The do shrink my hair up to shoulder length and the result is a very full head of curls.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t carry them in most drugstores anymore, but are available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I felt that the price is fair and the product works very well.</li>
            <li> I just snap them in while my hair is damp and do a combination of air and blow drying in the morning for quick lift and curl, very easy.</li>
            <li> I love them so much I almost want to buy more just in case they ever stop making them!</li>
            <li> Easy to sleep in.  </li>
            <li> Easy to put in.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are fairly easy to sleep in as well.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to put in, and they stay in.  </li>
            <li> Some people may find it easy, but not me.  </li>
            <li> Product shipped very quick.  </li>
            <li> The snap mechanism was surprisingly easy to use.</li>
            <li> would strongly advise anyone who desires curly hair to use old-fashioned foam rollers instead.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten decent looking curls once since I bought them a good while ago.</li>
            <li> When you have fine hair like mine, a full head of all-day curls is quite feat!</li>
            <li> The curls are beautiful and last all day with out any hair spray.</li>
            <li> ding them a star because there is no way the average (or excellent) woman is going to get the hair styles shown on the package.  </li>
            <li> and she sleeps just fine with them in.  </li>
            <li> So in short, I would not expect perfect results your first time.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to use and extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li> hair is fine.  </li>
            <li> So the fact that it takes me 15 minutes to put these in is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> They were comfortable for her to wear at night.</li>
            <li> I just figured this review would be more useful if you knew what type and length of hair I am using with this product.</li>
            <li> They were super easy to get in my hair, easy to close, held in hair well, and were comfortable to sleep in.  </li>
            <li> akin to those cute flip flops you wear right after getting a pedicure.  </li>
            <li> are super comfortable - and I like the cool animal print!</li>
            <li> It was super easy to put the rollers in.  </li>
            <li> did this on dry hair and let it sit for an hour while I got ready for work, the curls were awesome!  </li>
            <li> I love these rollers (they are a couple of dollars cheaper at Walgreens if you are willing to make the trip).  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> These rollers offer a much better curl than the Conair Hot Roller Set that I just purchased.  </li>
            <li> So I picked these up originally at a beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li> These are a great way to get heatless curls for long hair.  </li>
            <li> Mah - nothing to get excited over</li>
            <li> The good thing is they&#x27;re so soft it&#x27;s for the most part really comfy to sleep in.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to sleep on them, and it takes a great deal of time to blow dry your hair.    </li>
            <li> Then roll them in (using clean partings with a tail comb)</li>
            <li> -wild aside, they have been one of my favorite beauty sacrifices to make when I have been able to bring myself to do so.  </li>
            <li> when i took them out i was so happy to see my hair had more volume than usual and was super easy to style.  </li>
            <li> The plastic pins are much easier to wrap the hair around and the foam absorbs the hair better, unlike the slippery fabric.</li>
            <li> The Wrap Snap N Go Rollers definitely look well constructed with nice fabric, in a nice plastic zip case with very descriptive instruction booklet.  </li>
            <li> but once you get the hang of it they&#x27;re cool.</li>
            <li> If they made a larger size, those would be good for people with longer hair.  </li>
            <li> Waiste of money , puts wave in your hair it might give you good curls if you have super short hair or if you leave them in for days..........</li>
            <li> Normally my hair goes flat hours after curling with a hot iron or rollers, so this was excellent!</li>
            <li> They fall out right away even though I filled the directions.</li>
            <li> : No heat, fairly comfortable, cute leopard print (so my husband doesn&#x27;t totally run for the hills, yes, I can be cute with these... sort of), Snap clasp makes these worth purchase, you don&#x27;t have to use any clips or pins.  </li>
            <li> is only because the material used to cover them could be smoother or more satiny and would be better to protect the hair shaft (I sleep on a satin pillowcase and</li>
            <li> I guess they&#x27;re quick?</li>
            <li> work best left in overnight, and are the only rollers I can sleep in overnight.  </li>
            <li> These are good for long hair.  </li>
            <li> The good thing about this product, you are not adding extra damage to the hair by using hot rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t believe how easy these were to sleep on.</li>
            <li> In addition, the way they are installed differs more than you might think when you look at them, and that makes a very unexpected difference.  </li>
            <li> It keeps falling out if I don&#x27;t knot it before I snap it, but if done properly the curls are amazing.</li>
            <li> All in all, for $10, or $14 on amazon, they are well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love these soft bouncy curls.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that the curlers are soft and don&#x27;t burn your head.</li>
            <li> Most of the wayward curl problems I have experienced have been easily attributable to user error--in a fit of aggression, I either wind them too tight trying to pin the cranky little ends under to keep them in all night, or I don&#x27;t pay attention to which way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to buy some more, though, because there&#x27;s no other product like it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice to give your hair a rest from heat processing of curling irons, flat irons etc.</li>
            <li> I was excited that one package curled my whole head</li>
            <li> The result is that they stay where you put them, which in my case was right around the crown of my head.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy, my 6 year old can do it.</li>
            <li> have used pillow rollers (of good quality, given the previously explored corners of the market) for some years, and all too-tight ringlets and spirals-gone</li>
            <li> and you can do it on a squirmy four year old amazingly quick!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!  </li>
            <li> (Use hot rollers for that.)</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> Since the my hair will hold a perm forever, the curls stay intact pretty well</li>
            <li> I only used 4 curlers for my 1b,F/M,ii,MBL hair, and the cascade of curls is lovely.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t feel them at all when I was sleeping, they are so soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t want hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> There are no wires or tiny coils of rock-hard squished pillow and hair to jab you in the noggin all night, and they are piled neatly on the part of your head that, unless you are a skilled yogi, you are not using for sleeping anyway.  </li>
            <li> The curlers are fairly comfortable for sleeping and don&#x27;t look completely hideous.</li>
            <li> she listed a site she found on a technique of wrapping your hair in a head band, which gave me exactly what I was looking for:</li>
            <li> I am going to try these one more time, curling my hair around 2 or 3 of them to get a larger curl and see what happens.</li>
            <li> They are REALLY easy to put in, I mean super easy!</li>
            <li> I use a lot of different kinds of curlers, these are fun, and really easy.  </li>
            <li> but I would imagine if your hair texture is right, they would work very well that way.</li>
            <li> I seem to still be twisting them a bit too tight to make sure they are secure, but hey, I still learning.</li>
            <li> Add some root lifter or mousse and use on barely damp hair to maximize hold/volume and minimize dry time and you will be pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to remember to leave the slightest bit of slack in the bottom few so that you don&#x27;t yank your precious locks as you hoist them up to the ones you will lock them into, to avoid yanking a couple hairs that didn&#x27;t have enough give, but that is an easy step and is also easy to correct: just unroll and retry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes me less than 20 minutes to put them in and they look really cute!</li>
            <li> Gives beautiful Victoria secret model curls overnight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a hot, sexy, loose type curled look.  </li>
            <li> For sleeping, I would suggest sleeping with pillow rollers, those are pretty comfy for sleeping and make great overnight curls on wet and dry</li>
            <li> then I tried leaving my precious sleep out of it and invested in a bonnet dryer, so that I could just blast the damp hair dry and get on with my day.  </li>
            <li> Many times I&#x27;ve shampooed in the morning, and worked just a bit of product through my hair and let it air dry, then roll it in the evening.  </li>
            <li> After buying pretty much every type on the market, including the cheap version of these,  I&#x27;ve finally settled with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> They gave me a nice tight curl.  </li>
            <li> The curls are big and beautiful, not the skinny old woman look of the old fashioned foam curlers, and if you roll them from the middle, you get ringlets!</li>
            <li> i curled my hair in big chunks on these and slept on them just fine.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair about mid-back length, and after I used these, the length of my hair stopped above my shoulders!  </li>
            <li> and these curlers work very well for all lengths .Curl</li>
            <li> I have hair to my shoulders, stick straight, and the curls, after sleeping in them,</li>
            <li> how much come in it?</li>
            <li> The curl is very bouncy.  </li>
            <li> so much so that I walked into a restaurant</li>
            <li> and it is ridiculously straight.</li>
            <li> my hair was VERY curly...</li>
            <li> They work better with wet hair, along with pieces of perm paper.</li>
            <li> These snap and wrap rollers make my life so much easier, and now I can rest assured my hair will look fabuluous in the morning</li>
            <li> no matter how much I toss and turn.</li>
            <li> The result isn&#x27;t fabulous, but it does work by creating some waves which are a definite improvement for me.</li>
            <li> These seem really durable and sturdy, and can be washed in the machine.  </li>
            <li> You really need to dampin the hair AND use some form of product if you have thicker hair</li>
            <li> There are no bendy spines, no bendy foam cores, and they have big hair-safe snaps at the ends, used to secure them.  </li>
            <li> (Note, I think I might try these for padding the next time I am trying to get comfortable and stable in a headstand in yoga class.)  </li>
            <li> It looks very \\&quot;spa-day chic,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The curl really varies depending on tightness of the curl and amount of hair used.  </li>
            <li> It is VERY helpful.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have much grip</li>
            <li> Too much heat fries my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not a morning person who wants to spend an hour washing, drying and styling my hair in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway</li>
            <li> Even so, it&#x27;s important to snap the ends together on the outside - not against your scalp.  </li>
            <li> I use hair spray if it&#x27;s a windy or very humid day.  </li>
            <li> The curls are really nice, but they fall if you don&#x27;t use a product and have heavy</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the most comfortable curlers to sleep on, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re like sleeping without any curlers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pillow rollers, unlike many women in their other relationships, have backbones.  </li>
            <li> The snaps technically do work, because I tried them by just holding them down in my hands, under a light, not up in my hair, so I could see them better, and managed to snap them.  </li>
            <li> thanks i hop a decent amount is in it</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, and lots (fine texture).</li>
            <li> I recently purchased theses, to wear while sleeping (VERY COMFORTABLE), so I could sleep in an extra 30 min.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try these after seeing them at the drugstore to add some curl and volume up top and was expecting them to be a let down.</li>
            <li> I slept overnight with my satin sleep cap over the top to keep the frizzies down, and finger combed my hair after I took the curlers out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably be able to do it on someone else&#x27;s head if they were sitting down in front of me</li>
            <li> No matter how you lie down, the things are, for the most part, out of your way and non-disruptive to your sleep.  </li>
            <li> To their credit, they do produce a curl quickly on dry hair, but if you have layered hair, these are a huge chore to get rolled and keep in.  </li>
            <li> Mainly because rollers hurt to sleep in and they leave dents in my hair, which gives away the fact that my hair had been rolled.</li>
            <li> In a nutshell, they fix the primary flaws above, and add a couple unexpected benefits as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would love it if they could come out with different sizes of these curlers for different types of curls.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like little frizzy ringlets, so I put more hair on each stick, and get big full curls, like you would from a set of jumbo rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> these give a decent curl, not as easy to use as i would like, you do have to connect or thread one through the other to make them stay in.  </li>
            <li> I focus on the areas around my face and the top layer of my hair all the way around my part for a little boost.</li>
            <li> : You will get better at putting them in with a little time.  </li>
            <li> I bought them at Sally about a year ago and they work great for tight spiral curls that last all day long.</li>
            <li> bottom line is that for me, these curlers are great if you want tight spiral curls that last all day long.</li>
            <li> Nothing you would wear for the raw sake of being fashionable, but something you&#x27;re okay showing others as it suggests that you&#x27;re amidst a day of power-pampering yourself.  </li>
            <li> but there are some very key highlights that I think will prove important to those of you who have an existing love-hate relationship with a beauty product you spend a theoretical 1/3 of your life</li>
            <li> My hair is very straight and silky, and they would not stay in it for an hour let alone the entire night.</li>
            <li> Further, they are long and made entirely of foam, so you are not bound to wrapping the length of your hair around a miniscule square of foam and are free to wrap more loosely or in a manner to create spiral curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> am well aware that, heretofore, the gold standard for pillow rollers has been a happy malleable little center bit, upon which a forgiving block of foam is skewered, with the entire contraption being encased in a piece of grabby, softish material, either fuzzy fleecy stuff or something that looks to be part of a space blanket.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used them, I didn&#x27;t follow directions and interlock each stick, so I used some pin curl clips to hold them in place, which isn&#x27;t really necessary if you follow directions.  </li>
            <li> The curl from these is a bit tighter than the hot roller set that I have, but the hair looks loose, soft, and natural- compared to what happened with the hot roller</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair that is just above the bra strap.</li>
            <li> This led to more hair-pulling, oddly distributed curls, and wouldn&#x27;t really help those who get their beauty rest with one cheek or the the other planted in their real pillow...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Interleaving the rollers like a chain results in the creation of a Greek goddess-style halo of pillow rings, which is actually quite cool.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair with a very uneven curl pattern and lot of frizz, so I throw a perm in my hair about twice a year to help make it a bit more uniform</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a looser curl, its easy, just leave them in for less time!</li>
            <li> Once you snap the first one, when you roll the next roller and get ready to snap it insert the ends into the loop of the last roller and snap so the interconnect.  </li>
            <li> I am a black woman with thick hair to my shoulders and these rollers work great on my relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> to use and like it says, don&#x27;t wrap in wet head, hair won&#x27;t dry overnight for sure if you try that.</li>
            <li> They secure with a single plastic snap, and they lie in a malleable ring on the head that you can roll like rollers or wind in a spiral to create different curls.  </li>
            <li> , to make a terribly long story short (especially considering the low price point of these items), I am about to buy second and third stashes of these lovelies, lest they stop being available at a theater near me now that my love affair has begun.  </li>
            <li> But, for quick volume to flat roots and a little evening out of my curl, they are well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I tried the first time, sans instructions, to wind in a direction that would reduce the natural single half-roll down that is caused anytime you secure with looser rollers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are HIGHLY recommended for long haired people, they really work, and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Flashing back to my pillow rollers of yore, The thing I had to admit hating most was that it really was hard to sleep on the things.  </li>
            <li> The next morning, my hair was still very damp</li>
            <li> and they are totally surprised when I tell them they are my curlers.</li>
            <li> The curls looked so natural and soft and the coil held all day.  </li>
            <li> After looking at pictures of the longer hair, I knew that I needed some type of face framing device to really carry the extra length.  </li>
            <li> The rollers really work and they will give you lasting curls.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The unexpected benefit?  </li>
            <li> so if your hair is really soft or has layers they fall out sometimes.</li>
            <li> That is natural curl in the photos.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your time on these</li>
            <li> Some of the curls in the back were more limp.</li>
            <li> They are cheaper, much less trouble and produce more consistent curls.</li>
            <li> I was browsing Amazon last night, looking for a way to curl my hair without heat and without the stiff neck and shoulder soreness of most sleep-in curlers.</li>
            <li> I received a couple of compliments from a guy that I had seen several times with the straight hair, but he never said anything about how pretty I looked-- until seeing the soft loose curls from these</li>
            <li> With long hair, I was lucky to use 10 of the included 12 at a time, and their washable nature has me now using them when deep condition hair under heat, using them for an air-dry curl session, and piling my hair up into them with a misting of water or leave-in conditioner when I settle into a red-eye flight, keeping my hair under a hat or protected from the sun on a swimming day, etc.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These curled my hair more tightly by sleeping on them all night long.  </li>
            <li> I have better results when I wrap very small sections of my hair for spirals,</li>
            <li> Next time we used it, we made sure her hair was only slightly damp.  </li>
            <li> These were my first experience with rollers so for 1 it took a few days to really learn how to use them</li>
            <li> - it took me two times to get the right technique down - I only use 5 rollers for my whole head.</li>
            <li> I believe wholeheartedly that you will be converted quickly from traditional pillow rollers or rag rollers for a very small upfront investment, and achieve comfortable curls that last all day.  </li>
            <li> My third attempt I used spray on conditioner in place of mouse so curls would come out less frizzy and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I would never curl my hair after getting this long, too much work and did not want to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also not thick enough.  </li>
            <li> with today&#x27;s fashions, that&#x27;s not entirely out of the realm of possibility), but cute enough to hit the grocery store, manicurist, post office, or to wear around for errands where you might actually see someone you know while you let them dry or keep your hair protected during deep conditioning treatments and the like.  </li>
            <li> These work very well when used with a drier on dry hair.</li>
            <li> The parts that did dry were VERY curly though.  </li>
            <li> But instead I got major tangles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with the curlers with limited success to achieve looser, wavier curls and was actually hoping they might offer a larger curler to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ever since I got them I barely even use the flex-rods anymore.  </li>
            <li> They definitely do not work on hair that does not already have a natural curl to it.  </li>
            <li> For that you have to do them overnight, they won&#x27;t dry in a decent amount of time without an overhead dryer.  </li>
            <li> In our quest to develop spines, we apparently start, in some cases, with our pillow rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first time I used them, on wet hair with mouse added, I used 7 of the rollers and the next morning</li>
            <li> , I found myself trying to separate my hair differently, and concentrating my rolls to the left and right of center.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Best way to go, at least my favorite is to do them on my dry hair in the morning</li>
            <li> My hair loses curls easily when I use a curling iron but with these my curls lasts the entire day.</li>
            <li> It was kind of hard to get started wrapping because they&#x27;re so narrow.</li>
            <li> A couple loosened up but not a single curler fell out during sleep.</li>
            <li> For special events, we wash her hair, dry it and leave it a little damp, add Motions Foaming lotion.  </li>
            <li> If you are worried about putting hot curlers in a little girls hair, give these a whirl.</li>
            <li> Whosoever has the better lot in pillow-rolled life, the nubby little bumps created by mounting tiny little pillows to your skull at night does not for a resful night make.  </li>
            <li> simply take an elastic cloth headband and put it over your head (like a native american, or flapper), with slightly damp hair of course, and some product too, and you simply take the hair and wrap up over and down under the band, adding more hair to that piece as you wrap around to the back.  </li>
            <li> It takes a ton of product to keep a curl for a few hours (hence the over use the first time).</li>
            <li> You wrap your coil around the little foam bit, twist the wire lightly, and head to bed with your new alien hairdo to awake in the morning (or emerge from your bonnet dryer) with a headful of bouncy curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I am thinking that for more freedom to curls small and tight, I want another package of rollers.</li>
            <li> Too much product weighs down my hair.</li>
            <li> However, after using these little gems now for several restful nights, I am now quite aware of the fundamental design flaws that plague pillow rollers</li>
            <li> I wash, mousse, hold the hair up, hold the curler up to the middle of the strand, and wrap the hair around the curler first, tucking the end of my hair where it&#x27;ll be rolled, then roll the rest of it up, twisting extra tight, and snap.</li>
            <li> Goody makes excellent foam curlers that come in all different sizes; if you want tight spiral curls, you should buy this: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> purchased for my six year old with very long hair</li>
            <li> those things are loud and you basically sit pathetically tied to an outlet for a good hour (if you have hair past your mid-back like I do), totally unable to move about or carry on a conversation.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy to say that I was wrong!!</li>
            <li> I was dismayed to shed 20 or more helpless little hairs every time I yanked those suckers out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but as the new hair grows in the top is flat as a pancake and looks really awkward against the curls.</li>
            <li> That bonnet dryer also did not help much with the other problem, which was the sticky material that really grabbed the hair--and wouldn&#x27;t let go when I wanted to take them out!--at least on the white, non-space-blanket-material pillow rollers that dominate the market.  </li>
            <li> The foam inside fabric tends to break down after first use and never goes back to original shape, rendering them useless for the second use😢</li>
            <li> However, lately, I&#x27;ve been more concerned about noticing the long term effects of the chemicals on my hair and noted it&#x27;s starting to look a little fried, so I decided to try to scale back to a once a year perm.</li>
            <li> The ends are super curly while the rest is a semi tight to tight curl.</li>
            <li> My problem is that once I&#x27;ve got one rolled on top of my head, I&#x27;ve found it difficult to impossible to snap; I struggle with it while my arms get more and more tired.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how else to put it, but the &amp;#34;male&amp;#34; end of the snap isn&#x27;t long enough, and/or the &amp;#34;female&amp;#34; end isn&#x27;t deep enough.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I was really hoping I&#x27;d like these; I was going to get the bendy type rollers, but Wrap Snap N Go had better reviews.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another surprise benefit: the atrocious leopard print that made me less likely to buy, coupled with the crownlike placement that naturally arises from the roller chaining actually looks, dare I say, cute!  </li>
            <li> The first curl was a bit clumsy</li>
            <li> Have had medium to long hair  at different times/</li>
            <li> My LONG hair turns into curls that hang above my shoulders!!</li>
            <li> The 2nd time I only used 4 rollers, wet with mouse added prior, and my hair was medium curly.  </li>
            <li> There are 8 regular sized rollers and four long rollers.  </li>
            <li> For extra long hair, attach two of these together.</li>
            <li> I would definitely go that route if my hair wasn&#x27;t so long.  </li>
            <li> Also, this is way too long a review for something as simple and inconsequential as pillow rollers.</li>
            <li> for the full picture step by stepand video, web search \\&quot;easiest way in the world to curl your hair, by broken poet\\&quot; and your life will be changed.  </li>
            <li> My 4 year old has hair down to her waist that is stick-straight.  </li>
            <li> in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the rollers in my hair dry overnight, same effect.  </li>
            <li> My daughter (white Caucasian) has extremely thick, straight as a board hair.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super hard to snap so that they stay tight and actually keep the hair in place.</li>
            <li> Two sets is not cheap as rollers go, but these are not ordinary rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finding a comfortable, pressure-free way to lay my head down generally resulted in stretching or snapping at least a few overwound hairs from their moorings, and anchoring my head into one unrelenting position as I tried to sleep for about an hour at a time.  </li>
            <li> Next morning (about 10 hours later) they were extremely curly.  </li>
            <li> These are unbelievable and come highly highly recommended.</li>
            <li> We take them out, finger fluff, and the curls last for two days.  </li>
            <li> They are designed for long hair.</li>
            <li> When it gets about elbow length, it&#x27;s too long.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly, I&#x27;ve been meaning to pick these up at the store for many years, and have simply ignored them, thinking I am too tired to try pillow rollers again and that my stock of 250 doesn&#x27;t warrant picking up another batch just yet, so I know I am late to the party.  </li>
            <li> long, wavy curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have long hair, you&#x27;ll probably need two sets.  </li>
            <li> I have long straight thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have hair down to my bra-line, and it is layered (layers are more difficult, yes, but I found it manageable with damp hair.  </li>
            <li> They are kinda hard to get snapped into place and getting the hair on is a little tough, but my hair looked cute!</li>
            <li> I will save the other pack for later.</li>
            <li> I have very straight, long, thin hair.</li>
            <li> Further, they tend to be the subject of \\&quot;Me Tarzan, you Jane\\&quot; remarks from even the male housemates of our species, rather than the subject of ridicule, or some brand of shame representing the levels of ugliness we are willing to endure in the name of being momentarily</li>
            <li> Even if you were to put them all over your head, disregarding the simple prescribed instructions, they are so soft and without hard bits that you will sleep</li>
            <li> I have very long hair.</li>
            <li> Not for curling dry hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried them dry and wet--wearing them to bed</li>
            <li> Dry, the curl doesn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> , let you hair dry halfway or blowdry til still damp, and add volumizing mousse or setting lotion through.</li>
            <li> took about 6 hours in almost dry hair, but the curl held.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no air passing around so nothing to dry the hair.</li>
            <li> I let them air dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman with natural hair and was getting so tired of co-washing my hair every single day after my workout.  </li>
            <li> One thing is if you put these in completely wet and your hair is long, it&#x27;s probably not going to work too well...</li>
            <li> They do loose curls but also stay in place</li>
            <li> followed the directions and wrapped fairly loosely, and used one package of wraps.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are nearly impossible on dry hair with no product, and layered hair is more of a challenge, but keep working at it</li>
            <li> My daughter has hair halfway down her back.  </li>
            <li> After about 3 years of use, the foam is starting to break down.  </li>
            <li> I simply roll them in before bed with slightly damp hair</li>
            <li> wet doesn&#x27;t dry your hair all the way through.</li>
            <li> People with thin or normal hair should only need one set.</li>
            <li> And even then, they don&#x27;t create the promised lift at the roots of the hair because the fabric is so soft that the hair is always slipping around - making it impossible to roll them tightly and securely</li>
            <li> Sadly, I used a curling iron to get the tight curls out, so didn&#x27;t get to enjoy the rollers.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is so thick that if she wanted all over tight curls throughout her whole head, we would need to buy another set.  </li>
            <li> I have only one complaint, they don&#x27;t last forever.</li>
            <li> I just wet my already wilted curls with water, rolled the hair with Wrap, Snap &amp; Go and went to bed.  </li>
            <li> To begin your curling you should comb your hair up in the center of front of your head and start rolling from there.  </li>
            <li> tried the curlers on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair has gotten straighter in the last few years and I&#x27;ve tried to find something that works for me.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ll explain it in a sec.)  </li>
            <li> When rolling them with wet hair, you might as well be wrapping your hair with a ribbon.</li>
            <li> I rolled my hair up wet, spraying each section with styling spray.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a learning curve how wet your hair can be when you&#x27;re putting them in.</li>
            <li> It goes down past the middle of my back and could never hold a curl until I got these.</li>
            <li> I suggest Velcro rollers if your hair is less than 6 inches long.    </li>
            <li> It takes about 5 minutes to curl my flat hair, thick hair would be maybe ten.</li>
            <li> I have long middle of back length hair that is thin.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I dampen my hair slightly; sometimes I leave it dry.  </li>
            <li> my attempts at making large waves with big sections of hair came out a little weird looking</li>
            <li> There is a little booklet in the case that is 16 pages long that describes how to make spiral curls or other curls.  </li>
            <li> I walked into a local *small* drug store and saw these rollers on the shelf.  </li>
            <li> However, this was due to user error.</li>
            <li> Lifelong customer!</li>
            <li> I found that Nyquil helped this, but that is not exactly a long-term solution to self-inflicted beauty problem.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can use it on wet or dry hair, but with wet sometimes it will be WAY too curly and hard to brushout.</li>
            <li> I used WAY too much product and twisted them WAY too tight.</li>
            <li> Since her hair is so thick, it wasn&#x27;t all the way dry after the rollers were in her wet head for 11 hours!  </li>
            <li> a bit too curly for with a slight frizz.  </li>
            <li> I used some leave-in conditioner on my slightly damp hair to help set the curls.  </li>
            <li> I woke up and dressed, got myself together (and the kids, and the hubby!), and unwrapped my hair- fiddled with my fingers (re-twirled) and less than 2 minutes</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I found one youtube video showing how to get tight corkscrew curls -- double wrap the rollers at the base, as far as possible, before snapping together.</li>
            <li> this obviates that benefit to some degree,) and because the tight snaps might be a little cumbersome for the less dexterous among us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my curls are so tight its unreal.</li>
            <li> I was not looking for tight spiral curls, or &#x27;80s style \\&quot;body\\&quot; in my hair.</li>
            <li> Its a little awkward to sleep in them at first (as with all rollers), but it doesnt hurt my head.  </li>
            <li> I used them once when I got them and ended up with super tight ugly curls that were frizzy at the end.</li>
            <li> They are also very soft and I could see how they wouldn&#x27;t be uncomfortable to sleep in, all though I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.</li>
            <li> Wish they were a little thicker, but you can&#x27;t have everything.  </li>
            <li> I recommend spritzing a little spray gel on to the section of hair before you roll to make it easier and also allow the curl to hold once you take out the curler.</li>
            <li> Like any hair styling product, it can take a little time, practice, and experimenting to get the results you want.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since cut my hair to a little below my ears and look forward to seeing how my hair turns out.</li>
            <li> After I used them the second time, I am addicted.</li>
            <li> The end result is flappy, messy curls that hang limply around the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve done them a few times, it takes me five minutes tops to put them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a few years,</li>
            <li> I did manage to snap one and it did result in a well-set curl, but it&#x27;s too much trouble for me.  </li>
            <li> This made some pretty funky old fashioned curls that were awfully</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of practice to learn how to roll correctly, but once you master that the results are unbelievable.</li>
            <li> One of the snaps was right on the pressure point of the back of my head, and was a little uncomfortable through the night (my bad).  </li>
            <li> (It is even worse when the hair is slightly damp or wet).</li>
            <li> I buy these for my daughter who is in Show Choir and has very long very thick hair</li>
            <li> I got a very tight curl.</li>
            <li> but once I got the hand of the tight twist, using my fingers almost to twirl the curlers around rather than rolling slowly with my hand</li>
            <li> I was Not able to wrap my hair...</li>
            <li> SO Finished Small 5/8&amp;#34; Foam Rollers 14 Pcs (82554)]].</li>
            <li> It is shoulder length - lays just past the shoulder.  </li>
            <li> It works on all hair types, from cheek length to past the shoulders.  </li>
            <li> In the morning, after finger styling, I usually just leave it.  </li>
            <li> I have always used flex-rods and that means being stuck under a dryer or unable to go to sleep untill my hair was completely dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably like this product, but it&#x27;s hard to tell.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to roll the crown of your head</li>
            <li> Have used this product for at least 5 years.</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions in the included manual (at least for me)</li>
            <li> I thought the name was a little silly, but I&#x27;ll get to that in a moment, as they happen to be correct for a reason I hadn&#x27;t anticipated when I gave them a shot.  </li>
            <li> part of the reason i went to natural hair is because i hate sleeping on rollers.  </li>
            <li> VERY hard to explain without pictures...</li>
            <li> Again, very thick, brown hair.  </li>
            <li> I have hair almost to my elbows, so to my dismay, I had to stop using the \\&quot;easiest way in the world to curl your hair method\\&quot;, because my hair is about two inches two long now :(</li>
            <li> They feel too thin.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I have no hair roller experience at all, but seriously they are so difficult to use!</li>
            <li> They are a little annoying to sleep in.</li>
            <li> I have hair about an inch shy of my butt</li>
            <li> Product did NOT work like expected , it gives terrible result &amp; the rollers did not hold their shape after use</li>
            <li> hair rollers are a nifty concept but impossible to use on a practical basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have bad results with trying to sleep in them</li>
            <li> The bad thing is they get caught in your hair a lot because of the snaps and sometimes it will pull throughout the night even if you try to fix it.</li>
            <li> After being disappointed with Wrap Snap N Go, I tried the old-fashioned pin curl concept by twirling strands of hair up towards my head and fastening them to my head with hair clips.  </li>
            <li> and you have to curl the base then the ends and pin in standing barrels.</li>
            <li> Too bad they aren&#x27;t memory foam!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> The foam inside fabric tends to break down after first use and never goes back to original shape, rendering them useless for the second use😢</li>
            <li> Have used this product for at least 5 years. have always had a problem sleeping in curlers, but not wrap snap and go.  Have had medium to long hair  at different times/ and these curlers work very well for all lengths .Curl my hair overnight and curl will last till next shampoo. If curlers get to squished just throw them in washer and dryer to revitalize them. Use them every week.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old has hair down to her waist that is stick-straight.  For special events, we wash her hair, dry it and leave it a little damp, add Motions Foaming lotion.  I can roll her hair in about 10 - 15 minutes and she sleeps just fine with them in.  We take them out, finger fluff, and the curls last for two days.  Highly recommended!!  Yes, they are nearly impossible on dry hair with no product, and layered hair is more of a challenge, but keep working at it and you can do it on a squirmy four year old amazingly quick!</li>
            <li> i picked these up a couple years ago and they&#x27;ve been sitting on my shelf every since.  I&#x27;m an African American woman with natural hair and was getting so tired of co-washing my hair every single day after my workout.  i needed to find something i could do to my hair to save my time in the mornings.  i remembered i had these on my shelf and tried them last night.  i curled my hair in big chunks on these and slept on them just fine.  part of the reason i went to natural hair is because i hate sleeping on rollers.  i left them in for my workout and shower.  when i took them out i was so happy to see my hair had more volume than usual and was super easy to style.  i came here and put another package in my cart because i never want to run out!  thank you!  finally an answer to my problem!</li>
            <li> purchased for my six year old with very long hair these are to big for her and the curls fall out within an hour</li>
            <li> Ok, I haven&#x27;t rolled my hair in years. Mainly because rollers hurt to sleep in and they leave dents in my hair, which gives away the fact that my hair had been rolled. I am a black woman with thick hair to my shoulders and these rollers work great on my relaxed hair. They are very comfortable to sleep in and they don&#x27;t leave dents or marks. The curls are beautiful and last all day with out any hair spray. I bought two pack thinking one pack wouldn&#x27;t be enough, but I have only had to open the one pack. I will save the other pack for later. I love them so much I almost want to buy more just in case they ever stop making them! I would recommend these rollers to anyone wanting curls with ease and comfort.</li>
            <li> Hi I have medium Silky hair ... i brought this Product to curl my hair....&lt;br /&gt;I tried constantly 3 days .... I was Not able to wrap my hair... It not at all working for me ..</li>
            <li> This is a really good concept and very comfortable to sleep in.  However, I used it on damp hair and slept with them on.  The next morning, my hair was still very damp and so were the rollers.  These work very well when used with a drier on dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have used these rollers for years!  The curls are big and beautiful, not the skinny old woman look of the old fashioned foam curlers, and if you roll them from the middle, you get ringlets! I wash, mousse, hold the hair up, hold the curler up to the middle of the strand, and wrap the hair around the curler first, tucking the end of my hair where it&#x27;ll be rolled, then roll the rest of it up, twisting extra tight, and snap. It&#x27;s so easy, my 6 year old can do it. It takes about 5 minutes to curl my flat hair, thick hair would be maybe ten. I have hair to my shoulders, stick straight, and the curls, after sleeping in them, (I suggest a hair net) last all day, even on rainy days running errands, with no hairspray!  These curlers are meant for sleeping in. My daughter has hair halfway down her back.  The curl lasts for two days, more if I didn&#x27;t bathe her.  Not for curling dry hair. (Use hot rollers for that.) They are designed for long hair. I suggest Velcro rollers if your hair is less than 6 inches long.    I have only one complaint, they don&#x27;t last forever. After about 3 years of use, the foam is starting to break down.  Too bad they aren&#x27;t memory foam! I&#x27;m about to buy some more, though, because there&#x27;s no other product like it!</li>
            <li> Have not found anything out there that meets my needs.  These are good for long hair.  Easy to sleep in.  Easy to put in.  They stay in.  I also use a C-Pap respirator and can juggle them around the straps.  Wish they were a little thicker, but you can&#x27;t have everything.  I would buy them again.  Think I will buy another one, just for a spare.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find these.  I had one package and needed more.  They do loose curls but also stay in place when one snapped loop is snapped inside of the next one, like a chain.</li>
            <li> I love these rollers (they are a couple of dollars cheaper at Walgreens if you are willing to make the trip).  I wear them every night and they do not hurt a bit to sleep in.  They give my hair great volume which lasts all day.  I bought some for my mom and she loves them too! - she is buying some for my niece!  Be sure to read the directions - it took me two times to get the right technique down - I only use 5 rollers for my whole head.</li>
            <li> I found these at Walgreens drug store today for $10 and got them thinking they probably wouldn&#x27;t work. I am so happy to say that I was wrong!! It takes a little bit of practice to learn how to roll correctly, but once you master that the results are unbelievable. I recommend spritzing a little spray gel on to the section of hair before you roll to make it easier and also allow the curl to hold once you take out the curler. They are also very soft and I could see how they wouldn&#x27;t be uncomfortable to sleep in, all though I haven&#x27;t tried that yet. All in all, for $10, or $14 on amazon, they are well worth the money. It&#x27;s also nice to give your hair a rest from heat processing of curling irons, flat irons etc.</li>
            <li> I have very straight, long, thin hair. It goes down past the middle of my back and could never hold a curl until I got these. They are REALLY easy to put in, I mean super easy! It takes me less than 20 minutes to put them in and they look really cute! I don&#x27;t cover them up when I go out of the house and I can&#x27;t count the amount of compliments I get on my hair (with the curlers in!!). People think it is a hair-do and they are totally surprised when I tell them they are my curlers. If I wear them overnight and into the day (about 20 hours) my curls are so tight its unreal. My LONG hair turns into curls that hang above my shoulders!! If you are looking for a looser curl, its easy, just leave them in for less time! These are unbelievable and come highly highly recommended. After posting my pictures on facebook, all my cousins in London want me to get them for them. I buy them at Walgreens because they are only $10 there. Have fun curling, you will love these!</li>
            <li> I was out of town for a gala.  I jumped in the shower and when I got out my curls had began to fall.  I walked into a local *small* drug store and saw these rollers on the shelf.  With no hair dryer or styling products with me I just wet my already wilted curls with water, rolled the hair with Wrap, Snap &amp; Go and went to bed.  The next morning my curls were perfect.  The curls looked so natural and soft and the coil held all day.  I have always used flex-rods and that means being stuck under a dryer or unable to go to sleep untill my hair was completely dry.  This product is amazing I can sleep without even noticing I have rollers in my hair at all.  Worth every penny! Ever since I got them I barely even use the flex-rods anymore.  It is ideal for natural hair because I can curl my hair without the hassle or danger of adding heat to my hair.  I can workout at the gym-workout come home roll my hair and off to bed, wake up in the morning to perfect curls all over again. It is exactly what I needed.  I love love love this product.</li>
            <li> how much come in it? can some please tell me before i buy it? thanks i hop a decent amount is in it</li>
            <li> To their credit, they do produce a curl quickly on dry hair, but if you have layered hair, these are a huge chore to get rolled and keep in.  Tip:  for smaller sections of hair, try knotting rather than snapping to keep it held.</li>
            <li> I have just grown my hair out from a shoulder length bob to a longer style.  After looking at pictures of the longer hair, I knew that I needed some type of face framing device to really carry the extra length.  These rollers offer a much better curl than the Conair Hot Roller Set that I just purchased.  The good thing about this product, you are not adding extra damage to the hair by using hot rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are fairly easy to sleep in as well.  The curl from these is a bit tighter than the hot roller set that I have, but the hair looks loose, soft, and natural- compared to what happened with the hot roller set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These curled my hair more tightly by sleeping on them all night long.  The curl is very bouncy.  But I used them last night and sat with them in my hair while I answered e-mails for about 45 min. to an hour.  The curl was great then also... so much so that I walked into a restaurant and it turned a number of men&#x27;s heads.  I received a couple of compliments from a guy that I had seen several times with the straight hair, but he never said anything about how pretty I looked-- until seeing the soft loose curls from these rollers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a hot, sexy, loose type curled look.  I love the effects of this--&lt;br /&gt;They are super comfortable - and I like the cool animal print!</li>
            <li> Had these when I was younger. So happy I found them again.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair with a very uneven curl pattern and lot of frizz, so I throw a perm in my hair about twice a year to help make it a bit more uniform and that&#x27;s always worked wonders. However, lately, I&#x27;ve been more concerned about noticing the long term effects of the chemicals on my hair and noted it&#x27;s starting to look a little fried, so I decided to try to scale back to a once a year perm. Since the my hair will hold a perm forever, the curls stay intact pretty well but as the new hair grows in the top is flat as a pancake and looks really awkward against the curls. I decided to try these after seeing them at the drugstore to add some curl and volume up top and was expecting them to be a let down. Honestly, they are not bad at all. It does take a lot of trial and error to learn the best way to use them, but once you get an idea of what works for you, they can be applied quickly and work reliably. I have bad results with trying to sleep in them but I would imagine if your hair texture is right, they would work very well that way. I just snap them in while my hair is damp and do a combination of air and blow drying in the morning for quick lift and curl, very easy. I do wish the set came with more- I have better results when I wrap very small sections of my hair for spirals, my attempts at making large waves with big sections of hair came out a little weird looking and there are not really enough in the package to wrap all my hair the way I like it. But, for quick volume to flat roots and a little evening out of my curl, they are well worth the money. I focus on the areas around my face and the top layer of my hair all the way around my part for a little boost.</li>
            <li> They definitely do not work on hair that does not already have a natural curl to it.  My hair is very straight and silky, and they would not stay in it for an hour let alone the entire night.</li>
            <li> I have had these in my closet for about three years now. I used them once when I got them and ended up with super tight ugly curls that were frizzy at the end. However, this was due to user error. I used WAY too much product and twisted them WAY too tight. I finally decided to pull them back out when I was searching heartless curls. I have hair about an inch shy of my butt and it is ridiculously straight. It takes a ton of product to keep a curl for a few hours (hence the over use the first time). After I used them the second time, I am addicted. They give a nice curl without the use of any product. I simply roll them in before bed with slightly damp hair and I wake up with nice curls. They are a little annoying to sleep in. I seem to still be twisting them a bit too tight to make sure they are secure, but hey, I still learning. I have used them now about 10 times and I am very happy!</li>
            <li> They fall out right away even though I filled the directions.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased theses, to wear while sleeping (VERY COMFORTABLE), so I could sleep in an extra 30 min.  They work GREAT.  I have long middle of back length hair that is thin.  The first time I used them, on wet hair with mouse added, I used 7 of the rollers and the next morning my hair was VERY curly... a bit too curly for with a slight frizz.  The 2nd time I only used 4 rollers, wet with mouse added prior, and my hair was medium curly.  My third attempt I used spray on conditioner in place of mouse so curls would come out less frizzy and smooth.  This worked great for me.  So in short, I would not expect perfect results your first time.  Like any hair styling product, it can take a little time, practice, and experimenting to get the results you want.  The curls are very resilient and are even great for 2 days.</li>
            <li> love them can sleep in them ...wife</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this purchase. I felt that the price is fair and the product works very well.</li>
            <li> Needed to create ringlets for my daughter&#x27;s ballet - these created more of an abstract curl vs a defined ringlet.  They were comfortable for her to wear at night.</li>
            <li> Product did NOT work like expected , it gives terrible result &amp; the rollers did not hold their shape after use</li>
            <li> Great to produce curly style and I bought the to sleep in to lessen hair dryer time.  Works great for my intended purpose.</li>
            <li> Just like many &amp;#34;As Seen On TV&amp;#34; products, these Wrap Snap &amp; Go hair rollers are a nifty concept but impossible to use on a practical basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder-length hair of medium thickness, and these things took about 4 hours to put in. And even then, they don&#x27;t create the promised lift at the roots of the hair because the fabric is so soft that the hair is always slipping around - making it impossible to roll them tightly and securely (It is even worse when the hair is slightly damp or wet). The end result is flappy, messy curls that hang limply around the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly advise anyone who desires curly hair to use old-fashioned foam rollers instead. They are cheaper, much less trouble and produce more consistent curls. The plastic pins are much easier to wrap the hair around and the foam absorbs the hair better, unlike the slippery fabric. Goody makes excellent foam curlers that come in all different sizes; if you want tight spiral curls, you should buy this: [[ASIN:B000VT54LK Goody SO Finished Small 5/8&amp;#34; Foam Rollers 14 Pcs (82554)]]. They don&#x27;t carry them in most drugstores anymore, but are available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold the hair well.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I have no hair roller experience at all, but seriously they are so difficult to use! I haven&#x27;t gotten decent looking curls once since I bought them a good while ago.</li>
            <li> So I picked these up originally at a beauty supply store.  There is a little booklet in the case that is 16 pages long that describes how to make spiral curls or other curls.  It also describes the best ways to curl your hair and instructs that all of the curlers to intersnap to one another.  There are two lengths.  There are 8 regular sized rollers and four long rollers.  To begin your curling you should comb your hair up in the center of front of your head and start rolling from there.  Once you snap the first one, when you roll the next roller and get ready to snap it insert the ends into the loop of the last roller and snap so the interconnect.  And so on and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did this on dry hair and let it sit for an hour while I got ready for work, the curls were awesome!  It was super easy to put the rollers in.  Now that I&#x27;ve done them a few times, it takes me five minutes tops to put them in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the rollers in my hair dry overnight, same effect.  The rollers were, meh, okay I guess, to sleep on.  they were a bit uncomfy and a lot of my hair came out from several rollers.  I was wearing a sleep cap the night that I slept with them in.  For sleeping, I would suggest sleeping with pillow rollers, those are pretty comfy for sleeping and make great overnight curls on wet and dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the curlers on wet hair.  For that you have to do them overnight, they won&#x27;t dry in a decent amount of time without an overhead dryer.  This made some pretty funky old fashioned curls that were awfully tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best way to go, at least my favorite is to do them on my dry hair in the morning or before I&#x27;m going out.  I put them in and leave them on for an hour.  I use a lot of different kinds of curlers, these are fun, and really easy.  If you are worried about putting hot curlers in a little girls hair, give these a whirl.</li>
            <li> Waiste of money , puts wave in your hair it might give you good curls if you have super short hair or if you leave them in for days..........</li>
            <li> I love these soft bouncy curls.  I only used 4 curlers for my 1b,F/M,ii,MBL hair, and the cascade of curls is lovely.  I used some leave-in conditioner on my slightly damp hair to help set the curls.  I slept overnight with my satin sleep cap over the top to keep the frizzies down, and finger combed my hair after I took the curlers out.  The effect is shiny, soft, beautiful princess curls.  These are a great way to get heatless curls for long hair.  I couldn&#x27;t feel them at all when I was sleeping, they are so soft and comfortable.  To understand what the \\&quot;code\\&quot; and abbreviations meant, google fia&#x27;s hair typing, and google hair length abbreviations.  I just figured this review would be more useful if you knew what type and length of hair I am using with this product.</li>
            <li> I already had one set, but needed another one. I have very long hair. These are very comfortable to wear and to sleep in.</li>
            <li> I love the rollers, wish they were in fatter sizes. I&#x27;ve tried all the styles, but haven&#x27;t seen the relaxed curl yet. My hair turns out to be the big frizzed head look! I have to experiment more to give the product a fair chance, but they are good rollers. They just may not be good for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and like it says, don&#x27;t wrap in wet head, hair won&#x27;t dry overnight for sure if you try that. My hair passes my buttocks so one roller gets quite a bit of hair. The ends are super curly while the rest is a semi tight to tight curl. They remind me of using brown paper bags and tying them at the end.</li>
            <li> I used these curlers when I had shoulder length hair. It took a fews times for me to learn how to do it quick and effectively. Eventually, I did. They work better with wet hair, along with pieces of perm paper. I don&#x27;t like to sleep on them, and it takes a great deal of time to blow dry your hair.    I&#x27;ve since cut my hair to a little below my ears and look forward to seeing how my hair turns out. I love the fact that the curlers are soft and don&#x27;t burn your head. And NO PINS! I&#x27;ve put them in my 8 yr old daughters hair and she looked GREAT! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a few years, have only used them a couple of times. They&#x27;re super hard to snap so that they stay tight and actually keep the hair in place. I recently cut my hair--impossible to get all of it curled, snapped together, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried them dry and wet--wearing them to bed wet doesn&#x27;t dry your hair all the way through. Dry, the curl doesn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> Love them!  I have long thick hair.  My hair dresser complains everytime I go in for an appointment.  So the fact that it takes me 15 minutes to put these in is a huge plus.  They are easy to put in, and they stay in.  Its a little awkward to sleep in them at first (as with all rollers), but it doesnt hurt my head.  I ordered 2 packs as I didnt think one pack would be enough.  These are a MUST have!</li>
            <li> Excellent for getting curls without damaging hair. For extra long hair, attach two of these together.</li>
            <li> Wow what a great hair product! Gives beautiful Victoria secret model curls overnight. Takes literally five minutes to put in. I have 24 in extensions and i use, only 6 of the rollers and i don&#x27;t damage my extensions with heat...the best! Lifelong customer!</li>
            <li> You can get an awesome pageboy or 1940&#x27;s pincurl look with these! I have very long hair, and lots (fine texture). It&#x27;s a pain to use an iron and you have to curl the base then the ends and pin in standing barrels. I would never curl my hair after getting this long, too much work and did not want to cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are amazing rollers. The best way to use them is after you shower, let you hair dry halfway or blowdry til still damp, and add volumizing mousse or setting lotion through. Then roll them in (using clean partings with a tail comb) You can use it on wet or dry hair, but with wet sometimes it will be WAY too curly and hard to brushout. However with shorter hair this would be better, If longer do the damp method. You can use a heated blowdry cap or blowdry them and let sit for a couple hours at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are HIGHLY recommended for long haired people, they really work, and nothing else I have found can give hair that retro look without a ton of time. Effortless!! SO worth the $$$$!!!</li>
            <li> these give a decent curl, not as easy to use as i would like, you do have to connect or thread one through the other to make them stay in.  took about 6 hours in almost dry hair, but the curl held.  not for you if you want the curl to start close to the head like i do.</li>
            <li> They are kinda hard to get snapped into place and getting the hair on is a little tough, but my hair looked cute!</li>
            <li> These rollers came out years ago and it&#x27;s awesome that they can still be purchased. The rollers really work and they will give you lasting curls.</li>
            <li> I bought at Walgreens.... and could not keep my hair in the rollers even when the ends were snapped together.</li>
            <li> These snap and wrap rollers make my life so much easier, and now I can rest assured my hair will look fabuluous in the morning no matter how much I toss and turn. They are easy to use and extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li> It keeps falling out if I don&#x27;t knot it before I snap it, but if done properly the curls are amazing.</li>
            <li> The Wrap Snap N Go Rollers definitely look well constructed with nice fabric, in a nice plastic zip case with very descriptive instruction booklet.  My problem is that once I&#x27;ve got one rolled on top of my head, I&#x27;ve found it difficult to impossible to snap; I struggle with it while my arms get more and more tired.  Some people may find it easy, but not me.  The snaps technically do work, because I tried them by just holding them down in my hands, under a light, not up in my hair, so I could see them better, and managed to snap them.  I don&#x27;t know how else to put it, but the &amp;#34;male&amp;#34; end of the snap isn&#x27;t long enough, and/or the &amp;#34;female&amp;#34; end isn&#x27;t deep enough.  I&#x27;d probably be able to do it on someone else&#x27;s head if they were sitting down in front of me and I was standing.  If the snaps were different I&#x27;d probably like this product, but it&#x27;s hard to tell.  I did manage to snap one and it did result in a well-set curl, but it&#x27;s too much trouble for me.  I was disappointed because I was really hoping I&#x27;d like these; I was going to get the bendy type rollers, but Wrap Snap N Go had better reviews.  My hair has gotten straighter in the last few years and I&#x27;ve tried to find something that works for me.  After being disappointed with Wrap Snap N Go, I tried the old-fashioned pin curl concept by twirling strands of hair up towards my head and fastening them to my head with hair clips.  The result isn&#x27;t fabulous, but it does work by creating some waves which are a definite improvement for me.</li>
            <li> My daughter (white Caucasian) has extremely thick, straight as a board hair.  It is shoulder length - lays just past the shoulder.  Again, very thick, brown hair.  She asked for something to make her hair curl, but is only 10 so I didn&#x27;t want hot rollers.  These were fantastic from the start!  Since her hair is so thick, it wasn&#x27;t all the way dry after the rollers were in her wet head for 11 hours!  The parts that did dry were VERY curly though.  Next time we used it, we made sure her hair was only slightly damp.  I sprayed each strand with hairspray before I rolled them up.  Next morning (about 10 hours later) they were extremely curly.  Her hair is so thick that if she wanted all over tight curls throughout her whole head, we would need to buy another set.  Product shipped very quick.  We&#x27;ve had these rollers about 4 months and used several times.  They&#x27;re holding up well.</li>
            <li> I buy these for my daughter who is in Show Choir and has very long very thick hair and they work great and are easy to sleep in.</li>
            <li> I have hair almost to my elbows, so to my dismay, I had to stop using the \\&quot;easiest way in the world to curl your hair method\\&quot;, because my hair is about two inches two long now :(.....  (I&#x27;ll explain it in a sec.)  So, I started doing pin curls, rag curls, and every type of overnight \\&quot;setting\\&quot; curl I could do, because my hair simply does not hold curl from heat.  After buying pretty much every type on the market, including the cheap version of these,  I&#x27;ve finally settled with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: No heat, fairly comfortable, cute leopard print (so my husband doesn&#x27;t totally run for the hills, yes, I can be cute with these... sort of), Snap clasp makes these worth purchase, you don&#x27;t have to use any clips or pins.  These seem really durable and sturdy, and can be washed in the machine.  I don&#x27;t like little frizzy ringlets, so I put more hair on each stick, and get big full curls, like you would from a set of jumbo rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: You will get better at putting them in with a little time.  The first time I used them, I didn&#x27;t follow directions and interlock each stick, so I used some pin curl clips to hold them in place, which isn&#x27;t really necessary if you follow directions.  One of the snaps was right on the pressure point of the back of my head, and was a little uncomfortable through the night (my bad).  You really need to dampin the hair AND use some form of product if you have thicker hair atleast.... The curls are really nice, but they fall if you don&#x27;t use a product and have heavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; OKay.... now to explain the \\&quot;easiest way in the world to curl your hair\\&quot;:&lt;br /&gt;You simply take an elastic cloth headband and put it over your head (like a native american, or flapper), with slightly damp hair of course, and some product too, and you simply take the hair and wrap up over and down under the band, adding more hair to that piece as you wrap around to the back.  VERY hard to explain without pictures... for the full picture step by stepand video, web search \\&quot;easiest way in the world to curl your hair, by broken poet\\&quot; and your life will be changed.  It works on all hair types, from cheek length to past the shoulders.  When it gets about elbow length, it&#x27;s too long.  It literally takes 5 minutes once you get the hang of it, for the most beautiful even curls, I&#x27;ve ever had.  Wish I had known about it all my life. If you use this method, all you need is one cloth headband.  You can get them in packs of 3 from any CVS or Grocery store for a couple of bucks.  I would definitely go that route if my hair wasn&#x27;t so long.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> Finally, someone masters a pillow roller that is spa quality instead of meant to double as a medieval torture device!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I&#x27;ve been meaning to pick these up at the store for many years, and have simply ignored them, thinking I am too tired to try pillow rollers again and that my stock of 250 doesn&#x27;t warrant picking up another batch just yet, so I know I am late to the party.  Also, this is way too long a review for something as simple and inconsequential as pillow rollers. but there are some very key highlights that I think will prove important to those of you who have an existing love-hate relationship with a beauty product you spend a theoretical 1/3 of your life wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used pillow rollers (of good quality, given the previously explored corners of the market) for some years, and all too-tight ringlets and spirals-gone-wild aside, they have been one of my favorite beauty sacrifices to make when I have been able to bring myself to do so.  Most of the wayward curl problems I have experienced have been easily attributable to user error--in a fit of aggression, I either wind them too tight trying to pin the cranky little ends under to keep them in all night, or I don&#x27;t pay attention to which way I wind which end--and are not something I blame the pillow rollers for having caused.  However, after using these little gems now for several restful nights, I am now quite aware of the fundamental design flaws that plague pillow rollers everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pillow rollers, unlike many women in their other relationships, have backbones.  There, I said it.  In our quest to develop spines, we apparently start, in some cases, with our pillow rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am well aware that, heretofore, the gold standard for pillow rollers has been a happy malleable little center bit, upon which a forgiving block of foam is skewered, with the entire contraption being encased in a piece of grabby, softish material, either fuzzy fleecy stuff or something that looks to be part of a space blanket.  You wrap your coil around the little foam bit, twist the wire lightly, and head to bed with your new alien hairdo to awake in the morning (or emerge from your bonnet dryer) with a headful of bouncy curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, these leopard-print monstrosities are critically different.  There are no bendy spines, no bendy foam cores, and they have big hair-safe snaps at the ends, used to secure them.  In addition, the way they are installed differs more than you might think when you look at them, and that makes a very unexpected difference.  Further, they are long and made entirely of foam, so you are not bound to wrapping the length of your hair around a miniscule square of foam and are free to wrap more loosely or in a manner to create spiral curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flashing back to my pillow rollers of yore, The thing I had to admit hating most was that it really was hard to sleep on the things.  Granted, I am a back-sleeper, but I would have thought I would have had an easier go at getting some shut-eye that way than the side- and tummy-sleepers who don them.  Whosoever has the better lot in pillow-rolled life, the nubby little bumps created by mounting tiny little pillows to your skull at night does not for a resful night make.  Finding a comfortable, pressure-free way to lay my head down generally resulted in stretching or snapping at least a few overwound hairs from their moorings, and anchoring my head into one unrelenting position as I tried to sleep for about an hour at a time.  (Note: I found that Nyquil helped this, but that is not exactly a long-term solution to self-inflicted beauty problem.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To combat this challenge, I found myself trying to separate my hair differently, and concentrating my rolls to the left and right of center.  This led to more hair-pulling, oddly distributed curls, and wouldn&#x27;t really help those who get their beauty rest with one cheek or the the other planted in their real pillow...youknow, the one the goes on the bed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then I tried leaving my precious sleep out of it and invested in a bonnet dryer, so that I could just blast the damp hair dry and get on with my day.  Not the best idea--those things are loud and you basically sit pathetically tied to an outlet for a good hour (if you have hair past your mid-back like I do), totally unable to move about or carry on a conversation.  That bonnet dryer also did not help much with the other problem, which was the sticky material that really grabbed the hair--and wouldn&#x27;t let go when I wanted to take them out!--at least on the white, non-space-blanket-material pillow rollers that dominate the market.  I was dismayed to shed 20 or more helpless little hairs every time I yanked those suckers out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brings me to my newfound romance with these Wrap Snap N Go pillow rollers.  I thought the name was a little silly, but I&#x27;ll get to that in a moment, as they happen to be correct for a reason I hadn&#x27;t anticipated when I gave them a shot.  In a nutshell, they fix the primary flaws above, and add a couple unexpected benefits as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, there is no wire.  They secure with a single plastic snap, and they lie in a malleable ring on the head that you can roll like rollers or wind in a spiral to create different curls.  I tried the first time, sans instructions, to wind in a direction that would reduce the natural single half-roll down that is caused anytime you secure with looser rollers. The next time I used them, I looked at the included insert and discovered another design intention: interlocking the rollers as you add each one, or even after you have them in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interleaving the rollers like a chain results in the creation of a Greek goddess-style halo of pillow rings, which is actually quite cool.  All you do is thread one end of the roller you are about to snap into the ring of one you have already done and then click it shut.  The result is that they stay where you put them, which in my case was right around the crown of my head.  You have to remember to leave the slightest bit of slack in the bottom few so that you don&#x27;t yank your precious locks as you hoist them up to the ones you will lock them into, to avoid yanking a couple hairs that didn&#x27;t have enough give, but that is an easy step and is also easy to correct: just unroll and retry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unexpected benefit?  No matter how you lie down, the things are, for the most part, out of your way and non-disruptive to your sleep.  Heaven sent.  There are no wires or tiny coils of rock-hard squished pillow and hair to jab you in the noggin all night, and they are piled neatly on the part of your head that, unless you are a skilled yogi, you are not using for sleeping anyway.  (Note, I think I might try these for padding the next time I am trying to get comfortable and stable in a headstand in yoga class.)  Even if you were to put them all over your head, disregarding the simple prescribed instructions, they are so soft and without hard bits that you will sleep just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another surprise benefit: the atrocious leopard print that made me less likely to buy, coupled with the crownlike placement that naturally arises from the roller chaining actually looks, dare I say, cute!  Not wear-to-work-or-a-nightclub cute (but with today&#x27;s fashions, that&#x27;s not entirely out of the realm of possibility), but cute enough to hit the grocery store, manicurist, post office, or to wear around for errands where you might actually see someone you know while you let them dry or keep your hair protected during deep conditioning treatments and the like.  It looks very \\&quot;spa-day chic,\\&quot; akin to those cute flip flops you wear right after getting a pedicure.  Nothing you would wear for the raw sake of being fashionable, but something you&#x27;re okay showing others as it suggests that you&#x27;re amidst a day of power-pampering yourself.  Further, they tend to be the subject of \\&quot;Me Tarzan, you Jane\\&quot; remarks from even the male housemates of our species, rather than the subject of ridicule, or some brand of shame representing the levels of ugliness we are willing to endure in the name of being momentarily pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to make a terribly long story short (especially considering the low price point of these items), I am about to buy second and third stashes of these lovelies, lest they stop being available at a theater near me now that my love affair has begun.  With long hair, I was lucky to use 10 of the included 12 at a time, and their washable nature has me now using them when deep condition hair under heat, using them for an air-dry curl session, and piling my hair up into them with a misting of water or leave-in conditioner when I settle into a red-eye flight, keeping my hair under a hat or protected from the sun on a swimming day, etc.  I believe wholeheartedly that you will be converted quickly from traditional pillow rollers or rag rollers for a very small upfront investment, and achieve comfortable curls that last all day.  Add some root lifter or mousse and use on barely damp hair to maximize hold/volume and minimize dry time and you will be pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could award 4.5 stars, as that sacrificed star is only because the material used to cover them could be smoother or more satiny and would be better to protect the hair shaft (I sleep on a satin pillowcase and this obviates that benefit to some degree,) and because the tight snaps might be a little cumbersome for the less dexterous among us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> I have long straight thick hair. The first curl was a bit clumsy but once I got the hand of the tight twist, using my fingers almost to twirl the curlers around rather than rolling slowly with my hand I got a very tight curl. The curl really varies depending on tightness of the curl and amount of hair used.  I was excited that one package curled my whole head but I am thinking that for more freedom to curls small and tight, I want another package of rollers. Some of the curls in the back were more limp. People with thin or normal hair should only need one set. The snap mechanism was surprisingly easy to use. I really couldn&#x27;t believe how easy these were to sleep on. A couple loosened up but not a single curler fell out during sleep. 12 in the pack. I think sleeping in a hair net/ night cap would help. The curlers do look really cute in! Like a 50s star.&lt;br /&gt;READ the instruction book it comes with. It is VERY helpful.</li>
            <li> These were my first experience with rollers so for 1 it took a few days to really learn how to use them but once you get the hang of it they&#x27;re cool. The good thing is they&#x27;re so soft it&#x27;s for the most part really comfy to sleep in. The bad thing is they get caught in your hair a lot because of the snaps and sometimes it will pull throughout the night even if you try to fix it. They don&#x27;t have much grip so if your hair is really soft or has layers they fall out sometimes. Also because its not a lot of grip it&#x27;s hard to roll the crown of your head they don&#x27;t stay up. But they&#x27;re good for thicker longer hair. I like flexi Rods way better!</li>
            <li> My hair loses curls easily when I use a curling iron but with these my curls lasts the entire day.</li>
            <li> Well, my hair is already curly, I was just hoping for a more tamed curl.  But instead I got major tangles.  They&#x27;re also not thick enough.  When rolling them with wet hair, you might as well be wrapping your hair with a ribbon. They feel too thin.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length hair and these rollers worked great.  They gave me a nice tight curl.  I rolled my hair up wet, spraying each section with styling spray.</li>
            <li> I guess they&#x27;re quick? It was kind of hard to get started wrapping because they&#x27;re so narrow. I like how they wrap/lock together because they do feel very secure on your head and they are VERY comfortable to sleep in...no issues there. I frankly like the look of using http://www.amazon.com/Conair-Styling-Essentials-Rollers-Curlers/dp/B009VGIHS6/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_bt_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;1SRZF2FD006RQCMVVQZT the conair pillow rollers better...probably faster and they work so well for me (easier because there&#x27;s something larger to wrap your hair around).    One thing is if you put these in completely wet and your hair is long, it&#x27;s probably not going to work too well...there&#x27;s no air passing around so nothing to dry the hair. Same with the sponge rollers but it&#x27;s a learning curve how wet your hair can be when you&#x27;re putting them in.</li>
            <li> I use fewer to get looser curls. best thing I have tried to sleep in.</li>
            <li> Mah - nothing to get excited over</li>
            <li> I bought these at a drug store on a whim. I had been using a cut-off sock bun in my hair to give me some waves, and wanted a bit more curl. The pictures on the product sort of scared me- I was not looking for tight spiral curls, or &#x27;80s style \\&quot;body\\&quot; in my hair. However, I thought I would give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and wrapped fairly loosely, and used one package of wraps. I have hair down to my bra-line, and it is layered (layers are more difficult, yes, but I found it manageable with damp hair.  I showered at night, did the rest of my night routine and read, and then put them in and went to sleep. I woke up and dressed, got myself together (and the kids, and the hubby!), and unwrapped my hair- fiddled with my fingers (re-twirled) and less than 2 minutes and I was all set. I looked great! These were wonderful and lasted all day! I am a VERY happy customer, and thrilled with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I have to add, I love that these are machine washable too! I added Aveda&#x27;s Smooth Infusion Style-Prep Smoother to my damp hair, and that was all I needed to have beautiful curls that lasted all day. Normally my hair goes flat hours after curling with a hot iron or rollers, so this was excellent!</li>
            <li> I was browsing Amazon last night, looking for a way to curl my hair without heat and without the stiff neck and shoulder soreness of most sleep-in curlers. I have long, fine hair that is just above the bra strap. Too much heat fries my hair. Too much product weighs down my hair. I&#x27;m also not a morning person who wants to spend an hour washing, drying and styling my hair in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway.....I was looking at the curlers. I already have them. I bought them at Sally about a year ago and they work great for tight spiral curls that last all day long. The do shrink my hair up to shoulder length and the result is a very full head of curls. When you have fine hair like mine, a full head of all-day curls is quite feat! The curlers are fairly comfortable for sleeping and don&#x27;t look completely hideous. I&#x27;ve been experimenting with the curlers with limited success to achieve looser, wavier curls and was actually hoping they might offer a larger curler to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled on Perfectionista&#x27;s review in here and at the bottom she listed a site she found on a technique of wrapping your hair in a head band, which gave me exactly what I was looking for: long, wavy curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line is that for me, these curlers are great if you want tight spiral curls that last all day long. Would love it if they could come out with different sizes of these curlers for different types of curls.</li>
            <li> These worked great and are exactly as advertised.  They were super easy to get in my hair, easy to close, held in hair well, and were comfortable to sleep in.  I only gave this 4 stars because the curls that resulted were so tiny, they made me look like I had an afro!  I have fine hair about mid-back length, and after I used these, the length of my hair stopped above my shoulders!  Sadly, I used a curling iron to get the tight curls out, so didn&#x27;t get to enjoy the rollers.  If they made a larger size, those would be good for people with longer hair.  I am going to try these one more time, curling my hair around 2 or 3 of them to get a larger curl and see what happens.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey since it can be found for cheaper, but I didn&#x27;t have time to go looking in person. I found one youtube video showing how to get tight corkscrew curls -- double wrap the rollers at the base, as far as possible, before snapping together. If you follow the directions in the included manual (at least for me) all of the curls would fall out in the night and so I would end up with waves instead of curls in the morning. They&#x27;re the most comfortable curlers to sleep on, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re like sleeping without any curlers. They don&#x27;t pull my hair, and they&#x27;re very simple, easy-to-use design.</li>
            <li> these are a win-win every time! love them for traveling.</li>
            <li> I own two sets of these rollers.  I bought a second set so I&#x27;d have more of the longer rollers.  If you have long hair, you&#x27;ll probably need two sets.  Two sets is not cheap as rollers go, but these are not ordinary rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What they are is polyester foam (like quilt batting) cut into strips, covered in fabric, with plastic snaps on the ends.  You wrap your hair around, then snap the ends together.  This transforms the roller to a loop.  You link the loops together in a [[ASIN:B001BZFC8I chain]].  All kidding aside, that&#x27;s the basic process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work best left in overnight, and are the only rollers I can sleep in overnight.  Even so, it&#x27;s important to snap the ends together on the outside - not against your scalp.  The plastic snaps will dig into your scalp if snapped together next to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine.  It will take a curl, but does not want to hold.  When I remove the rollers in the morning, I don&#x27;t comb through.  I just use my fingers to arrange the curls.  The instructions say  to put styling product on every strand.  You don&#x27;t have to do that.  Many times I&#x27;ve shampooed in the morning, and worked just a bit of product through my hair and let it air dry, then roll it in the evening.  Sometimes I dampen my hair slightly; sometimes I leave it dry.  The curls come out a bit looser if I don&#x27;t dampen it.  In the morning, after finger styling, I usually just leave it.  I use hair spray if it&#x27;s a windy or very humid day.  I cannot tell you how thrilled I am to be able to have all day curls - without a perm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rollers can and should be machine washed.  I let them air dry.  Washing removes soaked in product and \\&quot;re-poofs\\&quot; the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ding them a star because there is no way the average (or excellent) woman is going to get the hair styles shown on the package.  That is natural curl in the photos.  Otherwise, an excellent, no-heat method of curling hair.</li>
