            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think i got the exact pattern in the picture.  </li>
            <li>not to mention you cant go wrong with the cute design!!!</li>
            <li>Pink doesn&#x27;t happen to be my favorite color...</li>
            <li>First off these live up to their name of mini.  </li>
            <li>Good to have it in a purse, but not big enough for regular use</li>
            <li>small, easy to store, well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Love these little guys.  </li>
            <li>I bought one in Canada years ago in a pattern I loved, but only bought another pair here off amazon because unfortunately I lost the point tweezers off the set I originally bought</li>
            <li>I have an extra set in my first aid kit.  </li>
            <li>Read the dimensions before buying if you want to avoid being surprised.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re small enough to carry around in a small clutch and work beautifully.</li>

            <li> Hard to find a decent pair of tweezers at a decent price these days.</li>
            <li> They last a long time if you don&#x27;t lose them!</li>
            <li> I did find them a little more difficult to work with than I expected because of their size.  </li>
            <li> The one I got is actually black and white flowers; which is even cuter than the one in the picture.  </li>
            <li> I have a set in black and white i got at cvs for 2x</li>
            <li> Only a bit disappointed that I couldn&#x27;t get them in the same pattern/colours as my original set.</li>
            <li> They are sharp though.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t fault the listing copy editor or the other reviewers for failing to reveal how tiny these are (about 2 1/2 inches or 64 mm) --- they all pointed out that the tweezers are small.  </li>
            <li> Not much else to say other than thank you!</li>
            <li> Now I always have a small pair of tweezers in my purse to grab that hair that is driving me nuts whenever I need to.</li>
            <li> very small and compact design, works well.</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with my tweezerman tweezers!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m horrible about remembering to tweeze my eyebrows but always seem to see a stray hair at the worst times.</li>

            <li> Perfect size, high quality, and I love that it includes both the slant and fine point tweezers in a slim and secure pouch. They&#x27;re small enough to carry around in a small clutch and work beautifully.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these tweezers! They are hands down the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and I have purchased probably thirty pairs in the last five years! They grab the thinnest of hairs without breaking them and last ages before dulling. I got them for literally a third of the price at Walmart, but I&#x27;d definitely purchase a million times over before paying for another name brand. For anyone who tweezes their eyebrows, chin or upper lip these are a must! They are great for splinters and pulling threads while sewing too ;) Great for any tiny task that you need a really good grip for.</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to store in makeup bag.</li>
            <li> These things are tiny. They are sharp though.</li>
            <li> I love this tweezer set. I bought one in Canada years ago in a pattern I loved, but only bought another pair here off amazon because unfortunately I lost the point tweezers off the set I originally bought and I can&#x27;t seem to find them in stores in Germany. They last a long time if you don&#x27;t lose them! Only a bit disappointed that I couldn&#x27;t get them in the same pattern/colours as my original set. The one I was sent was different shades of red with the Chinese longevity symbol imprinted on it.</li>
            <li> These tweezers work beautifully --- the tips align well and provide plenty of grip for tiny splinters, errant hairs or what have you.  Pink doesn&#x27;t happen to be my favorite color...and these came in two different shades of it.  However, I didn&#x27;t deduct a star because I didn&#x27;t like the color.  My only reservation relates to the miniscule size of the tweezers.  I can&#x27;t fault the listing copy editor or the other reviewers for failing to reveal how tiny these are (about 2 1/2 inches or 64 mm) --- they all pointed out that the tweezers are small.  I did find them a little more difficult to work with than I expected because of their size.  Another half-inch and they&#x27;d have been perfect.</li>
            <li> It’s super tiny and super cute.  And has the two most practical kinds of tweezers in this great little case.  The one I got is actually black and white flowers; which is even cuter than the one in the picture.  It&#x27;s perfect for travel case or even your purse.  As someone who can&#x27;t live without tweezers for single day this is a great set.  I think it would also make a great gift.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are great at grabbing even the tiniest little hairs. They are also awesome to keep in my first aid kit that I keep in my car for taking care of things like splinters on the go!</li>
            <li> BE AWARE THAT IT HAS A VARIETY OF PACKAGING. I love Revlon tweezers. Been using this brand for over 4 years now. I like this tweezer set. I actually have 2 pairs. There&#x27;s a tweezer holder and a set of a slanted and pointed tweezers. They hare pretty small. 1/2 sized to 3/4 sized of a regular tweezer. Can easily can slip into my purse or make up bag.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Fast shipping!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this set!!!! I am a professional waxer and most waxers swear by tweezerman. I was very unhappy with my tweezerman tweezers!! these are much better and they grab the tiny hairs without breaking them. not to mention you cant go wrong with the cute design!!! the color wasn&#x27;t affected by the barbicide like the tweezerman set. I would definitely recommend this set! :)</li>
            <li> I purchased these to keep in my purse. I&#x27;m horrible about remembering to tweeze my eyebrows but always seem to see a stray hair at the worst times. Now I always have a small pair of tweezers in my purse to grab that hair that is driving me nuts whenever I need to.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Good quality for in my travel toiletry bag.</li>

            <li> Perfect size to keep in ur car, purse, anywhere!! U can do a quick fix no matter where u r.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Hard to find a decent pair of tweezers at a decent price these days. These were perfect and they&#x27;re pretty! Bonus! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> small, easy to store, well worth the money.  I&#x27;d defiantly buy again.  my favorite tweezers.  I have an extra set in my first aid kit.  fun pattern I think there are several patterns out there I&#x27;m not too picky but I don&#x27;t think i got the exact pattern in the picture.  I have a set in black and white i got at cvs for 2x the price i gave to a friend so he did not have to have pink polka dots in his first aid kit. I have 3 sets now and would re -buy in an instant.  very small and compact design, works well. The point on the pointed one is very exact and the diagonal holds on to hair and splinters well.</li>
            <li> These are officially my favorite tweezers, they are so accurate and very well made.</li>
            <li> First off these live up to their name of mini.  Tiny tiny tiny.  Read the dimensions before buying if you want to avoid being surprised.  However, excellent quality and they do what they need to do.</li>
