            <li>Very easy to use and absorbs rapidly into your skin with no stickiness after application.  </li>

            <li>Great stuff, it took a little time to get it in the mail, but the product is excellent, thank you!</li>
            <li>Makes a very smooth feel on legs and body.</li>
            <li>This should be a very important find for some eczema sufferers.</li>
            <li>I was blinded by excellent price and good (on average) reviews.</li>
            <li>So, be certain you will be getting retinol in your lotion, lol.</li>
            <li>I have tried many moisturizing lotions-most prescribed by dermatologists.</li>
            <li>This cream is ok, not any better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>and I am really pleased.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, had to purchase another.  </li>
            <li>Top ingredient is mineral oil.</li>
            <li>Awesome product, wear it at night and remember to wash it off before heading out the next day</li>
            <li>Price is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for cellulite on my hip area and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>i love that it practially has no smell.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more oce</li>
            <li>Enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I guess I was expecting more after reading some of the reviews.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li>U will update when more time has passed.</li>
            <li>Have tried many retinol products and they&#x27;re either overpriced or just don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>this stuff does nothing .it seems to age my face skin even more.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>My thighs look more toned than ever. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>I love it (not the sunburn).</li>
            <li>I was so thrilled by other excellent ingredients and NO PARABENS that I went for it and have no one to blame for.</li>
            <li>This product is worth a LOT more than you pay for it!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even smell it when it&#x27;s on my face, which is great, as I&#x27;m quite sensitive to scents.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so easy to apply from the pump when you&#x27;re in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>on.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li>It has a very tremendous tightening effect and I felt like my skin was squeezing me.</li>
            <li>Like this stuff, like the pump, easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy at all and soaks in easily, and there is the slightest fragrance which I can&#x27;t even smell unless I put my hand up to my nose.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, nothing special.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any firming but the fine lines seem to be melting away...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s to be considered a light moisturizer in my opinion.</li>
            <li>GREAT Facial Product!</li>
            <li>It makes me feel so comfortable after I put it</li>
            <li>Creates a great facial moisture-shield.  </li>
            <li>My son is using this and the Advanced Clinicals AHA for pilaris keratosis.  </li>
            <li>Again, I&#x27;m virtually wrinkle free</li>
            <li>This product does not make my skin smooth or feel like it makes any difference at all.</li>
            <li>I use Body Merry every morning after my bath and Advanced Clinicals every night before bed.</li>
            <li>So Far so good, I never used this product</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>it is exactly what i ordered and will be ordering more.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad that I purchased it because my face is clearing up mighty fast.</li>
            <li>I have tried several brands and this one is, by far, the best out there.</li>
            <li>Came so quick two days and also a lil free</li>
            <li>So far I am pleased with this purchase and with Prime, I got it the day after I ordered it!  </li>
            <li>I used this after using my Derma Roller for the first time Saturday night and my skin felt and looked great the very next day!</li>
            <li>Love this, &amp; REALLY love the closed system &amp; pump handle, much more hygienic than dipping fingers into jars.</li>
            <li>I had an eye on until I see the full ingredient list.</li>
            <li>It feels good on the skin but not enough moisture</li>
            <li>I thought that this was too good to be true, given the value of buying this cream, but I used it on the back of my hands to test it</li>
            <li>If you get mild  patchy redness, its part of the process.   </li>
            <li>All and all, very pleased, especially with the price.</li>
            <li>Ok I have used pretty much the full jar over the winter.  </li>
            <li>The first time I bought this it was about $15, now it is triple that!?  </li>
            <li>I have to look first them when I apply this lotion every night!</li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase</li>
            <li>This is well worth buying..</li>
            <li>I totally missed the most important part: the list of fully disclosed ingredients which started with water and had mineral oil as a 2d ingredient with Retinol as 11th.</li>
            <li>but if you are a purist you&#x27;d go for something more natural like bees-wax.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smack dap in the middle of light weight and heavy, which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>No strong scent and great price.  </li>
            <li>I think it is a good deal just compared with other creams $$ tags.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and absorbs right away.  </li>
            <li>This product right here works.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of putting it on, head to toe, right after a hot bath, then went to bed.</li>
            <li>Honestly, to me, Retinol seems to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>sits on my counter &amp; the pump handle makes it easy to use frequently on face, neck, &amp; the often-missed d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe there is very much retinol in this cream.</li>
            <li>After the first three weeks there was a noticeable improvement in the tone, texture and smoothness of my skin.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t be back for more.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff something I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>See results after first use.</li>
            <li>It absolutely does!</li>
            <li>Nice feel and no funny smell</li>
            <li>Works great softens and smooths dry rough skin</li>
            <li>look how much u get, a large tub.</li>
            <li>My skin looks fabulous and since the retinol is lower in the ingredients, it is gentle enough to use for daytime as well as evening.</li>
            <li>No real improvement in skin, but makeup goes on better.</li>
            <li>Great product,  noticed a difference in my behind</li>
            <li>fast deliveryl</li>
            <li>Really like this Retinol cream.</li>
            <li>I have been using Retinol Advanced Firming Cream for several weeks on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>Has also helped smooth wrinkles in my upper arms.</li>
            <li>Maybe  I&#x27;ll see the difference if I use the whole jar otherwise</li>
            <li>this cream really does help the cellulite go away, you just need some patience</li>
            <li>it really does work.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It is widely used in concentrated form as petroleum jelly form and has some appropriate uses</li>
            <li>but i give it a four rating because it adds  smoothness to the legs and its very light.&lt;br /&gt;Pump</li>
            <li>Skin looks younger and smooth, plump.</li>
            <li>So, I am very thankful to find this stuff</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it and have bought it again!</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>My skin looks even toned and smooth,  and the wrinkles on my forehead aren&#x27;t as deep.   </li>
            <li>and I can tell a difference in how much nicer my skin looks when I use it.  </li>
            <li>I am dark-skinned (Filipino) but living under the intense Hawaiian sun and I am not taking any chances with skin cancer or premature wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Retinol really does make your skin suceptable to sunburn.</li>
            <li>(Hence my 4 star rating as I don&#x27;t know how effect the cream really is).</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Not greasy at all and absorbs into my skin really well.</li>
            <li>I will not reorder this product for this reason alone unless the company substitutes mineral oil for a more natural moisture sealant in the future.</li>
            <li>With constant use twice daily, I have seen a remarkable overall rejuvenation of my skin and others have commented on this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You get more product than expected!  </li>
            <li>I am thirty three years old and had recently noticed some fine lines appearing around my mouth and on my forehead.</li>
            <li>i live in FL where we have a discount store that you can get it for 4.99 in!</li>
            <li>I mainly like it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, this particular Retinol cream does work.</li>
            <li>normal everyday lotion nothing special and full of chemicals</li>
            <li>My skin took a good few weeks to get back to normal again.</li>
            <li>Truly high quality.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any significant improvement yet after two weeks of daily application maybe too early to see that.</li>
            <li>We have used this as well as much more expensive retinol - this was the same, if not maybe even better!</li>
            <li>my hands have never been so soft, and I don&#x27;t need to use much.  </li>
            <li>my wife loves it so far seems to be working thanks</li>
            <li>After a few days, my fingers are beginning to look better as well.</li>
            <li>Very creamy .. sinks in quickly..  </li>
            <li>I just hope they never change the formula to \\&quot;new and</li>
            <li>In my opinion this product holds its own very well when compared with other well known and more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>this big tub of Retinol cream is cheap and lasts for a couple years the way I use it (just one pump quarter-sized dollop of cream is enough to cover my face and neck).</li>
            <li>I very much prefer the Argan Oil, sold by this same company.</li>
            <li>nothing special and not very moisturizing</li>
            <li>This stuff made my face so clear I don&#x27;t even have to wear makeup!</li>
            <li>wow!  </li>
            <li>The FIRST time I used it, the wrinkles on my hands were totally GONE!  </li>
            <li>After the first use, when I woke up the next morning my face was THEE SOFTEST</li>
            <li>Seemed to help with my aging skin and made it soft and supple!</li>
            <li>With consistent use, you can definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li>it will at less light your skin .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear bar unwrapped and costs all of bout $2.50</li>
            <li>i use this on my face,tummy and legs.loving it so far.</li>
            <li>I purchased it early November 2014</li>
            <li>have used it at least once a day for the most part.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone looking to reduce those early signs that you see creeping up on you.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin so soft</li>
            <li>The key to this stuff is to use it then take a break and allow the effects of this cream to really show.   </li>
            <li>but my skin never adjusted and was irritated, but I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised with the outcome.</li>
            <li>Thus far I don&#x27;t see any change since using the product but will keep trying.</li>
            <li>Maybe with the help of my genes, diet, and exercise, but my peers always comment how young I still look, and I like to think that Retinol has helped.</li>
            <li>This product works well on old scars and stretch marks.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really comment on how well this product will work as of now, only time will tell.</li>
            <li>I would though say if you have sensitive to not use it.</li>
            <li>So one day I applied a fair amount on my hands and my dried, cracked skin and cut healed in just a few days</li>
            <li>It feels more like a thick lotion.</li>
            <li>The quality is not bad but not worth the price.  </li>
            <li>improved\\&quot; like so many other products, which really ruins the product.  </li>
            <li>I see a little important in skin, only been using it for 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>I use this on my arms and legs, has lighted up a few dark spots and moisturizes my skin better than any moisturizer I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I use a sheer makeup because I like the natural look and this lotion compliments my foundation.</li>
            <li>I use it only at night and it makes my skin soft in the morning</li>
            <li>However, like other products of this nature I would avoid using the product over or very close to the eyes.</li>
            <li>And in two weeks the scars in my arm (new scars roughly 1 month old from my dog before he learned to quit jumping) have almost disappeared entirely!</li>
            <li>I usually apply it right after I shower in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other retinol products in the past that make my skin silky smooth almost instant.</li>

            <li> The AHA works best alternated with a plumping or hydrating serum or non-hyalonuric product.</li>

            <li> is so effective at ending the symptoms.</li>
            <li> I liked this product a lot.</li>
            <li> You do, however, need to use it every day for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and absorbs rapidly into your skin with no stickiness after application.  </li>
            <li> Really have to use a very good cleanser, recommend a glycerine bar from a feel-rite health store.</li>
            <li> Great product and super cheap!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, it took a little time to get it in the mail, but the product is excellent, thank you!</li>
            <li> Makes a very smooth feel on legs and body.</li>
            <li> This should be a very important find for some eczema sufferers.</li>
            <li> I was blinded by excellent price and good (on average) reviews.</li>
            <li> So, be certain you will be getting retinol in your lotion, lol.</li>
            <li> I have tried many moisturizing lotions-most prescribed by dermatologists.</li>
            <li> This cream is ok, not any better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and I am really pleased.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, had to purchase another.  </li>
            <li> Top ingredient is mineral oil.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, wear it at night and remember to wash it off before heading out the next day</li>
            <li> Price is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for cellulite on my hip area and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> i love that it practially has no smell.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more oce</li>
            <li> Enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting more after reading some of the reviews.  </li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li> U will update when more time has passed.</li>
            <li> Have tried many retinol products and they&#x27;re either overpriced or just don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> this stuff does nothing .it seems to age my face skin even more.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> My thighs look more toned than ever. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I love it (not the sunburn).</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled by other excellent ingredients and NO PARABENS that I went for it and have no one to blame for.</li>
            <li> This product is worth a LOT more than you pay for it!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even smell it when it&#x27;s on my face, which is great, as I&#x27;m quite sensitive to scents.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so easy to apply from the pump when you&#x27;re in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> on.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li> It has a very tremendous tightening effect and I felt like my skin was squeezing me.</li>
            <li> Like this stuff, like the pump, easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy at all and soaks in easily, and there is the slightest fragrance which I can&#x27;t even smell unless I put my hand up to my nose.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, nothing special.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any firming but the fine lines seem to be melting away...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to be considered a light moisturizer in my opinion.</li>
            <li> GREAT Facial Product!</li>
            <li> It makes me feel so comfortable after I put it</li>
            <li> Creates a great facial moisture-shield.  </li>
            <li> My son is using this and the Advanced Clinicals AHA for pilaris keratosis.  </li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;m virtually wrinkle free</li>
            <li> This product does not make my skin smooth or feel like it makes any difference at all.</li>
            <li> I use Body Merry every morning after my bath and Advanced Clinicals every night before bed.</li>
            <li> So Far so good, I never used this product</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> it is exactly what i ordered and will be ordering more.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad that I purchased it because my face is clearing up mighty fast.</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands and this one is, by far, the best out there.</li>
            <li> Came so quick two days and also a lil free</li>
            <li> So far I am pleased with this purchase and with Prime, I got it the day after I ordered it!  </li>
            <li> I used this after using my Derma Roller for the first time Saturday night and my skin felt and looked great the very next day!</li>
            <li> Love this, &amp; REALLY love the closed system &amp; pump handle, much more hygienic than dipping fingers into jars.</li>
            <li> I had an eye on until I see the full ingredient list.</li>
            <li> It feels good on the skin but not enough moisture</li>
            <li> I thought that this was too good to be true, given the value of buying this cream, but I used it on the back of my hands to test it</li>
            <li> If you get mild  patchy redness, its part of the process.   </li>
            <li> All and all, very pleased, especially with the price.</li>
            <li> Ok I have used pretty much the full jar over the winter.  </li>
            <li> The first time I bought this it was about $15, now it is triple that!?  </li>
            <li> I have to look first them when I apply this lotion every night!</li>
            <li> Well worth the purchase</li>
            <li> This is well worth buying..</li>
            <li> I totally missed the most important part: the list of fully disclosed ingredients which started with water and had mineral oil as a 2d ingredient with Retinol as 11th.</li>
            <li> but if you are a purist you&#x27;d go for something more natural like bees-wax.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smack dap in the middle of light weight and heavy, which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> No strong scent and great price.  </li>
            <li> I think it is a good deal just compared with other creams $$ tags.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and absorbs right away.  </li>
            <li> This product right here works.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of putting it on, head to toe, right after a hot bath, then went to bed.</li>
            <li> Honestly, to me, Retinol seems to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> sits on my counter &amp; the pump handle makes it easy to use frequently on face, neck, &amp; the often-missed d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe there is very much retinol in this cream.</li>
            <li> After the first three weeks there was a noticeable improvement in the tone, texture and smoothness of my skin.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be back for more.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff something I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> See results after first use.</li>
            <li> It absolutely does!</li>
            <li> Nice feel and no funny smell</li>
            <li> Works great softens and smooths dry rough skin</li>
            <li> look how much u get, a large tub.</li>
            <li> My skin looks fabulous and since the retinol is lower in the ingredients, it is gentle enough to use for daytime as well as evening.</li>
            <li> No real improvement in skin, but makeup goes on better.</li>
            <li> Great product,  noticed a difference in my behind</li>
            <li> fast deliveryl</li>
            <li> Really like this Retinol cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using Retinol Advanced Firming Cream for several weeks on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Has also helped smooth wrinkles in my upper arms.</li>
            <li> Maybe  I&#x27;ll see the difference if I use the whole jar otherwise</li>
            <li> this cream really does help the cellulite go away, you just need some patience</li>
            <li> it really does work.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It is widely used in concentrated form as petroleum jelly form and has some appropriate uses</li>
            <li> but i give it a four rating because it adds  smoothness to the legs and its very light.&lt;br /&gt;Pump</li>
            <li> Skin looks younger and smooth, plump.</li>
            <li> So, I am very thankful to find this stuff</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it and have bought it again!</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> My skin looks even toned and smooth,  and the wrinkles on my forehead aren&#x27;t as deep.   </li>
            <li> and I can tell a difference in how much nicer my skin looks when I use it.  </li>
            <li> I am dark-skinned (Filipino) but living under the intense Hawaiian sun and I am not taking any chances with skin cancer or premature wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Retinol really does make your skin suceptable to sunburn.</li>
            <li> (Hence my 4 star rating as I don&#x27;t know how effect the cream really is).</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all and absorbs into my skin really well.</li>
            <li> I will not reorder this product for this reason alone unless the company substitutes mineral oil for a more natural moisture sealant in the future.</li>
            <li> With constant use twice daily, I have seen a remarkable overall rejuvenation of my skin and others have commented on this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You get more product than expected!  </li>
            <li> I am thirty three years old and had recently noticed some fine lines appearing around my mouth and on my forehead.</li>
            <li> i live in FL where we have a discount store that you can get it for 4.99 in!</li>
            <li> I mainly like it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, this particular Retinol cream does work.</li>
            <li> normal everyday lotion nothing special and full of chemicals</li>
            <li> My skin took a good few weeks to get back to normal again.</li>
            <li> Truly high quality.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any significant improvement yet after two weeks of daily application maybe too early to see that.</li>
            <li> We have used this as well as much more expensive retinol - this was the same, if not maybe even better!</li>
            <li> my hands have never been so soft, and I don&#x27;t need to use much.  </li>
            <li> my wife loves it so far seems to be working thanks</li>
            <li> After a few days, my fingers are beginning to look better as well.</li>
            <li> Very creamy .. sinks in quickly..  </li>
            <li> I just hope they never change the formula to \\&quot;new and</li>
            <li> In my opinion this product holds its own very well when compared with other well known and more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> this big tub of Retinol cream is cheap and lasts for a couple years the way I use it (just one pump quarter-sized dollop of cream is enough to cover my face and neck).</li>
            <li> I very much prefer the Argan Oil, sold by this same company.</li>
            <li> nothing special and not very moisturizing</li>
            <li> This stuff made my face so clear I don&#x27;t even have to wear makeup!</li>
            <li> wow!  </li>
            <li> The FIRST time I used it, the wrinkles on my hands were totally GONE!  </li>
            <li> After the first use, when I woke up the next morning my face was THEE SOFTEST</li>
            <li> Seemed to help with my aging skin and made it soft and supple!</li>
            <li> With consistent use, you can definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li> it will at less light your skin .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear bar unwrapped and costs all of bout $2.50</li>
            <li> i use this on my face,tummy and legs.loving it so far.</li>
            <li> I purchased it early November 2014</li>
            <li> have used it at least once a day for the most part.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone looking to reduce those early signs that you see creeping up on you.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin so soft</li>
            <li> The key to this stuff is to use it then take a break and allow the effects of this cream to really show.   </li>
            <li> but my skin never adjusted and was irritated, but I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised with the outcome.</li>
            <li> Thus far I don&#x27;t see any change since using the product but will keep trying.</li>
            <li> Maybe with the help of my genes, diet, and exercise, but my peers always comment how young I still look, and I like to think that Retinol has helped.</li>
            <li> This product works well on old scars and stretch marks.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really comment on how well this product will work as of now, only time will tell.</li>
            <li> I would though say if you have sensitive to not use it.</li>
            <li> So one day I applied a fair amount on my hands and my dried, cracked skin and cut healed in just a few days</li>
            <li> It feels more like a thick lotion.</li>
            <li> The quality is not bad but not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> improved\\&quot; like so many other products, which really ruins the product.  </li>
            <li> I see a little important in skin, only been using it for 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I use this on my arms and legs, has lighted up a few dark spots and moisturizes my skin better than any moisturizer I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I use a sheer makeup because I like the natural look and this lotion compliments my foundation.</li>
            <li> I use it only at night and it makes my skin soft in the morning</li>
            <li> However, like other products of this nature I would avoid using the product over or very close to the eyes.</li>
            <li> And in two weeks the scars in my arm (new scars roughly 1 month old from my dog before he learned to quit jumping) have almost disappeared entirely!</li>
            <li> I usually apply it right after I shower in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other retinol products in the past that make my skin silky smooth almost instant.</li>
            <li> so initially I was not sure how much it worked.</li>
            <li> a small amount comes out and takes care of a large peice of you body.</li>
            <li> I suffered a mean one to my face and ears when I went kayaking on day and forgot to put sunblock on, and considering how thin the skin is under the eyes, it immediately resulted in MORE wrinkles and lines!</li>
            <li> About the cream itself, my left hand was extremely dry!</li>
            <li> I could have gotten the same results from a cheap bottle of drug store facial cold cream.  </li>
            <li> I just need a retinol cream to perserve my skin and keep wrinkles and whatnot at bay for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> I was upset when I saw this same size jar at regular beauty store for less than $5.00...</li>
            <li> it would be A LOT more expensive if they did!</li>
            <li> just irretate my skin or  dry it out.</li>
            <li> It was so dry my skin cracked</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $$$$ on more expensive products if you just want to see results.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Any lotion or cream I would apply to my hand would only irritate my skin and moisturize for only a few minutes.</li>
            <li> you should only use it at night, NEVER during the day), it absorbs nicely(I wait at least 30 mins for it to fully absorbs before going to bed) and leaves my face feeling soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> For the past ten years  I have used Clinique makeup and their dramatically different moisturizing lotion in the morning but at night I use this instead.</li>
            <li> After only a few nights his skin is already clearer.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really no frangrance, just smells like lotion to me.</li>
            <li> and I got a second degree burn after using this a few weeks before I went to the beach.</li>
            <li> It is not fast, but does work.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> Not sure on the long term effects yet since I&#x27;ve only used for a few days.</li>
            <li> As practice, I will rinse off this cream and put on sunblock when I hit the outdoors, since in my experience (and contrary to other reports)</li>
            <li> Then I would let my skin rest for a month then reply four times a week every other month.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to other reviewers claiming this doesn&#x27;t have retinol.</li>
            <li> I use this twice daily with my trouble spots, so I will see what the results are like and hope it minimizes my trouble ares.</li>
            <li> im.a 54 yr old male with dull ,tired looking skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even mention Retinol on the jar, and don&#x27;t do a thing for dark spots.</li>
            <li> It erased all my blemishes and dark spots.</li>
            <li> Been using it on my thighs and butt for over a month and am seeing smoother, less bumpy skin.</li>
            <li> and she says that her wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Seen it somewhere else for half the price.</li>
            <li> This may seem a little pricey for some people however comparing this to other retinol products that are $8.00 for a 2oz jar!</li>
            <li> Mineral oil creates an artificial film over the skin sealing it in, which yes, helps to retain moisture but at a price of not allowing it to breathe much, not unlike its father product: oil is spilled into the ocean from defective oil drilling - you have heard on the news what it does to sea life.</li>
            <li> use it everyday and now noticed some improved changes.  </li>
            <li> feels nice,doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky or oily  and does help the appearance of your skin if you use it everyday..</li>
            <li> i was looking for a product that would firm my skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> My skin was so thin it was spitting open.</li>
            <li> I also hope this helps firm some problem areas.</li>
            <li> I have really uneven skin.</li>
            <li> It took a few months before I started seeing results.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a few months and noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I have stopped purchasing the high end products because of their price and disappointing results.</li>
            <li> My skin usually looks just washed.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a mediocre substitute for those in a financial pinch looking to cut corners.</li>
            <li> But when it comes to cellulite or wrinkles, sorry ladies, I am only 24, I don&#x27;t suffer from those two...</li>
            <li> Not sure about the actual effects yet, but I use it every other day, I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> I could hardly believe it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t be using this because it must be a little too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> I am not going to give this product a bad review because I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Or atleast that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been reading lately (about Retinal A not specifically this product).</li>
            <li> thick goop.</li>
            <li> This is a thick cream</li>
            <li> I just kept rubbing by face because the smoothness was unbelievable!</li>
            <li> It was so bad that I&#x27;ve had a permanent crack on one hand, and I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of wrinkles on my fingers and the back of my hands from all the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I had an ugly cut on the back of my hand.</li>
            <li> but I am giving it 3 stars because it arrived broken, the dispenser and some cream in the box.</li>
            <li> Some even made the dryness worse.  </li>
            <li> Steroids take weeks and thin your skin.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed, was hoping this would do the trick with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Retinol creams tend to be incredibly expensive.</li>
            <li> This product is very poor.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but don&#x27;t be greedy!</li>
            <li> but nothing bad that couldn&#x27;t be covered up with makeup.   </li>
            <li> Or maybe I just wanted to see a difference so badly, I imagined it!</li>
            <li> i dont write reviews (unless something is TERRIBLE)</li>
            <li> What a horrible thing to get.</li>

            <li> Great buy!!!!! Applies markup nicely! No shedding!!!! That&#x27;s all I was worried about!&lt;br /&gt;#RAR</li>
            <li> wonderful product .... it works for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried many moisturizing lotions-most prescribed by dermatologists. This OTC bets them all. Results in just days.</li>
            <li> i use this on my face,tummy and legs.loving it so far.</li>
            <li> This cream is ok, not any better than others I&#x27;ve tried. You do get a lot for your money. No real improvement in skin, but makeup goes on better.</li>
            <li> Great product,  noticed a difference in my behind</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase.  I mainly like it b/c it&#x27;s so easy to apply from the pump when you&#x27;re in a hurry.  But at night, I try to use a second, heavier moisturizer over it.  It&#x27;s to be considered a light moisturizer in my opinion.</li>
            <li> GREAT Facial Product!</li>
            <li> This product works well at reducing the appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li> Truly high quality.  Also bought the Collagen and I am really pleased.  Will continue to buy great products with awsome price!</li>
            <li> I feel like this is a good product. It was also a good value. Will  purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this product, had to purchase another.  Great as a moisturizer.  It was delivered in about 2 days, was packaged well and I will purchase from seller in the future</li>
            <li> nothing special and not very moisturizing</li>
            <li> Great product and super cheap! Makes my skin look great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, nothing special.</li>
            <li> Top ingredient is mineral oil.</li>
            <li> like the good sized jar</li>
            <li> I give 5 stars . It work perfectly on my skin. I am very happy with this advanced clinicals retinol cream.</li>
            <li> The coolness and smoothness is really great to put on my face. It feels so good for my face.  It makes me feel so comfortable after I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and I&#x27;m so glad that I purchased it because my face is clearing up mighty fast. Thank you, Amazon!</li>
            <li> I received a completely different bottle than what is pictured. I did not like that and this did not work for me at all!</li>
            <li> If you are a fan of Retinol, this is probably the best you will find. I have tried several brands and this one is, by far, the best out there. It does not burn like the others do. I made the mistake of putting it on, head to toe, right after a hot bath, then went to bed. It has a very tremendous tightening effect and I felt like my skin was squeezing me. That tells me it will tighten up wrinkles on the face and such. I will not apply all over anymore. Honestly, to me, Retinol seems to dry out my skin. I very much prefer the Argan Oil, sold by this same company. It is amazing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $$$$ on more expensive products if you just want to see results.&lt;br /&gt;This sits on my counter &amp; the pump handle makes it easy to use frequently on face, neck, &amp; the often-missed d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;. My skin feels like silk. The AHA works best alternated with a plumping or hydrating serum or non-hyalonuric product. Love this, &amp; REALLY love the closed system &amp; pump handle, much more hygienic than dipping fingers into jars.</li>
            <li> Wonderful price - wonderful product.  My skin looks fabulous and since the retinol is lower in the ingredients, it is gentle enough to use for daytime as well as evening.</li>
            <li> I thought that this was too good to be true, given the value of buying this cream, but I used it on the back of my hands to test it and I saw a reduction in age spots from just three uses.  It is not greasy and absorbs right away.  So far I am pleased with this purchase and with Prime, I got it the day after I ordered it!  The first time I bought this it was about $15, now it is triple that!?  This stuff is good, but wow!  I will not buy it again, if the price stays the same.  Sorry, but don&#x27;t be greedy!</li>
            <li> Like this stuff, like the pump, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, wear it at night and remember to wash it off before heading out the next day</li>
            <li> Creates a great facial moisture-shield.  Softens my skin on both face and neck.  Will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> use it everyday and now noticed some improved changes.  Great value</li>
            <li> Works great softens and smooths dry rough skin</li>
            <li> OMG...great stuff!!  Price is phenomenal.  fast deliveryl</li>
            <li> feels nice,doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky or oily  and does help the appearance of your skin if you use it everyday..nice size for the price..</li>
            <li> Came so quick two days and also a lil free gift!....great birthday eve gift...Thank You!!!</li>
            <li> Very creamy .. sinks in quickly..  Love it !!!</li>
            <li> Feels great, no greasy or oily residue, soak right in and just feels wonderful.  No strong scent and great price.  Love this product and will continue to use and great price too.  Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I am thirty three years old and had recently noticed some fine lines appearing around my mouth and on my forehead. I read the reviews on this product and decided to try it. I purchased it early November 2014 have used it at least once a day for the most part.For the past ten years  I have used Clinique makeup and their dramatically different moisturizing lotion in the morning but at night I use this instead. I have not noticed any firming but the fine lines seem to be melting away...I use a sheer makeup because I like the natural look and this lotion compliments my foundation. My skin usually looks just washed. I read a review about this product somewhere that it takes about sixty days to see a difference and I would have to agree. I recommend this product to anyone looking to reduce those early signs that you see creeping up on you. I know everyone&#x27;s skin conditions is different and I realize that this may not work for everyone but it seems to be working for me.. God Bless!!</li>
            <li> Just received it but I am giving it 3 stars because it arrived broken, the dispenser and some cream in the box. I&#x27;ll post again after I start using</li>
            <li> This cream is AMAZING!  I&#x27;ve used it for cellulite on my hip area and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  I never thought to use it as a moisturizer for my hands and face, for some reason.  My hands were like sandpaper, and I&#x27;ve tried countless lotions, all to no effect whatsoever.  Some even made the dryness worse.  It was so bad that I&#x27;ve had a permanent crack on one hand, and I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of wrinkles on my fingers and the back of my hands from all the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I figured I had nothing to lose.  The FIRST time I used it, the wrinkles on my hands were totally GONE!  After a few days, my fingers are beginning to look better as well. I don&#x27;t know why it doesn&#x27;t moisturize for some people... my hands have never been so soft, and I don&#x27;t need to use much.  It&#x27;s not greasy at all and soaks in easily, and there is the slightest fragrance which I can&#x27;t even smell unless I put my hand up to my nose.  I&#x27;ve begun to use it on my face, and after only 2 days, I noticed that wrinkles already subsiding.  I can&#x27;t even smell it when it&#x27;s on my face, which is great, as I&#x27;m quite sensitive to scents.  This stuff is INCREDIBLE, and I&#x27;ll never be without it again.  I just hope they never change the formula to \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; like so many other products, which really ruins the product.  10 stars for this!!!</li>
            <li> pump does not work so I have to open entire tub every time .</li>
            <li> I think it might have done something?</li>
            <li> I had alot of sun damage on my face and hands and within a week or so it is about 80% gone.  I could hardly believe it.  Well worth the purchase</li>
            <li> My son is using this and the Advanced Clinicals AHA for pilaris keratosis.  After only a few nights his skin is already clearer.</li>
            <li> arrived on the day you said it would. I will be ordering again!! thank you</li>
            <li> Really like this Retinol cream.</li>
            <li> i love that it practially has no smell. i have sentive skin so a lot of products out there just irretate my skin or  dry it out. This hasn&#x27;t done that. Will be buying more oce i run out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much different. Just so so for me. Maybe it will work for you but not for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Retinol Advanced Firming Cream for several weeks on my face and neck. After the first three weeks there was a noticeable improvement in the tone, texture and smoothness of my skin. With constant use twice daily, I have seen a remarkable overall rejuvenation of my skin and others have commented on this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am very satisfied with the results and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone. In my opinion this product holds its own very well when compared with other well known and more expensive brands. I recommend for best results that it should be used consistently. However, like other products of this nature I would avoid using the product over or very close to the eyes. I am extremely happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M. Lewis</li>
            <li> Nice product,fast delivery</li>
            <li> I love this cream! Been using it on my thighs and butt for over a month and am seeing smoother, less bumpy skin. Just ordered my 2nd tub. Best price I have found online too!</li>
            <li> it is exactly what i ordered and will be ordering more.  i was looking for a product that would firm my skin.</li>
            <li> normal everyday lotion nothing special and full of chemicals</li>
            <li> I use this on my arms and legs, has lighted up a few dark spots and moisturizes my skin better than any moisturizer I&#x27;ve used.  Need to wear sun screen with it thought if out in the sun. Has also helped smooth wrinkles in my upper arms.</li>
            <li> This may seem a little pricey for some people however comparing this to other retinol products that are $8.00 for a 2oz jar! You&#x27;ll realize that this is a really good price for 16oz. About the cream itself, my left hand was extremely dry! It was so dry my skin cracked and I had an ugly cut on the back of my hand. Any lotion or cream I would apply to my hand would only irritate my skin and moisturize for only a few minutes. I even tried using coconut oil and did not work. I had already been using this Retinol for my face however I had not thought about using it on my hands. So one day I applied a fair amount on my hands and my dried, cracked skin and cut healed in just a few days and I did not have to keep reapplying it to keep my hand moisturized. I would definitely recommend this product! My mom has also been using this and she says that her wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> i dont write reviews (unless something is TERRIBLE) and i dont swear by any specific product but this ish changed ALL of that! i am 30 and wear no makeup and ppl can never believe it and i attribute it to this stuff... i live in FL where we have a discount store that you can get it for 4.99 in! i buy ALL of it everytime they have some in stock. i also use the coconut oil one and alphy hydroxy one on my body and ur skin will NEVER feel or look better! why does the world not know about this stuff? im happy they dont bc it would be A LOT more expensive if they did!</li>
            <li> Excellent. Enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Very nice cream. I use it twice daily. Keeps my skin so soft and I swear stretch marks on my stomach are smoother too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any significant improvement yet after two weeks of daily application maybe too early to see that. Maybe  I&#x27;ll see the difference if I use the whole jar otherwise I will try another product..</li>
            <li> Love this product! Will buy again</li>
            <li> A great cream but it didn&#x27;t do what I read about. Don&#x27;t even mention Retinol on the jar, and don&#x27;t do a thing for dark spots. Won&#x27;t be back for more.</li>
            <li> Loving this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> It was every thing I wanted I loved it thank you the price was good yes I&#x27;d order it again</li>
            <li> This is a very nice cream contained in an excellent pump dispenser.  Very easy to use and absorbs rapidly into your skin with no stickiness after application.  I use it on my face, arms and legs after a shower and when not going to be out in the sun.  Very good product.  Results are yet to be seen.</li>
            <li> Just started using but my skin feels softer...</li>
            <li> Great stuff, it took a little time to get it in the mail, but the product is excellent, thank you!</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting more after reading some of the reviews.  The quality is not bad but not worth the price.  Nivea lotion works just as well at a lower cost.</li>
            <li> Love this cream, not greasy, no fragrance to clash with your perfume! Will order again! I see a little important in skin, only been using it for 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> this cream really does help the cellulite go away, you just need some patience it really does work.</li>
            <li> This is well worth buying..I have stopped purchasing the high end products because of their price and disappointing results.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, excellent service. Thanks</li>
            <li> I broke out in a rash and had to stop using it</li>
            <li> I was blinded by excellent price and good (on average) reviews. I totally missed the most important part: the list of fully disclosed ingredients which started with water and had mineral oil as a 2d ingredient with Retinol as 11th. I was so thrilled by other excellent ingredients and NO PARABENS that I went for it and have no one to blame for. Mineral oil creates an artificial film over the skin sealing it in, which yes, helps to retain moisture but at a price of not allowing it to breathe much, not unlike its father product: oil is spilled into the ocean from defective oil drilling - you have heard on the news what it does to sea life. It is widely used in concentrated form as petroleum jelly form and has some appropriate uses but if you are a purist you&#x27;d go for something more natural like bees-wax. Anyway, choice is yours. I will not reorder this product for this reason alone unless the company substitutes mineral oil for a more natural moisture sealant in the future. I am debating buying another product from them I had an eye on until I see the full ingredient list. I am not a purist but do NOt want MINERAL OIL IN MY SKINCARE, no thank you</li>
            <li> So Far so good, I never used this product but i give it a four rating because it adds  smoothness to the legs and its very light.&lt;br /&gt;Pump the jar one time and its good for the top leg pump the jar one time and its good for the bottom part of your leg. a small amount comes out and takes care of a large peice of you body. Makes a very smooth feel on legs and body. etc.</li>
            <li> Seen it somewhere else for half the price.</li>
            <li> Works well. Skin looks younger and smooth, plump.</li>
            <li> Upon searching for RoC brand Retinol BB Cream, this item appeared in Amazon. Since it was a fraction of the cost of the RoC brand for a much larger quantity I thought why not give it a try? It&#x27;s not quite like RoC in terms of quality but it&#x27;s a mediocre substitute for those in a financial pinch looking to cut corners. Of all things, this works great for reducing stretch marks. It&#x27;s not greasy and has no fragrance.</li>
            <li> This lotion feels great when you put it on. A little bit goes a long ways. Not sure on the long term effects yet since I&#x27;ve only used for a few days. The only issue I had was the pump was messed up and wouldn&#x27;t pump so I had to scoop lotion out of container. I contacted Amazon and they replaced the lotion without any problems.</li>
            <li> This retinol firming cream nothing. I don&#x27;t believe there is very much retinol in this cream. I have used perscription retinol before and the consistency of this feels nothing like retinol. It feels more like a thick lotion. I could have gotten the same results from a cheap bottle of drug store facial cold cream.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I picked up eczema from a medication allergy. What a horrible thing to get. BUT, this stuff kills it for me. Within a day or two the symptoms are gone. Steroids take weeks and thin your skin. My skin was so thin it was spitting open. So, I am very thankful to find this stuff is so effective at ending the symptoms. Did not expect this. This should be a very important find for some eczema sufferers. Great wrinkle cream too!</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product and over time the results are observed</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF AND I WILL BUY IT AGAIN!!!</li>
            <li> this is a good product I have noticed some changes will give it another month</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  It&#x27;s changed the texture and tone of my skin after a week of using it.  Highly recommend it and have bought it again!</li>
            <li> So this is a premature review because I&#x27;ve only had this product for twI weeks. But in two weeks this stuff has done amazing!!! I have been applying it everywhere especially in scars and my face. I have oily skin so I never wear moisturizer or lotion on by face but this stuff doesn&#x27;t make me break out or make my face even oilier! After the first use, when I woke up the next morning my face was THEE SOFTEST it has ever been! I just kept rubbing by face because the smoothness was unbelievable! Until I noticed my fiance looking at me like I had twI heads! Lol And in two weeks the scars in my arm (new scars roughly 1 month old from my dog before he learned to quit jumping) have almost disappeared entirely! I have to look first them when I apply this lotion every night! Would I don&#x27;t doubt that this stuff can get rid of scars! U will update when more time has passed. Also I suggest to only use this are night because it hasthe potential in the presence of sun to develop Tumors! Or atleast that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been reading lately (about Retinal A not specifically this product). I also hope this helps firm some problem areas. But when it comes to cellulite or wrinkles, sorry ladies, I am only 24, I don&#x27;t suffer from those two... yet (on the wrinkles)! Haha&lt;br /&gt;I hope this does help in your decision. I would recommend this, in fact I have already suggested this to my Mother in Law and my Mom!&lt;br /&gt;Check back around May/June for updates.&lt;br /&gt;Ashley H.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I used this after using my Derma Roller for the first time Saturday night and my skin felt and looked great the very next day! It appeared &amp;#34;clearer&amp;#34;! I have really uneven skin. And it did wonders when penetrating try the skin on a deeper level! Or maybe I just wanted to see a difference so badly, I imagined it! ;)</li>
            <li> I was disappointed, was hoping this would do the trick with my dry skin. It feels good on the skin but not enough moisture and my skin was still crapey. : (</li>
            <li> Ok I have used pretty much the full jar over the winter.  This is what I found.  The cream is pleasant and feels hydrating when you put it on.   I was getting patchy redness  but nothing bad that couldn&#x27;t be covered up with makeup.   The key to this stuff is to use it then take a break and allow the effects of this cream to really show.   My skin looks even toned and smooth,  and the wrinkles on my forehead aren&#x27;t as deep.   Use this, stick it out, and don&#x27;t give up on it.  If you get mild  patchy redness, its part of the process.   I will get another jar and another...</li>
            <li> Nice feel and no funny smell, I&#x27;ll repurchase for those reasons.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this cream</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t be using this because it must be a little too harsh for my skin. Had a different brand before and it must have been a different formula. Tried this for about 3 weeks but my skin never adjusted and was irritated, but I do have sensitive skin. Will just sit in my cupboard now!</li>
            <li> my wife loves it so far seems to be working thanks</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t or haven&#x27;t seen any results, so I stopped using it....</li>
            <li> Not sure about the actual effects yet, but I use it every other day, I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it. I think it is a good deal just compared with other creams $$ tags.</li>
            <li> This cream didn&#x27;t do any of the above it said it would do..there&#x27;s no retinol in this cream at all.</li>
            <li> Really have to use a very good cleanser, recommend a glycerine bar from a feel-rite health store. It&#x27;s a clear bar unwrapped and costs all of bout $2.50</li>
            <li> I liked this product a lot. Seemed to help with my aging skin and made it soft and supple!</li>
            <li> Nice alternative for a good winter moisturizer.  I use it only at night and it makes my skin soft in the morning and I can tell a difference in how much nicer my skin looks when I use it.  You do, however, need to use it every day for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> Retinol creams tend to be incredibly expensive. This stuff is inexpensive and works beautifully, and you get a heck of alot for money - who knew??!!</li>
            <li> I use this twice daily with my trouble spots, so I will see what the results are like and hope it minimizes my trouble ares.</li>
            <li> I was upset when I saw this same size jar at regular beauty store for less than $5.00... It&#x27;s just lotion .. Doesn&#x27;t do any difference .. Not enough retinol in it ...</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Have tried many retinol products and they&#x27;re either overpriced or just don&#x27;t work.  This moisturizes well for my oily skin and my pores are diminishing day by day.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff made my face so clear I don&#x27;t even have to wear makeup! It erased all my blemishes and dark spots. I&#x27;m really surprised with the outcome. Love this stuff something I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Works good. It is priced great for the results.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  The container is much larger than it looks in the picture.  You get more product than expected!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Thus far I don&#x27;t see any change since using the product but will keep trying.</li>
            <li> I used this as a night cream to reduce sun damage from my exposed areas (face, neck, arms, chest) since I am outdoors a lot. I am dark-skinned (Filipino) but living under the intense Hawaiian sun and I am not taking any chances with skin cancer or premature wrinkles. As practice, I will rinse off this cream and put on sunblock when I hit the outdoors, since in my experience (and contrary to other reports) Retinol really does make your skin suceptable to sunburn. I suffered a mean one to my face and ears when I went kayaking on day and forgot to put sunblock on, and considering how thin the skin is under the eyes, it immediately resulted in MORE wrinkles and lines! My skin took a good few weeks to get back to normal again. I have never suffered such a severe sunburn before I started using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this particular Retinol cream does work. Maybe with the help of my genes, diet, and exercise, but my peers always comment how young I still look, and I like to think that Retinol has helped. this big tub of Retinol cream is cheap and lasts for a couple years the way I use it (just one pump quarter-sized dollop of cream is enough to cover my face and neck). I usually apply it right after I shower in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I recommend this? Try it and see if it works for you. It took a few months before I started seeing results.</li>
            <li> im.a 54 yr old male with dull ,tired looking skin. this stuff does nothing .it seems to age my face skin even more. thick goop. look how much u get, a large tub. look at the low cost. red flag went up. hello????</li>
            <li> This product is worth a LOT more than you pay for it!  We have used this as well as much more expensive retinol - this was the same, if not maybe even better!</li>
            <li> I love this cream, its works great</li>
            <li> This product works well on old scars and stretch marks. I saw 50% difference after two weeks.   UPDATE: Today is April 23rd 2016 and I love this product! My stretch marks on my tummy is now 90% gone. I applied this lotion to my skin four times a week. Then I would let my skin rest for a month then reply four times a week every other month. The retinal in this lotion is no joke. It burns but not redo cultus. You will notice your skin start to peel and then your stretch marks will start to shrink. I&#x27;m a no b.s. Type of person. This product right here works. Period. Point. Blank.for the best results use this product after you take a shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 20s, sensitive, combo skin and really no wrinkles. I just need a retinol cream to perserve my skin and keep wrinkles and whatnot at bay for as long as I can. This product is great, the amount you get for the price is unbeatable. I&#x27;ve used $100 retinol creams and this is just as good. Again, I&#x27;m virtually wrinkle free so I can&#x27;t really comment on how well this product will work as of now, only time will tell. (Hence my 4 star rating as I don&#x27;t know how effect the cream really is). In the meantime, I like it. It&#x27;s smack dap in the middle of light weight and heavy, which is perfect for me. Considering I use it at night(and you should only use it at night, NEVER during the day), it absorbs nicely(I wait at least 30 mins for it to fully absorbs before going to bed) and leaves my face feeling soft in the morning. I also occasionally use it on my hands. There&#x27;s really no frangrance, just smells like lotion to me. All and all, very pleased, especially with the price.</li>
            <li> Very good Ã­tem thanks</li>
            <li> I use this product along with a massage roller which I purchased through Amazon also.  This is a thick cream and I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the results!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It is so affordable, that I wasn&#x27;t expecting such quality. Can&#x27;t recommend it enough. See results after first use.</li>
            <li> It dosen&#x27;t even have Retinol in the ingredients. Wont boy again.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought this. So far, so good. Not greasy at all and absorbs into my skin really well.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for getting rid of stretch marks!</li>
            <li> This product is very poor. I&#x27;ve used other retinol products in the past that make my skin silky smooth almost instant. This product does not make my skin smooth or feel like it makes any difference at all. I used it about a month and nothing changed from before I started using it.</li>
            <li> Did not do anything for me</li>
            <li> Made my face red and broke out with pimples. I am a woman in my 50&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> With consistent use, you can definitely see a difference. Consistency is key. My thighs look more toned than ever. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to other reviewers claiming this doesn&#x27;t have retinol. It absolutely does! I do NOT sunburn and I got a second degree burn after using this a few weeks before I went to the beach. I&#x27;m not kidding. Again, I do not burn. So, be certain you will be getting retinol in your lotion, lol. I love it (not the sunburn).</li>
            <li> This makes me break out using it all by itself.  I have to use it with my moisturizer and can not use it every day.  I am not going to give this product a bad review because I have sensitive skin.  I would though say if you have sensitive to not use it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It is not fast, but does work. It also keeps the skin moistrized.</li>
            <li> This is a &amp;#34;numero uno &amp;#34;product...excellent!!!</li>
            <li> This works great! I use it for a body lotion to decrease the look of cellulite. I tried it for a few months and noticed a difference. I also increased my workouts at the same time so initially I was not sure how much it worked. When I ran out of it and tried just regular lotion; the difference was obvious. The biggest improvement came with I coupled this with Body Merry Cellulite cream (http://amazon.com/gp/product/B00N4UXI6G/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_5). I use Body Merry every morning after my bath and Advanced Clinicals every night before bed.</li>
            <li> Use it on a daily basis, see the difference.  Will buy another when this one finishes.</li>
