            <li>this wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>The shipping itself wasn&#x27;t perfect because when I got the product some soap had leaked out</li>
            <li>This stuff is great!</li>
            <li>What a great find!!</li>
            <li>This is the best face wash of all time.</li>
            <li>the Johnathan shower filter is very good !</li>
            <li>Best face wash ever.</li>
            <li>This product is so AMAZING!!!  </li>
            <li>what a great product!</li>
            <li>great on skin</li>
            <li>Even the price is great for &amp;#34;fixed income&amp;#34; people.</li>
            <li>This is a great cleansing wash that my wife&#x27;s dermatologist recommended.</li>
            <li>I wish I had tried this stuff sooner, my skin is finally happy.  </li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a great cleanser for the price</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t have acne, this Purpose cleanser does a great job of removing dirt and grease from my face.</li>
            <li>This is a great skin cleanser and moisterizer.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser is amazing!</li>
            <li>I also sometimes use Aveeno moisturizer with it afterwards but Purpose is still good by itself.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a smell at all, and it seems like a good product.</li>
            <li>I have problem skin so this is not the product for me, not that it isn&#x27;t a good product</li>
            <li>its a good product.</li>
            <li>but this is a good face wash..</li>
            <li>good~</li>
            <li>This is so good at removing makeup that it even removes mascara that has been reapplied throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am glad I did!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Within one day of using this cleanser, my skin already looked and felt much better!</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I stumbled across the reviews of this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I absoloutely love this face wash!</li>
            <li>Purchased a bottle of Purpose after a friends recommendation, and I love it!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I probably have.    </li>
            <li>I really liked this product in the beginning.</li>
            <li>This honestly changed my life.</li>
            <li>We both like it, nice price will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>Thorough cleanser that never over-dries or damages my skin and is even effective on eye makeup.</li>
            <li>Can be counted on as a superb cleanser that leaves no unnecessary residue.</li>
            <li>It is very good at cleaning but also quite gentle.</li>
            <li>The best face wash for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>However, if I couldn&#x27;t get the bar, this would do just fine!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and effective.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I decided to do research on the best facial wash out there and discovered Purpose</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure someone explain why this works.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I gave it a chance cause it is so INEXPENSIVE</li>
            <li>I have learned that keeping it simple is always the best route.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of using an acne scrub that&#x27;s probably more meant for teens than 30 year olds</li>
            <li>love cleaning wash called Purpose</li>
            <li>I just wish the company had of secured the bottle more to keep it from leaking.</li>
            <li>I have tried this more than once over the years since it has been recommended to me by doctors</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It also does a great job of cleansing, not just being gentle.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a breakout in ages (since I began using this product), and I recommend it to all of my friends who also love it.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t compare, but I am satisfied with Purpose.</li>
            <li>My favorite face wash.&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE this face wash.  </li>
            <li>slightly more soapy-smelling and skin-drying than moisturel, but</li>
            <li>and I can see why people love to use it for treating acne and what-not.</li>
            <li>Just make sure that you, and I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying this, \\&quot;exfoliate.\\</li>
            <li>and most people moisturize anyway after cleansing.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is also very nice and the cleanser itself is gentle.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice lather and rinses clean.</li>
            <li>Your face does feel very, very clean after you use it.</li>
            <li>and is super effective.  </li>
            <li>It really is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Shipped to your door free makes it an even better deal.</li>
            <li>Unscented and great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Many keep my face smooth by leaving something on it which I don&#x27;t appreciate.</li>
            <li>love this product, its efficient and makes me feel clean without drying out my skin</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>pricing is really quite good and just about as cheap as a big-box store.</li>
            <li>my skin don;t have a wrinkle in sight, my pores are fine and no blackheads use with the purpose moisturizing cream w/spf15.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for me because I need to keep my face very clean because of my seborrhea, but I don&#x27;t want to dry it out too much because of my psoriasis....</li>
            <li>I may use this as a backup, but I don&#x27;t think I would use it as my primary face wash.</li>
            <li>I still put on some light oil-free SPF 15 lotion for my face, though.    </li>
            <li>This stuff while inexpensive and without any fancy scents or skin reactions (like cooling or warming) is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I cleanse with Purpose twice a day and follow it with a light moisturizer in the am, retinol moisturizer in the pm.</li>
            <li>No fragrances, gentle, and simply amazing.</li>
            <li>Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash is the best facial cleanser that I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>and Purpose isn&#x27;t working as effectively and as quickly as it did when I first got it.</li>
            <li>it keeps my face clean and</li>
            <li>and plus dry skin just isn&#x27;t that attractive or</li>
            <li>When I want to clean</li>
            <li>Felt my face more pure and shiny</li>
            <li>Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash was one of the most recommended cleansers.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s gentle, I&#x27;m able to use spot treatment during breakouts without overdrying.</li>
            <li>and it is just so simple that your skin feels really good.</li>
            <li>Purpose just keeps my skin perfectly soft &amp; blemish free :) it smells like johnsons baby shampoo, the yellow kind!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>it makes your skin feel so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Before i discovered this product, i had mild acne.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;rinses quickly and completely&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily it comes in a plastic bag</li>
            <li>This soap is good for my skin does not dry it out or make me break out - very gentle</li>
            <li>It does kind of clean the skin, but I was left with flakey skin even AFTER I put on moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my drier spots, and it does a good job of clearing up the oil slicks.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a lite scent soap free perfect for you if you have sensitive skin or acne prone skin it washes off makeup and is a perfect size if you&#x27;re curious it&#x27;s not to small not to big</li>
            <li>It washes off easily, leaving behind some kind of light moisturizing feel that is quite refreshing.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that has cleared up my skin&#x27;s dryness and peeling, I use this in combination with a Bioelemt&#x27;s brand moisturizer and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even tried the 300 dollar Le Mar creme and found it not being useful.</li>
            <li>Like many of the other reviews that have mentioned it here, this cleansing wash is a great alternative to those who have skin that dries easily or have tried other skin care products that are based on salicylic acid to no avail.    </li>
            <li>My instinct was right</li>
            <li>Normally Amazon is great with shipping, but my product arrived in a plastic bag, and it had leaked like other reviewers.</li>
            <li>This is the best facial cleanser for people with normal to dry OR combination skin.</li>
            <li>I use it around my eyes and it is gentle, yet effective enough to remove eye make up.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser is very gentle.</li>
            <li>The bottle arrived very fast, and it started clearing my skin in just 2 days.</li>
            <li>It is a very gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and lathers well.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to calm, but still leave my sensitive skin clean, as what I was using for the colder months was startign to leave my skin too oily.</li>
            <li>After just using Purpose for about a week, you can&#x27;t even tell that I had much of anything on my forehead!  </li>
            <li>Most everything I put on will piss off my skin and flares up and turns red.</li>
            <li>This product claims to be \\&quot;soap-free\\&quot; and when applied to a wet face works nicely up into a lather.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you the number of products I have tried just to go back and rinse my face again just to make it feel better.  </li>
            <li>I love this product but when my last shipment arrived the bottle had leaked.</li>
            <li>But I will say that when I first started using it, my skin became really clear and pimple free.  </li>
            <li>but first I was to wash my face with Purpose and nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;Within</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this for the nervous and curious people who aren&#x27;t sure if they want to buy this face wash because they have sensitive skin like me :)</li>
            <li>so let me tell you 3 really good face washes for those who want beautiful skin but have sensitive skin and are tired of trying things because I&#x27;ve tried everything Purity made simple facial cleansing gel thats a favorite  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the Purpose Wash.</li>
            <li>I love how simple this product is.</li>
            <li>&quot; I&#x27;m giving it four stars because it does exactly what it says and at around 5 bucks, heck, how can anyone complain?</li>
            <li>It is ideal as a face wash because it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin after using it the way some astringent washes do, leaving your skin scaly or rough.</li>
            <li>The price was cheaper than stores, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it because it looks like I lost a decent amount from the shipping..</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend Clean and Clear&#x27;s Blackhead Eraser Scrub.</li>
            <li>While pregnant you&#x27;re supposed to avoid many typical acne treatments and Purpose has none of them</li>
            <li>sure there are other products that work, but this one is the right price.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this, my few breakouts have been more mild and cleared up quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty decent delivery time.</li>
            <li>Works very well, it really is add gentle as water.</li>
            <li>that I can readily see after the 1 week of use.</li>
            <li>Gentle Cleansing Wash.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Everyone has different skin, so it&#x27;s important to look for the one that works for you.    </li>
            <li>It really works well for my acne.</li>
            <li>Unless you really want to save twenty or thirty cents, get it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>My skin type is combination and very acne prone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, non-irritating, cleanses very well, and smells good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked really well for me</li>
            <li>I still need to moisturize afterwards, but this product is really gentle on skin</li>
            <li>and I had to wash the bottle off, but there wasn&#x27;t too much lost that way</li>
            <li>Removes makeup and is gentle.</li>
            <li>All Purpose and Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser I read on the bottle not the one at the store but the one on Amazon because the one at the store is made by another company</li>
            <li>This gentle cleanser did not irritate my face after shaving.  </li>
            <li>This one not only clean and gentle enough, it RINSED OFF easily.</li>
            <li>I also use Queen Helens mud mask and the green one for acne, Manuka Honey for a mask to help my scars, and witch hazel with rose hips in it for my toner.</li>
            <li>However, I feel like I get more breakouts using this product than with other products.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve started to see blemishes appear again, but there are so many other variables that could be contributing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Remedy: I&#x27;ve used a TON of products to try to even out my skin tone, calm down the irritation and smooth things out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what kind of skin condition I have</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you have more sensitive skin and need a face wash that doesn&#x27;t completely dry you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this is how it helps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Symptoms: Super scaly, flakey facial skin around eyebrows, nose and forehead.</li>
            <li>so no serious complaints with that, either.</li>
            <li>It does not dry the face and leaves the skin feedling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and I wanted a cleanser that would effectively clean my skin, but not dry it out.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if it is the fragrance which is very pleasant or another ingredient or really bad luck, but I am putting this out here since it gets such great reviews.  </li>
            <li>I have been battling blemishes and acne ever since high school.  </li>
            <li>You can also follow up with some Rosewater Toner from Burt&#x27;s and Bee&#x27;s, and for moisture, add Pond&#x27;s moisturizer, it&#x27;ll certainly give you clear skin, rather than use this junk.</li>
            <li>I was tempted to go buy a new cleanser like cetaphil or cerve</li>
            <li>Anytime I&#x27;ve tried a new cleanser it never works as well as this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe that my prescription products contributed to clear skin at all or rarely but using this face wash has made that big difference.</li>
            <li>I was undergoing radiation treatment and they told me I could only use a very gentle soap while being treated.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It also helps clear up my acne too!</li>
            <li>I sent back the first one thinking</li>
            <li>but second one came just like the first one...  </li>
            <li>Something in it , I believe, breaks me out more than usual.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different facial washes before and this is the only one I&#x27;ll use from now on.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin that has always dried out easily, especially when using any kind of non-moisturizing soap.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s only about six ingredients in this compared to all the weird-named chemicals in Cetaphils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this for ONE MONTH, my skin has pretty much completely cleared up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a male in my early 20&#x27;s, and I&#x27;ve been battling mild acne and blemishes since I was a teen.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t keeping my face as clear as I wanted</li>
            <li>I had a severe breakout on my forehead and nothing would help clear it up.  </li>
            <li>I found this stuff thanks to a friend with great skin and was shocked to see the affordable price tag, so I tried it.</li>
            <li>It kept my skin clear for weeks.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft after using it.</li>
            <li>DRYOUT and leaves the skin soft, moiturized with a glow.</li>
            <li>It is extremely gentle yet it has cleared up my face entirely of blemishes.</li>
            <li>and then I will apply a facial moisturizer 10-15 minutes after cleaning my face with Purpose Gentle.</li>
            <li>I am 72 years old and have been looking for a cleansing face wash that didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling like there was still soap on it.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and I&#x27;ve seen a drastic decrease in my acne in about 5 days.</li>
            <li>but i DO have really sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin that reacts to almost every product I have tried.</li>
            <li>Completely cleans off oil and makeup without drying.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin you must try this.  </li>
            <li>My face is soft and smooth and I can even see it after a few days.  </li>
            <li>a little isn&#x27;t a problem, but it was a bit of a bummer to received it that way and have to clean it up when I took it out of the package.</li>
            <li>Thanks, J&amp;J for keeping [[ASIN:B0011Z3X66 Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash - 6 Oz]] on the market long enough for me to discover it.</li>
            <li>I used it once or twice a day everyday and saw a significant improvement.  </li>
            <li>It works as expected, lathers well, is very gentle to my skin, and cleanses my face well, and rinses well without drying my skin.</li>
            <li>Finally, a cleanser that doesn&#x27;t irritate my combination skin and really leaves my face feeling clean rather than dried out!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive but oil-prone skin (only break out ocassionally), so I asked around for something that would be gentle, but still cleanse enough.</li>
            <li>It started like normal, in middle school</li>
            <li>That said, I&#x27;m one satisfied customer and recommend it to folks who have had no success with other mainstream cleansers.</li>
            <li>I have some acne especially on my chin, and I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll see something new in the store and wanna try it out, but always come back to purpose...</li>
            <li>This one is gentle on my non-teenager face and doesn&#x27;t severely dry it out either.</li>
            <li>It cleans my very combination skin well, minimizes the appears of nose pores, minimizes breakouts and it doesnt dry my skin.</li>
            <li>this was the first cleanser I found that was gentle enough to use everyday.</li>
            <li>My face is soooo sensitive to products and I cannot use soap or my nose gets all peely and gross.</li>
            <li>BUT nothing a little moisturizer afterwards doesn&#x27;t fix right up</li>
            <li>Make sure you try it for a few weeks because it may take a little while for you to notice its effects.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I can only find positive things to say about this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Your skin actually feels cleaner after, and it does not have any scents which I believe benefit acne prone/ white head prone and sensitive skin; that is what I have.</li>
            <li>As a side note, I am pregnant and have been looking for something gentle yet effective to deal with my pregnancy-related breakouts (which have been awful!).</li>
            <li>I have Seborrheic dermatitis and Rosacea, so my skin is very sensitive and dry.</li>
            <li>Use it with lukewarm water to open up the pores enough to clean thoroughly, but not hot enough to leave your skin dry.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and leaves my face feeling SO soft!  </li>
            <li>I mean CLEAN.</li>
            <li>I bought this at target and the first few days I did not think it was working.</li>
            <li>I started off using this everyday for the first month or so</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is the BEST face cleanser I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> and now I use it every 2-3 days and my skin looks flawless.</li>
            <li> this wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> The shipping itself wasn&#x27;t perfect because when I got the product some soap had leaked out</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> What a great find!!</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash of all time.</li>

            <li> This is a great cleansing wash that my wife&#x27;s dermatologist recommended.</li>
            <li> I wish I had tried this stuff sooner, my skin is finally happy.  </li>
            <li> LOL</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a great cleanser for the price</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t have acne, this Purpose cleanser does a great job of removing dirt and grease from my face.</li>
            <li> This is a great skin cleanser and moisterizer.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser is amazing!</li>
            <li> I also sometimes use Aveeno moisturizer with it afterwards but Purpose is still good by itself.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a smell at all, and it seems like a good product.</li>
            <li> I have problem skin so this is not the product for me, not that it isn&#x27;t a good product</li>
            <li> its a good product.</li>
            <li> but this is a good face wash..</li>
            <li> good~</li>
            <li> This is so good at removing makeup that it even removes mascara that has been reapplied throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Within one day of using this cleanser, my skin already looked and felt much better!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I stumbled across the reviews of this product!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I absoloutely love this face wash!</li>
            <li> Purchased a bottle of Purpose after a friends recommendation, and I love it!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I probably have.    </li>
            <li> I really liked this product in the beginning.</li>
            <li> This honestly changed my life.</li>
            <li> We both like it, nice price will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Thorough cleanser that never over-dries or damages my skin and is even effective on eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Can be counted on as a superb cleanser that leaves no unnecessary residue.</li>
            <li> It is very good at cleaning but also quite gentle.</li>
            <li> The best face wash for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> However, if I couldn&#x27;t get the bar, this would do just fine!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and effective.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I decided to do research on the best facial wash out there and discovered Purpose</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure someone explain why this works.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I gave it a chance cause it is so INEXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> I have learned that keeping it simple is always the best route.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of using an acne scrub that&#x27;s probably more meant for teens than 30 year olds</li>
            <li> love cleaning wash called Purpose</li>
            <li> I just wish the company had of secured the bottle more to keep it from leaking.</li>
            <li> I have tried this more than once over the years since it has been recommended to me by doctors</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> It also does a great job of cleansing, not just being gentle.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a breakout in ages (since I began using this product), and I recommend it to all of my friends who also love it.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare, but I am satisfied with Purpose.</li>
            <li> My favorite face wash.&lt;br</li>
            <li> LOVE this face wash.  </li>
            <li> slightly more soapy-smelling and skin-drying than moisturel, but</li>
            <li> and I can see why people love to use it for treating acne and what-not.</li>
            <li> Just make sure that you, and I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying this, \\&quot;exfoliate.\\</li>
            <li> and most people moisturize anyway after cleansing.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is also very nice and the cleanser itself is gentle.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice lather and rinses clean.</li>
            <li> Your face does feel very, very clean after you use it.</li>
            <li> and is super effective.  </li>
            <li> It really is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Shipped to your door free makes it an even better deal.</li>
            <li> Unscented and great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Many keep my face smooth by leaving something on it which I don&#x27;t appreciate.</li>
            <li> love this product, its efficient and makes me feel clean without drying out my skin</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> pricing is really quite good and just about as cheap as a big-box store.</li>
            <li> my skin don;t have a wrinkle in sight, my pores are fine and no blackheads use with the purpose moisturizing cream w/spf15.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for me because I need to keep my face very clean because of my seborrhea, but I don&#x27;t want to dry it out too much because of my psoriasis....</li>
            <li> I may use this as a backup, but I don&#x27;t think I would use it as my primary face wash.</li>
            <li> I still put on some light oil-free SPF 15 lotion for my face, though.    </li>
            <li> This stuff while inexpensive and without any fancy scents or skin reactions (like cooling or warming) is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I cleanse with Purpose twice a day and follow it with a light moisturizer in the am, retinol moisturizer in the pm.</li>
            <li> No fragrances, gentle, and simply amazing.</li>
            <li> Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash is the best facial cleanser that I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> and Purpose isn&#x27;t working as effectively and as quickly as it did when I first got it.</li>
            <li> it keeps my face clean and</li>
            <li> and plus dry skin just isn&#x27;t that attractive or</li>
            <li> When I want to clean</li>
            <li> Felt my face more pure and shiny</li>
            <li> Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash was one of the most recommended cleansers.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s gentle, I&#x27;m able to use spot treatment during breakouts without overdrying.</li>
            <li> and it is just so simple that your skin feels really good.</li>
            <li> Purpose just keeps my skin perfectly soft &amp; blemish free :) it smells like johnsons baby shampoo, the yellow kind!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> it makes your skin feel so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Before i discovered this product, i had mild acne.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;rinses quickly and completely&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily it comes in a plastic bag</li>
            <li> This soap is good for my skin does not dry it out or make me break out - very gentle</li>
            <li> It does kind of clean the skin, but I was left with flakey skin even AFTER I put on moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my drier spots, and it does a good job of clearing up the oil slicks.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a lite scent soap free perfect for you if you have sensitive skin or acne prone skin it washes off makeup and is a perfect size if you&#x27;re curious it&#x27;s not to small not to big</li>
            <li> It washes off easily, leaving behind some kind of light moisturizing feel that is quite refreshing.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that has cleared up my skin&#x27;s dryness and peeling, I use this in combination with a Bioelemt&#x27;s brand moisturizer and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried the 300 dollar Le Mar creme and found it not being useful.</li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviews that have mentioned it here, this cleansing wash is a great alternative to those who have skin that dries easily or have tried other skin care products that are based on salicylic acid to no avail.    </li>
            <li> My instinct was right</li>
            <li> Normally Amazon is great with shipping, but my product arrived in a plastic bag, and it had leaked like other reviewers.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser for people with normal to dry OR combination skin.</li>
            <li> I use it around my eyes and it is gentle, yet effective enough to remove eye make up.  </li>
            <li> This cleanser is very gentle.</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived very fast, and it started clearing my skin in just 2 days.</li>
            <li> It is a very gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and lathers well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to calm, but still leave my sensitive skin clean, as what I was using for the colder months was startign to leave my skin too oily.</li>
            <li> After just using Purpose for about a week, you can&#x27;t even tell that I had much of anything on my forehead!  </li>
            <li> Most everything I put on will piss off my skin and flares up and turns red.</li>
            <li> This product claims to be \\&quot;soap-free\\&quot; and when applied to a wet face works nicely up into a lather.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you the number of products I have tried just to go back and rinse my face again just to make it feel better.  </li>
            <li> I love this product but when my last shipment arrived the bottle had leaked.</li>
            <li> But I will say that when I first started using it, my skin became really clear and pimple free.  </li>
            <li> but first I was to wash my face with Purpose and nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;Within</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this for the nervous and curious people who aren&#x27;t sure if they want to buy this face wash because they have sensitive skin like me :)</li>
            <li> so let me tell you 3 really good face washes for those who want beautiful skin but have sensitive skin and are tired of trying things because I&#x27;ve tried everything Purity made simple facial cleansing gel thats a favorite  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the Purpose Wash.</li>
            <li> I love how simple this product is.</li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;m giving it four stars because it does exactly what it says and at around 5 bucks, heck, how can anyone complain?</li>
            <li> It is ideal as a face wash because it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin after using it the way some astringent washes do, leaving your skin scaly or rough.</li>
            <li> The price was cheaper than stores, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it because it looks like I lost a decent amount from the shipping..</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend Clean and Clear&#x27;s Blackhead Eraser Scrub.</li>
            <li> While pregnant you&#x27;re supposed to avoid many typical acne treatments and Purpose has none of them</li>
            <li> sure there are other products that work, but this one is the right price.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this, my few breakouts have been more mild and cleared up quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty decent delivery time.</li>
            <li> Works very well, it really is add gentle as water.</li>
            <li> that I can readily see after the 1 week of use.</li>
            <li> Gentle Cleansing Wash.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Everyone has different skin, so it&#x27;s important to look for the one that works for you.    </li>
            <li> It really works well for my acne.</li>
            <li> Unless you really want to save twenty or thirty cents, get it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My skin type is combination and very acne prone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, non-irritating, cleanses very well, and smells good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked really well for me</li>
            <li> I still need to moisturize afterwards, but this product is really gentle on skin</li>
            <li> and I had to wash the bottle off, but there wasn&#x27;t too much lost that way</li>
            <li> Removes makeup and is gentle.</li>
            <li> All Purpose and Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser I read on the bottle not the one at the store but the one on Amazon because the one at the store is made by another company</li>
            <li> This gentle cleanser did not irritate my face after shaving.  </li>
            <li> This one not only clean and gentle enough, it RINSED OFF easily.</li>
            <li> I also use Queen Helens mud mask and the green one for acne, Manuka Honey for a mask to help my scars, and witch hazel with rose hips in it for my toner.</li>
            <li> However, I feel like I get more breakouts using this product than with other products.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve started to see blemishes appear again, but there are so many other variables that could be contributing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remedy: I&#x27;ve used a TON of products to try to even out my skin tone, calm down the irritation and smooth things out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what kind of skin condition I have</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you have more sensitive skin and need a face wash that doesn&#x27;t completely dry you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this is how it helps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Symptoms: Super scaly, flakey facial skin around eyebrows, nose and forehead.</li>
            <li> so no serious complaints with that, either.</li>
            <li> It does not dry the face and leaves the skin feedling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and I wanted a cleanser that would effectively clean my skin, but not dry it out.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is the fragrance which is very pleasant or another ingredient or really bad luck, but I am putting this out here since it gets such great reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have been battling blemishes and acne ever since high school.  </li>
            <li> You can also follow up with some Rosewater Toner from Burt&#x27;s and Bee&#x27;s, and for moisture, add Pond&#x27;s moisturizer, it&#x27;ll certainly give you clear skin, rather than use this junk.</li>
            <li> I was tempted to go buy a new cleanser like cetaphil or cerve</li>
            <li> Anytime I&#x27;ve tried a new cleanser it never works as well as this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that my prescription products contributed to clear skin at all or rarely but using this face wash has made that big difference.</li>
            <li> I was undergoing radiation treatment and they told me I could only use a very gentle soap while being treated.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It also helps clear up my acne too!</li>
            <li> I sent back the first one thinking</li>
            <li> but second one came just like the first one...  </li>
            <li> Something in it , I believe, breaks me out more than usual.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different facial washes before and this is the only one I&#x27;ll use from now on.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin that has always dried out easily, especially when using any kind of non-moisturizing soap.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only about six ingredients in this compared to all the weird-named chemicals in Cetaphils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this for ONE MONTH, my skin has pretty much completely cleared up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male in my early 20&#x27;s, and I&#x27;ve been battling mild acne and blemishes since I was a teen.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t keeping my face as clear as I wanted</li>
            <li> I had a severe breakout on my forehead and nothing would help clear it up.  </li>
            <li> I found this stuff thanks to a friend with great skin and was shocked to see the affordable price tag, so I tried it.</li>
            <li> It kept my skin clear for weeks.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft after using it.</li>
            <li> DRYOUT and leaves the skin soft, moiturized with a glow.</li>
            <li> It is extremely gentle yet it has cleared up my face entirely of blemishes.</li>
            <li> and then I will apply a facial moisturizer 10-15 minutes after cleaning my face with Purpose Gentle.</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old and have been looking for a cleansing face wash that didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling like there was still soap on it.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and I&#x27;ve seen a drastic decrease in my acne in about 5 days.</li>
            <li> but i DO have really sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin that reacts to almost every product I have tried.</li>
            <li> Completely cleans off oil and makeup without drying.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin you must try this.  </li>
            <li> My face is soft and smooth and I can even see it after a few days.  </li>
            <li> a little isn&#x27;t a problem, but it was a bit of a bummer to received it that way and have to clean it up when I took it out of the package.</li>
            <li> Thanks, J&amp;J for keeping [[ASIN:B0011Z3X66 Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash - 6 Oz]] on the market long enough for me to discover it.</li>
            <li> I used it once or twice a day everyday and saw a significant improvement.  </li>
            <li> It works as expected, lathers well, is very gentle to my skin, and cleanses my face well, and rinses well without drying my skin.</li>
            <li> Finally, a cleanser that doesn&#x27;t irritate my combination skin and really leaves my face feeling clean rather than dried out!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive but oil-prone skin (only break out ocassionally), so I asked around for something that would be gentle, but still cleanse enough.</li>
            <li> It started like normal, in middle school</li>
            <li> That said, I&#x27;m one satisfied customer and recommend it to folks who have had no success with other mainstream cleansers.</li>
            <li> I have some acne especially on my chin, and I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see something new in the store and wanna try it out, but always come back to purpose...</li>
            <li> This one is gentle on my non-teenager face and doesn&#x27;t severely dry it out either.</li>
            <li> It cleans my very combination skin well, minimizes the appears of nose pores, minimizes breakouts and it doesnt dry my skin.</li>
            <li> this was the first cleanser I found that was gentle enough to use everyday.</li>
            <li> My face is soooo sensitive to products and I cannot use soap or my nose gets all peely and gross.</li>
            <li> BUT nothing a little moisturizer afterwards doesn&#x27;t fix right up</li>
            <li> Make sure you try it for a few weeks because it may take a little while for you to notice its effects.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I can only find positive things to say about this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Your skin actually feels cleaner after, and it does not have any scents which I believe benefit acne prone/ white head prone and sensitive skin; that is what I have.</li>
            <li> As a side note, I am pregnant and have been looking for something gentle yet effective to deal with my pregnancy-related breakouts (which have been awful!).</li>
            <li> I have Seborrheic dermatitis and Rosacea, so my skin is very sensitive and dry.</li>
            <li> Use it with lukewarm water to open up the pores enough to clean thoroughly, but not hot enough to leave your skin dry.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and leaves my face feeling SO soft!  </li>
            <li> I mean CLEAN.</li>
            <li> I bought this at target and the first few days I did not think it was working.</li>
            <li> I started off using this everyday for the first month or so</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for those of you looking to gently remove facial makeup without irritating skin.</li>
            <li> My aunt accidently touched my face the other day and she was amazed how soft my skin was.  </li>
            <li> It actually can peel and when touched the skin feels dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous kinds of facial wash and have been using Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser for a few years now</li>
            <li> all the liquid face wash agents (both expensive and cheap)</li>
            <li> a few weeks my face was clear and the flushing of my face has disappeared too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It can leave my face a bit dry sometimes</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my face insanely dry.  </li>
            <li> then i cover the dry patches with vaseline and sleep.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s dry, sometimes it&#x27;s irritated, sometimes it has breakouts.</li>
            <li> Every cleanser I tried would treat one issue but cause another (moisturize the dryness- cause breakouts, treat the breakouts- dry out my skin, etc).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking off a star because it did leave my face feeling just a tad bit dry</li>
            <li> The only con is it is somewhat expensive, but has been worth it to me.</li>
            <li> everything else seems to dry my skin out or cause a breakout!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried expensive face washes, whole face wash product lines (ProActive, Murad), and some of the trendier face washes such as Zihr.    </li>
            <li> Use it at least twice per day, and your skin will become so incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> and I have absolutely no complaints with it.</li>
            <li> It also washes off easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a thin film behind like other washes.</li>
            <li> I have tried other skin products and none of them have worked but this manages for whatever reason to do the trick and does not irritate my skin or cause any other problems.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different face washes in the past year to try to find something to help my skin, but they just irritated my skin and sometimes caused it to burn.</li>
            <li> So, why put a bunch of other stuff into a cleanser that I don&#x27;t need?  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t needed any of the other products in my arsenal</li>
            <li> and when my skin gets use to my other face wash</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but my skin does feel a little dry after use (remedied with a moisturizer).  </li>
            <li> I would recommend &#x27;Aveeno Active Naturals Ultra Calming Foaming Cleanser, Fragrance-Free&#x27; over this product.</li>
            <li> Even though it is &amp;#34;soap free&amp;#34; it creates a thick lather, especially when used with a Clarisonic brush.</li>
            <li> lately.&lt;br /&gt;After a month, no more irritated skin, no more dry patches, no more breakouts (not even the hormone related ones that have plagued me for years).</li>
            <li> The redness and flakiness was gone and my breakouts are less noticeable and are healing.</li>
            <li> It also made me slightly break out.</li>
            <li> I have few products that I swear by and won&#x27;t switch from, and this is one of them.</li>
            <li> dried out my skin -</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see the same dramatic difference</li>
            <li> All I know is overall this costs way less than any prescription or expensive &amp;</li>
            <li> After I ran out of my purpose sample, I tried Cetaphil and was left disappointed because the redness in my cheeks came back.</li>
            <li> Overall, I will be buying this again in stores, but not from Amazon unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne and combination skin for the past 15 years.</li>
            <li> I had been using Cetaphil for the past three years or so.</li>
            <li> and this is doing the trick lately.</li>
            <li> After my pregnancy made me break out like CRAZY (and I mean like thirteen year-old style), a friend who had recently had a baby recommended Purpose.</li>
            <li> It washes away all my makeup, dirt, and grim from the day and leave my skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> After TWO DAYS, my skin was softer, less broken out, and all around less crazy.</li>
            <li> Dead wrong.</li>
            <li> this is my beauty secret for 19 years</li>
            <li> It has no scent, color, or anything irritating.</li>
            <li> maybe it was a process wrong</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did get some acne breakouts with it.  </li>
            <li> moisturel is no more :(</li>
            <li> Just sorry I didn&#x27;t start using it sooner!</li>
            <li> I tried take forever or even impossible to rinse off.</li>
            <li> Not too bad.  </li>
            <li> I ended up having a painful skin reaction with my skin sloughing off after using it.</li>
            <li> but the age of twenty-five, I was sick of it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This cleanser is very gentle. It makes my skin soft after using it. However, I feel like I get more breakouts using this product than with other products. I may use this as a backup, but I don&#x27;t think I would use it as my primary face wash.</li>
            <li> the very best on the market for my skin type - it does not DRYOUT and leaves the skin soft, moiturized with a glow. this is my beauty secret for 19 years and i am 59 and my skin don;t have a wrinkle in sight, my pores are fine and no blackheads use with the purpose moisturizing cream w/spf15. This should not be discontinued, Please. THE BEST!!!!</li>
            <li> Before i discovered this product, i had mild acne. i&#x27;d get maybe 5 or 6 pimples on my face at a time, so i&#x27;d buy a simple cleanser. When i broke out, i decided to do some research. Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash was one of the most recommended cleansers. So i decided to give it a try. The bottle arrived very fast, and it started clearing my skin in just 2 days. I would strongly recommend this product to anyone. It&#x27;s cheap and effective.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne for years. It started like normal, in middle school but the age of twenty-five, I was sick of it. I decided to try this face wash and replace my BNZ 10 with this and I am glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;feels great on skin&lt;br /&gt;rinses quickly and completely&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t irritate break outs&lt;br /&gt;clams break outs&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t bleach hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;none that I can readily see after the 1 week of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male in my early 20&#x27;s, and I&#x27;ve been battling mild acne and blemishes since I was a teen. I&#x27;ve tried numerous kinds of facial wash and have been using Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser for a few years now but it wasn&#x27;t keeping my face as clear as I wanted so I decided to do research on the best facial wash out there and discovered Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash. I am glad I did! Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash is the best facial cleanser that I&#x27;ve ever had. It is extremely gentle yet it has cleared up my face entirely of blemishes. It can leave my face a bit dry sometimes so every now and then I will apply a facial moisturizer 10-15 minutes after cleaning my face with Purpose Gentle. The one con it has is its bottle. It can&#x27;t be left in the shower because water will get into the bottle and make the cleanser a lot thinner and \\&quot;watery\\&quot;. Other than that, I can only find positive things to say about this cleanser. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The label is so simple and non-descript that I would have just ignored it on the shelves.  Honestly, I probably have.    I have been battling blemishes and acne ever since high school.  I&#x27;ve tried expensive face washes, whole face wash product lines (ProActive, Murad), and some of the trendier face washes such as Zihr.    I had a severe breakout on my forehead and nothing would help clear it up.  After just using Purpose for about a week, you can&#x27;t even tell that I had much of anything on my forehead!  It doesn&#x27;t leave my face insanely dry.  I still put on some light oil-free SPF 15 lotion for my face, though.    Use it with lukewarm water to open up the pores enough to clean thoroughly, but not hot enough to leave your skin dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what kind of skin condition I have but this is what I&#x27;ve done and this is how it helps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Symptoms: Super scaly, flakey facial skin around eyebrows, nose and forehead. It actually can peel and when touched the skin feels dry. Most everything I put on will piss off my skin and flares up and turns red. Sometimes itches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remedy: I&#x27;ve used a TON of products to try to even out my skin tone, calm down the irritation and smooth things out. I&#x27;ve even tried the 300 dollar Le Mar creme and found it not being useful. This is the only thing that helps....I wash my face at night with Purpose then i cover the dry patches with vaseline and sleep. After 2-3 days everything just clears up. It doesn&#x27;t work as well if I do just Purpose or just vaseline but both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure someone explain why this works. All I know is overall this costs way less than any prescription or expensive &amp;#34;le mar&amp;#34; type lotion and is super effective.  Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviews that have mentioned it here, this cleansing wash is a great alternative to those who have skin that dries easily or have tried other skin care products that are based on salicylic acid to no avail.    This product claims to be \\&quot;soap-free\\&quot; and when applied to a wet face works nicely up into a lather.  It washes off easily, leaving behind some kind of light moisturizing feel that is quite refreshing.  I have tried other skin products and none of them have worked but this manages for whatever reason to do the trick and does not irritate my skin or cause any other problems.  Everyone has different skin, so it&#x27;s important to look for the one that works for you.    That said, I&#x27;m one satisfied customer and recommend it to folks who have had no success with other mainstream cleansers.</li>
            <li> This soap is good for my skin does not dry it out or make me break out - very gentle</li>
            <li> It is awesome. It is a very gentle cleanser. I love it!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  I noticed a difference in my skin within 2 days.  The fragrance is also very nice and the cleanser itself is gentle.  Great buy!!!</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old and have been looking for a cleansing face wash that didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling like there was still soap on it.  I can&#x27;t tell you the number of products I have tried just to go back and rinse my face again just to make it feel better.  This is the BEST face cleanser I have ever tried.  My face is soft and smooth and I can even see it after a few days.  Even the price is great for &amp;#34;fixed income&amp;#34; people.</li>
            <li> Felt my face more pure and shiny</li>
            <li> I bought this at target and the first few days I did not think it was working. I was tempted to go buy a new cleanser like cetaphil or cerve but I wanted to give this a chance. My instinct was right It really works well for my acne. It is very gentle and lathers well. Cleans my skin and makes my pores a lot smaller. You can feel your skin tightening after you use it. I am so glad I gave it a chance cause it is so INEXPENSIVE and it actually works!  I use This for my cleanser I also use Queen Helens mud mask and the green one for acne, Manuka Honey for a mask to help my scars, and witch hazel with rose hips in it for my toner.</li>
            <li> I was undergoing radiation treatment and they told me I could only use a very gentle soap while being treated. They recommended Purpose soap. That was three years ago and I am still using it. It really is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleansing wash that my wife&#x27;s dermatologist recommended. It is ideal as a face wash because it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin after using it the way some astringent washes do, leaving your skin scaly or rough. It also washes off easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a thin film behind like other washes. It is very good at cleaning but also quite gentle. Highly recommended if you have more sensitive skin and need a face wash that doesn&#x27;t completely dry you out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note on the price:&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s pricing is really quite good and just about as cheap as a big-box store. Shipped to your door free makes it an even better deal. Unless you really want to save twenty or thirty cents, get it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I used this product when I was away for college with prescription products on the side to combat acne. I have to say compared to what I had been recommend by dermos (cetaphil) and another product that I am currently using by Mario Badescu that have the same texture this has been my fave and I am returning to it this week. I don&#x27;t believe that my prescription products contributed to clear skin at all or rarely but using this face wash has made that big difference. Your skin actually feels cleaner after, and it does not have any scents which I believe benefit acne prone/ white head prone and sensitive skin; that is what I have. I have learned that keeping it simple is always the best route. Def my go to face wash, that has never given me any problems.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have 2 different skin conditions. I have Seborrheic dermatitis and Rosacea, so my skin is very sensitive and dry. I have tried a lot of different face washes in the past year to try to find something to help my skin, but they just irritated my skin and sometimes caused it to burn. This is the ONLY thing that makes my redness disappear while not drying it out at the same time. I also sometimes use Aveeno moisturizer with it afterwards but Purpose is still good by itself.  My dermatologist recommended this and Cetaphil. After I ran out of my purpose sample, I tried Cetaphil and was left disappointed because the redness in my cheeks came back. I started off using this everyday for the first month or so and now I use it every 2-3 days and my skin looks flawless. I don&#x27;t even wear foundation anymore, that&#x27;s how well this stuff works. Overall, I will be buying this again in stores, but not from Amazon unfortunately. Normally Amazon is great with shipping, but my product arrived in a plastic bag, and it had leaked like other reviewers. The price was cheaper than stores, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it because it looks like I lost a decent amount from the shipping..</li>
            <li> Finally, a cleanser that doesn&#x27;t irritate my combination skin and really leaves my face feeling clean rather than dried out! Thanks, J&amp;J for keeping [[ASIN:B0011Z3X66 Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash - 6 Oz]] on the market long enough for me to discover it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it is working or not...  but the reason I gave it a three stars is because, when it arrived damaged twice.  It leak inside the bag.  I sent back the first one thinking maybe it was a process wrong but second one came just like the first one...  I will probably not order this again.</li>
            <li> I love this product but when my last shipment arrived the bottle had leaked. Luckily it comes in a plastic bag and it&#x27;s so inexpensive losing a little isn&#x27;t a problem, but it was a bit of a bummer to received it that way and have to clean it up when I took it out of the package.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of using an acne scrub that&#x27;s probably more meant for teens than 30 year olds (Neutrogena Grapefruit Acne Wash Scrub). I ended up having a painful skin reaction with my skin sloughing off after using it. This one is gentle on my non-teenager face and doesn&#x27;t severely dry it out either. Purchasing a big bottle for the shower!</li>
            <li> The best face wash for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this for my stress induced-adult acne.  I used it once or twice a day everyday and saw a significant improvement.  This is now month two of use and I don&#x27;t see the same dramatic difference, I&#x27;ve started to see blemishes appear again, but there are so many other variables that could be contributing. But I will say that when I first started using it, my skin became really clear and pimple free.  It doesn&#x27;t have a smell at all, and it seems like a good product.</li>
            <li> I have problem skin so this is not the product for me, not that it isn&#x27;t a good product</li>
            <li> My Doctor looked at my face which was red and flushed and breaking out. I thought I had rosea and she gave me some ointment to use on it twice a day but first I was to wash my face with Purpose and nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;Within a few weeks my face was clear and the flushing of my face has disappeared too.&lt;br /&gt;I love cleaning wash called Purpose it keeps my face clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use nothing else on my face but this wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I know Amazon has it I will be buying it here too.</li>
            <li> when I received this package, about 1/4 of it had leaked out into the package. its a good product. I just wish the company had of secured the bottle more to keep it from leaking.</li>
            <li> I have tried this more than once over the years since it has been recommended to me by doctors but I give up! Something in it , I believe, breaks me out more than usual. I am not sure if it is the fragrance which is very pleasant or another ingredient or really bad luck, but I am putting this out here since it gets such great reviews.  I guess no cleanser is for everyone.  My skin type is combination and very acne prone.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  I love it.  It&#x27;s gentle, non-irritating, cleanses very well, and smells good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different facial washes before and this is the only one I&#x27;ll use from now on.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product in the beginning. It worked really well for me but I think my skin is starting to get used to it. I&#x27;m starting to break out again and Purpose isn&#x27;t working as effectively and as quickly as it did when I first got it. If your skin isn&#x27;t like mine and gets used to face washes quickly, I definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> Pretty decent delivery time. Although I think it should be a prime item. Works very well, it really is add gentle as water. I have extremely sensitive skin and this is doing the trick lately. Make sure you try it for a few weeks because it may take a little while for you to notice its effects.</li>
            <li> Believe me when I write that I am a product junkie!! This stuff while inexpensive and without any fancy scents or skin reactions (like cooling or warming) is a fantastic product. It cleans my very combination skin well, minimizes the appears of nose pores, minimizes breakouts and it doesnt dry my skin. This is the best facial cleanser for people with normal to dry OR combination skin.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin that has always dried out easily, especially when using any kind of non-moisturizing soap. With this wash, I haven&#x27;t noticed the problem at all. I still need to moisturize afterwards, but this product is really gentle on skin and I have absolutely no complaints with it. The shipping itself wasn&#x27;t perfect because when I got the product some soap had leaked out and I had to wash the bottle off, but there wasn&#x27;t too much lost that way so no serious complaints with that, either.</li>
            <li> love this product, its efficient and makes me feel clean without drying out my skin</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I had been using Cetaphil for a while to combat my oily, breakout-prone skin and on a whim decided to switch to Purpose. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results! My skin is so soft and I&#x27;ve seen a drastic decrease in my acne in about 5 days. Even though it is &amp;#34;soap free&amp;#34; it creates a thick lather, especially when used with a Clarisonic brush. Highly recommend for those of you looking to gently remove facial makeup without irritating skin.</li>
            <li> I have never reviewed a product before, but this cleanser deserves it! I have struggled with acne and combination skin for the past 15 years. Within one day of using this cleanser, my skin already looked and felt much better! The redness and flakiness was gone and my breakouts are less noticeable and are healing. As a side note, I am pregnant and have been looking for something gentle yet effective to deal with my pregnancy-related breakouts (which have been awful!). I am so glad that I stumbled across the reviews of this product! What a great find!!</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash of all time. Removes makeup and is gentle. This honestly changed my life. I had seborrhea for years (same thing that causes dandruff, only on my face) and this was the first cleanser I found that was gentle enough to use everyday. It also does a great job of cleansing, not just being gentle. This is perfect for me because I need to keep my face very clean because of my seborrhea, but I don&#x27;t want to dry it out too much because of my psoriasis....and plus dry skin just isn&#x27;t that attractive or comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure there are other products that work, but this one is the right price. I have few products that I swear by and won&#x27;t switch from, and this is one of them. Anytime I&#x27;ve tried a new cleanser it never works as well as this. Unscented and great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> dried out my skin - but i DO have really sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;i used this 3 times and binned it.</li>
            <li> My skin needs different things at different times. Sometimes it&#x27;s dry, sometimes it&#x27;s irritated, sometimes it has breakouts. (actually, I should say HAD these issues, not anymore though) Every cleanser I tried would treat one issue but cause another (moisturize the dryness- cause breakouts, treat the breakouts- dry out my skin, etc). Also, fragranced products irritated it.&lt;br /&gt;No matter what though it does always need to be cleansed. So, why put a bunch of other stuff into a cleanser that I don&#x27;t need?  I cleanse with Purpose twice a day and follow it with a light moisturizer in the am, retinol moisturizer in the pm. I haven&#x27;t needed any of the other products in my arsenal lately.&lt;br /&gt;After a month, no more irritated skin, no more dry patches, no more breakouts (not even the hormone related ones that have plagued me for years). I wish I had tried this stuff sooner, my skin is finally happy.  I will but this product forever.</li>
            <li> Use it at least twice per day, and your skin will become so incredibly soft. Since it&#x27;s gentle, I&#x27;m able to use spot treatment during breakouts without overdrying. If you have sensitive skin, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave skin felling tight/dry.  I use it daily so does my oldest son.  We both like it, nice price will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I started using this product years ago because of my ongoing acne problem.  It does not dry the face and leaves the skin feedling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this for the nervous and curious people who aren&#x27;t sure if they want to buy this face wash because they have sensitive skin like me :) it&#x27;s a lite scent soap free perfect for you if you have sensitive skin or acne prone skin it washes off makeup and is a perfect size if you&#x27;re curious it&#x27;s not to small not to big and when my skin gets use to my other face wash I switch off to this one so let me tell you 3 really good face washes for those who want beautiful skin but have sensitive skin and are tired of trying things because I&#x27;ve tried everything Purity made simple facial cleansing gel thats a favorite  All Purpose and Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser I read on the bottle not the one at the store but the one on Amazon because the one at the store is made by another company so I don&#x27;t know about that one but I hope this review helps I also use a shower filter because the water these days have a lot of chemicals in it so I use a filter the Johnathan shower filter is very good ! I thought I&#x27;d share what works well but this is a good face wash..</li>
            <li> The cleanser is amazing! It cleans my oily skin without drying! It feels so good~ Also when I wash my eyelid it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eye. Great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complain is about the packaging. It leaks...</li>
            <li> I had been using Cetaphil for the past three years or so. I have some acne especially on my chin, and I wanted to try something new. I did my research and ended up settling on this brand. There&#x27;s only about six ingredients in this compared to all the weird-named chemicals in Cetaphils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this for ONE MONTH, my skin has pretty much completely cleared up. This is so good at removing makeup that it even removes mascara that has been reapplied throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cetaphil didn&#x27;t help my acne or make it go away but this does, so switch!!!</li>
            <li> Not too bad.  One test I do is wash my face after shaving.  This gentle cleanser did not irritate my face after shaving.  Unfortunately, I did get some acne breakouts with it.  I would recommend &#x27;Aveeno Active Naturals Ultra Calming Foaming Cleanser, Fragrance-Free&#x27; over this product.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the Purpose Wash. While it works well, I have to say I prefer to use the bar to this. However, if I couldn&#x27;t get the bar, this would do just fine!</li>
            <li> Best face wash ever. I found this stuff thanks to a friend with great skin and was shocked to see the affordable price tag, so I tried it. It&#x27;s changed my life. I haven&#x27;t had a breakout in ages (since I began using this product), and I recommend it to all of my friends who also love it. Try it, I know it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but it works for the majority.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin that reacts to almost every product I have tried. I bought Purpose and it has been cleaning my face without causing a breakout or rash. I love it! I have not tried some of the products others mention such as the one by Aveeno so I can&#x27;t compare, but I am satisfied with Purpose. The only con is it is somewhat expensive, but has been worth it to me.</li>
            <li> My favorite face wash.&lt;br /&gt;For years all the liquid face wash agents (both expensive and cheap) I tried take forever or even impossible to rinse off. Many keep my face smooth by leaving something on it which I don&#x27;t appreciate. When I want to clean I mean CLEAN. This one not only clean and gentle enough, it RINSED OFF easily.</li>
            <li> LOVE this face wash.  I use it around my eyes and it is gentle, yet effective enough to remove eye make up.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but my skin does feel a little dry after use (remedied with a moisturizer).  Still, I will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Thorough cleanser that never over-dries or damages my skin and is even effective on eye makeup. Can be counted on as a superb cleanser that leaves no unnecessary residue. Have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and I wanted a cleanser that would effectively clean my skin, but not dry it out. Dead wrong. It does kind of clean the skin, but I was left with flakey skin even AFTER I put on moisturizer.  It also made me slightly break out. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. I would certainly recommend Clean and Clear&#x27;s Blackhead Eraser Scrub. It kept my skin clear for weeks. I was amazed. You can also follow up with some Rosewater Toner from Burt&#x27;s and Bee&#x27;s, and for moisture, add Pond&#x27;s moisturizer, it&#x27;ll certainly give you clear skin, rather than use this junk.</li>
            <li> This is the only wash I have used in 3 years. It has no scent, color, or anything irritating. Perfect for sensitive skin. Completely cleans off oil and makeup without drying.</li>
            <li> Purpose facial wash was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  It works as expected, lathers well, is very gentle to my skin, and cleanses my face well, and rinses well without drying my skin.</li>
            <li> slightly more soapy-smelling and skin-drying than moisturel, but moisturel is no more :(</li>
            <li> it makes your skin feel so clean and fresh. and it is just so simple that your skin feels really good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using purpose since middle school &amp; I&#x27;m now 25! I&#x27;ll see something new in the store and wanna try it out, but always come back to purpose...everything else seems to dry my skin out or cause a breakout! Purpose just keeps my skin perfectly soft &amp; blemish free :) it smells like johnsons baby shampoo, the yellow kind! Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. Non greasy as well!</li>
            <li> I absoloutely love this face wash! My face is soooo sensitive to products and I cannot use soap or my nose gets all peely and gross. This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that has cleared up my skin&#x27;s dryness and peeling, I use this in combination with a Bioelemt&#x27;s brand moisturizer and it works amazingly. It also helps clear up my acne too! I hope this never gets discontinued, I can&#x27;t go a day without it! Thank you Purpose!!</li>
            <li> This product is so AMAZING!!!  I have VERY sensitive skin and I breakout ALL the time.  This product doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and leaves my face feeling SO soft!  My aunt accidently touched my face the other day and she was amazed how soft my skin was.  If you have sensitive skin you must try this.  Nothing else ever worked for me and I think I&#x27;ve used everything on the market!  LOL</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to calm, but still leave my sensitive skin clean, as what I was using for the colder months was startign to leave my skin too oily. I have sensitive but oil-prone skin (only break out ocassionally), so I asked around for something that would be gentle, but still cleanse enough. Purchased a bottle of Purpose after a friends recommendation, and I love it! It has a nice lather and rinses clean. My husband has even been sneaking uses of this, and he&#x27;s picky, so that says a lot. Since I&#x27;ve been using this, my few breakouts have been more mild and cleared up quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> After my pregnancy made me break out like CRAZY (and I mean like thirteen year-old style), a friend who had recently had a baby recommended Purpose. While pregnant you&#x27;re supposed to avoid many typical acne treatments and Purpose has none of them so I thought I&#x27;d try it out. After TWO DAYS, my skin was softer, less broken out, and all around less crazy. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my drier spots, and it does a good job of clearing up the oil slicks. I&#x27;m going to be sticking with Purpose even after the baby is here- what a great product! Just sorry I didn&#x27;t start using it sooner!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and will be devastated the day they decide to discontinue this product. I have acne prone combination skin and wash my face with Purpose every morning and evening. It washes away all my makeup, dirt, and grim from the day and leave my skin feeling clean and refreshed. I love how simple this product is. No fragrances, gentle, and simply amazing.</li>
            <li> I just received this a week ago and have been using it in the morning after my shower and at night. It&#x27;s definitely a great cleanser for the price and I can see why people love to use it for treating acne and what-not. I&#x27;m a guy and finally stopped kidding myself that these cleansers are only for girls. Although I don&#x27;t have acne, this Purpose cleanser does a great job of removing dirt and grease from my face. After a few days of use I can already tell my pores are slowly but surely getting emptied of all the crud that builds up over years of not washing your face properly. Your face does feel very, very clean after you use it. Just make sure that you, and I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying this, \\&quot;exfoliate.\\&quot; I&#x27;m giving it four stars because it does exactly what it says and at around 5 bucks, heck, how can anyone complain? I&#x27;m taking off a star because it did leave my face feeling just a tad bit dry BUT nothing a little moisturizer afterwards doesn&#x27;t fix right up and most people moisturize anyway after cleansing. I definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great skin cleanser and moisterizer.  I use it in the shower every day.</li>
