            <li>I&#x27;ve also experienced what I believe is sort of a reaction to the drops used for dilating my eyes.</li>
            <li>have experienced a very nice improvement which&lt;br /&gt;is probably going to save my having surgery for some&lt;</li>
            <li>Institutes of Health website from a physician who&#x27;d been successfully treating cataract patients of his for 25 yrs.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
            <li>VERY reasonably priced and PRICELESS as it is RESTORING his clarity and vision.  </li>
            <li>OR if they do work for you, the doctor will tell you that your cataract is getting BETTER,  or (surprise!)</li>
            <li>i let you know more soon!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to start at the first sign of an issue.</li>
            <li>I use a warm cloth to clean and eyes feel good.</li>
            <li>I am looking into a more cost effective approach when ordering.</li>
            <li>more than 3 times every day.</li>
            <li>3+ months that improvement will be more conclusive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still that bad-some things/some lot better.</li>
            <li>Need more time to see how it works for the cataract.</li>
            <li>and im confident over time and sticking to my no sugar diet</li>
            <li>Even the bottle is a better design than what I was using before.  </li>
            <li>My Chihuahua seems to be seeing better after a week or so of using it.  </li>
            <li>Such a wonderful product...</li>
            <li>and they feel much better in my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most veterinarians don&#x27;t know about this medication, please share this knowledge with them so they can help dogs and cats who are at the beginning stages of cataracts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure that she no longer had cataracts and</li>
            <li>/&gt;BTW, amazon.com does have some of the better prices for this product.  </li>

            <li>My dog&#x27;s optamologist said this was ok, but not to expect any miracles for her cataract.</li>
            <li>I can now see the color in my eyes better after using.&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
            <li>I had the start of a  cataract and after taking drops for a period of time the VA optometrist said my eyes are healthy.  </li>
            <li>He has taught me many things throughout the years and I am grateful.  </li>
            <li>I have been able to see colors brighter and clearer since using this product.</li>
            <li>I am 50 and don&#x27;t need reading glasses and my night vision is better.</li>
            <li>My dogs cataracts seem better.</li>
            <li>I need to apply it more times per day</li>
            <li>i notice that the drops along with the Saffron pills make my vision better.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product and will continue to use until I have cataract surgery next year.</li>
            <li>So it ends up costing more to use than others.  </li>
            <li>Wish I could have given this one a better rating.</li>
            <li>I think I have to continue to use it to have more progress, happy so far.</li>
            <li>The product came very quickly -- Thank You.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>An amazing product fro a first rate seller.</li>
            <li>I doubt that this helps, but it did give me hope...until I finally got the cataract surgery which has worked beautifully.</li>
            <li>The purchase aspect went fine.</li>
            <li>I will be fine</li>
            <li>Every time I took a dose, I made a huge leap forward within 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Every time I took a dose, I made a huge leap forward within 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I intend to continue using it but can&#x27;t give an accurate review at this time.</li>
            <li>These drops won&#x27;t work well if cataracts are advanced.</li>
            <li>He assured me that there are no eye drops available to cure cataracts.</li>
            <li>HPUS 6X: is recommended for conjunctival and corneal swelling and light sensitivity, dryness, redness, lachrymation and burning of the lid margin.</li>
            <li>Polysorbate 80 (0.4% as a light lubricant).*&lt;br /</li>
            <li>He assured me that there are no eye drops available to cure cataracts.</li>
            <li>Euphrasia 5x (Eyebright) HPUS6X: is recommended for conjunctival and corneal swelling and light sensitivity, dryness, redness, lachrymation and burning of the lid margin.</li>
            <li>Polysorbate 80 (0.4% as a light lubricant).</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to turn on a light.    </li>
            <li>To my surprise and utter joy, after ablout a month or so, I have noticed a change in the clarity.  </li>
            <li>So far seems to be effective but it will take a while to be sure for this product.</li>
            <li>i do not have cataracts, but i wanted to test drops that others said made a  significant difference for people with eyesight affected by age and pets with eye</li>
            <li>i will add to this reort if the drops make any significant diference</li>
            <li>However because I do think the drops are good for the eye; providing a dose of Cineraria - a free radical supplement; I continue to use them, hoping to stave off a cataract in the Left eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so in addition to my own \\&quot;natural lens\\</li>
            <li>Dont expect 20/20 but good enough to read mail.</li>
            <li>these drops along with lutein and macu&#x3D;guard really help they make me feel more focused</li>
            <li>feel I got as much benefit from it, however I am pleased with it and&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really, my vision is getting better.</li>
            <li>I buy this product every other month is for my sister she says is great for cataract</li>
            <li>and it took almost 4 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;Natural Opthalmics, based in Colorado, got them here quickly</li>
            <li>and meanwhile you will suffer a loss in visual acuity which means you won&#x27;t be able to read or safely drive until you have surgery.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say if these drops are keeping me from cataracts, but they feel good in my eyes, and ease the strain from long hours on the pc.</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t know how successful it will be until I go back for a check up.</li>
            <li>I have prime shipping and it has never failed me!  </li>
            <li>Like the fact it&#x27;s a natural product &amp; felt very comfortable using the drops.</li>
            <li>It was worth the price.</li>
            <li>I rarely need the glasses anymore.  </li>
            <li>Better result arrive when treatment is begun in the early stage of cataract.</li>
            <li>Better result arrive when treatment is begun in the early stage of cataract.</li>
            <li>So far I believe it has because his eyes seem more in focus.</li>
            <li>It was worth a try.</li>
            <li>I love Natural Ophthaimics..for cataract treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no burning as with the India product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a high quality product delivered quickly!</li>
            <li>I have cataract on my right eye.</li>
            <li>I am planning to use it as I avoiding surgery and hoping that my right vision improves.</li>
            <li>She was right.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t completely reversed the issue but it has certainly made it better.</li>
            <li>After using these eye drops, his halos and low vision are getting much better.  </li>
            <li>After only four days of treatment, She seemed to be able to see somewhat and the gray haze is gone.</li>
            <li>Too soon to tell, did not finish the first bottle.  </li>
            <li>Willing to use the rest.</li>
            <li>Most all of the brown color is back and she can see much better especially at night.  </li>
            <li>My experience is that it does exactly what it is supposed to do - quite well so.</li>
            <li>I am sure this tiny cataract will continue to heal and no longer be visible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am sure this tiny cataract will continue to heal and no longer be visible.    </li>
            <li>At this time, my expectations are much higher than the results.</li>
            <li>He sold me my first bottle for $45.00.</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase the same product for $15.00.</li>
            <li>However, that said, I&#x27;m going to a cataract specialist for evaluation next month and will know more after that.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>But Brite Eyes iii improved my vision in bright sunlight (glare) noticeably in one month, so I&#x27;ll probably stay with it for a few months.  </li>
            <li>and it felt like a hot cigarette was in my eye.</li>
            <li>Refusing to do that, I resorted to the drops again, this time really hoping it would have some positive effect on the secondary cataract - which doesn&#x27;t happen all the time, but also isn&#x27;t uncommon.</li>
            <li>It was never very bad to begin with, but I really don&#x27;t see any real improvement yet.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it did meet  my expections but the full effect will be seen within few more months.</li>
            <li>I am certain that these eye drops halted the formation and cleared cataract that was forming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very soothing</li>
            <li>Very soothing for the eye.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast and it was well packaged.</li>
            <li>the color was very muted and cloudy.</li>
            <li>again I gave the product the benefit of the doubt, again it was applied and immediately the product made his eyes extremely much</li>
            <li>Works fine--but will need continuous use to really see results.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I will administer and order more if needed to clear up earlier stage cataracts.  </li>
            <li>developed a cataract in my right eye after ICL surgery.</li>
            <li>read a very illuminating article about this product&#x27;s main ingredient on the Nat&#x27;l.</li>
            <li>Love is an active force, not a passive one......</li>
            <li>I now suspect that when older people start to have balance problems that it&#x27;s because they have cataracts developing that the eye doctor says are not bad enough to need surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is much less pricy than the carosine eye drops that you can saturate your eyes with it and thus ensuring a better result.</li>
            <li>I started on this herb blend several years ago when I had Bell&#x27;s Palsy and my eyes were so sensitive to light</li>
            <li>I started on this herb blend several years ago when I had Bell&#x27;s Palsy and my eyes were so sensitive to light</li>
            <li>Upon careful/close examination by this doctor I was told, \\&quot;there is NO evidence of any cataract in the left eye, and in the right eye there appears to be a very tinybeginning of a cataract formation\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Geat product, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Later, a friend told me about Natural Ophthalmics Crystalline Lens/Cineraria Eye drops that could improve and possibly stop early cataracts in HUMANS and the same medication was used successfully with DOGS and CATS.</li>
            <li>Stars because I&#x27;d recommend anyone who&#x27;s at risk for \\&quot;natural\\&quot; cataracts... not surgically induced cataracts like I had, use drops like these - hopefully buying a little more time before you have to go \\&quot;under</li>

            <li>(wow!!).  </li>
            <li>I have now used Schwabe (German) pure fresh cineraria drops with no trouble at all, as well as BriteEyes iii carnosine drops without problems.</li>
            <li>Where cataracts are more advanced (due to a variety of reasons) less favorable results can be expected.*&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Because the natural lens in my eye had become \\&quot;scratched\\&quot;, I really couldn&#x27;t expect any drops to \\&quot;dissolve\\&quot; the cataract.</li>
            <li>I walk nearly every day at a fast clip and now do that without fear of falling.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels in my eyes, but I am not sure that it is helping the Cataracts that much.</li>
            <li>My Pomeranian was just diagnosed with diabetes and the reason was not from the normal warning signs, it was from a vet check up.</li>
            <li>Cineraria helps, increase circulation in the eye tissues, helping circulation and normal metabolism.</li>

            <li>I do think these drops have improved my vision somewhat, but I am on my third bottle as you prescribed and my cataract in my right eye is still fogging my vision.  </li>
            <li>the left eye is clearer but the right eye is still somewhat cloudy</li>
            <li>I bought these drops as the doc said I was starting to get a cataract in my right eye.</li>
            <li>have found that whereas the product said to use 2 drops per eye and this was fine initially, now his eyes only seem to &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34</li>
            <li>You would think that ophthalmologists would be telling their patients about this simple cure and put all of their older patients on this medication to prevent cataracts in the first place.</li>
            <li>use two other products with them and think they are important.</li>

            <li>If you are in the very early stages then you should give these drops a try.</li>
            <li>I believe this doctor saw the remaining lesion of what had been a larger cataract in the right eye, however Natural Ophthalmics Crystalline Lens Cineraria Eye Drops have reduced that cataract to an almost completely healed lesion.</li>

            <li>you have been told YOU are getting cataracts, or SOMEONE YOU CARE ABOUT was told this, or your OLDER DOG or CAT is in the early stages starting to get them, share this information, certainly start using these eye drops.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough for long term results, however, the drops are very soothing and my eyes feel more relaxed.  </li>

            <li>He examined by eyes today and was surprised that the cateract was still the same and not worse.  </li>

            <li>I am fostering a 13 year old beagle.</li>
            <li>old Shih tzu had been diagnosed with cataracts.</li>
            <li>He is 7 years old and has cataracts in both eyes.</li>
            <li>So far, the drops have had an improvement for my cataract.  </li>
            <li>I purchased 3 bottles of these eye drops in hope it would help my 11 year old springer spaniels glaucoma.  </li>
            <li>Upon exam, the veterinarian mentioned to me that my dog was in the early stages of getting cataracts in her eyes.  </li>
            <li>I promise they will stop the cataract process if it is caught in early stages.  </li>
            <li>My dog is now 12 years old and should have some evidence of cataracts, and three years ago I was told she did have early cataracts and</li>
            <li>Did nothing for my 10 year old dog.</li>
            <li>As far as that&#x27;s concerned, I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s been any change.</li>
            <li>I used it on my dog where other reviewers had success.  </li>
            <li>I hold the dropper above the top of head, pull back headskin slightly to make the whites of eyes appear and drop there, so as not to have the dog jump at the drop coming towards their eyes.  </li>
            <li>Her eyes were getting a light blue cast instead of being her normal deep dark brown.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not ready for a definite opinion about this product; at least 30 (preferable 60) days should give a fair test time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different \\&quot;cataract dissolving\\&quot; eye drops, and although none of them \\&quot;dissolved\\&quot; the cataract I had in my R eye, this drop was the least \\&quot;pricey\\&quot;, and was the most soothing of the ones I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Drops are good when my eyes are tired , especially afrer being on the computer for a long time.- - - - Will I order again?</li>
            <li>i also used the drops in the eyes of an older dog who has one eye that is cloudy and it worked as well as more expensive drops i have used.</li>
            <li>After several months of three times a day use, it didn&#x27;t do anything for my early cateract formation.</li>
            <li>Have used this on my old dog and reordered several times.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These drops have given me my life back as I no longer have to find ways to keep the sun from reflecting off the cataract and my balance is nearly 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Each time the drops have been used they have progressively made my dog&#x27;s eyes worse and more cloudy.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to know if it halted my early progression cataracts, but from the first use, my &#x27;dry eye syndrome&#x27; improved.</li>
            <li>I also took one light blub out of the overhead light because the reflection from a little bit behind my left eye was a distraction as it reflected off the stigmatism and cataract.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
            <li> VERY reasonably priced and PRICELESS as it is RESTORING his clarity and vision.  </li>
            <li> OR if they do work for you, the doctor will tell you that your cataract is getting BETTER,  or (surprise!)</li>
            <li> i let you know more soon!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to start at the first sign of an issue.</li>
            <li> I use a warm cloth to clean and eyes feel good.</li>
            <li> I am looking into a more cost effective approach when ordering.</li>

            <li> Need more time to see how it works for the cataract.</li>
            <li> and im confident over time and sticking to my no sugar diet</li>
            <li> Even the bottle is a better design than what I was using before.  </li>
            <li> My Chihuahua seems to be seeing better after a week or so of using it.  </li>
            <li> Such a wonderful product...</li>
            <li> and they feel much better in my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most veterinarians don&#x27;t know about this medication, please share this knowledge with them so they can help dogs and cats who are at the beginning stages of cataracts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure that she no longer had cataracts and</li>
            <li> /&gt;BTW, amazon.com does have some of the better prices for this product.  </li>

            <li> My dog&#x27;s optamologist said this was ok, but not to expect any miracles for her cataract.</li>
            <li> I can now see the color in my eyes better after using.&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
            <li> I had the start of a  cataract and after taking drops for a period of time the VA optometrist said my eyes are healthy.  </li>
            <li> He has taught me many things throughout the years and I am grateful.  </li>
            <li> I have been able to see colors brighter and clearer since using this product.</li>
            <li> I am 50 and don&#x27;t need reading glasses and my night vision is better.</li>
            <li> My dogs cataracts seem better.</li>
            <li> I need to apply it more times per day</li>
            <li> i notice that the drops along with the Saffron pills make my vision better.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and will continue to use until I have cataract surgery next year.</li>
            <li> So it ends up costing more to use than others.  </li>
            <li> Wish I could have given this one a better rating.</li>
            <li> I think I have to continue to use it to have more progress, happy so far.</li>
            <li> The product came very quickly -- Thank You.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> An amazing product fro a first rate seller.</li>
            <li> I doubt that this helps, but it did give me hope...until I finally got the cataract surgery which has worked beautifully.</li>
            <li> The purchase aspect went fine.</li>
            <li> I will be fine</li>
            <li> Every time I took a dose, I made a huge leap forward within 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Every time I took a dose, I made a huge leap forward within 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I intend to continue using it but can&#x27;t give an accurate review at this time.</li>
            <li> These drops won&#x27;t work well if cataracts are advanced.</li>
            <li> He assured me that there are no eye drops available to cure cataracts.</li>
            <li> HPUS 6X: is recommended for conjunctival and corneal swelling and light sensitivity, dryness, redness, lachrymation and burning of the lid margin.</li>
            <li> Polysorbate 80 (0.4% as a light lubricant).*&lt;br /</li>
            <li> He assured me that there are no eye drops available to cure cataracts.</li>

            <li> Polysorbate 80 (0.4% as a light lubricant).</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to turn on a light.    </li>
            <li> To my surprise and utter joy, after ablout a month or so, I have noticed a change in the clarity.  </li>
            <li> So far seems to be effective but it will take a while to be sure for this product.</li>
            <li> i do not have cataracts, but i wanted to test drops that others said made a  significant difference for people with eyesight affected by age and pets with eye</li>
            <li> i will add to this reort if the drops make any significant diference</li>
            <li> However because I do think the drops are good for the eye; providing a dose of Cineraria - a free radical supplement; I continue to use them, hoping to stave off a cataract in the Left eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so in addition to my own \\&quot;natural lens\\</li>
            <li> Dont expect 20/20 but good enough to read mail.</li>
            <li> these drops along with lutein and macu&#x3D;guard really help they make me feel more focused</li>
            <li> feel I got as much benefit from it, however I am pleased with it and&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really, my vision is getting better.</li>
            <li> I buy this product every other month is for my sister she says is great for cataract</li>
            <li> and it took almost 4 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;Natural Opthalmics, based in Colorado, got them here quickly</li>
            <li> and meanwhile you will suffer a loss in visual acuity which means you won&#x27;t be able to read or safely drive until you have surgery.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say if these drops are keeping me from cataracts, but they feel good in my eyes, and ease the strain from long hours on the pc.</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t know how successful it will be until I go back for a check up.</li>
            <li> I have prime shipping and it has never failed me!  </li>
            <li> Like the fact it&#x27;s a natural product &amp; felt very comfortable using the drops.</li>
            <li> It was worth the price.</li>
            <li> I rarely need the glasses anymore.  </li>
            <li> Better result arrive when treatment is begun in the early stage of cataract.</li>
            <li> Better result arrive when treatment is begun in the early stage of cataract.</li>
            <li> So far I believe it has because his eyes seem more in focus.</li>
            <li> It was worth a try.</li>
            <li> I love Natural Ophthaimics..for cataract treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no burning as with the India product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a high quality product delivered quickly!</li>
            <li> I have cataract on my right eye.</li>
            <li> I am planning to use it as I avoiding surgery and hoping that my right vision improves.</li>
            <li> She was right.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t completely reversed the issue but it has certainly made it better.</li>
            <li> After using these eye drops, his halos and low vision are getting much better.  </li>
            <li> After only four days of treatment, She seemed to be able to see somewhat and the gray haze is gone.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell, did not finish the first bottle.  </li>
            <li> Willing to use the rest.</li>
            <li> Most all of the brown color is back and she can see much better especially at night.  </li>
            <li> My experience is that it does exactly what it is supposed to do - quite well so.</li>
            <li> I am sure this tiny cataract will continue to heal and no longer be visible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am sure this tiny cataract will continue to heal and no longer be visible.    </li>
            <li> At this time, my expectations are much higher than the results.</li>
            <li> He sold me my first bottle for $45.00.</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase the same product for $15.00.</li>
            <li> However, that said, I&#x27;m going to a cataract specialist for evaluation next month and will know more after that.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> But Brite Eyes iii improved my vision in bright sunlight (glare) noticeably in one month, so I&#x27;ll probably stay with it for a few months.  </li>
            <li> and it felt like a hot cigarette was in my eye.</li>
            <li> Refusing to do that, I resorted to the drops again, this time really hoping it would have some positive effect on the secondary cataract - which doesn&#x27;t happen all the time, but also isn&#x27;t uncommon.</li>
            <li> It was never very bad to begin with, but I really don&#x27;t see any real improvement yet.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it did meet  my expections but the full effect will be seen within few more months.</li>
            <li> I am certain that these eye drops halted the formation and cleared cataract that was forming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very soothing</li>
            <li> Very soothing for the eye.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast and it was well packaged.</li>
            <li> the color was very muted and cloudy.</li>
            <li> again I gave the product the benefit of the doubt, again it was applied and immediately the product made his eyes extremely much</li>
            <li> Works fine--but will need continuous use to really see results.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I will administer and order more if needed to clear up earlier stage cataracts.  </li>
            <li> developed a cataract in my right eye after ICL surgery.</li>
            <li> read a very illuminating article about this product&#x27;s main ingredient on the Nat&#x27;l.</li>
            <li> Love is an active force, not a passive one......</li>
            <li> I now suspect that when older people start to have balance problems that it&#x27;s because they have cataracts developing that the eye doctor says are not bad enough to need surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is much less pricy than the carosine eye drops that you can saturate your eyes with it and thus ensuring a better result.</li>
            <li> I started on this herb blend several years ago when I had Bell&#x27;s Palsy and my eyes were so sensitive to light</li>
            <li> I started on this herb blend several years ago when I had Bell&#x27;s Palsy and my eyes were so sensitive to light</li>
            <li> Upon careful/close examination by this doctor I was told, \\&quot;there is NO evidence of any cataract in the left eye, and in the right eye there appears to be a very tinybeginning of a cataract formation\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Geat product, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Later, a friend told me about Natural Ophthalmics Crystalline Lens/Cineraria Eye drops that could improve and possibly stop early cataracts in HUMANS and the same medication was used successfully with DOGS and CATS.</li>
            <li> Stars because I&#x27;d recommend anyone who&#x27;s at risk for \\&quot;natural\\&quot; cataracts... not surgically induced cataracts like I had, use drops like these - hopefully buying a little more time before you have to go \\&quot;under</li>

            <li> (wow!!).  </li>
            <li> I have now used Schwabe (German) pure fresh cineraria drops with no trouble at all, as well as BriteEyes iii carnosine drops without problems.</li>
            <li> Where cataracts are more advanced (due to a variety of reasons) less favorable results can be expected.*&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Because the natural lens in my eye had become \\&quot;scratched\\&quot;, I really couldn&#x27;t expect any drops to \\&quot;dissolve\\&quot; the cataract.</li>
            <li> I walk nearly every day at a fast clip and now do that without fear of falling.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels in my eyes, but I am not sure that it is helping the Cataracts that much.</li>
            <li> My Pomeranian was just diagnosed with diabetes and the reason was not from the normal warning signs, it was from a vet check up.</li>
            <li> Cineraria helps, increase circulation in the eye tissues, helping circulation and normal metabolism.</li>

            <li> I do think these drops have improved my vision somewhat, but I am on my third bottle as you prescribed and my cataract in my right eye is still fogging my vision.  </li>
            <li> the left eye is clearer but the right eye is still somewhat cloudy</li>
            <li> I bought these drops as the doc said I was starting to get a cataract in my right eye.</li>
            <li> have found that whereas the product said to use 2 drops per eye and this was fine initially, now his eyes only seem to &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34</li>
            <li> You would think that ophthalmologists would be telling their patients about this simple cure and put all of their older patients on this medication to prevent cataracts in the first place.</li>
            <li> use two other products with them and think they are important.</li>

            <li> If you are in the very early stages then you should give these drops a try.</li>
            <li> I believe this doctor saw the remaining lesion of what had been a larger cataract in the right eye, however Natural Ophthalmics Crystalline Lens Cineraria Eye Drops have reduced that cataract to an almost completely healed lesion.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough for long term results, however, the drops are very soothing and my eyes feel more relaxed.  </li>

            <li> old Shih tzu had been diagnosed with cataracts.</li>
            <li> He is 7 years old and has cataracts in both eyes.</li>
            <li> So far, the drops have had an improvement for my cataract.  </li>
            <li> I purchased 3 bottles of these eye drops in hope it would help my 11 year old springer spaniels glaucoma.  </li>
            <li> Upon exam, the veterinarian mentioned to me that my dog was in the early stages of getting cataracts in her eyes.  </li>
            <li> I promise they will stop the cataract process if it is caught in early stages.  </li>
            <li> My dog is now 12 years old and should have some evidence of cataracts, and three years ago I was told she did have early cataracts and</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my 10 year old dog.</li>
            <li> As far as that&#x27;s concerned, I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s been any change.</li>
            <li> I used it on my dog where other reviewers had success.  </li>
            <li> I hold the dropper above the top of head, pull back headskin slightly to make the whites of eyes appear and drop there, so as not to have the dog jump at the drop coming towards their eyes.  </li>
            <li> Her eyes were getting a light blue cast instead of being her normal deep dark brown.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not ready for a definite opinion about this product; at least 30 (preferable 60) days should give a fair test time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different \\&quot;cataract dissolving\\&quot; eye drops, and although none of them \\&quot;dissolved\\&quot; the cataract I had in my R eye, this drop was the least \\&quot;pricey\\&quot;, and was the most soothing of the ones I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Drops are good when my eyes are tired , especially afrer being on the computer for a long time.- - - - Will I order again?</li>
            <li> i also used the drops in the eyes of an older dog who has one eye that is cloudy and it worked as well as more expensive drops i have used.</li>
            <li> After several months of three times a day use, it didn&#x27;t do anything for my early cateract formation.</li>
            <li> Have used this on my old dog and reordered several times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These drops have given me my life back as I no longer have to find ways to keep the sun from reflecting off the cataract and my balance is nearly 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I also took one light blub out of the overhead light because the reflection from a little bit behind my left eye was a distraction as it reflected off the stigmatism and cataract.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have used this only for two days and already a discernible improvement in my vision has become apparent.</li>
            <li> I have a small cataract on my right eye.</li>
            <li> At the very least my eyes do not feel so dry and feel more refreshed.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I can hardly call the lesion in the right eye a cataract because it is so small\\&quot;.  </li>

            <li> I was especially appreciative since it was SO alarming to receive this scary diagnosis of my little toy poodle&#x27;s juvenile cataracts (he&#x27;s a rescue doggie but only between 4-5 yrs.</li>
            <li> Because a secondary cataract is an encapsulation behind the new cataract lens - which is permanent, and should correct vision once the encapsulation is gone, I gave it a try for several months while I was trying to resolve the billing issues of the original cataract surgery, and looked for a new surgeon; hoping that these drops would improve my vision just a bit in the interim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 3 weeks now and especially hoping the drops stave off the formation of the early cataract in his &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; eye, and the one that had already developed seems to be improving, it&#x27;s hard to judge as his eyes change depending on the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> no better no worse.</li>
            <li> It is too soon to tell if the product will have long lasting results, however the eye appears to be clearer than if was before we started the drops!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use this product long enough to say whether it helped my cataract.</li>
            <li> It make my eyes very dry and even harder to see clearly.</li>
            <li> Within less than a month I could see a definite improvement and in 3 months the blue cast in her eyes was totally gone!  </li>
            <li> a long time i have needed reading glasses, and glasses that clarify computer videos and text.</li>
            <li> I start off with a Systane Lubricant Eye Drops, wait a few seconds, then use the Natural eye drops for Cataract.</li>

            <li> Because the doctor&#x27;s billing staff was completely inept, they didn&#x27;t know how to bill our insurance company; leaving me to deal with their mess or pay them $5,400!</li>

            <li> Keeps my dry eye at bay.</li>
            <li> So far it makes my eyes less dry and perhaps a bit less cloudy.</li>

            <li> My min poodle has cataracts and his eyes were turning an odd blue shade.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, shortly after the cataract surgery, I developed a secondary cataract!</li>
            <li> It reads: \\&quot;Cataracts are a condition which develops as the body, with age, has a harder time providing oxygen, nutrition, detoxification and antioxidants to the cells of the eye&#x27;s lens.</li>

            <li> This product is not only a sham</li>
            <li> I had told the doctor that my dog had been diagnosed with cataracts in both eyes and the left was the worst, and that her eyes had started to have a pale light blue cast to them, but that blue cast had completely gone away after treating her eyes with these eye drops (which I had brought and shown to him).  </li>

            <li> Contrary to past common practice of eye doctors to wait until the lens \\&quot;ripens\\&quot; and replace the clouded lens with an artificial lens, doctors now often recommend natural treatments supporting the capacity to maintain or even clear the crystalline lens.</li>

            <li> The improvement is a very small.</li>
            <li> I was told when the cataracts got worse I should consider this.  </li>
            <li> It seems the itching, burning and irritation in my eyes became worse after that.</li>
            <li> And it truly hurts me that I was the one at fault for causing his eyes to get worse at this rate.</li>
            <li> This was a re-order--I&#x27;ve been using the drops on my 16 year-old Papillon--and her cataracts don&#x27;t seem to be getting worse.  </li>

            <li> My mom likes it. It works to her cataract.</li>
            <li> After several months of three times a day use, it didn&#x27;t do anything for my early cateract formation.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels in my eyes, but I am not sure that it is helping the Cataracts that much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different \\&quot;cataract dissolving\\&quot; eye drops, and although none of them \\&quot;dissolved\\&quot; the cataract I had in my R eye, this drop was the least \\&quot;pricey\\&quot;, and was the most soothing of the ones I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I developed a cataract in my right eye after ICL surgery. Because the natural lens in my eye had become \\&quot;scratched\\&quot;, I really couldn&#x27;t expect any drops to \\&quot;dissolve\\&quot; the cataract. ICL is \\&quot;Implanted Contact Lens\\&quot; surgery - so in addition to my own \\&quot;natural lens\\&quot;, I also had an \\&quot;artificial lens\\&quot; inserted in my eye surgically because my eyesight was over -9.00 diopters; leaving my sight so poor that I couldn&#x27;t find my glasses if I&#x27;d misplaced them after getting up in the middle of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the surgery was SO expensive and wasn&#x27;t covered by insurance, I put the cataract surgery off until the last possible moment, living with blurry vision for about a year. At the point where I felt my daytime driving was affected, I went ahead with the cataract surgery. Unfortunately, shortly after the cataract surgery, I developed a secondary cataract! Grrr! Because the doctor&#x27;s billing staff was completely inept, they didn&#x27;t know how to bill our insurance company; leaving me to deal with their mess or pay them $5,400! Refusing to do that, I resorted to the drops again, this time really hoping it would have some positive effect on the secondary cataract - which doesn&#x27;t happen all the time, but also isn&#x27;t uncommon. Because a secondary cataract is an encapsulation behind the new cataract lens - which is permanent, and should correct vision once the encapsulation is gone, I gave it a try for several months while I was trying to resolve the billing issues of the original cataract surgery, and looked for a new surgeon; hoping that these drops would improve my vision just a bit in the interim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t see any improvement while using 2 drops twice per day (no pun intended! LOL). However because I do think the drops are good for the eye; providing a dose of Cineraria - a free radical supplement; I continue to use them, hoping to stave off a cataract in the Left eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, I did find a great surgeon, with a competent billing person. So if I do have to have another cataract surgery I won&#x27;t worry about the surgery, surgeon, or billing \\&quot;staff\\&quot; - i.e. that I&#x27;ll have to do all the work to get our insurance company to pay the surgeon&#x27;s bills, and not have a billing manager threating me every other day - all the while she&#x27;s not doing her job! Grrr!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 Stars because I&#x27;d recommend anyone who&#x27;s at risk for \\&quot;natural\\&quot; cataracts... not surgically induced cataracts like I had, use drops like these - hopefully buying a little more time before you have to go \\&quot;under the knife\\&quot; and have to possibly pay out a small fortune to get your eyesight corrected!good for the eye; providing a dose of Cineraria - a free radical supplement; I continue to use them, hoping to stave off a cataract in the Left eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, I did find a great surgeon, with a competent billing person.

            <li> used around 1 month. more than 3 times every day. it looks like  water and not working on my eyes.</li>
            <li> My husband was showing signs of cataracts and actually got surgery on one 2 years ago. The surgery didn&#x27;t work ( Waste of money!)  After using these eye drops, his halos and low vision are getting much better.  Went to the eye doctor and his eye is gradually making improvements.  He will go back again in a couple of months to get an update. Can&#x27;t wait.</li>
            <li> For my dog, show good signs after 30 days. On my 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> It make my eyes very dry and even harder to see clearly. Not recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite some time, bu haven&#x27;t gone to my optometrist yet. I will go this month and will find out then if it&#x27;s helping, but the drops are cooling and make my eyes feel good. I feel I can see clearer too. I&#x27;ll update after my eye appointment</li>
            <li> clearing my dog&#x27;s cataracts but it takes vigilance</li>
            <li> The product came very quickly -- Thank You. I was especially appreciative since it was SO alarming to receive this scary diagnosis of my little toy poodle&#x27;s juvenile cataracts (he&#x27;s a rescue doggie but only between 4-5 yrs. old). Did a LOT of research before selecting this product to treat his condition. Have been administering the drops 3x a day for appx. 3 weeks now and especially hoping the drops stave off the formation of the early cataract in his &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; eye, and the one that had already developed seems to be improving, it&#x27;s hard to judge as his eyes change depending on the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that whereas the product said to use 2 drops per eye and this was fine initially, now his eyes only seem to &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; one drop per dose, otherwise the second drop spills out onto his fur, so I&#x27;m now giving him only 1 drop per eye. Am hoping after appx. 3+ months that improvement will be more conclusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a very illuminating article about this product&#x27;s main ingredient on the Nat&#x27;l. Institutes of Health website from a physician who&#x27;d been successfully treating cataract patients of his for 25 yrs. with Cineraria.</li>
            <li> I used this product as per the directions and had no positive results at all, the bottle lasted around 30 days. I ordered another bottle because a lot of the reviews stated that you needed to take this for some time before noticing results. I was using this with the eye pelletes by the same manufacturer and after 60 days my cataract in my left eye has not changed at all, I will not buy this product again</li>
            <li> The purchase aspect went fine. The shipping was timely. Good job!</li>
            <li> Vision 200/250 diabetic have non diabetic cataracts/No dr approve surgury(wont do without lens implant/may be allergic/cant take out/steroids make blood sugar in 500&#x27;s &amp; insulin no help have to go off steroids-tryed). Tryed lutein/astaxanthin (4mg 2xs a day/beta caratene/apple cider vinegar drops/prayer) no better no worse. My vision chart-gas price sign $3.99 last saw.&lt;br /&gt;On drops about month. 2 days things  brighter. Yesterday gas $2.49. Read a catalog. Hope to read mail by christmas.&lt;br /&gt;Still taking pills &amp; prayer (no acv drops).&lt;br /&gt;By accident took 3 drops found helps. So take 3/3 drops or 2 drops 3xs/day 1 or 2 xs/week. Figure cant hurt going blind anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for alternative method thats helps. Dont expect 20/20 but good enough to read mail. Lol see the mail if falls on ground &amp; not feel for it. Still that bad-some things/some lot better.</li>
            <li> Good quality. I use them in my 13 year old yorkies eyes.  She has the beginning signs of cataracts but her sight is good.  I&#x27;d to contribute that to these drops. I&#x27;ve used in mine also. Very soothing</li>
            <li> My Pomeranian was just diagnosed with diabetes and the reason was not from the normal warning signs, it was from a vet check up. They noticed his cataracts which prompted a test, which diagnosed his diabetes.  So I am hoping this product will prolong his eye sight and relieve any pain he may have in his eyes.  Only time will tell.  My vet Is hoping for the same results!</li>
            <li> I just saw the eye doctor today and while, yes, I still have cataracts, they have not progressed since I started using this product and they are very minimal!</li>
            <li> Very soothing for the eye. Need more time to see how it works for the cataract. It was worth the price. I will buy again</li>
            <li> Used these eyedrops for months and over time they help slow down the spread of cataract on the eye. If you are in the very early stages then you should give these drops a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6 months and didn&#x27;t notice any change in my vision. Might work well for some people? not me. Like the fact it&#x27;s a natural product &amp; felt very comfortable using the drops. However I found a cure for cataracts on 12-13-11, it&#x27;s called surgery.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; product.  Some days there seems to be a real, visual improvement, other days little or no difference.  I&#x27;m not ready for a definite opinion about this product; at least 30 (preferable 60) days should give a fair test time.</li>
            <li> I do think these drops have improved my vision somewhat, but I am on my third bottle as you prescribed and my cataract in my right eye is still fogging my vision.  It was never very bad to begin with, but I really don&#x27;t see any real improvement yet.  I am going to continue to use the drops though I will probably end up having cataract surgery in the future.</li>
            <li> An amazing product fro a first rate seller. My plan is to reorder on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these drops religiously for 1.5 years, sometimes twice a day.  I keep the drops by my door to remind.&lt;br /&gt;My vision has IMPROVED and the cataract which was detected 5 years ago is still at a level 1.</li>
            <li> im in my 60s and starting to have vision problems scary at times especially when im driving  I started to research all my alternatives to surgery and these drops along with lutein and macu&#x3D;guard really help they make me feel more focused and im confident over time and sticking to my no sugar diet I will be fine im giving myself 3 months to find out</li>
            <li> I was having lots of eye problems and while dealing with them, the doctor said he also found cataracts.  I began using these drops, and the pellets.  My vision has definitely improved.  I rarely need the glasses anymore.  My dog was just diagnosed with cataracts today and plan to do the same for her that I have done for myself and see what the vet has to say as we go forward.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our dog who is getting a cataract. It is too soon to tell if the product will have long lasting results, however the eye appears to be clearer than if was before we started the drops!</li>
            <li> Since receiving I&#x27;m waiting to see if it will help my baby. I will let all know the results.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was fast and it was well packaged. I so far like the product.</li>
            <li> Less than a bottle usage, the floaters diminish noticeably. I am not sure about its effect on cataract which according to other users may take up to more than 8 months for a telling result. It is much less pricy than the carosine eye drops that you can saturate your eyes with it and thus ensuring a better result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased.  Even the bottle is a better design than what I was using before.  Easier to get the drop in my eye, not running down my face.  But what&#x27;s in the bottle is what counts.  Try it.</li>
            <li> Have used this on my old dog and reordered several times. He has cataracts and his eyes get dry so put this in twice a day for him.</li>
            <li> I am fostering a 13 year old beagle. She was diagnosed with cataracts in both eyes. I have been giving her theses drops and the left eye is clearer but the right eye is still somewhat cloudy</li>
            <li> It has been a month.  I see no improvement.  I&#x27;m still using it and may buy another bottle when this one is gone.  I have been told it takes six months!  Well, I&#x27;ll keep doing it, the operation is costly after all, but if it doesn&#x27;t do what it supposedly professes to do, I will be writing here to amend this and let you all know.  If it words, I&#x27;ll let you know as well.</li>
            <li> Our ll yr. old Shih tzu had been diagnosed with cataracts. One Eye worse than the other, both had the gray haze. After only four days of treatment, She seemed to be able to see somewhat and the gray haze is gone. She actually plays with her ball outside again and seems to see it when thrown. I think the drops have actually restored her sight somewhat.</li>
            <li> I have used this only for two days and already a discernible improvement in my vision has become apparent. This stuff rocks!</li>
            <li> Have only seen slow down not any clearing up. Though I would see some cataract reversal from what I saw advertised</li>
            <li> Have used the product years already. Find it the best to keep the eye from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was excellent.</li>
            <li> i do not have cataracts, but i wanted to test drops that others said made a  significant difference for people with eyesight affected by age and pets with eye problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for a long time i have needed reading glasses, and glasses that clarify computer videos and text. because of my sloppy lifestyle where i lose glasses, leaving a trail of them behind me like breadcrumbs after Hansel and Gretel, i buy 99 cent store magnifying glasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recently i was wearing  from 2.75 magnification to 3/25, depending on the size of text.  2 days of these drops and i went to 1.50 for video which was enough for larger text too. and everything was sparkling clear.  i also used the drops in the eyes of an older dog who has one eye that is cloudy and it worked as well as more expensive drops i have used. i left a bottle with a friend who rescued a dog with damaged eyes and a serious cataract in  one of them. i will add to this reort if the drops make any significant diference</li>
            <li> My Chihuahua seems to be seeing better after a week or so of using it.  He is 7 years old and has cataracts in both eyes.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell, did not finish the first bottle.  Hope I see&lt;br /&gt;results soon.  Willing to use the rest.</li>
            <li> So far, the drops have had an improvement for my cataract.  I have followed the regiman and can &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; a trending&lt;br /&gt;in my vision.  I look forward to the future.</li>
            <li> Bought it because it had good reviews.  Upon use eyes became severely irritated and painful.  Stopped use of it immediately.</li>
            <li> I cannot say if these drops are keeping me from cataracts, but they feel good in my eyes, and ease the strain from long hours on the pc. I purchased some for my brother too...we consider these part of our health-routine.</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 bottles of these eye drops in hope it would help my 11 year old springer spaniels glaucoma.  I wanted to give it time to work and it DID!!  Most all of the brown color is back and she can see much better especially at night.  It worked for Teeka and should work for your dog too.</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful product...truly so. My experience is that it does exactly what it is supposed to do - quite well so.</li>
            <li> I am using it for less than a month. In two weeks of using it my eyes did not seem as tight, like less pressure.  Also some gunk in corners of each eye every morning. I use a warm cloth to clean and eyes feel good. Eyes are not as dry into 4th week. My greastest burden is the headlilghts at night. I stopped driving at night 5 weeks ago. My daughter told me she had read about this product on line, so that&#x27;s how I found you. I ordered, and two weeks later I ordered again. Less pressire and less tightmess  was already an incentive to reorder.  Well now into my 4th week - - - - two nights ago druving with my husband at the wheel, in a downpour of rain - - - I noticed that the blurr and fireworks around the headlights of oncoming cars had softened. I look forward to see what the next week brings. I take 2 drops in both eyes twice a day and 3 of the pellets by same company twice a day. I have no schedule, just as I feel the need. Drops are good when my eyes are tired , especially afrer being on the computer for a long time.- - - - Will I order again? - - - - YES - - - -</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, so I bought a bottle, It made my labradors eye even cloudier. I threw this stuff in the garbage. I do not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Good product.  I will reorder.</li>
            <li> I used it on my dog where other reviewers had success.  I didn&#x27;t, but it may have halted the growth, but not taken it away.</li>
            <li> I had purchased Cineraria from Herbal Supplements for You.&lt;br /&gt;They shipped from India and it took almost 4 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;Natural Opthalmics, based in Colorado, got them here quickly and they feel much better in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;There is no burning as with the India product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a high quality product delivered quickly!</li>
            <li> Did abs0olutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I buy this product every other month is for my sister she says is great for cataract</li>
            <li> About three years ago I took my precious little nine year old dog, Chelsea to her veterinarian for a problem with a tooth.  Upon exam, the veterinarian mentioned to me that my dog was in the early stages of getting cataracts in her eyes.  Her eyes were getting a light blue cast instead of being her normal deep dark brown. I had been noticing this change in her eyes for about a year.  We discussed the possibility of doing expensive surgery. I was told when the cataracts got worse I should consider this.  Later, a friend told me about Natural Ophthalmics Crystalline Lens/Cineraria Eye drops that could improve and possibly stop early cataracts in HUMANS and the same medication was used successfully with DOGS and CATS. I ordered this product on line (without a prescription) and faithfully started to put two drops in my dogs eyes every day (they do not sting).  Within less than a month I could see a definite improvement and in 3 months the blue cast in her eyes was totally gone!  To prevent the problem from reoccurring I have continued to use this medication in my dogs eyes, just one drop a day in each eye ever since.  Her eyes are still deep brown with no sign of any blue cast or cloudiness. Chelsea is 12 now, and in these three years  I have had several occasions to take her back to the veterinarian.  Each time I have been told upon the exam of her eyes that there is no indication of cataracts seen.  I am certain that these eye drops halted the formation and cleared cataract that was forming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have been told YOU are getting cataracts, or SOMEONE YOU CARE ABOUT was told this, or your OLDER DOG or CAT is in the early stages starting to get them, share this information, certainly start using these eye drops. Don&#x27;t delay!  Your doctor will tell you \\&quot;the cataract has to get bigger before insurance will pay so you may have to wait for that to happen\\&quot; and meanwhile you will suffer a loss in visual acuity which means you won&#x27;t be able to read or safely drive until you have surgery.  Don&#x27;t listen to this!!  Please don&#x27;t wait....get these eye drops and faithfully use them.  These drops won&#x27;t work well if cataracts are advanced. I promise they will stop the cataract process if it is caught in early stages.  You have little to loose, because if the drops don&#x27;t work for you, your doctor will tell you the cataract is still there OR if they do work for you, the doctor will tell you that your cataract is getting BETTER,  or (surprise!) it is GONE (wow!!).  If you doubt, read the reviews on this web site:  http://www.naturaleyecare.com/shop/cineraria-cataract-eye-drops.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I am  Registered Nurse.  FYI, this medication is listed in the PDR (Physician&#x27;s Desk Reference).  This book is the BIBLE for doctors and nurses...when it comes to drugs. You would think that ophthalmologists would be telling their patients about this simple cure and put all of their older patients on this medication to prevent cataracts in the first place. But then again, they stand to make a ton of money from patients and insurance companies removing cataracts.  Most veterinarians don&#x27;t know about this medication, please share this knowledge with them so they can help dogs and cats who are at the beginning stages of cataracts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE November 17, 2014:&lt;br /&gt;Last week I took my dog to a veterinary doctor that is Board Certified in Ophthalmology (a specialist in eye disease and injury).  I wanted to make sure that she no longer had cataracts and I since she is a poodle I wanted to make sure she did not have any other problem with retinal diseases that cause blindness which common with poodles.  My dog is now 12 years old and should have some evidence of cataracts, and three years ago I was told she did have early cataracts and the left eye was the worst. Upon careful/close examination by this doctor I was told, \\&quot;there is NO evidence of any cataract in the left eye, and in the right eye there appears to be a very tinybeginning of a cataract formation\\&quot;.  He went on to say, \\&quot;I can hardly call the lesion in the right eye a cataract because it is so small\\&quot;.  I had told the doctor that my dog had been diagnosed with cataracts in both eyes and the left was the worst, and that her eyes had started to have a pale light blue cast to them, but that blue cast had completely gone away after treating her eyes with these eye drops (which I had brought and shown to him).  He assured me that there are no eye drops available to cure cataracts. I believe this doctor saw the remaining lesion of what had been a larger cataract in the right eye, however Natural Ophthalmics Crystalline Lens Cineraria Eye Drops have reduced that cataract to an almost completely healed lesion. Wit continued use I am sure this tiny cataract will continue to heal and no longer be visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;************************************&lt;br /&gt;The information I have pasted below is taken from the following web site which explains how Crystalline Lens/Cineraria works:  http://www.naturaleyecare.com/shop/cineraria-cataract-eye-drops.html  It reads: \\&quot;Cataracts are a condition which develops as the body, with age, has a harder time providing oxygen, nutrition, detoxification and antioxidants to the cells of the eye&#x27;s lens. There are no blood vessels in the lens, so the body&#x27;s task to provide these nutrients and defenders is a challenge.

            <li> Keeps my dry eye at bay. Cheaper than Restasis. I use them every night and every morning. No problem.  The item arrived sooner than expected.  Great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started my third bottle so I&#x27;ve been using this about 6 months. I have small cataracts in both eyes. I used to get the sun reflecting off the cataract and my stigmatism in my left eye. It was so bad that I installed both a blind and a shade in my office window so the reflection wouldn&#x27;t blind me while working at my computer. I also took one light blub out of the overhead light because the reflection from a little bit behind my left eye was a distraction as it reflected off the stigmatism and cataract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The optometrist said he could see why the two together were causing problems. It would have driven me batty this summer. The only time it&#x27;s bothered me was after I was gone for 8 weeks and was out of my routine of using it 3 times a day. Was using less. Now that I&#x27;m doing it 3 times a day again, I am no longer having a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the change in my balance is unbelievable. It used to be so bad I figured people thought I was drunk. Going to the chiropractor and using my teeter helped some, but it never totally went away until this summer. About 10 years ago I went through balance therapy for it. The therapist said our eyes, knees, and bottom of our feet all contain sensors to help us balance. As we age, they become worn out. Balance therapy is designed to create new sensors. I never got totally free of the balance problems and some days it was worse than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now that my cataracts are greatly reduced, I have nearly perfect balance. I walk nearly every day at a fast clip and now do that without fear of falling. Typing this, I realized that most of the time when I was weaving like I was drunk was when I was outside. I often needed to go slow navigating the backyard to empty the trash. I now suspect that when older people start to have balance problems that it&#x27;s because they have cataracts developing that the eye doctor says are not bad enough to need surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days ago, I realized I was no longer taking a little flashlight with me when I got up in the middle of the night. Now the two night lights guide my way and I don&#x27;t need to turn on a light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These drops have given me my life back as I no longer have to find ways to keep the sun from reflecting off the cataract and my balance is nearly 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you go to the company&#x27;s website at www.natoph.com, it says that it takes 6-9 months to get results. It also tells how the solution works--by increasing oxygen and nutrients to the eye along with detoxifying it. It also says if you are not getting results, then you are probably not taking in enough nutrients for your eyes. It recommends another one of their solutions to give your eyes the nutrients they need to see properly. The site has a locator for finding a doctor who uses these drops with his patients. You can call the company at 1-877-220-9710.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use two other products with them and think they are important. However, I was using both of them before I started the Cataract drops. I start off with a Systane Lubricant Eye Drops, wait a few seconds, then use the Natural eye drops for Cataract. I use both products at least 3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take Solaray Eye Blend SP-23. I started on this herb blend several years ago when I had Bell&#x27;s Palsy and my eyes were so sensitive to light I could hardly function. Every time I took a dose, I made a huge leap forward within 30 minutes. When I run out and don&#x27;t take them, I can tell the difference.en I got up in the middle of the night.

            <li> I have used this product for three months. I have cataract on my right eye. The improvement is a very small. I still find my vision is impaired with the cataract. I apply drops three times daily. I noticed it reduces the glare, but vision is negligibly improved. I am planning to use it as I avoiding surgery and hoping that my right vision improves. At this time, my expectations are much higher than the results. I am praying that my cataract would be reversed as one&#x27;s vision is critical for quality of life.</li>
            <li> OMG I can see clearer. After 2 months of using this product my huband noticed I wasnt wearing my reading glasses anymore. Cant wait until my next eye dotor appointment</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my 10 year old dog. Used it every day for 2 months.</li>
            <li> My dog&#x27;s optamologist said this was ok, but not to expect any miracles for her cataract. She was right.</li>
            <li> My min poodle has cataracts and his eyes were turning an odd blue shade. Since using the drops, his eyes are clearer.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a month and it doesn&#x27;t work. It was a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I compared this product to the Similasan brand I had used previously and&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t feel I got as much benefit from it, however I am pleased with it and&lt;br /&gt;the service of the seller and have recommended it to my associates, and plan&lt;br /&gt;to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Have noticed an improvement in my vision.  Would recumbent this product.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery. Happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using these drops for 5 months and I went back to eye doctor today after about 6 months.  I have a carteract in left eye.  He examined by eyes today and was surprised that the cateract was still the same and not worse.  It is recommended that you use 6-9 months before having another eye exam. At the very least my eyes do not feel so dry and feel more refreshed.</li>
            <li> This product does reduce the amount of floaters.</li>
            <li> I like it so far but only time will show just how much it has helped my dog.  So far I believe it has because his eyes seem more in focus.</li>
            <li> I have a small cataract on my right eye. Before using these drops, I had a diminution in color vision. Since I started using them regularly, the cataract has not gotten bigger, and I have no trouble with color vision.</li>
            <li> I was recommended these drops by my doctor.  He sold me my first bottle for $45.00. I was able to purchase the same product for $15.00. Now that&#x27;s a savings.  I use them regularly &amp; they seem to be helping.</li>
            <li> Daily use...wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Ended up having cataract surgery. It was worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have been using for 3 weeks now, I have noticed a difference in my sight.  I can now see the color in my eyes better after using.&lt;br /&gt;Before the color was very muted and cloudy. I think I have to continue to use it to have more progress, happy so far.</li>
            <li> I love Natural Ophthaimics..for cataract treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I have experienced a very nice improvement which&lt;br /&gt;is probably going to save my having surgery for some&lt;br /&gt;time.</li>
            <li> I had the start of a  cataract and after taking drops for a period of time the VA optometrist said my eyes are healthy.  It seems these drops do work.</li>
            <li> The eye problem that I was having is clearing up. My  friend who suggested I use Cineraria Eye, also used the eye formula&lt;br /&gt;along with the internal formula and is now not wearing eye glasses . He has worn eye glasses for 30 years. I am anticipating discarding the eye glasses.</li>
            <li> I have cataracts and wanted to try something to prolong having surgery.  I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough for long term results, however, the drops are very soothing and my eyes feel more relaxed.  I am quite pleased so far.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 6 months and I have not seen a difference in my vision.</li>
            <li> This product works as stated. It helps prevent cataracts from advancing. I purchase it every three months and save money in the process.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to know if it halted my early progression cataracts, but from the first use, my &#x27;dry eye syndrome&#x27; improved. Am no longer using the drops intended for that. Happy to have found this.</li>
            <li> These feel good in the eye, no stinging. The only difficulty is getting them in my eye as opposed to all over my face...lol</li>
            <li> I like the price and value of this as advertised and posted item. I will give a report in the future as to how it works.</li>
            <li> I bought these drops as the doc said I was starting to get a cataract in my right eye. I have been using this now so I really don&#x27;t know how successful it will be until I go back for a check up.</li>
            <li> I combine these drops with additional drops containing L-Carnosine. Collectively, I have observed his navigational ability is enhanced when the drops are administered. I have prime shipping and it has never failed me!  The consistency  in dosage is imperative or backsliding will occur.  I am looking into a more cost effective approach when ordering. Mercy is a male mixed terrier and has some schnaunzer and maybe some shepard in him. He has taught me many things throughout the years and I am grateful.  Love is an active force, not a passive one......</li>
            <li> I am currently using this product but cannot testify to any changes because of this product at this writing. Maybe I can give an update later if it works as others stated.</li>
            <li> The recommendation is to use this for over a period of 3 plus months, and I haven&#x27;t used it for that long.  I intend to continue using it but can&#x27;t give an accurate review at this time.</li>
            <li> I have been able to see colors brighter and clearer since using this product. I would recommend this product to those that have the beginning of cataracts. It can help.</li>
            <li> I was recently diagnosed with cataracts in both eyes. I&#x27;ve also experienced what I believe is sort of a reaction to the drops used for dilating my eyes. It seems the itching, burning and irritation in my eyes became worse after that. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month in the hope that it would help the cataracts at least. As far as that&#x27;s concerned, I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s been any change. I&#x27;m not sure I will continue using this product after I finish what&#x27;s left. I had expected at least some difference in vision clarity and relief of symptoms. However, that said, I&#x27;m going to a cataract specialist for evaluation next month and will know more after that.</li>

            <li> These drops are a travesty. Each time the drops have been used they have progressively made my dog&#x27;s eyes worse and more cloudy. Each time it has progressively worsened his cataracts. This product is not only a sham but words can not express the feelings I have seeing my beloved pet&#x27;s eyes worsen within Seconds of applying this awful product in his eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a chance the first time, it seemed like it made it worse, then again a second time again I gave the product the benefit of the doubt, again it was applied and immediately the product made his eyes extremely much cloudier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is god awful. And it truly hurts me that I was the one at fault for causing his eyes to get worse at this rate.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Been using it for 1 year and nothing has improved.</li>
            <li> I like it  keeps my eyes clear</li>
            <li> Really, my vision is getting better. I am 50 and don&#x27;t need reading glasses and my night vision is better. My dogs cataracts seem better. She isn&#x27;t as nervous and spooked as she was before these drops. they don&#x27;t hurt and help lots of conditions.</li>
            <li> Works fine--but will need continuous use to really see results.</li>
            <li> havent seen any changes but they do help w dryness; started using them about a month ago, so still waiting on clearance of floaters n other stuff</li>
            <li> This was a re-order--I&#x27;ve been using the drops on my 16 year-old Papillon--and her cataracts don&#x27;t seem to be getting worse.  It appears like the cloudiness over her eyes has been gradually diminishing.  I need to apply it more times per day then I have.  I&#x27;ll keep giving it to her and hopefully keep it from getting worse.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a less costly alternative to clearing up canine cataracts than surgery.  To my surprise and utter joy, after ablout a month or so, I have noticed a change in the clarity.  I will administer and order more if needed to clear up earlier stage cataracts.  My doxie has had the eyes clouding for about 2 years now.  I am using it on our mini pin too.  The price and quality are awesome.  I administer 1 or two drops 2x a day to each eye.  I hold the dropper above the top of head, pull back headskin slightly to make the whites of eyes appear and drop there, so as not to have the dog jump at the drop coming towards their eyes.  YAAAY and kudos to this product!!!  VERY reasonably priced and PRICELESS as it is RESTORING his clarity and vision.  I know what I&#x27;LL be trying when/if I get em!  HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Works well with Homeopathic CATARACT care eye pelletes</li>
            <li> Yes, it did meet  my expections but the full effect will be seen within few more months. So far it makes my eyes less dry and perhaps a bit less cloudy. i notice that the drops along with the Saffron pills make my vision better. i let you know more soon! ;)</li>
            <li> I use this for my dog who&#x27;s eyes started to go cloudy. I spoke with our holistic vet and he recommended them. It hasn&#x27;t completely reversed the issue but it has certainly made it better. It&#x27;s best to start at the first sign of an issue.</li>
            <li> I doubt that this helps, but it did give me hope...until I finally got the cataract surgery which has worked beautifully.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  So far seems to be effective but it will take a while to be sure for this product.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and will continue to use until I have cataract surgery next year.</li>
            <li> Sad to say something in this product made my eyes itch and weep so badly I finally had to stop using it 3 weeks in.  I also didn&#x27;t like the fact that, instead of two smaller vials, the larger bottle can&#x27;t be used up in 30 days (you&#x27;re told to discard it). So it ends up costing more to use than others.  I have now used Schwabe (German) pure fresh cineraria drops with no trouble at all, as well as BriteEyes iii carnosine drops without problems. I couldn&#x27;t use this product long enough to say whether it helped my cataract. But Brite Eyes iii improved my vision in bright sunlight (glare) noticeably in one month, so I&#x27;ll probably stay with it for a few months.  Wish I could have given this one a better rating.</li>
            <li> The drops were sting proof, the problem they did nothing for my cataracts, nothing at all. I tried can-c drops also that did nothing at all. I know have order drops from India and trying them out. They have a sting but I am hopeful they will work. By the way don&#x27;t use the formula that U may see on some sights from doc so and so that DMSO and Vit C has to be made by a Pharmacist by prescription I had a Doctor make it out for me, Don&#x27;t do that one  I used it once and it felt like a hot cigarette was in my eye.Through it in the trash.</li>
            <li> I use it 3xday.  It has kept my cateracts from progressing and not having to get surgery.  Geat product, I highly recommend it.</li>
