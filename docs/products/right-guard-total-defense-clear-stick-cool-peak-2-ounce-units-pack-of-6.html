            <li>Everything came in on time and exactly as ordered - once I run out, I&#x27;ll be ordering more!!!</li>
            <li>Fortunately Drug Store (Online) had this great product</li>
            <li>Good product, but not carried in many stores.</li>
            <li>They all leave some kind of marks on clothing...</li>
            <li>Great price, shipped quick and will order again.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s great having a product available for purchase that you&#x27;re familiar with and that you&#x27;ve been used to using for years!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best anti perspirant I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It is by far the best...</li>
            <li>Not an appropriate item for this kind of purchase.</li>
            <li>This antiperspirant and deodorant is THE most effective under arm product \\&quot;available\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking at this on Amazon, chances are you already know that this is the best deodorant and just want more of it because apparently the world hates us.</li>
            <li>Scent - nice and noticeable but not too strong, just right!&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li>and it is my husbands favorite</li>
            <li>i love the product, but the packaging on one of the deoderants broke at the bottom... is this common?4</li>
            <li>so I love that I got it in bulk.</li>
            <li>but this stuff is so much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, I couldn&#x27;t resist.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in the stores, so I was so glad to find it here.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I could find this online for my husband.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite deodorant</li>
            <li>Wish they put more quality into them though.</li>
            <li>I have used this for so many years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been my favorite for years.  </li>
            <li>Looking cute, feeling cute.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t need to get any more for a while.</li>
            <li>Glad i found it available online, and i  bought a case.</li>
            <li>So glad they were available and in a 6 pack.</li>
            <li>Work good fast shipping</li>
            <li>Good price and very convenient.</li>
            <li>These are his favorite kind and the only kind of deodorant he likes to use.  </li>
            <li>I tried these, and the smell is fine.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the clear stick deodorants aren&#x27;t more popular.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear, dries quickly, smells good, and prevents perspiration.</li>
            <li>He was so excited when this 6 pack arrived.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find this in stores where we live, so I&#x27;m thrilled we can still order online.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best clear solid</li>
            <li>It took quite awhile to clean them.</li>
            <li>This stuff goes on clean.</li>
            <li>of these \\&quot;invisible\\&quot; solids are frauds (even Right Guard&#x27;s!).</li>
            <li>The clear stick is a nice compromise between the two.</li>
            <li>Well this is a good deal, 6 sticks in a fresh smelling and inconspicuous box that&#x27;ll last you for years.</li>
            <li>Glad to see I can bulk order on Amazon every few months and be good to go.</li>
            <li>Traveling -  won&#x27;t leak thru plane or camping when environment conditions can quickly hit extremes</li>
            <li>Dry, Smell Good,</li>
            <li>Thanks for being available.</li>
            <li>Make sure it says \\&quot;clear stick\\&quot; on it, and not \\&quot;invisible solid\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Many retail outlets carry the &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34;, but not the old standby.</li>
            <li>Rumor is that it&#x27;s not being made anymore, and most stores that carried it only have it available online.</li>
            <li>It Right Guard, what can I say.</li>
            <li>My husband likes using right guard...</li>
            <li>Right Guard is all that you need.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon is the only place we have been able to find this product now and at a super price of $3 each.  </li>
            <li>Love the clear stick--non-staining, long lasting, great scent.</li>
            <li>I have tried many others over the years, but was also saddened when my local stores stopped carrying the Right Guard.</li>
            <li>The smell is manly, nothing extremely special but smells fine enough.  </li>
            <li>They have brought it back, and it is better than ever.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it soaked through my shirt.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>The only thing that does better is Certain-Dri</li>
            <li>I was very unhappy when I learned that the manufacturer had discontinued it,  and very happy when I was able to buy a 3 year supply on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>truly and honestly is the only clear stick on the market.  </li>
            <li>Better than the gel or the solid that are presently available in local stores.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>smell much better than I do without it and my pits aren&#x27;t all drippy wet.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Dial stopped making these two products so they are getting to be very scarce in stores.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t even find this brand in stores, I just love clear sticks and have been using this particular brand for several years and they don&#x27;t leave any powder or sticky residue!</li>
            <li>This is the only deodorant my husband will wear and the only place we&#x27;ve been able to find it.</li>
            <li>My wife even likes the smell better than the same fragrance in the solid stick.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to most deodorants but this one is the only one i have found that actually doesn&#x27;t give me a rash.</li>
            <li>Now he has enough to last a good long time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>He opens every one, doesn&#x27;t find what he&#x27;s looking for and goes on his rant about how much he loves the clear sticks and doesn&#x27;t understand why we can&#x27;t find them.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if they are suitable for use.</li>
            <li>My favorite deodorant, long lasting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using this brand for years and having an outdoor, physical type job demanded I use something extra strong.</li>
            <li>The Clear Stick line is becoming much more difficult to find in stores...</li>
            <li>early high school any way.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly the same as the Xtreme stick ( Just a new label ).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product itself is one I&#x27;ve used for close to a decade possibly and as someone who tends to sweat almost exclusively through his armpits, it&#x27;s phenomenal compared to other products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is why Right Guard Total Defense 5 - Clear Stick (and Soft &amp; Dri Pulse) blows away its competition:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s not the clear stick, you&#x27;re going to get the deodorant flakes, marks, etc.</li>
            <li>I like the clear solids and this does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Have been using Clear Stick for years.  </li>
            <li>This product is \\&quot;actually\\&quot; clear like it states...</li>
            <li>Every time my husband and I are shopping anywhere that sells deodorant we spend about 15 minutes in the deodorant aisle looking for a clear stick.  </li>
            <li>These are actually clear, stick deodorants.  </li>
            <li>I checked three supermarkets near me.</li>
            <li>The simple things we count on really are missed when they disappear.</li>
            <li>No Irritations - no allergic reaction for those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This RIGHT GUARD Total Defense 5 - Clear Stick (and the female comparable SOFT &amp; DRI Pulse also made by Dial Corp.)</li>
            <li>As others have said, this has the true clear apperance of the gels without the gooey mess.</li>
            <li>Too bad their management felt they had to change a good thing!</li>
            <li>The package arrived promptly, the price was a significant discount, and I have no need to worry for a few months.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear like a gel (so no messy residue), but not wet</li>
            <li>If you push lightly to apply it, not enough gets on your skin to do anything, and if you push too hard, too much gets on you</li>
            <li>All of their new products are slippery goop or white powder that stains.....</li>
            <li>It holds up during his 10 hour work days and because it is a clear stick, there is no white residue.</li>
            <li>This is the only clear stick on the market that I&#x27;ve found, so it doesn&#x27;t mess-up your shirts, flake all over the place and works well.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll go back to Old Spice gel</li>
            <li>Alot of deodorants say they&#x27;re invivsble solid, but it is a complete farse...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to deodorants that contain alcohol, they make my skin crack and burn, but this deodorant is the only one that doesn&#x27;t do that because it doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol.</li>
            <li>Long lasting - truly lasts all day in hot and humid conditions, even into the next day</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly active, I run and workout at least 5-7 days a week, so I put this on more than once a day</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love the clear stick--non-staining, long lasting, great scent.</li>
            <li> I have tried many others over the years, but was also saddened when my local stores stopped carrying the Right Guard.</li>
            <li> The smell is manly, nothing extremely special but smells fine enough.  </li>
            <li> They have brought it back, and it is better than ever.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it soaked through my shirt.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> The only thing that does better is Certain-Dri</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy when I learned that the manufacturer had discontinued it,  and very happy when I was able to buy a 3 year supply on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> truly and honestly is the only clear stick on the market.  </li>
            <li> Better than the gel or the solid that are presently available in local stores.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> smell much better than I do without it and my pits aren&#x27;t all drippy wet.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Dial stopped making these two products so they are getting to be very scarce in stores.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even find this brand in stores, I just love clear sticks and have been using this particular brand for several years and they don&#x27;t leave any powder or sticky residue!</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant my husband will wear and the only place we&#x27;ve been able to find it.</li>
            <li> My wife even likes the smell better than the same fragrance in the solid stick.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most deodorants but this one is the only one i have found that actually doesn&#x27;t give me a rash.</li>
            <li> Now he has enough to last a good long time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> He opens every one, doesn&#x27;t find what he&#x27;s looking for and goes on his rant about how much he loves the clear sticks and doesn&#x27;t understand why we can&#x27;t find them.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if they are suitable for use.</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant, long lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using this brand for years and having an outdoor, physical type job demanded I use something extra strong.</li>
            <li> The Clear Stick line is becoming much more difficult to find in stores...</li>
            <li> early high school any way.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly the same as the Xtreme stick ( Just a new label ).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product itself is one I&#x27;ve used for close to a decade possibly and as someone who tends to sweat almost exclusively through his armpits, it&#x27;s phenomenal compared to other products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is why Right Guard Total Defense 5 - Clear Stick (and Soft &amp; Dri Pulse) blows away its competition:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not the clear stick, you&#x27;re going to get the deodorant flakes, marks, etc.</li>
            <li> I like the clear solids and this does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Have been using Clear Stick for years.  </li>
            <li> This product is \\&quot;actually\\&quot; clear like it states...</li>
            <li> Every time my husband and I are shopping anywhere that sells deodorant we spend about 15 minutes in the deodorant aisle looking for a clear stick.  </li>
            <li> These are actually clear, stick deodorants.  </li>
            <li> I checked three supermarkets near me.</li>
            <li> The simple things we count on really are missed when they disappear.</li>
            <li> No Irritations - no allergic reaction for those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This RIGHT GUARD Total Defense 5 - Clear Stick (and the female comparable SOFT &amp; DRI Pulse also made by Dial Corp.)</li>
            <li> As others have said, this has the true clear apperance of the gels without the gooey mess.</li>
            <li> Too bad their management felt they had to change a good thing!</li>
            <li> The package arrived promptly, the price was a significant discount, and I have no need to worry for a few months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear like a gel (so no messy residue), but not wet</li>
            <li> If you push lightly to apply it, not enough gets on your skin to do anything, and if you push too hard, too much gets on you</li>
            <li> All of their new products are slippery goop or white powder that stains.....</li>
            <li> It holds up during his 10 hour work days and because it is a clear stick, there is no white residue.</li>
            <li> This is the only clear stick on the market that I&#x27;ve found, so it doesn&#x27;t mess-up your shirts, flake all over the place and works well.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll go back to Old Spice gel</li>
            <li> Alot of deodorants say they&#x27;re invivsble solid, but it is a complete farse...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to deodorants that contain alcohol, they make my skin crack and burn, but this deodorant is the only one that doesn&#x27;t do that because it doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol.</li>
            <li> Long lasting - truly lasts all day in hot and humid conditions, even into the next day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly active, I run and workout at least 5-7 days a week, so I put this on more than once a day</li>
            <li> getting really hard to find this in the stores, my hubby, daughter and I all use this exact type because of the sensitivities we&#x27;ve found with other brands--even other right guard brands.  </li>
            <li> For every pack of these you buy, at least 2 sticks aren&#x27;t manufactured right</li>
            <li> Okay - this a little silly but can&#x27;t find the Clear Stick reliably locally (CVS, Target, RiteAid, ShopRite).</li>
            <li> Oh by the way did I say that it is also long lasting.  </li>
            <li> - so not too wet, not dry</li>
            <li> This ONLY happens occasionally but other than that</li>
            <li> I prefer the smell of the other one, but the shipping is so much more expensive</li>
            <li> like it&#x27;s been sitting in a warehouse somewhere for too long.</li>
            <li> Gel is much too sloppy and leaves you feeling wet, while invisible solid is white -- and will still leave white marks on shirts -- and is rough to apply.  </li>
            <li> Tried some other stile and brands but this is the only one that works for me.</li>
            <li> None of the cake-like residue you get with every other solid on the market.</li>
            <li> It takes FOREVER to dry on your skin.  </li>
            <li> (so you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to dry).</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts and keeps me dry.  </li>
            <li> Safer - contains only 8.6% of active ingredient compared to 2x</li>
            <li> Truly a clear stick - looks clear, goes on clear, and doesn&#x27;t dirty clothes</li>
            <li> By mid day on an average temperarure day, I was in rough shape ( phew !)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a very thick gel that goes on very gloppy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s undergone various packaging changes and a few scent changes in the time I&#x27;ve used it but for my $</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on wet and sticky.  </li>
            <li> Every time I&#x27;ve used it I&#x27;ve ended up having to wipe my armpits down with a dry cloth to get the excess off.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant and I was disappointed when the took it off the market.</li>
            <li> no more white stains on your pits!</li>
            <li> that of all other products&lt;</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that &amp;#34;sometimes&amp;#34; the stick crumbles leading me to believe the product itself is stale and old....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find locally and it works.  </li>
            <li> This is the ONLY deodorant I use, and have been using now for at least 4 years now.</li>
            <li> Usually the choices are limited to gel and &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> WOOHoo...sore one for the black T-shirt.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t find something comparable for me!</li>
            <li> I personally like this stuff and hate changing to a new product as they tend to burn or not work as well etc.</li>
            <li> One stick usually lasts about 3 months.</li>
            <li> So hard to find in stores around here</li>
            <li> since this product has become so hard to find  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li> Because of a problem with irritations, he was unable to use anything else.  </li>
            <li> Seems crazy to be writing a review about deodorant....</li>
            <li> Too bad not sold in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I hate this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for years was very disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore in the store.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed when it was taken from the store.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My husband was in a panic.  He could not find this product in the only store chain that he knew carried it.  Because of a problem with irritations, he was unable to use anything else.  This is when I suggested that we check on Amazon and we found it.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant product I&#x27;m found in 76 years and now they&#x27;ve stopped making it !!!  All of their new products are slippery goop or white powder that stains.....only &amp;#34;Clear Stick&amp;#34; had it all.  Too bad their management felt they had to change a good thing!</li>
            <li> That the only deodorant that works on me an not make me smell expired</li>
            <li> Great product. Delivered on time. Perfect.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  It is the only product that my husband can use.  No longer do I have to try the is product in the stores.  Thanks for being available.</li>
            <li> Okay - this a little silly but can&#x27;t find the Clear Stick reliably locally (CVS, Target, RiteAid, ShopRite).</li>
            <li> Excellent, never discontinue this item!</li>
            <li> It Right Guard, what can I say. I buy it on here because I can&#x27;t  find a stick of it any where in a 150 mile radius of home. I&#x27;ve been using this some brand and style since 15 or 16... early high school any way. It&#x27;s undergone various packaging changes and a few scent changes in the time I&#x27;ve used it but for my $ it&#x27;s the best clear solid I&#x27;ve found and it works. WOOHoo...sore one for the black T-shirt.</li>
            <li> Solves the problem of Drugstores never having the deodorant you use...what a bonus.</li>
            <li> So hard to find in stores around here and it is my husbands favorite</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the Right Guard deodorant. I have used it for several years.</li>
            <li> Great product no stores have it</li>
            <li> The best for not caking and coming off in clothes.  It has a good sporty smell too. Try some today.</li>
            <li> having issues with the bottom falling out.. i love the product, but the packaging on one of the deoderants broke at the bottom... is this common?4</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant and I was disappointed when the took it off the market. They have brought it back, and it is better than ever.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the clear stick deodorants aren&#x27;t more popular. I&#x27;ve had to buy this at the grocery store for the last two years because all the big box stores don&#x27;t seem to ever carry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of these \\&quot;invisible\\&quot; solids are frauds (even Right Guard&#x27;s!). If it&#x27;s not the clear stick, you&#x27;re going to get the deodorant flakes, marks, etc. to some extent. As others have said, this has the true clear apperance of the gels without the gooey mess.</li>
            <li> I hate this stuff.  They say it&#x27;s a stick.  It&#x27;s really a very thick gel that goes on very gloppy.  The first time I used it, it soaked through my shirt.  It&#x27;s done it every time since.  It takes FOREVER to dry on your skin.  Every time I&#x27;ve used it I&#x27;ve ended up having to wipe my armpits down with a dry cloth to get the excess off.  I wish I had never bought it.  If you push lightly to apply it, not enough gets on your skin to do anything, and if you push too hard, too much gets on you and I&#x27;ve actually had clumps of it drop to the floor!  I think I&#x27;ll go back to Old Spice gel although I haven&#x27;t been too happy with that either.</li>
            <li> Good product, but not carried in many stores.</li>
            <li> Work good fast shipping</li>
            <li> Sill the best non-staining anti-perspirant</li>
            <li> Best deodorant on the market. Too bad not sold in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking at this on Amazon, chances are you already know that this is the best deodorant and just want more of it because apparently the world hates us. Well this is a good deal, 6 sticks in a fresh smelling and inconspicuous box that&#x27;ll last you for years.</li>
            <li> Have use this products for years -- when I had problem with both he gels and solid sticks. This anti-P works, smell great and doesn&#x27;t fade or run.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that &amp;#34;sometimes&amp;#34; the stick crumbles leading me to believe the product itself is stale and old....like it&#x27;s been sitting in a warehouse somewhere for too long. This ONLY happens occasionally but other than that, it&#x27;s great having a product available for purchase that you&#x27;re familiar with and that you&#x27;ve been used to using for years!</li>
            <li> Great price, shipped quick and will order again.</li>
            <li> Great seller, great prices, will be doing business again,  thx</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!! i was glad to see it for sale on  Amazon!!</li>
            <li> The only deodorant my husband will use. I can&#x27;t find it anywhere anymore so I love that I got it in bulk. Great deodorant!</li>
            <li> I like the clear solids and this does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I smell much better than I do without it and my pits aren&#x27;t all drippy wet.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Great product. Have been using Clear Stick for years.  Happy to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My husband likes using right guard...</li>
            <li> My husband prefers this brand and got it at a great price.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant my husband will wear and the only place we&#x27;ve been able to find it. It holds up during his 10 hour work days and because it is a clear stick, there is no white residue. My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t find something comparable for me!</li>
            <li> I checked three supermarkets near me. Seems this is not being sold in stores. I personally like this stuff and hate changing to a new product as they tend to burn or not work as well etc. Glad to see I can bulk order on Amazon every few months and be good to go.</li>
            <li> Seems crazy to be writing a review about deodorant.... but this stuff is so much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, I couldn&#x27;t resist.  It doesn&#x27;t go on wet and sticky.  And, best yet, it doesn&#x27;t ever leave those nasty white marks that can get on your clothes.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in the stores, so I was so glad to find it here.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Have use this products for years -- when I had problem with both he gels and solid sticks.  This anti-P works, smell great and doesn&#x27;t give me a rash.  My wife even likes the smell better than the same fragrance in the solid stick.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best anti perspirant I have ever used.  I provides lasting protection, it doesn&#x27;t stain clothes and causes me no allergic reaction.  I was very unhappy when I learned that the manufacturer had discontinued it,  and very happy when I was able to buy a 3 year supply on Amazon.  Oh by the way did I say that it is also long lasting.  One stick usually lasts about 3 months.</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant, long lasting.</li>
            <li> Everything just as described.  Good purchase</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find in stores anymore!  I have used this for years was very disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore in the store. Tried some other stile and brands but this is the only one that works for me. Wish it was back in stores because it lasts and works. Was very disappointed when it was taken from the store. I&#x27;m telling you this works all day and then some if you are out on a camp out with out a shower for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> This brand, style and scent are just o.k.  It&#x27;s my fault, I can&#x27;t remember which one my husband prefers !</li>
            <li> getting really hard to find this in the stores, my hubby, daughter and I all use this exact type because of the sensitivities we&#x27;ve found with other brands--even other right guard brands.  We will be buying up all the ones we can find.</li>
            <li> This is the best antiperspirant/deodorant there is. It goes on clear, dries quickly, smells good, and prevents perspiration. This is the ONLY antiperspirant/deodorant that I have found that has all of these qualities.</li>
            <li> since this product has become so hard to find  i was more than happy to come across it on  amazon .for me this product is very effective</li>
            <li> Better than the gel or the solid that are presently available in local stores. Does not leave a residue on the clothes.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever. Alot of deodorants say they&#x27;re invivsble solid, but it is a complete farse... They all leave some kind of marks on clothing... This product is \\&quot;actually\\&quot; clear like it states... It is by far the best... Make sure it says \\&quot;clear stick\\&quot; on it, and not \\&quot;invisible solid\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores.  Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Every time my husband and I are shopping anywhere that sells deodorant we spend about 15 minutes in the deodorant aisle looking for a clear stick.  He opens every one, doesn&#x27;t find what he&#x27;s looking for and goes on his rant about how much he loves the clear sticks and doesn&#x27;t understand why we can&#x27;t find them.  He was so excited when this 6 pack arrived.  These are actually clear, stick deodorants.  These are his favorite kind and the only kind of deodorant he likes to use.  The smell is manly, nothing extremely special but smells fine enough.  I prefer the smell of the other one, but the shipping is so much more expensive I tried these, and the smell is fine.</li>
            <li> My husband says it&#x27;s the only deodorant that works for him</li>
            <li> I can no longer find this in stores. I&#x27;m glad I could find this online for my husband. He hates gels, and the so-called &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; solids still leave white marks.</li>
            <li> The Clear Stick line is becoming much more difficult to find in stores... Usually the choices are limited to gel and &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; solid... Gel is much too sloppy and leaves you feeling wet, while invisible solid is white -- and will still leave white marks on shirts -- and is rough to apply.  The clear stick is a nice compromise between the two.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> My husbands pits smell legit.</li>
            <li> Thankfully Amazon sells this stuff.  It&#x27;s hard to find locally and it works.  Will not grease up your armpit like a gel and will last all day in the summer heat.</li>
            <li> Love the clear stick--non-staining, long lasting, great scent.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even find this brand in stores, I just love clear sticks and have been using this particular brand for several years and they don&#x27;t leave any powder or sticky residue!</li>
            <li> For every pack of these you buy, at least 2 sticks aren&#x27;t manufactured right and you can&#x27;t even use them. This is my favorite deodorant so I&#x27;ll keep getting them. Wish they put more quality into them though.</li>
            <li> No problems at all with this vendor.</li>
            <li> Right Guard is all that you need.</li>
            <li> Many retail outlets carry the &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34;, but not the old standby. Amazon to the rescue! Good price and very convenient.</li>
            <li> This is the only antiperspirant that works for me PERIOD. I have tried many others over the years, but was also saddened when my local stores stopped carrying the Right Guard. Fortunately Drug Store (Online) had this great product and I get six at a time. Works great and I smell nice no matter what! (My family lets me know....) Thanks.</li>
            <li> A scent I haven&#x27;t been able to get in quite some time from nearby stores: very happy with the transaction! Everything came in on time and exactly as ordered - once I run out, I&#x27;ll be ordering more!!! Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product itself is one I&#x27;ve used for close to a decade possibly and as someone who tends to sweat almost exclusively through his armpits, it&#x27;s phenomenal compared to other products. The only thing that does better is Certain-Dri but I don&#x27;t like to use it daily. Plus with this scent, I used to get a lot of compliments about the &#x27;cologne&#x27; I was wearing. 5 out of 5 stars for sure!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly the same as the Xtreme stick ( Just a new label ). Just what I wanted ! Would definately purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is our favorite deodorant, and it&#x27;s difficult to find in stores --this is the perfect way to buy it!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this in the stores anymore, so this was a great find and value...love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Dry, Smell Good, No stick No crust. PERFECT!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> What a convenient way to get continued-use products!  The package arrived promptly, the price was a significant discount, and I have no need to worry for a few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using this brand for years and having an outdoor, physical type job demanded I use something extra strong. I never had an issue even after sweltering days in the sun. When my local grocery store and drug store stopped stocking it I had to try something else. By mid day on an average temperarure day, I was in rough shape ( phew !)&lt;br /&gt;  Glad i found it available online, and i  bought a case. The simple things we count on really are missed when they disappear.</li>
            <li> I have used this for so many years. All of a sudden I can&#x27;t find it anywhere. So I bought enough to last me for a while</li>
            <li> This is the only clear stick on the market that I&#x27;ve found, so it doesn&#x27;t mess-up your shirts, flake all over the place and works well. Rumor is that it&#x27;s not being made anymore, and most stores that carried it only have it available online. I&#x27;ve emailed 3 times and the manufacturer will not confirm that. So, buy &#x27;em while you can, before some of the vendors jack the prices up.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most deodorants but this one is the only one i have found that actually doesn&#x27;t give me a rash. I love it and buy bulk packs from amazon!</li>
            <li> All six units were covered in a sticky gel. It took quite awhile to clean them. Not sure if they are suitable for use. No doubt they were stored, packaged or shipped at an inappropriate temperature. I put them outside in the freezing temp to see if they solid back up. Not an appropriate item for this kind of purchase. Lesson learned!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this in stores where we live, so I&#x27;m thrilled we can still order online. It&#x27;s clear like a gel (so no messy residue), but not wet (so you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to dry). It also smells great on my man. :)</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant that doesn&#x27;t irritate my armpits. I&#x27;m sensitive to deodorants that contain alcohol, they make my skin crack and burn, but this deodorant is the only one that doesn&#x27;t do that because it doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol. I&#x27;m fairly active, I run and workout at least 5-7 days a week, so I put this on more than once a day and it works great. It smells great, not too strong, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate. This is the ONLY deodorant I use, and have been using now for at least 4 years now.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this deodorant. We started having difficulty finding it in store.  Now he has enough to last a good long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this repeatedly.  It&#x27;s been my favorite for years.  I&#x27;m so glad I can buy these by the case at a discount!</li>
            <li> The only product that does not cause a rash under my arms.  I buy these 6 at a time.</li>
            <li> All time favorite deodorant! Doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts and keeps me dry.  I hope they never stop making this!</li>
            <li> Looking cute, feeling cute.</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on clean. None of the cake-like residue you get with every other solid on the market. It&#x27;s a shame you can&#x27;t find these in stores anymore. No one is making anything like it either.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find these in stores as they have been discontinued. So glad they were available and in a 6 pack. I won&#x27;t need to get any more for a while. Maybe they will bring this product back by then. Thanks.</li>
            <li> no more white stains on your pits!</li>
            <li> Why Dial Corporation stopped manufacturing this product defies all logic.  This RIGHT GUARD Total Defense 5 - Clear Stick (and the female comparable SOFT &amp; DRI Pulse also made by Dial Corp.) truly and honestly is the only clear stick on the market.  This antiperspirant and deodorant is THE most effective under arm product \\&quot;available\\&quot;.  Dial stopped making these two products so they are getting to be very scarce in stores.  Stock up now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is why Right Guard Total Defense 5 - Clear Stick (and Soft &amp; Dri Pulse) blows away its competition:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Truly a clear stick - looks clear, goes on clear, and doesn&#x27;t dirty clothes&lt;br /&gt;2.  Solid - so not too wet, not dry and you can get dressed immediately&lt;br /&gt;3.  Scent - nice and noticeable but not too strong, just right!&lt;br /&gt;4.  Long lasting - truly lasts all day in hot and humid conditions, even into the next day&lt;br /&gt;5.  Safer - contains only 8.6% of active ingredient compared to 2x that of all other products&lt;br /&gt;6.  Traveling -  won&#x27;t leak thru plane or camping when environment conditions can quickly hit extremes&lt;br /&gt;7.  No Irritations - no allergic reaction for those with sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is the only place we have been able to find this product now and at a super price of $3 each.  Thank you Amazon!</li>
