            <li>I received your products as a \\&quot;gag\\&quot; gift, it&#x27;s the best gift.  </li>
            <li>It works wonderfully the smell of the poo-pourri has a great aroma..</li>
            <li>I had to use this product out-of-town over a friends house and was so happy to have it and not the leave the restroom &#x27;eeeeew&#x27; smelly.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great item.</li>
            <li>I love it great great great.</li>
            <li>Have a good one</li>
            <li>Another spray would have been nice, I didn&#x27;t remember ordering wipes.....</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice residual smell, not too overpowering but just nice.  </li>
            <li>She got a great laugh</li>
            <li>I love Poo-Pourri.</li>
            <li>I though would have a more variety of its product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t take it with me in my purse and feel confident.</li>
            <li>It worked. :)</li>
            <li>Course I asked each one to be sure to use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before and love it.  </li>
            <li>So much better than the &amp;#34;after sprays&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I actually love the product, even though the original scent smells like lemon Pledge.  </li>
            <li>The original smells like lemon pledge and leaves the guest bathroom smelling like nothing ever happened.  </li>
            <li>Prompt delivery, clean package.  </li>
            <li>By the Barrow Full..</li>
            <li>I have given this as a gift to many friends and once they get over the laugh/ shock/ joking part and actually used it, they all love it too.</li>
            <li>Lots of fun giving it for gifts.</li>
            <li>most of all, surprisingly useful for what seemed to be such a novelty item.</li>
            <li>Now we can invest in new paint, new fixtures for the guest bath and not worry about any more melted seats..</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying more of this, probably in a different scent, in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>As funny as it is it is even better that it actually works.</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>done, funny, but</li>
            <li>Works very well and smells mild like natural ginger</li>
            <li>(he couldnt laugh loud though)</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>even found that the local store near me is selling these.</li>
            <li>Poo-Pourri may look like a gag gift, at least if you go by the ridiculous compendium of sophomoric puns that make out the name of the products in its catalog.&lt;br /&gt;However, the bottles and labels are very well made and look posh, and even better, the product actually works -- so you can keep it on a shelf in the guest bathroom, as a subtle hint -- or keep one in your own if you want to put a stop to romance killers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>

            <li> Working 13 hour shifts, eating not optimally balanced food, and typically having the staff toilets near the lockers , this product is a godsend.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter that most are Crazy Musician Types and the party is for the neighborhood, church, family, friends of my Children, Birthdays etc.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s last dying breath the other</li>
            <li> But, at least 50% is better than what they had been leaving behind.</li>
            <li> My only issue with it is that the travel size wasn&#x27;t even big enough to last a whole month, so I was a little sad when it gave</li>
            <li> the only issue is the spray pump does not work well and gives out when you are down to 2 or 3 ounces.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t  as expected.</li>
            <li> 20 day old dead fish, dead bodies,</li>

            <li> We have several friends that are ALWAYS dropping by invited or not and usually at parties that we are throwing.</li>
            <li> I plan on using it soon because I am going to be spending some time in hotel rooms with other people and don&#x27;t want to stink up the room.</li>
            <li> I took it on a cruise where I shared a room (and a bathroom) with 3 other ladies.</li>
            <li> The spray nozzles do leak after a while which is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> ; which are so heavy.</li>
            <li> Its SO BAD that when we had Black Lights on for a Party when the Door opened a creeping glowing greenish live fog followed one out and attacked a person nearby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought this to take on vacation as family was sharing small quarters.  </li>

            <li> I love Poo-Pourri. I have given this as a gift to many friends and once they get over the laugh/ shock/ joking part and actually used it, they all love it too.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully the smell of the poo-pourri has a great aroma..it just works just like they say it will.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves to come to my apartment and s*** up the bathroom. I bought the gift set as a gift for someone else, but bought a 2 oz bottle for me and OHMYGOD, it totally works.  &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> I actually love the product, even though the original scent smells like lemon Pledge.  My only issue with it is that the travel size wasn&#x27;t even big enough to last a whole month, so I was a little sad when it gave it&#x27;s last dying breath the other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying more of this, probably in a different scent, in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.5/5 stars</li>
            <li> The travel kit I though would have a more variety of its product. The wipes they provided I won&#x27;t use, I would have preferred a key ring spray size container.</li>
            <li> I love it great great great. I can&#x27;t take it with me in my purse and feel confident. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> It actually works!&lt;br /&gt;I even found that the local store near me is selling these. As funny as it is it is even better that it actually works.</li>
            <li> Given to a traveling family member. It worked. :)</li>
            <li> It really works!  The original smells like lemon pledge and leaves the guest bathroom smelling like nothing ever happened.  The spray nozzles do leak after a while which is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Got it for my friends wife the video on youtube sold it for me.  She got a great laugh (he couldnt laugh loud though) Would buy again</li>
            <li> We have several friends that are ALWAYS dropping by invited or not and usually at parties that we are throwing. Doesn&#x27;t matter that most are Crazy Musician Types and the party is for the neighborhood, church, family, friends of my Children, Birthdays etc. They ALL know to check locations as to where and when and THERE they ARE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW, it&#x27;s not that they are not invited. Even though they ARE..these THREE out of FIVE and You ALL KNOW whom IM writing about,&lt;br /&gt;These Three have the WORST BOWEL Habits of any Human&#x27;s Ive been around....no kidding. And I have gone in NY Dive Bars, Junky Bars, Rodeo Bathrooms You name it Ive even had to use an Outhouse Several Times where you spread Lyme on your Droppings...That place also attracted Raccoon&#x27;s and Maybe a Skunk...Nothing compares to these guys foul odors that they eliminate from their backsides.. NOTHING. 20 day old dead fish, dead bodies, Im guessing..Cows that have MAD Cow and have been feed Chili with Peppers..By the Barrow Full..Wild Dogs and Lions that have Killed and eaten Dead Skunk Scent Saks...Tigers that have eaten some Missionary&#x27;s that were RELATED to these Guys.. I swear the last time a GUEST of Ours went AFTER one came out just having finished projectile vomiting the dinner that night.&lt;br /&gt;Course I WARN those that I CAN Never Ever Strike a Match behind these guys and Never carry a smoke in after them. Its SO BAD that when we had Black Lights on for a Party when the Door opened a creeping glowing greenish live fog followed one out and attacked a person nearby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, TO THE POOPOURI.....IT DID NOT STAND A CHANCE but, TG it does work...about 50% of the Stench was eliminated. Course I asked each one to be sure to use it. They may have used it wrong Who Knows..But, at least 50% is better than what they had been leaving behind. Now we can invest in new paint, new fixtures for the guest bath and not worry about any more melted seats..Have a good one</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  I had to use this product out-of-town over a friends house and was so happy to have it and not the leave the restroom &#x27;eeeeew&#x27; smelly.  Buy it, for those places that you don&#x27;t want to be embarrassed if you have &#x27;to go&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Works very well and smells mild like natural ginger the only issue is the spray pump does not work well and gives out when you are down to 2 or 3 ounces.  For the price you pay they need to fix the spray pump. I have tried it several times in several sizes and the pump is always an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tina</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet since I haven&#x27;t traveled anywhere.  I plan on using it soon because I am going to be spending some time in hotel rooms with other people and don&#x27;t want to stink up the room.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t  as expected. I had ordered from them before and got multiple sprays. This was disappointing. One bigger spray, one smaller spray and a bunch of wipes. Being allergic to practically everything, I won&#x27;t even bother to try the wipes. Another spray would have been nice, I didn&#x27;t remember ordering wipes.....</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery, clean package.  I&#x27;ve used this product before and love it.  Leaves a nice residual smell, not too overpowering but just nice.  I bought this for a friend who is a nurse.  Working 13 hour shifts, eating not optimally balanced food, and typically having the staff toilets near the lockers , this product is a godsend.</li>
            <li> Great product. I took it on a cruise where I shared a room (and a bathroom) with 3 other ladies. It worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> Bought this to take on vacation as family was sharing small quarters.  Worked like a charm.  Even have it at work.</li>
            <li> Poo-Pourri may look like a gag gift, at least if you go by the ridiculous compendium of sophomoric puns that make out the name of the products in its catalog.&lt;br /&gt;However, the bottles and labels are very well made and look posh, and even better, the product actually works -- so you can keep it on a shelf in the guest bathroom, as a subtle hint -- or keep one in your own if you want to put a stop to romance killers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done, funny, but most of all, surprisingly useful for what seemed to be such a novelty item. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my sis after I used some of the stuff.  Works very well.  I now leave it in a discrete place in our guest bath.  So much better than the &amp;#34;after sprays&amp;#34; which are so heavy.</li>
            <li> Great item. Lots of fun giving it for gifts.</li>
            <li> I received your products as a \\&quot;gag\\&quot; gift, it&#x27;s the best gift.  I have an illeostomy which turns out to be quite smelly, it truly works</li>
