            <li> It was what I expected</li>
            <li> I also found them not exactly what I wanted: to hold neck scarves, so small, some heavier and larger.</li>

            <li> I know they&#x27;re inexpensive, but that doesn&#x27;t excuse workmanship so poor.</li>
            <li> Could use with very thin scarves only</li>
