            <li>it is really convenient and does not leak</li>
            <li>The sprayer works very well.  </li>
            <li>you will need to make sure it is screwed on tightly and it will noe leak</li>
            <li>Love this little atomizer.</li>
            <li>Used it twice and always have trouble getting the top part to screw on to the bottom part.  </li>
            <li>Would also be a fabulous purse bottle because the glass is thick enough to be safe.</li>
            <li>The tiny funnel doesn&#x27;t really work, it takes a lot of patience to transfer perfume from large bottles into these.</li>
            <li>I have so many small</li>
            <li>I checked the larger perfume bottle I poured it from to make sure it wasn&#x27;t the perfume itself, and it wasn&#x27;t - it was only the bit I poured into this smaller bottle, so</li>
            <li>Pretty enough to sit out on your dresser.</li>
            <li>The opening is large enough that you don&#x27;t need the funnel if you are using a sample vial.  </li>
            <li>These are fantastic little perfume bottles.  </li>
            <li>NATURAL COSMETICS</li>

            <li> now I can take my favorite and my husbands favorite cologne with me anywhere it is really convenient and does not leak</li>
            <li> These bottles are very pretty and easy to fill.  However, I noticed within days that the cologne was slowly leaking out.  It wasn&#x27;t from use.  The product just oozed out into the air.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and I love the tiny funnel that comes along for easy pouring.</li>
            <li> this is great!  just what i was looking for!  good price, nice looking and the perfect size.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I had seveal (testers) for a specific fragrence.  I now combined them all in this atomizer, and no more little bottles to deal with.  The mist that it sprays is just the right amount, and is not an overpowering amount.  Plus, it&#x27;s just the right size to carry in my purse.</li>
            <li> Love this little atomizer. Now I don&#x27;t use this as a travel item but rather I decant sample perfumes and use it at home. Good solid construction, high quality materials. Nice solid feel in the hand with a good wide fine spray. I only need one spray per application. Be aware on the picture you see three glass patterns, you will receive one of these not all three. I got the one on the left and LOVE it. Such a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> This came in so handy.  I have so many small&lt;br /&gt;bottles of perfune that are in a plain (splash)&lt;br /&gt;bottle.  This not only allows me to use up that&lt;br /&gt;perfume it always makes it easy to carry with me.&lt;br /&gt;Very cute bottles.</li>
            <li> I LOVE TO MAKE MY OWN  ESSENTIAL OILS AND THIS LITTLE BOTTLES ARE PERFECT FOR WHAT I DO.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS NATURAL COSMETICS</li>
            <li> These are fantastic little perfume bottles.  They&#x27;re excellent for taking your favorite perfume traveling or just having a little in your purse.  The bottles don&#x27;t leak and the nozzles don&#x27;t tend to clog either.</li>
            <li> I received this perfume spray bottle and was initially happy - it&#x27;s pretty, it was easy to fill and it fit perfectly inside my handbag. Everything was great until I actually sprayed the perfume from the bottle for the first time today. The perfume came out smelling like burnt rubber. No exaggeration, the perfume turned from a beautiful floral to the smell of burning tires. It was horrendous and I could not get it off of my skin no matter how hard I scrubbed. It was sickening and made me nauseous. I checked the larger perfume bottle I poured it from to make sure it wasn&#x27;t the perfume itself, and it wasn&#x27;t - it was only the bit I poured into this smaller bottle, so I know the scent came from the bottle and not the perfume. The other reviews are positive, so I&#x27;m not sure if something was wrong with the individual bottle I received, but I will be buying something different after this experience!</li>
            <li> Perfect for carrying in a purse, or storing the last ounce or two from a larger perfume bottle. Pretty enough to sit out on your dresser.</li>
            <li> I bought this atomizer to carry some of my favorite perfume. Everything about it seemed perfect, even when I sprayed it. I made a lovely thick mist.

            <li> I have had two of these for many years.  They are wonderful if you have perfume in a non atomizer and want to travel with it.</li>
            <li> They are nice little tubes made of glass, better than plastic which may change the way the perfume smells.  Well made, small enough for any size purse and the pump works well.  The tiny funnel doesn&#x27;t really work, it takes a lot of patience to transfer perfume from large bottles into these.</li>
            <li> Used it twice and always have trouble getting the top part to screw on to the bottom part.  Not worth the time and aggravation.  Look elsewhere for a travel atomizer.</li>
            <li> Great gifts for my coworkers as Christmas gifts</li>
            <li> I purchased this set and found it very functional and useful for filling my favorite perfumes. The bottles are attractive and easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I purchased this so I can carry my expensive Flower Bomb perfume with me, but the bottle leaked and I lost some of my expensive perfume</li>
            <li> I have had this item for a while now and it works great! also purchased my daughter one and she loves it. This item was packed well and arrived on time. I would order from this company again</li>
            <li> I have discovered that this distributor was NOT responsible for my item not arriving to me, but it was due to a glitch at the Post Office.
