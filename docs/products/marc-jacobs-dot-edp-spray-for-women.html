            <li> My wife was quite surprised when I told her I ordered her a present (not that I don&#x27;t buy her presents but this was really random).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave her a hint, D.O.T.  She could not figure out how her present had anything to do with the Department of Transportation.  A day before it arrived we happened to be shopping at Sams.  As we passed the perfume area I looked at the case and smiled.  She then saw the Dot and put 2 and 2 together.  We had a good laugh and the next day it arrived.  She really loves the scent and I do to.  It&#x27;s sweet smelling and but not sickly sweet or annoying.</li>
            <li> For such a highly rated product, and known name, the sent wasn&#x27;t that great, and it doesn&#x27;t last long. i have tried other products that aren&#x27;t so well known and last longer. I don&#x27;t even use it. In my opinion, it was a waste of money.</li>

            <li> My daughter loves this perfume.  We all thought the container was as bit overdone, however.  Isn&#x27;t it enough to just smell good without an obnoxious eye catcher?</li>
            <li> I was looking for a perfume as a gift. My niece loved it! It arrived just in time for Chrismas.</li>
            <li> The ladybug lid arrived broken.  Since it was so close to Christmas, I had my husband glue it together for me.  It was a good thing, I opened the box to check before I wrapped it.</li>
