            <li>I wear it in the summer because it has a light smell to it.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is the original and it has a serial number both on the bottle and on the box.</li>

            <li> This perfume is so good I was going to buy it at a local store for 55.00 and found it on amazon for 35.00, what a great deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my 17 yr old granddaughter. I was very pleased w/every aspect of my transaction. And, my granddaughter just loves the perfume. She said it is her favorite!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girl friend, because i love the smell whenever she uses it i just smell her all the time.its great fruity teen kinda fragrance, i think most of the people would like to just smell it ....</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and fruity, but it does not last very long.  You have to reapply it a few times a day if you want it to  linger.  It does smell good though.  It&#x27;s more of a summer fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice crisp fragrance with hints of fruit and flowers in it.  It&#x27;s long lasting and I have received compliments on it.  It&#x27;s light enough that it would be very appropriate to wear during the spring and summer.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume!!! It smells great. I received the item fast and was a great buy!</li>
            <li> I started wearing this about 3 years ago. It is still the only fragrance I can wear that people stop me and ask me what perfume I am wearing. I also have had co-workers tell me it is the only fragrance they have found that doesn&#x27;t bother their allergies. My back up perfume is Poison but it doesn&#x27;t come close to Nina.</li>
            <li> I was a bit anxious about buying this fragrance, mostly because there are a lot of ripoffs on the market. However, this isn&#x27;t one of those. The fragrance is the original and it has a serial number both on the bottle and on the box. The packaging was good and it arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased the Nina Ricci for Women.  I love the fragrence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased with Nina Ricce For Women.  I love the fragrance.  I also was impressed with the speed of delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this item smells great but this company takes forever the send stuff. I have been waiting on this item for over a month now and still haven&#x27;t recieved it. Don&#x27;t recommend buying stuff from this company.</li>
            <li> This is my main perfume. It&#x27;s perfect for spring &amp; summer. It&#x27;s light, fruity &amp; floral. I did have trouble once with the bottle leaking thick fluid - but I think that was a fluke because I have not had any troubles with any other bottles since.</li>
            <li> Just as I imagined. My girlfriend loved her christmas present. We are really happy with the product. Highly recomended. It arrived in time!!</li>
            <li> First off, the ordering process was very simple. The shipping was really fast. Great scented perfume for the woman in your life. If you want to make her happy, I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my mother. She had heard about it and wanted to try it. It is a classy smell, oriented towards more mature women. The one piece of feedback I had is that it was pretty strong. I like milder perfumes and this was pretty intense. But that is just taste. The quality of the perfume was very good, the packaging was fantastic, and overall it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I like it. I wear it in the summer because it has a light smell to it.</li>
            <li> I receive two bottles of 1oz each... Was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of Nina! I cant get enough of its fruity and dun scent. Great for sprng/summer! Always get compliments wth it.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted. And it smells great too! Not heavy, but light and refreshing. No one likes to smell like an old lady :)</li>
            <li> very exquisite fragrance</li>
            <li> Received a fake product totally unlike the product pictured, no box, only a padded envelope, product I received was used and labeled tester only and in a white bottle unlabeled. Seller stated to ship the product back. I have since done so and have not received any refund 3 weeks later.  Perhaps they will resell it and scam someone else.  I ended up buying the real thing for my wife and there is no comparison in the bottle or fragrance.  I will post pictures above of the fake you will actually get.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or hard earned money people just go to your local store and buy the real thing.  Or shop someone with more and better reviews. I have since filed a dispute.</li>
            <li> As always, Nina Ricci perfumes are fabulous!</li>
            <li> smell very nice and liked to my fiance</li>
            <li> I like this perfume, but I have to be in the mood for it. I usually prefer a less potent perfume, and this can be a bit strong if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> This particular fragrance is very lovely.  In the stores, it is almost double the price, so it is beneficial to order it on-line.</li>
