            <li>In addition to the fairly well-established hair-loss prevention attributes of the ingredients, this is just altogether a really nice shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients in the shampoo are the type that you want to fight mpb hairloss and is probably the best one you can get on Amazon right now for the price.</li>

            <li>They had the best reviews, the best price on Amazon than anywhere else, and the ingredients list includes lots of other things</li>

            <li>It has a great peppermint like smell which is very light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell and leaves your hair feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li>Its been working amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing shampoo, amazing ingredients and amazing company.  </li>
            <li>The peppermint leaves your scalp feeling amazing.</li>
            <li>IS AMAZING</li>
            <li>this shampoo is amazing, it stopped my hair loss, and I got rid of my dandruff problems, my hair is now thicker, every bottle lasts two months, in my case.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>has 1% Ketoconazole, yet it works as effectively as the Nizoral 2%, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling filmy and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad to find that my progress is a good bit ahead of the curve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have some catching up to do, but it just amazes how well this product (and the liquid) work.</li>
            <li>, it lathers up really nicely</li>
            <li>dont think this product is really effective at treating hair loss or helping to promote a climate that engages hair growth.</li>
            <li>The degree of hair loss does seem to have leveled off since switching to this kind of shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled with the results, also I am not losing any....</li>
            <li>Was a nice feeling to have a bit of my identity and dignity returned to me.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I have noticed hair regrowth after about 4 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I would say this cocktail is 85% as effective as Finasteride</li>
            <li>got this product for purpose of review,all views and claims are 100 percent my own.</li>
            <li>Excellent and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My husband loves the shampoo and it is effective.</li>
            <li>It would be an effective product for an irritated scalp without the hair growth component, but addressing both is a win-win.</li>
            <li>Smells really nice too, like mint, and doesn&#x27;t seem to be drying to the hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a good smell, a good lather, its sulfate free and</li>
            <li>It foams up nicely.  </li>
            <li>It lathers well, smells nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also wonderful that it doesn&#x27;t contain SLS, which can be very drying on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Dandruff is a fungus and that can&#x27;t be good for a healthy scalp.  </li>
            <li>shampooo wash my hair goood nice smell also</li>
            <li>Smells nice... noticed no change.</li>
            <li>The Emu Oil really is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>I tried Lipogaine and honestly, haven&#x27;t looked elsewhere since.  </li>
            <li>Also, it does a nice job washing hair.</li>
            <li>These hairs would have fallen out on their own any ways.</li>
            <li>on top of that it smells good.</li>
            <li>Lipogaine Shampoo also lathers up nicely, smells good and makes my hair and scalp feel very clean.</li>
            <li>great shampoo, clean and effective ingredients.</li>
            <li>Great smell and makes my scalp feeling clean</li>
            <li>It does a great job leaving your hair clean and not oily.</li>
            <li>The shampoo smells good(nice minty smell) and it leaves your scalp feeling great and clean.  </li>
            <li>Better than advertised and very satisfied.</li>
            <li>it is also has more body and just a very healthy look</li>
            <li>Has a pleasant smell and I genuinely feel that it invigorates my scalp.</li>
            <li>that clean hair and nice pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty wonderful shampoo, it smells good and does exactly what it is supposed to do!</li>
            <li>this is one of the best shampoos i had so far!</li>
            <li>I am using both lipogaine products and have got some pretty good results even with my inconsistant applications!</li>
            <li>No dandruff, this is the best product I&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>I tried Nizoral and while it had the ketoconazole this product has that and much more - plus a nice peppermint smell</li>
            <li>I have tried all the popular Ketoconazole shampoos and this one by far is the best, as it leaves my hair fuller and with more volume.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money, and a great addition to anyone&#x27;s hair loss regime.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s perfect cleans has keto and not harsh with emu oil.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure how effective this product is</li>
            <li>The cheaper shampoo would take away any hair products you would be wearing and make Lipogaine more effective.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the product , its worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shampoo on the market if you are experiencing hair loss.</li>
            <li>So far I have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Like much better than Nizoral, no sulfates and seems to be quite effective.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the product , its worth the money.</li>
            <li>Best product I have used so far on my hair.</li>
            <li>The best product for me so far.  </li>
            <li>and this is BY FAR the best.</li>
            <li>think they&#x27;re both effective, but I prefer Lipogaine because it foams up better (and it smells</li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo I have used so far.</li>
            <li>(very fine &amp;#34;baby</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for such a great product..Now even my manager is using it lol</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t look great for the first 2 months</li>
            <li>First of all, it leaves my hair feeling and looking great</li>
            <li>I have used many many products include the most popular Rogaine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced no ill side affects after using a couple bottles of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>this shampoo is pretty great.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and makes my scalp feel healthy and clean.  </li>
            <li>I think it is doing a great job of keeping my scalp clean, which is so important in preventing hair loss.</li>
            <li>It seems to be doing what it states, and it is a fine shampoo to boot!  </li>
            <li>In addition, I liked that the label peels off of the bottle easily, so people aren&#x27;t scoping my hairloss products in the shower when they go in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>The smell is really pleasant and it does fresh your hair.</li>
            <li>The shampoo also has a nice scent and as others have mentioned, it lathers easily, so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I just wanna say I love Lipogaine, I gave it 5 stars in my review because I believe it is a very effective product</li>
            <li>my scalp has a very healthy clean feeling also.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be giving my hair more volume.</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt better.</li>
            <li>Ok so i tried the lipogaine drops and it did wonders...</li>
            <li>i stopped using it because i noticed more hair fell off my head.</li>
            <li>started using it and was pleased immediately by a couple of things.</li>
            <li>Best of luck to all of you out there doing the same, &amp;#34;project.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and i do use it every day with no problems at all, so no itchy , and nothing , it just feels healthy.</li>
            <li>and i love it,</li>
            <li>and boy I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I went back to using Perfect Hair Shampoo</li>
            <li>my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>It lathers up a lot better...</li>
            <li>Lipogaine is the best hair loss shampoo I have ever used: it contains ingredients that have demonstrated legitimate clinical efficacy in fighting hair loss and decreasing scalp DHT levels (ketokonazole) and anti-inflammation agents such as copper peptides and biotin.  </li>
            <li>my hair looks more stronger</li>
            <li>I have been using both for almost a month and the lipogaine for women is OK</li>
            <li>I can say that flakiness has diminished and that I love the smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair regrowing products for many years.</li>
            <li>Decided to give Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo a try after being extremely impressed with their minoxidil.</li>
            <li>I pair it with a nice conditioner free of parabens and dilithicone or any type of silicone which you want to avoid.</li>
            <li>There are many hair loss shampoos out there to choose from.</li>
            <li>My scalp and hair always feels better after i use this stuff.</li>
            <li>Most are all style and no substance.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say for sure if I am regrowing any hair from it.</li>
            <li>I began losing my hair about 15 years ago, mostly on the crown of my head.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Lipogaine promotes healthy hair, and consequently it makes the hair you have stay in place.  </li>
            <li>Proof that I&#x27;m pleased with this product is that I&#x27;ve bought it more than once.  </li>
            <li>but thought this shampoo would perhaps make things even better.</li>
            <li>So glad to of found this product.</li>
            <li>I feel like they are working for me and expect to see more hair regrowth in the coming months.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light mint smell to it</li>
            <li>After using this product I sure see a difference.</li>
            <li>My hair is oily and lipogaine makes it feel healthy.</li>
            <li>it has worked wonders for me:)</li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with Lipogaine for men, and my hair is fuller, stronger for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple months and it does seem to help while using Lipogaine minoxodil (which is great!)</li>
            <li>(Lipogaine has more supposed DHT-blocking products...check out &#x27;Azetinol&#x27;).</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair feel thicker and more dense.</li>
            <li>It does work for most people.</li>
            <li>and I felt like this product would help me to both thicken up and regrow more hair for a fuller look.</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the instructions and wash your hair twice with it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li>Will keep buying :)</li>
            <li>but I think overall this is the best.</li>
            <li>Did I mention the smell? :)</li>
            <li>and I think this is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li>It is not a miracle shampoo, but it does make my hair feel healthy</li>
            <li>but, I love the formula of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Many of my friends have told me that there is an improvement.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I love it.  </li>
            <li>After losing a bit more hair I decided to try to incorporate keto again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried this product for 3 weeks and during that time I started to lose my hair even more.</li>
            <li>I would run my fingers across the top of my scalp and boom...</li>
            <li>more hair kept falling off.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t post to many reviews but after having to go through what this product did to me</li>
            <li>Fantastic shampoo!</li>
            <li>You are better off with 1percent Nizoral...</li>
            <li>I do not see any hair falling any more.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I use it in combination with minox, and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;After 3 month hairs feel thicker and more shiny.</li>
            <li>I started using the shampoo at the same time I started using the Lipo minox topical, which probably wasn&#x27;t the best idea for assessing results, but the outcome has been awesome.  </li>
            <li>It works in conjunction with their minoxidil and is a potent combination.</li>
            <li>soon I&#x27;m going to give it a try one more  time</li>
            <li>After using for a while longer I will be able to share growth and or improved thickness and over all health of my hair review.</li>
            <li>My hair looks noticeably better than before and is an excellent step in my daily regimen.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Regenepure is even more drying.</li>
            <li>Im back on it once again for 2 months now and will never stop using this awesome product, in tandem with the lipogaine serum and biotin supplements my hair is returning once again fuller and thicker</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there a better products out there.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the results that I am getting.</li>
            <li>I tried many shampoos up to now.</li>
            <li>I was not concerned too much about the price based off the great reviews the product had already.  </li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo in conjunction with generic Equate minoxidil since someone said the Equate version made in Israel is the best.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s looking like I can get about 3 months usage from one bottle while using it most days.</li>
            <li>The best over-the-counter hair loss shampoo I&#x27;ve used, actually.</li>
            <li>Out of all of them, I like Lipogaine Big 3 the best.</li>
            <li>and I did order two more bottles and will update my review if I feel my hair thickens.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m also very happy with that product I can see lots of tiny hairs growing in.</li>
            <li>I love this Shampoo.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair looking and feeling more dense.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair is thinning on top and the thinning area always itched a lot.</li>
            <li>Have used it for more than 2 year.  </li>
            <li>Of the two, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>and therefore I will continue using it until something better comes along.</li>
            <li>I can tell it works because when I stop using the product I shed more hair then</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I would love to use it more often but at $25 for 8oz</li>
            <li>I have been using Nioxin products for years and have been satisfied.  </li>
            <li>but Lipogaine solution sure has so I will combine as recommended 2 to 3 times a week.</li>
            <li>the better the product is for us to use.</li>
            <li>As a result, my hair looks great, and I am confident that I have totally stopped my hair loss for good.  </li>
            <li>I love this product it helped fight my receding hairline.</li>
            <li>No shampoo alone will eliminate it, so most recommend a minoxidil treatment as well.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I love this anti-DHT shampoo.</li>
            <li>I look forward to the 2-3 times a week that I use it because of how much better my hair looks over the course of that day.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t see anything  more</li>
            <li>It is great quality and again really works.</li>
            <li>This is the one of the best shampoo to use if you&#x27;re gonna try to fight male pattern baldness.</li>
            <li>Can style it however you want and the fact it has ketoconazole makes it even better.</li>
            <li>way better than regenpure.</li>
            <li>Love Lipogaine, my husband loves Lipogaine.</li>
            <li>Can be used more often than Nizoral and without the unwanted side effect of leaving your hair feeling like straw.</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for over 2 years and it has helped to keep my hair growing and healthy.  </li>
            <li>This product combined with the Lipogaine scalp treatment has kept my hair healthy and not falling out.  </li>
            <li>I have not lost any more hair and have even re-grown some.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it feels when you leave it in for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>It costs more than LIpogaine and</li>
            <li>People this stuff really works !!!!</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this shampoo,I get the results I desire, thank you very much!</li>
            <li>It does work up a nice rich lather once you get it going.</li>
            <li>Nice shampooo love shamppo specially liitle bit</li>
            <li>been using lipogaine shampoo with the drops for 6 months now and the results have been steady and great.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair feel nice and clean and tingly too.</li>
            <li>Smells nice , hair feels clean</li>
            <li>It has worked great in managing my dandruff outbreaks, I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>This product is great, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>My dad says it leaves his hair very clean.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely and leaves the hair feeling full.</li>
            <li>I think the shampoo is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I can say I have noticed much thicker hair and my fair follicles towards my crown are thicker and seem to be more healthy.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working pretty good.</li>
            <li>Also it smells good and leaves my hair looking good, not flat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Big 3 has a nice scent to it, it doesn&#x27;t get super foamy, and leaves some volume to it after you are done showering.</li>
            <li>That is most important to me. :)</li>
            <li>I have naturally fine hair with some thinning, but I&#x27;ve noticed my hair to be much more manageable and fuller since using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have hair past my shoulders and use the product 2x / week, and one bottle lasts a good 6 months; a more than fair price to pay to maintain and thicken your hair!  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is filled with quality ingredients and leaves your hair nice and clean.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light fragrance and the hair does feel clean after showering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cool and minty feeling.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, but it&#x27;s highly concentrated and smells nice.</li>
            <li>Awesome product, much better than the average hairloss shampoo you can get at Walgreens/CVS.</li>
            <li>For me, hair loss was basically ceased, and I experienced modest hair growth on both my hairline and crown.</li>
            <li>most importantly it has ketonconazole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its great product for complete hair problems.</li>
            <li>My son also likes it because it has greatly reduced the acne near his scalp.  </li>
            <li>Combined, they have done an incredible job at halting my hair loss, especially my receding hairline.</li>
            <li>So far I am happy with the result of using his product.</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised that it lathers great, and gives an invigorating tingling feeling as well.</li>
            <li>I heard about this product with my friend, so I decided to try and so far I&#x27;m so happy with it, and I would recomended too.</li>
            <li>and I love it, it&#x27;s hands down the best ketoconazole shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>For those who are willing to seriously let the shampoo rest on their scalp for a good 3.5 minutes or more, this product is excellent, and I think the best product on the market currently.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smelling nice and clean with full volume.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li>Though it is a little more costly than some of its competitors, it also delivers the best results.</li>
            <li>I performed a lot of online research, using a variety of resources, to try and find a shampoo that would hopefully work for my issues and be more hair friendly.  </li>
            <li>(SUCH a good thing!</li>
            <li>(Lipogaine has their own version which really does work better than Rogaine and its generics</li>
            <li>I use it Mondays, Wednesday and Fridays to keep it easy to remember.</li>
            <li>Very mild ingredients.</li>
            <li>What I can be sure of is that it leaves my hair feeling clean and  non greasy.</li>
            <li>This is a great product better than the traditional Rogaine.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and initially leaves a nice tingly sensation on the scalp.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice and feels very gentle for hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it works, it has all the right ingredients!</li>
            <li>Best shampoo hands down</li>
            <li>My hair has always been fine, but I have seen the gradual thinning on the top/crown and around the hairline (horseshoe pattern?).  </li>
            <li>Smell is fine.  </li>
            <li>See, I have really fine hair and all of the time I spend outdoors</li>
            <li>Quick shipping!  </li>
            <li>and I must say, it has quickly become my favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li>and i super LOVE</li>
            <li>Compared to other products, which often require multiple shampoos which each cost as much or more than this one, this is by far the best value along with being the best in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>better than nizoral which makes my hair dry and itchy, this shampoo has emu oil which moisturizes the scalp and makes my hair and scalp feel great.</li>
            <li>Following the instructions to lather and rinse twice while massaging and waiting for the amount of time recommended is also very important to get an optimum result.  </li>
            <li>I dont think they claim this product regrows hair, but I have seen a huge difference in the amount of hair that is lost.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a great shampoo to add to your arsenal of hair loss products.</li>
            <li>the fact that the shampoo is sulfate free is important.  </li>
            <li>I got great results with this shampoo (applied 3 times a week) and combined with 5% minoxidil such as Lipogaine and oral DHT blockers.</li>
            <li>shampoo lather is great , I only used 1/10 of this shampoo in a month .</li>
            <li>This shampoo is great because it has all the essential ingredients that you need to promote hair regrowth.</li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s particularly great to use, prior to applying minoxidil</li>
            <li>This shampoo is surprisingly gentle, and is effective at slowing hair loss on my front scalp.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s important to do your homework.</li>
            <li>, its great&lt;br /&gt;I am happy that I found this product; it actually works and my hair have grown ..</li>
            <li>Studies for this are readily available online</li>
            <li>On off days I use a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and it is the best shampoo for me.</li>
            <li>I actually use Lipogaine&#x27;s minoxidil product, which is great, but this shampoo did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li>I have to say this shampoo definitely makes my hair look thicker and feel great.  </li>
            <li>I have reduced my hair shedding greatly and improved the overall health of my scalp.</li>
            <li>If you just want a shampoo that cleans, you can go pick up any cheap shampoo from a drug store or grocery store and it will do the job.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too strong and it smells clean...</li>
            <li>and I definitely would recommend it to anyone wanting a great shampoo.</li>
            <li>but I do feel it is the highest quality ketoconazole shampoo available to date</li>
            <li>I love the peppermint it leaves my hair feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li>I believe I will buy this product after finish my free sample.</li>
            <li>Lipogaine Big 3 is great when combine with Lipogaine 3 in hair treatment</li>
            <li>I just wash before with a sulfate free shampoo and then wash again with the lipogaine, leaving in for the suggested time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t just want to stop/reverse hair loss, I want my hair to look good also which is simply not possible in many medicated shampoo&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant peppermint scent and leaves your hair feeling soft and full.</li>
            <li>Full head of hair despite a strong genetic predisposition toward it.</li>
            <li>Good product, lathers nicely and works well with other Lipogaine products to help with hair loss.</li>
            <li>it helps keep my hair looking full and strong.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality shampoo, with a great cosmetic feel, with proven, effective ingredients against hair thinning and associated scalp issues such as seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>Lipogaine Big 3 is very effective in preventing hair loss.</li>
            <li>it has a fresh clean smell unlike many others of this type.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair fresh , clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>A number of shampoos were recommended, which I tried, but it was this Lipogaine brand and formula that were consistently referenced by many experienced guys in the same boat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used their other product, the Minoxidil dropper, along with UltraX labs Hair Rush pills, and this shampoo, and the results are incredible.</li>
            <li>My scalp is now clean and dandruff free.</li>
            <li>First of all, you don&#x27;t need to use much product to get a good lather and thoroughly clean your hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li>When focusing on the hairline (because that&#x27;s what you see in the mirror), it&#x27;s easy to ignore how much you&#x27;re losing up top so this stuff will keep it in line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving my hair and I am fine with being bold.</li>
            <li>I will be reporting and adding pictures every month to see if there will be any significant difference visible.</li>
            <li>One bottle goes a long way and the results are great.</li>
            <li>Totally worth every penny!</li>
            <li>With consistent use ive regrown frontal hair and staved off loss of more hair.</li>
            <li>Each and every one of them has their unique benefits (Research it).  </li>
            <li>and I have noticed a significant difference in the amount of hair loss</li>
            <li>Worth a shot!</li>
            <li>the shampoo, I would recommend using a cheaper shampoo, like baby shampoo, or anything sulfate free before using Lipogaine to get the full effect of it.</li>
            <li>He originally used this in addition to the lipogaine minoxidil tx</li>
            <li>I had pretty rapid hair loss and tried MANY things, including Rogaine.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant regrowth</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t measured or anything, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that my hair is noticeably fuller.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure that people think I got a hair transplant, but</li>
            <li>Bottom line is that it&#x27;s a rich feeling shampoo, and you just feel like your getting all types of quality ingredients into the scalp and follicles.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are good though and that is apparent in using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Originally, I bought Lipogaine for my husband.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased so far.</li>
            <li>All in all, it is worth trying it!</li>
            <li>I came across Lipogaine and Regenpure on Amazon and decided to use Lipogaine first because it had more added ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells great and one bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>MPB.. shampoo probably isn&#x27;t enough to stop it, but this is by far the best one you could choose.</li>
            <li>Leaves scalp feeling tingling and clean.</li>
            <li>With so many hair loss products out there claiming to do things that they don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s nice to have find one that actually does.  </li>
            <li>after you apply Lipogaine and that should be it, you will notice how clean your hair feels and also it does help you hair to grow shinner and stronger.</li>
            <li>It&#x60;s keeping my scalp clean and repaired my hair after 6 months in use.</li>
            <li>clean out that DHT with this shampoo or something else you can find.</li>
            <li>I can say that you know that you are getting a clean scalp after use.</li>
            <li>Helps with scalp issues, leaves it so clean it literally squeaks will washing it.</li>
            <li>shampoo leaves a clean, minty scent because of the peppermint oil extract in it.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it works very well for me when I use it together with Lipogaine for women.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried multiple shampoos for hair loss and Lipogaine is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo is by far the BEST shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>My hair is supper clean.</li>
            <li>I believe the ketoconazole to clean dht.  </li>
            <li>And, I dont remember that shampoo leaving my hair feeling that clean.</li>
            <li>Lipogaine Big 3 is by far the best shampoo on the market.  </li>
            <li>What it does is clean and \\&quot;pre-treat\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Had tried Nizoral shampoo before and wasn&#x27;t necessarily sure if it made a difference and also didn&#x27;t like the way it made my hair look/feel after using it, leaving it kind of flat.</li>
            <li>It gives my fine hair more body and helps it dry thicker, I&#x27;ve been happy with it and ordered 2 more bottles after my initial order.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t confirm on how much hair loss prevention it does to my hair, but compare to other hair loss shampoo out there, it is one of the best</li>
            <li>The hair on the top of my scalp quits growing after a certain length.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s important that I take care of my hair accordingly and lipogaine does exactly that!</li>
            <li>Fresh smelling and leaves my hair feeling clean and free of residue.</li>
            <li>the contrary-my hair feels light and clean after using Lipogaine, with a fresh, minty smell.&lt;br /&gt;Lipogaine</li>
            <li>But It certainly makes my scalps feel good and my hairline has been kept safe recently, so I will keep on using this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to be a lifelong customer of Lipogaine.</li>
            <li>Ok, I want to start by saying I&#x27;ve been using regenepure dr for a long time in conjunction with avalon organics biotin thickening shampoo,  which has done amazing things for my hair.  </li>
            <li>It will likely not stop male pattern baldness on its own, but is a great product when combined with the Lipogaine Intensive Treatment as it will help increase absorption of the Minoxidil.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li>and it actually does a good job on your hair as well as your scalp</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a variety of products throughout the years and have managed to hold onto the remaining hair I do have fairly well given the baldness of my younger family members.</li>
            <li>I also recommend buying the cheapest laser hair comb you can for the full routine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, this shampoo leaves my hair actually looking good.</li>
            <li>My hair looks healthy, shinny and much thinker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a real life boost to my self-esteem to be able to keep my hair</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t make a bald person full headed of course.</li>
            <li>Overall good product.</li>
            <li>Shipping time was more than reasonable.</li>
            <li>To manage expectations, the improvement has not resulted in a full head of hair, but it did reverse the hair loss process.</li>
            <li>I leave it on for the duration of the shower and it gives a cool soothing feeling to my scalp.  </li>
            <li>but my hair hasn&#x27;t been this full in 5</li>
            <li>The good results are definitely from this product.</li>
            <li>I purchased Lipogaine&#x27;s Big 3 shampoo hoping it will be just as good as their minoxidil product.</li>
            <li>I decided on Lipogaine after researching the various ingredients between the two and felt they were a bit superior in Lipogaine.</li>
            <li>I tried another good shampoo for thinning hair, but had to use it every night to totally stop the itching.</li>
            <li>i think the product is really good.my hair look like more thicker after 4 time order .i will continue order in future.thanks</li>
            <li>One star withheld because it seems to be a good product for stopping or slowing hair loss and  bringing back some hair, but doesn&#x27;t appear to restore hair to where it was before hair loss began.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good hair loss shampoo</li>
            <li>but it is not a bad shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is nice like regular store bought shampoo not greasy, easy to use, and lasts awhile.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li>It also has some other great ingredients like Biotin and Saw Palmetto.</li>
            <li>I must say, dandruff control is excellent with this shampoo (absolutely zero recurrence) vs Nizoral where a little would still return.</li>
            <li>It has a &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; fragrance - sort of minty, but I use RedKen conditioner which has a little better fragrance - so it&#x27;s all good.  </li>
            <li>After shampooing, my scalp feels clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>but it was harsh and may have done more harm than good.</li>
            <li>did a ton of research before starting on this, &amp;#34;project&amp;#34; and all of the best reviews and recommendations I found on various forums and web sites pointed me to the product here.</li>
            <li>It feels great, and leaves hair thick and healthy.</li>
            <li>hair thinning is more from internal issues like hypothyroidism so wasn&#x27;t sure if this would even help.</li>
            <li>I immediately got back on Amazon and ordered two more bottles to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>At the start of this year, I made the bold decision to stop shaving.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, this product seems to work a lot better in the sense of improving my scalp condition without being harsh.</li>
            <li>My wife is making fun of me for using these products, however I really don&#x27;t care and am glad I did not wait any longer.</li>
            <li>Again, this product may be worthy of a 5-star review, butI</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am happy with this product, my hair is thicker and I have even recently had a compliment from a hair stylist saying how much hair I have, which is flattering</li>
            <li>Lipogaine uses the same key ingredient that Nizoral uses, but Lipogaine is created for hair loss and has excellent additional ingredients.</li>
            <li>It smells awesome, and overall has a better end result than what I was previously using.</li>
            <li>I received it yesterday and therefore, I&#x27;ve had my hair washed with this shampoo only once, could you believe that my hair looks really wonderful with  only one use?</li>
            <li>I have oily hair and was losing hair quickly...</li>
            <li>The shampoo cleans the hair well and suds up quickly.</li>
            <li>Ironically many of them have sodium sulfates of some kind as well which allegedly speeds up hair thinning.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped me tremendously with my hair thinning.</li>
            <li>I also like that the cleaning agents are mild.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is great and leaves my hair full and not weighted down.  </li>
            <li>My son has used this product for a couple years now, and he says it really works well in leaving his scalp feeling clean!</li>
            <li>It has a mild, fresh scent that I would describe as sweet mint.</li>
            <li>did and amazingly I am seeing the same results as I did originally.  </li>
            <li>It smells ok and lathers nice, never had to use any other shampoo after using this once.</li>
            <li>I feel a lot better about my hair after i use this compared to a normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>I got a haircut this morning and my stylist of 6 years told me that my hair looks and feels thicker than it has in several years, and that my scalp looks very healthy now.</li>
            <li>I have being using &amp;#34;Lipogaine Big 3&amp;#34; since the Nizoral shortage and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say for sure just how much the Big 3 shampoo has helped on its own,</li>
            <li>Smells good and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>1 bottle lasts a long time, it smells good and my scalp has improved.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ketonconazole has been shown to have some great effects in slowing down hair loss in some, it wont work alone</li>
            <li>For now I am happy that the shedding has slowed down a lot.</li>
            <li>Very good shampoo in the sense that it leaves your hair feeling/looking full and thick.</li>
            <li>I have seen more shedding, which i thought was because of the new product, but given the time frame i am hesitating to recommend this one.</li>
            <li>and I have experienced considerably less itch in those areas.</li>
            <li>Both I and my like this shampoo, smell and creamy texture of the shampoo are good, but I think it may be overly drying for people with dry hair or scalps.</li>
            <li>and I strongly recommend this to anyone who wants to prevent hair loss.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting pretty sparse on top after about 9 years of thinning, but not so much that I&#x27;m willing to shave clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i honestly dont know if it sloww my hair from falling, because my hair is to short, but &amp;#34; i still need a shampoo to clean my hair right &amp;#34; so this is it, this is my choice...</li>
            <li>This shampoo really does work!!</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo for two months, I am happy to say that the bald spot is smaller, with new hair filling in around the edges.</li>
            <li>I will update this review if anything changes for the positive or negative, but for now I&#x27;m very happy with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a little more effective in helping shampoo absorb into scalp.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is the best boost combined with minoxidil and finasteride, plus it does not dry the hair unlike the other ketoconazole shampoos.</li>
            <li>She couldn&#x27;t believe how much it had filled out.</li>
            <li>When I was taking this and the lipogain hair serum, my hair looked amazing and now I&#x27;m trying to get back to that fullness that I had before.</li>
            <li>worth the price</li>
            <li>and how they say it works ( wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the manufacturer wrote those)&lt;br /&gt;while using this product i lost more hair in the shower then when was using baby shampoo</li>
            <li>so what if the label says it has all these ingredients that supposedly help the hair, in reality when i keep all these chemicals on my hair for 3-4 minutes (as directed) then end up loosing way more hair then the natural rate</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying it.</li>
            <li>This product is both style and substance, something extraoardinarily rare in the hair loss industry.</li>
            <li>My criteria were: a) a shampoo that contained clinically proven ingredients that combat DHT and stimulate hair regrowth, and b) a shampoo that actually worked like a quality shampoo (volumized hair, smelled nice, foamed up, etc.).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li>it is worth a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though it does not work overnight (no product does), it is both a solid and effective product.  </li>
            <li>it was worth giving it a shot.</li>
            <li>It goes along way and my scalp feels fresh afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo every day because I love how soft it makes my hair.  </li>
            <li>It was worth going for Lipogaine.</li>
            <li>After seeing the success of this shampoo I even started to use their Lipogaine with Minoxidil.</li>
            <li>, it has a minty fresh scent which to me</li>
            <li>Only one that really worked was Perfect Image solutions which was disapproved by FDA later.</li>
            <li>Secondly, the smell of the shampoo is nice.  </li>
            <li>I thought It may be worth a try (tried all nutragena shampoo products,,head and shoulders..</li>
            <li>I use about a fifty cent piece / dollar piece worth of shampoo each time</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s worth as a dandruff cure and making my hair look thicker.  </li>
            <li>Keeping the dandruff under control is worth it alone.  </li>
            <li>so it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lipogaine Big 3 has kept my scalp itch free for more than 6 months.</li>
            <li>My bottle is still pretty full and it&#x27;s been a month.  </li>
            <li>Most anti-thinning shampoos have a lot of trash in them as far as fillers and chemicals go.  </li>
            <li>Just the ketoconazole alone for a shampoo is worth buying this.</li>
            <li>My husband is worth it.</li>
            <li>Just for the appearance alone this shampoo is worth it to me.  </li>
            <li>now i rarely see any hair when i shower.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell you for sure how much it works,</li>
            <li>Product came in good condition and as expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good shampoo, but I don&#x27;t get as much coverage as when I use Lipogaine Big 3.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I really have the Big Sexy Hair to match my favorite hairspray.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t been able to seen any conclusive results.</li>
            <li>and I figure it is worth a try to see if it works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d say its worth buying as a replacement to Nizoral, but still nothing beats Nizoral,</li>
            <li>My hair felt thicker/fuller right after the first use!</li>
            <li>A little bit lathers up very nice...</li>
            <li>The formula is far from perfect, but it is much cleaner than most other shampoos on the market, and the cleanest anti-thinning shampoo I have found so far.  </li>
            <li>The reviews were mostly very positive, so I figured for the price</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, lathers easily, and does not weight down hair.  </li>
            <li>So I researched and read reviews on the other ketoconazole shampoos on the market (Nizoral, Regenepure, Revita, etc.) and came to the conclusion that Lipogaine Big 3 would probably work the best.</li>
            <li>There might be other options that are more costly or require a prescription, but for the money, you won&#x27;t be able to beat this product.</li>
            <li>Shipping is pretty quick.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed a difference pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Also, it has many more active ingredients than Nizoral.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best hair loss shampoo I have ever used and believe me I have been fighting hair loss actively for 6 years now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;nizoral is good but with laurel sulfate and other ingredients, i can probably use it once a week and lipogane all week, ..</li>
            <li>Will be using this product for a long time. :-)!</li>
            <li>It has ketoconazole along with other good ingredients.</li>
            <li>Compared to other shampoos that claimed to &amp;#34;thicken hair&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;prevent hair loss,&amp;#34; this product appears to be superior.  </li>
            <li>but since this shampoo had Ketoconazole in it and other good ingredients.</li>
            <li>It has other good ingredients for your hair as well.</li>
            <li>But other than that it is a good investment.</li>
            <li>And this led me to the habit of washing my hair twice a day, usually right before I apply the minoxidil.</li>
            <li>You could see right to my scalp.</li>
            <li>You will notice a difference right away.</li>
            <li>This product has the right combination of ingredients that work to reduce DHT on your scalp.  </li>
            <li>Right now I just bought Hair Surge shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo makes my hair smell great and look thick and full.</li>
            <li>My hair loss is pretty well under control now but for me to give Lipogaine big 3 a 4 or a 5, it would have to yield hair loss on it&#x27;s own (meaning no propecia, minoxidil, or azealic acid)</li>
            <li>The shampoo is sulfate free and paraben free which I love since the less chemicals</li>
            <li>Good product, nice minty smell and definitely feel as if less hair is lost during showers</li>
            <li>3 weeks is really too soon to be sure the serum is working, however it does appear to be stimulating new hair growth already.</li>
            <li>There are many shampoos that will make my head feel clean, like refreshingly clean, but most of them leave my scalp dry and cause dandruff when applied regularly.</li>
            <li>With both products, I make sure that the product covers areas up front and on the sides that are mostly bare, not just the areas that still have hair.</li>
            <li>At first I was apprehensive about the price, but it ended up being totally worth it</li>
            <li>I use it every other day and it makes your hair feel pretty good and</li>
            <li>I decided to give this product a try since it got good reviews on Amazon and was highly praised several YouTube videos that espoused the product&#x27;s positive effects.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect shampoo for my normal hair, it doesn&#x27;t dry up my hair and stay in same condition all day.</li>
            <li>However, I am willing to continue to use the shampoo because of the positive comments, and to allow it to work, and hopefully in the very near future, I will be able to provide more information.  </li>
            <li>I have been using both for 6 months and my hair is back, so happy and look younger.</li>
            <li>I use this in combination with minoxodil topical and finasteride daily with great results</li>
            <li>it makes my hair soft and can style it easy.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re balding it&#x27;s worth a try to see if you get positive results.</li>
            <li>This is a great product which you won&#x27;t find in stores because why would big business want to sell something that actually helped the consumer ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this shampoo and can say that overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>After years of problems with hair lost and more than 10 different products which i have tried to curb it, it seems that i found the right one.</li>
            <li>Used Nizoral before which was good for dandruff but was too harsh for my scalp, this has been equally good at the same time soft for my scalp without any side effects.</li>
            <li>Whether it will help grow hair is yet to be seen, but my scalp is very much cleaner and hair is fuller looking.</li>
            <li>Very ironic.  </li>
            <li>Have used this shampoo for 1 month now, I like it very much.</li>
            <li>A very gentle &amp; cleansing solution, seems to compliment the Lipogaine Hair treatment.  </li>
            <li>It is not harsh like some of the other shampoos on the market as I use it three to four times per week with great results.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because it is a little drying, but I use a good hydrating conditioner after which helps.</li>
            <li>This shampoo also works as a great 2-in-1 as it actually also contains a conditioner agent, but the composition differs from most shampoo/conditioner blends as it&#x27;s not greasy and hard to wash out at all.</li>
            <li>and they have seen results within the first month or so.</li>
            <li>The Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo is among the top hair loss shampoos.</li>
            <li>These products seem to help most types and I would definitely encourage trying this solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all this product did for me exactly what it said it would.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine Big 3 Hair Loss prevention shampoo for about a month now, and love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it actually makes my hair FULLER!  </li>
            <li>I can safely say that those reviews were correct and I definitely suggest that you try this shampoo as a part of your hair restoral efforts.</li>
            <li>I had tried so many different products before.</li>
            <li>Hair definitely looks better.  </li>
            <li>Compared to my regular shampoo it leaves my hair and scalp noticeably cleaner and my hair has a lot more body.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than Nizoral at keeping my dandruff away and the associated hair loss that comes with it, considering all the extra ingredients they put in it.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first month and my hair has become thicker and fuller.  </li>
            <li>This is the first one I see a difference in using.  </li>
            <li>I did not notice any change the first month.</li>
            <li>and I am still on my first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product has consistently strengthened and increased my hair.</li>
            <li>Firstly, a Study Conducted at the University of Liege, Belgium, 1998</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ketoconazole is an anti-Fungal agent contained in the popular anti-dandruff Shampoo Nizoral, which, for many years was the only Ketoconazole Shampoo and used widely off label for hair loss</li>
            <li>but at the present, it is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t make the connection at first because I never think anything will help</li>
            <li>Most definitely!!  </li>
            <li>The process ain&#x27;t broke, so until something better comes along, this is the gold standard I&#x27;m sticking to.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>stuff is not expensive.</li>
            <li>I ordered my first bottle in March and used it exclusively.....</li>
            <li>and I have no ill effects.</li>
            <li>I would recommend trying these products and to stay consistent.</li>
            <li>and I definitely see more dense hair regrowing.</li>
            <li>I was interested in this shampoo because I seen that it fights hair loss.</li>
            <li>Still on my first bottle, I use it 3 times a week and my hair has stopped falling out.</li>
            <li>I initially tried RegenePure Dr. and for the first 2 weeks I was astonished of how immediate my results of better feeling hair and reduced shedding was.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely one of the better shampoo on the market.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t go for it because I assumed it was Rx</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months and have purchased more than one bottle because it is definitely doing its job.</li>
            <li>In addition to this, I use a topical minoxidil product all over the top of my head twice a day.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the way my hair looks and feels since using Lipogaine Big 3 and</li>
            <li>Most shampoos only fight hair loss or volumize but this one does both.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really do much more than any regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I have enjoyed the results I have seen since using this product and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>Within the first use, we all noticed that his hair fluffed up and looked shiny as well</li>
            <li>Evidently this helps with hair loss, and that I do not know about.</li>
            <li>I am on my third bottle and I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li>and I use it mon,wed, fri and have stayed consistent.</li>
            <li>The first two weeks I immediately noticed a decrease in hair shed followed by about 3 weeks of shedding a lot of hair...</li>
            <li>On my second bottle of shampoo now will get more.</li>
            <li>Made me nervous at first, but the shedding has stopped.  </li>
            <li>It has similar ingredients to Regenpure but works much better.</li>
            <li>I noticed immediately that the shampoo in this latest bottle was a different color (more white than beige).</li>
            <li>I can only tell that I am more than satisfaced with this product.</li>
            <li>Not only have stopped my hair loss but also grown more hair that even my co workers noticed and asked me if I was using anything on my hair</li>
            <li>its really doing the job!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>Lipogain big 3 is my favorite one.</li>
            <li>but it really does work so it makes it worth every penny.</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo just wish it had a bigger size and with a pump</li>
            <li>He was really consistent about using the products and it made a difference in his hair that stayed with him even after he stopped using it.  </li>
            <li>My fourth and newest bottle just arrived, and it&#x27;s tan and much more watery.</li>
            <li>I read about DHT and that in order for a chance at regrowing hair, I first had to get scalp inflammation under control.</li>
            <li>my hair feels soft, smooth and shiny after using this shampoo and my hair stopped falling after 2-3 weeks of using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>4 months before I started to use the shampoo), my hairline definitely looks better than it was 6 months ago.</li>
            <li>The only reason I do not give this a 4 star rating is the price, but I think most of the shampoos on the market are overpriced.  </li>
            <li>This is my first review on anything</li>
            <li>I used Lipogain for about three months and noticed that I was getting \\&quot;undergrowth\\&quot; on the area where my hair was thinning most, middle front potion.</li>
            <li>Shampoo didnt work as good, it dried up my hair and it made my scalp itch</li>
            <li>Right after that they asked me to order few bottles for them and so far they are happy with the results...</li>
            <li>Nice clean scent and refreshing a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Price seems fair to cheap compared to other products that state they do the same thing.  </li>
            <li>Love it, nicely scented and does not irritate the scalp like other similar products.</li>
            <li>Honestly one side is already back to 90%, but the other side is more stubborn.</li>
            <li>It seemed like a great fit for him given that he also had seborrheic dermatitis (cradle cap) since he was very young, and the same active ingredient is used to treat that.  </li>
            <li>The bottle will last you over a month and it leaves your hair smelling clean and looking full.</li>
            <li>I do notice that when using it I am more comfortable and it seems my hair is a little thicker.</li>
            <li>Last year my hair started to fall out rapidly and my bald spot was becoming more noticeable, but after a couple of months of using Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo and Lipogaine Intensive treatment</li>
            <li>/&gt;Combined with a regimen of other products I use, this shampoo has all the qualities of a nice shampoo, and I&#x27;ve been using it for about two years.</li>
            <li>since I use it in combination with other products; with that said, I am not stopping anytime soon, as it is a nice tool in the fight against hairloss.  </li>
            <li>Plus this adds a nice thickness, body and grip that other shampoos don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I like to combine with a conditioner because it does level hair flat otherwise , but that dosent stop me from being satisfied.</li>
            <li>I just do every other day, if i skip the weekends, i just stick to Mon-Wed-Fri; it works out nicely.</li>
            <li>Every guy is different, and I can&#x27;t speak for men who are at a more advanced stage of hair loss, or who tried combatting hair loss much later than I chose to, so again, I&#x27;m mainly speaking as a guy who, with a full head of hair, chose to preempt the loss.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 47 yrs old and have been using this shampoo in conjunction with the hair treatment and the results have been just short of amazing.</li>
            <li>The smell of peppermint is a nice touch and it lathers up very nicly in wet hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ketoconazole is a harsh ingredient when used on its own as it is a powerful anti-dandruff &amp;amp; anti-androgen.</li>
            <li>kind of useless, but smells nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nizoral for years and Lipogaine Big is way more gentle with the scalp.</li>
            <li>I definitely like this one better as I feel my hair is much smoother after using Lipogaine shampoo.</li>
            <li>No shampoo alone is going to re-grow hair but as far as I&#x27;m concerned this is the best one to use alongside Minoxodil or Lipogaine - especially any of the treatments containing azelaic acid (I&#x27;d tried traditional 5% minoxidil with only little success for about a year - moved on to a higher strength e-auction available treatment with azelaic acid, added Lipogaine Big 3 to help treat/heal the scalp and hair at the same time and have had EXCELLENT results since - my plan is to use that to re-grow and then the basic cheap minoxidil to maintain)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lathers really well,and does not take much to lather up which is great because that means it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Based on the positive reviews, I gave the shampoo a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m positive that this was what I was experiencing.</li>
            <li>I do have another positive comment though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of all the hair loss shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried, this product seems to have all the best ingredients that one looks for in the hair loss shampoo genre, it also lathers up extremely well while only having to use a small amount of the product, and best of all it actually leaves the hair looking good without weighing it down like some of the other hair loss shampoos on the market.</li>
            <li>funny to ready all the five star reviews</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and it lathers much easier than other hair loss shampoos I have used before.</li>
            <li>Will need more time in usage to see in the long run.</li>
            <li>i bought this because i have long hair and wanted to make sure i was taking care of it.  </li>
            <li>The first time you lather your hair and scalp it does not lather very well,</li>
            <li>It is strongly foamy (so a little goes a long way) and has good lubricant properties.</li>
            <li>and I honestly can say that it slows down the hair loss.</li>
            <li>Along with my minoxidil treatment, it helps keeping my hair thinning/loss at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other therapeutic shampoos it produces a very nice lather like a regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>But this is the first time I have ever taken the time to write a review, Lipogaine Big 3 has had a huge impact in my life.</li>
            <li>I am aware that results aren&#x27;t usually expected until after six months or more</li>
            <li>The fact that Lipogaine makes it all in one makes my hair regimen such easy process.</li>
            <li>I have tried two others, but this is the first hair loss shampoo that has all the important ingredients in one for the same price.</li>
            <li>I have dry hair and this shampoo seemed to make my hair more manageable and fuller than</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s some nice growth of some strands previously absent.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m back at very healthy, regular</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend you do the same.</li>
            <li>Most shampoo&#x27;s contain a chemical product known as Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS) that like Ketoconazole, is not harmfull in limited exposures to the scalp and skin.</li>
            <li>i take a med called Axiron (basically pure testosterone) because of a side effect from another med.</li>
            <li>Thickens hair a bit, don&#x27;t know for certain if I have hair loss</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain  </li>
            <li>Looks like they added Emu oil which certainly did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>as a newcomer to this product I hope for good results but so far I do have less hair loss</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had fine coarse curly hair and after bleaching it, it started thinning out.</li>
            <li>(i&#x27;ve got the fine white hairs in the thinning areas).  </li>
            <li>my hair has steadily been diffuse thinning for about ten years, mainly on the top and sides.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 45 year old male who&#x27;s been pretty lucky to have a full head of hair.</li>
            <li>so I cant share any hair growth or thickening results as of yet, just using it a couple times a week and its a pretty basic shampoo that leaves my hair clean.</li>
            <li>It costs a little more but is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t accurately judge the impact it has on hair loss/growth since I&#x27;ve also been using the Lipogaine daily treatment and finesteride.</li>
            <li>One day it really scared me because i was really losing so much hair</li>
            <li>Things are going better than I expected which can be proven by my batch of, &amp;#34;Five Months Later&amp;#34; photos.</li>
            <li>In short, it is filled with spelling and grammatical errors that make me question the quality of anything this this company manufactures.</li>
            <li>I believe these reviews are all FRAUD and this is just a cheap generic shampoo in this bottle</li>
            <li>hahaha</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much thicker after I use it.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>Nothing really worked  the way Lipogaine does.  </li>
            <li>I took photos every month to check if products really worked as it was claimed.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it makes my scalp tingle as well.  </li>
            <li>I used it for a month straight and by week 3 I started noticing regrowth in the front of my hairline.</li>
            <li>I started using this shampoo a couple of months ago and really like it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li>This shampoo goes really well with the Lipogaine drops.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So how much credit does this shampoo deserve?  </li>
            <li>so $1-2 a month isn&#x27;t much when you think about it</li>
            <li>(no, I am not a bot account promoting their products, they just really do work)).</li>
            <li>Too much going on and then just got used of not using.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very selective when it comes to the ingredients in health products.  </li>
            <li>My hair is much fuller.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the gentle products I use for my hair...</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>, it is much improved upon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lipogaine Big 3 is firstly free of Sodium Lauryl Sulphate.</li>
            <li>but I felt like I needed to do SOMETHING as I was shedding so much</li>
            <li>I find that it lathers very well, and smells like peppermint.</li>
            <li>Since using this shampoo, people ask me how I got my hair to thicken up so much.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels fuller, I recommend this product to anyone with thinning hair that wants a fuller look.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Tried this shampoo out, it turned out to be better than I expected.....</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers very well and you can feel it working on your scalp.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has a tea tree oil smell that is very soothing and after using it awhile</li>
            <li>Lathers and cleans really well with no build-up.</li>
            <li>It lathers up very well, so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot</li>
            <li>I really have nothing to fault with this product.</li>
            <li>This does really work.</li>
            <li>shampoo really lathers well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this product for a while and really like it.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>It cleans my hair well and leaves it looking  thicker, softer and very mangable.</li>
            <li>The Lipogaine lathered well and gently cleaned my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I became discouraged with the whole keto-shampoo buzz.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really liking the feeling it gives me when I step out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>It is very concentrated</li>
            <li>Gentle on your hair</li>
            <li>might give up on it really  </li>
            <li>I tried it 3-4 times a week for 3 weeks and still kept losing hair, which I couldn&#x27;t expect it to work that fast</li>
            <li>It also ruined my hair making it very straw-like to the point where I decided to discontinue use.</li>
            <li>Light weight and terrific ingredients.</li>
            <li>Worked very well for me for preventing additional hair loss.</li>
            <li>For me it is working really well.</li>
            <li>It lathers reasonably well -</li>
            <li>I really do feel as if there is some thickening going on.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use this shampoo and will start using minoxidil to see if/how much added benefit that adds.</li>
            <li>My daughter struggles with Lyme disease and was dealing with very itchy scalp and hair loss.</li>
            <li>I used it for 2 weeks straight</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t lose my hair as much as I used to when using this shampoo</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as much when I wash it, though it is a bit drying.  </li>
            <li>My hair is much fuller and thicker than before.</li>
            <li>The hair that was in the tub after shower decreased greatly.</li>
            <li>Since I started using this I have found myself not shedding as much</li>
            <li>Really seems to help with hair loss, will continue to repurchase, along with the Intensive treatment.</li>
            <li>You should experiment with how much AA you add as it can cause a burning sensation on the scalp.</li>
            <li>I alternate Lipogaine with another sulfate free shampoo since I wash every day.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I really like the product.  </li>
            <li>In fact, my hair is left shiny and smooth when it dries.  </li>
            <li>Read all the ingredients carefully to make sure you don&#x27;t have an allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li>The regenepure really opens up my scalp to the hair strengthening biotin shampoo.  </li>
            <li>That is saying something because I never something twice unless I really like it.  </li>
            <li>i really like how it leaves my hair fuller, and moe manageable after each use.</li>
            <li>Another thing I don&#x27;t really like is the fact that they peddle the whole &amp;#34;rinse and repeat&amp;#34; method.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>When my hair loss was getting noticeable, I decided to learn as much as I could about root causes and what could be done to counteract them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much to say that hasn&#x27;t already been said, but figured I&#x27;d throw in my two cents.</li>
            <li>I really do feel that it works and</li>
            <li>this shampoo had a very adverse effect on the condition of my hair; I cannot continue to use it; so I am going to complain to you about the non-return policy because I got two of them (</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I found the Lipogaine shampoo very helpful.  </li>
            <li>really* like the Lipogaine.</li>
            <li>I used Rogain for about a year but didn&#x27;t quite notice too much of an improvement.</li>
            <li>This hair product really works for me and never switching to another shampoo again.</li>
            <li>also, i don&#x27;t really use a conditioner with this,</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It is much gentler and no longer stings the scalp.</li>
            <li>consistency of the shampoo is very \\&quot;honey\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Big 3 makes my already naturally curly hair curl better, without any frizz.  </li>
            <li>Decided to try a few things on my own.</li>
            <li>They are ones that I feel safe using for my extra sensitive scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair is much thicker on top, absolutely no scalp showing.</li>
            <li>I had used generic Rogaine for years and it seemed to reduce hair loss but after switching to Lipogain the difference is far more noticeable.</li>
            <li>Have been using a few months and so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far I am pleased with this product, but only longer term use will determine whether I decide to continue with it or not, as it is pricey $$$.  </li>
            <li>Lipogaine doesn&#x27;t feel chemical-y, smells great, and leaves my hair feeling thick and soft.  </li>
            <li>26 year old male with thinning on top with a receding hair line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain about the price because I was almost willing to put down 5 grand with Bosley.</li>
            <li>No strange tingling, you just feel clean.</li>
            <li>Lipogaine 3 lathers up very nicely without the harsh ingredients of a regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I tried other ketoconazole shampoos and this is much milder and leaves my hair feeling better.</li>
            <li>It does clean your scalp very throughly however and you will definitely know that everything save skin is washed off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that this product to be at it&#x27;s most effectiveness when its used with other products.</li>
            <li>I feel this shampoo plays a significant role in my overall hair loss prevention regimen.  </li>
            <li>I was losing my hair on the top of my head due to epidural steroid injections after a car accident.</li>
            <li>I have used other products that work better.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other shampoos for this.</li>
            <li>Surely you&#x27;ve had other complaints with it.</li>
            <li>but, the second time you lather it is a rich lather.  </li>
            <li>It does not weigh the hair down resulting in a clean full look.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really say if I&#x27;m getting 5-star results, since I&#x27;m not seriously balding.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have read a lot of research on the main ingredients of these 3 shampoos ( ketonconazole, Caffeine and AHA) and believe they all work together really well.</li>
            <li>The shampoo foams up well, smells nice, and a bottle lasts me over 2 months, which is a long time because I use it almost daily.</li>
            <li>I chose Lipogaine because it has a strong list of limited ingredients.  </li>
            <li>of bubbles with this big 3 specially on the second.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this over many of the other out there on the market.</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a nice fragrance and using it as directed, the bottle should last a very long time.  </li>
            <li>one thing I will say is that it left my scalp feeling clean, although it tended to dry my hair out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>For the quality that you get along with the actual positive results in fighting hair loss, Lipogaine 3 is well worth buying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m growing new hair, the loss has certainly slowed or even stopped.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never felt or looked better and with the help of their women&#x27;s minoxidil solution and biotin, my hair is slowly but surely growing back in the thinning spots!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a full head of hair yet, but Lipogaine products are giving me results - and enough faith to keep trying.</li>
            <li>My hair is really shiny now, but definitely have to use deep conditioner on the ends more because they feel dryer than before I started using this.</li>
            <li>I remember being completely blown away the first time i used it.</li>
            <li>I would not be saying this if it weren&#x27;t true, and recently my fiance noticed my hair growth as well.</li>
            <li>Not a bad shampoo though,but conditioning after using this shampoo is definately necessary because its a bit stripping and drying to the hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s help keep my scalp and hair healthy even as the minoxidil and acid do their work to get down to the follicle.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say whether the shampoo is slowing down my hair loss for sure</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the value, its just kind of hard to tell the effects of this since I was already using the Lipogaine solution, but given the ingredients it has in it, the price, and that it helps with other things (i.e. dandruff) without a doubt, I have given it 4 stars.</li>
            <li>I can see lots of tiny new hair have grown from originally bared skin, some even from forehead.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say that I am seeing new hair growing</li>
            <li>This has also allowed for the growth of new hair along my formerly receding hairline, particularly in the side areas that create the old &amp;#34;widow&#x27;s peak&amp;#34; that so many men get in the early stages of losing it all.</li>
            <li>I love the slight tingle too-</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would love to hear from Lipogaine or any experts on this subject.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is my top number 1 shampoo for me: big 3 lipogaine  and second place :</li>
            <li>Based on the ingredients I&#x27;ll most likely use this for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and hats off to Lipogaine Big 3.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle of the shampoo, and it totally cleared up my flaking but even better my hair is coming in faster.</li>
            <li>and I encourage anyone to research this and point to two studies in particular.</li>
            <li>(minoxidil)- I definitely feel that it works better than the standard drugstore minoxidils like Rogaine</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better hair loss shampoo, my hair feels and even looks fuller, after one bottle I definitely noticed some baby hairs start to grow back on my receding hairline and the hair that&#x27;s not part of your receding hair will grow like bamboo, if you think it&#x27;s costly</li>
            <li>Will update after a few more months as I think you should really give it 6 months to work.</li>
            <li>I actually like this big 3 shampoo a lot more than Nizoral.</li>
            <li>It can keep my hair clean and strong for at least two days -</li>
            <li>I tried so many different shampoo and none worked until I found Lipogaine Big 3.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read about Nizoral and the main ingredient, ketoconazole, which was life-changing for me.</li>
            <li>Healthy hair requires a healthy scalp and Nizoral succeeded where others failed.</li>
            <li>Even if I&#x27;m not growing lost hair back, I still feel confident that this product, used in conjunction with Rogaine, slowed if not totally stopped my hair loss.</li>
            <li>Particularly the ketoconazole and emu oil.</li>
            <li>The cap is very sensitive and if you tighten it too much it will crack or snap off!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo is just as good as any high end shampoo without the harsh ingredients, along with the only ingredient proven to stop hair loss included.  </li>
            <li>so i am really satisfied and have high hopes for this stuff in conjunction with minoxidil because the combination is working; much less shedding or no shedding at all.</li>
            <li>I use the shampoo more often than the generally suggested frequency and have had no problems with dry scalp or hair or itching.</li>
            <li>Biotin and ketonconazole: two of the most effective ingredients to slow down the progression of hair</li>
            <li>It seems like the ingredients has changed because this bottle seems less sticky and more like normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this along with Lipogaine.</li>
            <li>would also highly recommend any hair-loss sufferers to check out the Lipogaine Hair Restoration product</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but the cost vs. ounces of the product seemed a bit high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended...</li>
            <li>Not only does Big 3 shampoo make your hair feel clean and have volume, but it also leaves your hair feeling soft and mildly conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I highly recommend both products if you have hair loss.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly dissapointed.</li>
            <li>It contains saw palmetto, biotin and many other natural ingredients that promote hair growth.</li>
            <li>It is far superior to anything I have used in the past and believe you me I have spent many years &amp; 1000&#x27;s of $ on trying different hair regrowth shampoos .</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo more than one month, it seems start to work a little.</li>
            <li>the shampoo is a little more runnier.  </li>
            <li>I was a little worried how the Lipogaine would lather since many of these hair loss shampoos tend to struggle in that regard...</li>
            <li>I have had this product a little more than a month.</li>
            <li>But, between the two, I haven&#x27;t lost more hair; and it does look like there is a little more.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, the price may seem a bit high for a shampoo, but it is well worth it as not only does it work, but it also lasts quite a bit of time.</li>
            <li>My scalp feels great after use and it is the only shampoo that I can use every other day that caters to a combination dry and oil</li>
            <li>particularly I was shedding the new hair I had regrown from using Lipogaine.</li>
            <li>makes my scalp feel clean and takes away dry scalp.</li>
            <li>Hair is also soft and very manageable, no conditioner needed.</li>
            <li>All in all great, though expensive.  </li>
            <li>: My scalp feel much better, shedding of dead skin during shower stopped.</li>
            <li>Remember when using it to keep it on your head for at least 5 minutes you&#x27;ll feel the nice tingling sensation on your head.</li>
            <li>It is worth the extra cost.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than  a few days a week.</li>
            <li>This hair loss shampoo has got a lot (pretty much all) of the essential ingredients needed to combat hair loss.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had success in regrowth and thickness in the last 2 years...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s way to harsh to use more than twice a week</li>
            <li>I do think it is worth the purchase especially if you are in a panic about hair loss.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to leave the shampoo in your hair for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s done extensive research on hair regrowth and retention and chose this product specifically based on the ingredients and success stories surrounding the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>witnessing his success with it, I would definitely recommend this product, (and the line of products from this company) to any man looking to enhance and keep his hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure which ingredients are the \\&quot;Big 3\\&quot; but it has some good ones.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t use styling products, and this shampoo leaves my hair in a nice thick state that I can comb into something that looks acceptable.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice consistency... not too watery but not too thick.  </li>
            <li>But it is much, much better, and he is less self conscious about it.  </li>
            <li>this shampoo packs a punch of many proven ingredients that support hair growth, such as ketonconazole, biotin and&lt;br /&gt;emu oil which help moisture to ease dry scalp caused by ketoconazole.</li>
            <li>Use it as directed, and I strongly recommend pairing it with a daily treatment of minoxidil and finasteride (doctor prescribed for the latter).</li>
            <li>It really makes your hair look full and the scalp is cleaner than when using other shampoos.</li>
            <li>I am not a serious hair-loss sufferer, and use this in combo with other products- perhaps a more serious hair-loss sufferer using would see even greater results than I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it over traditional ketoconazole shampoos like Nizoral, which seems to have more irritating ingredients and not feel as nice on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>and it leaves my hair very clean and soft, but not dried out at  like a lot of the other hair loss shampoos do.</li>
            <li>After about 6 months I noticed my hair thickening up (I also have been using Lipogaine&#x27;s &amp;#34;Lipogaine for Men: Intensive Treatment &amp; Complete Solution for Hair Loss&amp;#34;) and the results are slowly but surely showing.</li>
            <li>This in combination with this product http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037TM252/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 has shown progressive results for preventing hair loss and encouraging new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>Now what you probably will not get is new hair growth</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen new growth</li>
            <li>I have been using this new formula for a couple months.</li>
            <li>I would attempt to regrow my hair or live with my baldness.</li>
            <li>and there is also some new growth.</li>
            <li>just like advertised it takes time for it to work, and after 6 months my hair has substantially got thicker, and new hairs are growing all over including</li>
            <li>and I have noticed (my hairdresser did too) new growth where I was thinning.</li>
            <li>LOTS OF NEW HAIR STILL GROWING</li>
            <li>The product seems to have stabilized hair loss with a bit of new growth.  </li>
            <li>Just follow the instruction, it will help you keep what you have &amp; regrow new hairs.</li>
            <li>but there are definitely new hairs coming in along the front.</li>
            <li>I have noticed new hair growth, and it&#x27;s thicker and appears fuller.</li>
            <li>I really noticed since using this a significant amount of less hair has been falling out</li>
            <li>so now I noticed less in my brush and shower and noticed it hasn’t been coming out so much or as easily.</li>
            <li>I have been buying Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo for over a year now and will continue to do so as I really like how much it thickens my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is available in a handful of shampoos such as Regenepure, Revita, Lipogaine - Big 3, Hair Surge, and Nizoral.</li>
            <li>but it was still kind of thin and didn&#x27;t grow as fast.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has the ketoconazole in an excellent moisturizing base with lots of high quality ingredients and most importantly no sulfates since my hair is colored.</li>
            <li>At this point it seems very reasonable to expect it will be back to 90-100% of what it used to be, perhaps with another 6 months.</li>
            <li>Since then I have maintained the same which is good since I&#x27;m just trying to delay any further loss as long as possible.</li>
            <li>It does not flat my hair like many other shampoos.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed new growth in spots on top of my head and in small areas of my crown.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s helping to grow more hair or just preventing hair loss.</li>
            <li>In the past I used regenpure and lipogaine is byfar a better product....</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t promise you it will stop your hair loss, but in my experience, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed fewer hairs in my shower and that&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>just wish it more ketoconazole as that is the only proven ingredient to remove DHT only at a 2% concentration (vs 1% as currently formulated).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy that for sure over this relatively small bottle.</li>
            <li>I sometimes use Nizoral for the first wash then use this product for the 2nd wash.</li>
            <li>shampoo smells great, its thick, and does lather well, especially on the second</li>
            <li>During my research, I learned to expect some initial shedding, which I did for the first month.  </li>
            <li>The first bottle the shampoo was thicker and this bottle (second one)</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft after using as well!</li>
            <li>It also completely got rid of my dandruff!</li>
            <li>The other products i&#x27;ve tried would work for a few days and then dry my scalp out, leading to more dandruff, and more itch.</li>
            <li>I can easily say that this shampoo was able to slow down my hair loss.</li>
            <li>what i also like is that it does not contains laurel sulfato and thats good , because that stuff is bad, specially if u want lo leave it on the hair for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>As as HUGE bonus I also seem to be loosing less hairs since I started using it.</li>
            <li>I have almost zero dandruff, when I rub my hands through my hair over a black surface I see maybe one or two flakes which is a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>I usually have a dryness problem but Big 3 makes my scalp look and feel amazing.</li>
            <li>It does not dry my scalp as much as Nizoral.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different shampoos trying to find something that worked, but have had no success until now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It lathers up nicely with only a small amount of shampoo per application.  </li>
            <li>I have been using lipogaine with other shampoos (one caffeine based shampoo and one alpha hydroxy acid shampoo) and so far I have seen significant decrease in shedding.</li>
            <li>Will it slow down hair loss and keep your scalp happy?</li>
            <li>I decided giving lipogaine big 3 a try and found that I had pretty much the same experience.</li>
            <li>In short, I highly recommend this shampoo, especially in combination with the right additional hair-loss treatments.</li>
            <li>The more visible one&#x27;s were there before, but I also noticed some very tiny vellus hairs in spots around my hairline that previously had no hair(most</li>
            <li>thing I noticed on this second purchase is that the formula was changed slightly, for the better.  </li>
            <li>Noticed less hair on hands which only means more stayed on head.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks almost as good as it did a few years ago in less than 8 months time.</li>
            <li>I was a huge promoter of this product when i first bought in 2011 it did everything it was suppose as of late i wondering why i was sheeding so much hair come to find out today that it longer has azelaic acid a key DHT blocker .</li>
            <li>Well, it happened in a big way: I went from being a big-curly haired, happy fellow to nearly bald in a little less than a year.</li>
            <li>so I also use the Women&#x27;s Sensitive Product, and I have had quick results with those, but the Big 3 shampoo took to the next level.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited about the growth to say the least</li>
            <li>It really does my hair well, its not flat!</li>
            <li>my situation may be a little different than many others.</li>
            <li>A little more research led me to Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo, which also has ketoconazole, along with saw palmetto, biotin, emu oil and niacin with no SLS!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Great shampoo, a little expensive but worth it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really not because you only need a small amount and 3 times per week, so one bottle last a long time and the results are priceless, the shampoo also works well with the lipongaine drops, with the combination you&#x27;ll get results even quicker!!</li>
            <li>I wish I could use all natural products</li>
            <li>tried laser combs, saw palmetto, its extract, nioxin etc, now i use minoxidil, but it wasn&#x27;t really working (until recently</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for five months now and am surprised at how well this product has worked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been using the Lipogaine Intensive Treatment Complete Solution on my balding crown.</li>
            <li>/&gt;so guys i do have to say that so far...</li>
            <li>Too early to tell yet if it helps with hair loss but hair does look fuller.  </li>
            <li>This has worked so far.</li>
            <li>My son uses this product and swears by it, he also accompanies it with the  product Lipogaine for Men Intensive Treatment and complete Solution for Hair Loss.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month going on 2 months so its too early to tell no visible sign yet of changes with hair growth.</li>
            <li>Sure - but this is at LEAST a 6 month supply (probably a year)</li>
            <li>but I knew I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is just about the only Clinically Proven ingredient to actually help with Hair Loss as its been demonstrated to inhibit the Hormone DHT (Dihydrotestosterone) which is the primary culprit causing Male Pattern Hair Loss.</li>
            <li>and she could see a ton of baby hairs for the first time in a long time.</li>
            <li>; so far).</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it completely horrified me.</li>
            <li>and before I buy anything, online or in person, I do as much research as I possibly can.</li>
            <li>but my hair legitimately did stop shedding, like completely, after 6 or so months of using it 2 times a week.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo and use it daily.</li>
            <li>So far, this seems to be as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Lots of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Too early to say if it impacts hair-loss or promotes re-growth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s Rogaine or if my hair just naturally stopped thinning, but between Rogaine and this I haven&#x27;t lost any hair.</li>
            <li>It is too early to see any hair growth</li>
            <li>This product definitely cleans my hair and scalp very well.</li>
            <li>So far its been almost 2 months since I stopped using this shampoo and</li>
            <li>I was in the early stages of losing hair and freaking out about it.</li>
            <li>I generally wash my hair with a bit of normal shampoo, rinse it out, and then work Lipogaine in immediately after.</li>
            <li>I use in in conjunction with Lipogaine and have not seen any real improvement over the last 8 months.</li>
            <li>Did Lipogaine completely fill in the hair...</li>
            <li>Tried natural stuff...</li>
            <li>, natural stuff didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li>I went as far as to put fungus cream on my head...</li>
            <li>I really hope Lipogaine revises their Big 3 shampoo and start making it without salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li>Cleans your hair but doesn&#x27;t strip the natural oil of your hair.</li>
            <li>My “old” dandruff shampoo used sulfates, which I wanted to get away from.  </li>
            <li>I like the smell and how soft and manageable</li>
            <li>I used one bottle so far</li>
            <li>but the hair loss stopped and I am far from bald.</li>
            <li>The old formula had phenoxyethanol in it, which is a hideous ingredient used as a preservative.  </li>
            <li>My hair had NEVER felt that soft.</li>
            <li>if just using the shampoo alone will do as much, as he used the Lipogaine serum along with it, but I&#x27;d definitely try</li>
            <li>My hair loss is completely stopped after one week use of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>As to longer-term effects, I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month or so, but my hair seems like it&#x27;s much improved even on the days I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>The shampoo I will use for as long as it provides thickness and growth; however, the pills and the Minoxidil cause a lot of blood pressure issues, so be aware of that.</li>
            <li>it also has a lot of natural ingredients which leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>No hair restoration product is an instant solution, and I have not been using it as much as the recommended frequency.</li>
            <li>lasts for nearly 1.5 months for me</li>
            <li>Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo really works.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try and one bottle, even though only 8 ounces, should last a couple of months.</li>
            <li>but I am confident that repeated use of the Lipogaine products will help to slow, if not stop, additional hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was skeptical when I bought this product, but there were a lot of good reviews</li>
            <li>I noticed that my hair has started to slowly look better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I have actually grown new hair or the shampoo has just made it look thicker, but I do know it looks better.  </li>
            <li>Although this solution alone will probably not stimulate hair regrowth, it certainly does not aggravate the scalp or cause irritation like other intense shampoos.</li>
            <li>the key to stopping and reversing male hairloss is to catch it early, and attack it with the right products NOW- the longer you wait, the more hair you will lose that you can never get back; in regards to being the RIGHT product, Lipogaine Big 3 is THE keto shampoo of choice for me; it may be $25, but a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is light and has a low odor, I use the shampoo along with other product for re-growing hair.</li>
            <li>shampoo itself smells minty and fresh, due to Peppermint as one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>My hair was thinning and falling, and I read a lot of reviews with other products and this one had a lot of success reviews.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend this product especially for people who have hair thinning combined with seborrheic dermatitis and acne near the hairline.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick enough to not drip down your face when you leave it in which is also a great plus.</li>
            <li>This particular bottle sells for $25 while a larger volume Nizoral sells for $15 at Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the cost and the bottle lasts quite a long time, even with daily application (and 2-3 times a week is the suggested frequesny of usage).</li>
            <li>I just ordered my second bottle because my hair is growing back now and pretty rapidly...</li>
            <li>So it will last a long time and worth money.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this product has been a big part of making that happen, and generally improving the whole situation.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if this is doing anything or not, I am losing hair or thinning on the top and back of my head.  </li>
            <li>Given how much I have used in the first two weeks of daily use, I think this bottle will last me at least 3 to 4 months which is not a bad deal.  </li>
            <li>Im definitely starting early, I decided to start using this after noticing a little more scalp in the back in photos.</li>
            <li>The trick is to make sure you use a lot of conditioner after as it does tend to dry hair out just a little.</li>
            <li>One major difference I’ve noticed is the complete lack of hair in the shower drain.</li>
            <li>Ketoconazole is the active ingredient in this shampoo which helps with hair loss, although it is loaded with other supportive ingredients.</li>
            <li>Basically it has the good stuff and excludes the bad stuff therefore and still foams up well without having to use a huge amount each time, also only needing 2 to 3 uses a week to gain the necessary benefit.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have definitely seen the hair loss come to a complete halt and all kinds of new growth.</li>
            <li>too much shedding for too long.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works really well to restore hair and its lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has extra ingredients that normal volume shampoos don&#x27;t have.  </li>
            <li>Regenepure was fine but had a little less lubricant property and a little more peppermint oil, which made it not as pleasing.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t completely back to normal, but it&#x27;s quite a bit improved.</li>
            <li>And you only need a small spoon full to do the whole head.</li>
            <li>Smelled the same, but it took more of it to get the same amount of lather as the green.</li>
            <li>I recommend doing a semi-wash everyday instead of a full wash every 2 or 3 days.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know whether it was a coincidence or the shampoo was really working, but it is the only shampoo that reduced my hair loss, which I noticed right after the first/ second use, judging by how much hair was left on my brush -- much less than before.</li>
            <li>When I tried the Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo around 6 months ago, I can clearly see the hair loss slow down a lot within a few weeks which made me very happy.</li>
            <li>,my hair is super thin and was always falling out with the littlest tug,anything from putting my hair up,washing it,brushing etc would rip it right out</li>
            <li>looking forward to see new hair grow back in!</li>
            <li>It has lead to a healthier scalp and, used in conjunction with the Lipogaine topical solution, has resulted in thicker hair and new hair growth.</li>
            <li>It seems to make my hair thicker and possibly even started some new hair growth.</li>
            <li>Together, these two products have stopped my hair from receding further and helped stimulate some new growth.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was working at first, but the key is to leave it in your hair for as long (or longer) than they instruct you to on the bottle.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product for the first time in late 2012 I believe and have used in consistently ever since</li>
            <li>I use it everyday, mix a lil bit with some cheap baby shampoo to stretch out The big 3..  </li>
            <li>The only negative effect of this shampoo is that with overuse (more than 3 times a week) it may cause scalp irritation.</li>
            <li>Because it needs to be used consistent for long periods of time, only wish it can be purchased cheaper and in bulk.</li>
            <li>After using Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo, I am pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>No weird chemical or fertilizer-y smells like other products he tried before this one.  </li>
            <li>I would say if you are concerned about regrowing hair use it with Lipogain or try one out first and then compliment it with the other.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo for thin hair and definitely slows down shedding.  </li>
            <li>I hope they resolve this because they make other great products and ketoconazole shampoos are difficult to find.</li>
            <li>was originally prescribed Nizoral 2% Ketoconazole shampoo from my dermatologist, but found that it left my hair feeling heavy, as if there was build-up in it, or as if it didn&#x27;t all wash out completely.&lt;br /&gt;Lipogaine</li>
            <li>All of the ingredients that I mentioned especially Ketaconazole (This is a big one, look it up) are the main fundamental ingredients needed to fight hair loss.</li>
            <li>Overall, I noticed an increase in shedding, particularly in areas where I wasn&#x27;t shedding before (like the back of my head).</li>
            <li>Not only does Lipogaine Big 3 contain a high concentration of Ketoconazole (2%)</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is that the first bottle that I bought had the shampoo colored light opaque pink -- due to ketoconazole ingredient ( an anti fungal that is used for severe dandruff, and in several studies it was shown to reduce hair loss ); however, the color of the shampoo in my second bottle is grayish opaque white.</li>
            <li>When combined with Ketoconazole for sustained periods on the scalp as is needed to receive the anti-androgenic (anti-DHT) effects, these ingredients can cause itching, redness and general discomfort on the scalp.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t cheap, but at least I don&#x27;t have to wash as often with this type of shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a female with long hair, so to not use so much shampoo saves money.  </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to apply much, and the bottle can last quite a long time</li>
            <li>but what happened immediately was that with Lipogaine Big 3 was that my hair stop shedding almost completely</li>
            <li>On the in between days I just wash my hair with water only to maintain natural oils on my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>The shampoo works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may experience some shedding in the beginning, however this is natural for any hair loss product, especially ketoconazole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin (particularly my head) feels oily now where before I had dry hair/scalp.  </li>
            <li>It also left my hair feeling soft and well conditioned.  </li>
            <li>A shampoo alone can only get people so far.  </li>
            <li>I am a 38 year old male.  </li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo for only 4 weeks so far (started on October 10, 2014).  </li>
            <li>Well along with the lipogaine treatment I have been using the big 3 shampoo for over 2 years now and my hair has completely stopped falling out, thicker than it has ever been.</li>
            <li>I am only giving it a three star because I am in the early stages of usage.</li>
            <li>So far, I can only say my hair is not falling out anymore.</li>
            <li>I think I was sensitive to the SLS and other harsh chemistry in major brand shampoos, which this product is largely free of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the upside, the price for this product has gone down about $5 since it first came</li>
            <li>I have been using PURA DOR for the past year with good results (meaning my hair loss has not goteen worse), but decided to try out lipogaines shampoo as It is new on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shampoo feels and smells like regular shampoo, but definitely produces new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo for a few months and while I have not seen any hair regrowth, the rate of hair fallout has been reduced tremendously.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday on my short just above the shoulder length hair and it normally takes a little more than a month to use up the bottle.</li>
            <li>I was not looking to sprout tons of new hair or anything like that, but just to try and keep what I have as long as I can.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not going to talk about the effectiveness of this shampoo for hair loss prevention because it should be exactly the same as any other 1% ketoconazole shampoo.</li>
            <li>I do notice that my hair has stopped falling out (no loose hairs in the drain or on the bathroom floor).</li>
            <li>My hair started growing from the back first...and In just 3 months, I can now look in the mirror and see a huge difference, I only have a small area in the front, about the size of a quarter.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and would recommend it compared to other</li>
            <li>The other ketoconazole shampoos that are meant to be for dandruff irritate my scalp too much, but this doesn&#x27;t bother it at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really thickens your hair as some other reviews have stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a 29 year old white female with androgenetic alopecia.</li>
            <li>I have since discontinued use of such topical treatments and am going with natural supplements and washing my hair with combo of shampoo and apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, it contains Emu Oil which is a powerful anti-inflammatory agent that helps to mitigate harsh effects of the skins exposure to Ketoconazole.</li>
            <li>The price is kind of expensive, but is comparable in price to similar products.  </li>
            <li>Many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and pseudo organic products use this as a preservative which sets me off because it is an unhealthy chemical that has potential side effects.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried Regenpure, Pura d&#x27;or, and Hair Surge (p.s. not to be confused with the famous SURGE Movement on Facebook who just brought back SURGE soda).</li>
            <li>Some quality control issues in the past, had one batch where it was visibly thinner than previous orders, seems to have corrected this issue with latest batch.</li>
            <li>The first one, green in color, lasted me six months using three times a week.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair thick and full (noticeably so).</li>
            <li>I have relatively thick, fine hair that I wear long.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, I am headed in the right direction as far as at least preserving what hair I have left.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried various things over the past 20 years, from a brief Propecia experiment that I abandoned due to the prospect of &amp;#34;certain sexual side-effects&amp;#34; to propylene-glycol based Rogaine, which caused lesions and actually accelerated he hair loss.  </li>
            <li>I have seen minimal new hairs</li>
            <li>I notice less hair shed in between shampoos thanks to the dht blockers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it was coincidence or not, but either way, I&#x27;m sure there were a few factors, including the use of this shampoo that gave me the results I have.  </li>
            <li>The main active ingredient is the ketoconazole which acts as a DHT blocker.</li>
            <li>It does not magically grow your hair back, but it is useful when combined with minoxidil.</li>
            <li>Well, I have a couple bald spots on the sides of my head from hair extensions and my hair grows super slow</li>
            <li>i have only been using it for a couple of months, but i am certain it is getting thicker and there seems to be a lot less hair fall after a shower.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It won&#x27;t regrow hair for most people probably, but in terms of helping slow down hair loss, I believe it helps.</li>
            <li>When I first read the ingredients of this product I was looking for these key ingredients: Ketaconazole, Biotin, Saw Palmetto, Nettles, Castor oil, Emu oil, and Niacin and without any drying and harsh ingredients such as propylene glycol.  </li>
            <li>The only problem was that Nizoral was harsh, contained SLS and other harsh chemicals and left hair kind of frazzled.</li>
            <li>first, a very small amount goes a very long way; like i said, i still have a lot of hair and only a little bit creates a fantastic lather for me.</li>
            <li>Lipogaine Big 3 does not dry out my scalp, and I think I&#x27;m somewhat prone to dandruff as I remember having it as a kid, I definitely do not have it now, and that is also a use for ketoconazole.</li>
            <li>(I have very thin hair, naturally, and even more so after experience shedding over the last several months!)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several different hair products, shampoos and conditioners for my hair loss, and nothing has improved the look and feel of my hair like Lipogaine Big 3.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li>I found this shampoo left my hair feeling much softer and less processed than Nizoral with the same benefits (reduced itching, flaking, and shedding).  </li>
            <li>My hair has got in a little thicker but not by much.</li>

            <li> After using the product for more than 2 years, I must say this is the best hair loss product in the market.</li>
            <li> but it surely works for me wonderfully.  </li>

            <li> The ingredients in the shampoo are the type that you want to fight mpb hairloss and is probably the best one you can get on Amazon right now for the price.</li>

            <li> Pleasant smell and leaves your hair feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li> Its been working amazing</li>
            <li> Amazing shampoo, amazing ingredients and amazing company.  </li>
            <li> The peppermint leaves your scalp feeling amazing.</li>
            <li> IS AMAZING</li>
            <li> this shampoo is amazing, it stopped my hair loss, and I got rid of my dandruff problems, my hair is now thicker, every bottle lasts two months, in my case.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> has 1% Ketoconazole, yet it works as effectively as the Nizoral 2%, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling filmy and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad to find that my progress is a good bit ahead of the curve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have some catching up to do, but it just amazes how well this product (and the liquid) work.</li>
            <li> , it lathers up really nicely</li>
            <li> dont think this product is really effective at treating hair loss or helping to promote a climate that engages hair growth.</li>
            <li> The degree of hair loss does seem to have leveled off since switching to this kind of shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled with the results, also I am not losing any....</li>
            <li> Was a nice feeling to have a bit of my identity and dignity returned to me.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I have noticed hair regrowth after about 4 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I would say this cocktail is 85% as effective as Finasteride</li>
            <li> got this product for purpose of review,all views and claims are 100 percent my own.</li>
            <li> Excellent and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the shampoo and it is effective.</li>
            <li> It would be an effective product for an irritated scalp without the hair growth component, but addressing both is a win-win.</li>
            <li> Smells really nice too, like mint, and doesn&#x27;t seem to be drying to the hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a good smell, a good lather, its sulfate free and</li>
            <li> It foams up nicely.  </li>
            <li> It lathers well, smells nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also wonderful that it doesn&#x27;t contain SLS, which can be very drying on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Dandruff is a fungus and that can&#x27;t be good for a healthy scalp.  </li>
            <li> shampooo wash my hair goood nice smell also</li>
            <li> Smells nice... noticed no change.</li>
            <li> The Emu Oil really is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I tried Lipogaine and honestly, haven&#x27;t looked elsewhere since.  </li>
            <li> Also, it does a nice job washing hair.</li>
            <li> These hairs would have fallen out on their own any ways.</li>
            <li> on top of that it smells good.</li>
            <li> Lipogaine Shampoo also lathers up nicely, smells good and makes my hair and scalp feel very clean.</li>
            <li> great shampoo, clean and effective ingredients.</li>
            <li> Great smell and makes my scalp feeling clean</li>
            <li> It does a great job leaving your hair clean and not oily.</li>
            <li> The shampoo smells good(nice minty smell) and it leaves your scalp feeling great and clean.  </li>
            <li> Better than advertised and very satisfied.</li>
            <li> it is also has more body and just a very healthy look</li>
            <li> Has a pleasant smell and I genuinely feel that it invigorates my scalp.</li>
            <li> that clean hair and nice pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty wonderful shampoo, it smells good and does exactly what it is supposed to do!</li>
            <li> this is one of the best shampoos i had so far!</li>
            <li> I am using both lipogaine products and have got some pretty good results even with my inconsistant applications!</li>
            <li> No dandruff, this is the best product I&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> I tried Nizoral and while it had the ketoconazole this product has that and much more - plus a nice peppermint smell</li>
            <li> I have tried all the popular Ketoconazole shampoos and this one by far is the best, as it leaves my hair fuller and with more volume.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money, and a great addition to anyone&#x27;s hair loss regime.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s perfect cleans has keto and not harsh with emu oil.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure how effective this product is</li>
            <li> The cheaper shampoo would take away any hair products you would be wearing and make Lipogaine more effective.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product , its worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo on the market if you are experiencing hair loss.</li>
            <li> So far I have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Like much better than Nizoral, no sulfates and seems to be quite effective.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product , its worth the money.</li>
            <li> Best product I have used so far on my hair.</li>
            <li> The best product for me so far.  </li>
            <li> and this is BY FAR the best.</li>
            <li> think they&#x27;re both effective, but I prefer Lipogaine because it foams up better (and it smells</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have used so far.</li>
            <li> (very fine &amp;#34;baby</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Thanks for such a great product..Now even my manager is using it lol</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look great for the first 2 months</li>
            <li> First of all, it leaves my hair feeling and looking great</li>
            <li> I have used many many products include the most popular Rogaine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced no ill side affects after using a couple bottles of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> this shampoo is pretty great.  </li>
            <li> It smells good and makes my scalp feel healthy and clean.  </li>
            <li> I think it is doing a great job of keeping my scalp clean, which is so important in preventing hair loss.</li>
            <li> It seems to be doing what it states, and it is a fine shampoo to boot!  </li>
            <li> In addition, I liked that the label peels off of the bottle easily, so people aren&#x27;t scoping my hairloss products in the shower when they go in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> The smell is really pleasant and it does fresh your hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo also has a nice scent and as others have mentioned, it lathers easily, so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I just wanna say I love Lipogaine, I gave it 5 stars in my review because I believe it is a very effective product</li>
            <li> my scalp has a very healthy clean feeling also.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be giving my hair more volume.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt better.</li>
            <li> Ok so i tried the lipogaine drops and it did wonders...</li>
            <li> i stopped using it because i noticed more hair fell off my head.</li>
            <li> started using it and was pleased immediately by a couple of things.</li>
            <li> Best of luck to all of you out there doing the same, &amp;#34;project.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and i do use it every day with no problems at all, so no itchy , and nothing , it just feels healthy.</li>
            <li> and i love it,</li>
            <li> and boy I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I went back to using Perfect Hair Shampoo</li>
            <li> my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> It lathers up a lot better...</li>
            <li> Lipogaine is the best hair loss shampoo I have ever used: it contains ingredients that have demonstrated legitimate clinical efficacy in fighting hair loss and decreasing scalp DHT levels (ketokonazole) and anti-inflammation agents such as copper peptides and biotin.  </li>
            <li> my hair looks more stronger</li>
            <li> I have been using both for almost a month and the lipogaine for women is OK</li>
            <li> I can say that flakiness has diminished and that I love the smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair regrowing products for many years.</li>
            <li> Decided to give Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo a try after being extremely impressed with their minoxidil.</li>
            <li> I pair it with a nice conditioner free of parabens and dilithicone or any type of silicone which you want to avoid.</li>
            <li> There are many hair loss shampoos out there to choose from.</li>
            <li> My scalp and hair always feels better after i use this stuff.</li>
            <li> Most are all style and no substance.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say for sure if I am regrowing any hair from it.</li>
            <li> I began losing my hair about 15 years ago, mostly on the crown of my head.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Lipogaine promotes healthy hair, and consequently it makes the hair you have stay in place.  </li>
            <li> Proof that I&#x27;m pleased with this product is that I&#x27;ve bought it more than once.  </li>
            <li> but thought this shampoo would perhaps make things even better.</li>
            <li> So glad to of found this product.</li>
            <li> I feel like they are working for me and expect to see more hair regrowth in the coming months.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light mint smell to it</li>
            <li> After using this product I sure see a difference.</li>
            <li> My hair is oily and lipogaine makes it feel healthy.</li>
            <li> it has worked wonders for me:)</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with Lipogaine for men, and my hair is fuller, stronger for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple months and it does seem to help while using Lipogaine minoxodil (which is great!)</li>
            <li> (Lipogaine has more supposed DHT-blocking products...check out &#x27;Azetinol&#x27;).</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair feel thicker and more dense.</li>
            <li> It does work for most people.</li>
            <li> and I felt like this product would help me to both thicken up and regrow more hair for a fuller look.</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow the instructions and wash your hair twice with it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li> Will keep buying :)</li>
            <li> but I think overall this is the best.</li>
            <li> Did I mention the smell? :)</li>
            <li> and I think this is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li> It is not a miracle shampoo, but it does make my hair feel healthy</li>
            <li> but, I love the formula of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Many of my friends have told me that there is an improvement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I love it.  </li>
            <li> After losing a bit more hair I decided to try to incorporate keto again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried this product for 3 weeks and during that time I started to lose my hair even more.</li>
            <li> I would run my fingers across the top of my scalp and boom...</li>
            <li> more hair kept falling off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t post to many reviews but after having to go through what this product did to me</li>
            <li> Fantastic shampoo!</li>
            <li> You are better off with 1percent Nizoral...</li>
            <li> I do not see any hair falling any more.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I use it in combination with minox, and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;After 3 month hairs feel thicker and more shiny.</li>
            <li> I started using the shampoo at the same time I started using the Lipo minox topical, which probably wasn&#x27;t the best idea for assessing results, but the outcome has been awesome.  </li>
            <li> It works in conjunction with their minoxidil and is a potent combination.</li>
            <li> soon I&#x27;m going to give it a try one more  time</li>
            <li> After using for a while longer I will be able to share growth and or improved thickness and over all health of my hair review.</li>
            <li> My hair looks noticeably better than before and is an excellent step in my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Regenepure is even more drying.</li>
            <li> Im back on it once again for 2 months now and will never stop using this awesome product, in tandem with the lipogaine serum and biotin supplements my hair is returning once again fuller and thicker</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there a better products out there.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the results that I am getting.</li>
            <li> I tried many shampoos up to now.</li>
            <li> I was not concerned too much about the price based off the great reviews the product had already.  </li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo in conjunction with generic Equate minoxidil since someone said the Equate version made in Israel is the best.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s looking like I can get about 3 months usage from one bottle while using it most days.</li>
            <li> The best over-the-counter hair loss shampoo I&#x27;ve used, actually.</li>
            <li> Out of all of them, I like Lipogaine Big 3 the best.</li>
            <li> and I did order two more bottles and will update my review if I feel my hair thickens.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m also very happy with that product I can see lots of tiny hairs growing in.</li>
            <li> I love this Shampoo.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair looking and feeling more dense.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning on top and the thinning area always itched a lot.</li>
            <li> Have used it for more than 2 year.  </li>
            <li> Of the two, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> and therefore I will continue using it until something better comes along.</li>
            <li> I can tell it works because when I stop using the product I shed more hair then</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I would love to use it more often but at $25 for 8oz</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin products for years and have been satisfied.  </li>
            <li> but Lipogaine solution sure has so I will combine as recommended 2 to 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> the better the product is for us to use.</li>
            <li> As a result, my hair looks great, and I am confident that I have totally stopped my hair loss for good.  </li>
            <li> I love this product it helped fight my receding hairline.</li>
            <li> No shampoo alone will eliminate it, so most recommend a minoxidil treatment as well.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I love this anti-DHT shampoo.</li>
            <li> I look forward to the 2-3 times a week that I use it because of how much better my hair looks over the course of that day.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t see anything  more</li>
            <li> It is great quality and again really works.</li>
            <li> This is the one of the best shampoo to use if you&#x27;re gonna try to fight male pattern baldness.</li>
            <li> Can style it however you want and the fact it has ketoconazole makes it even better.</li>
            <li> way better than regenpure.</li>
            <li> Love Lipogaine, my husband loves Lipogaine.</li>
            <li> Can be used more often than Nizoral and without the unwanted side effect of leaving your hair feeling like straw.</li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over 2 years and it has helped to keep my hair growing and healthy.  </li>
            <li> This product combined with the Lipogaine scalp treatment has kept my hair healthy and not falling out.  </li>
            <li> I have not lost any more hair and have even re-grown some.  </li>
            <li> Love the way it feels when you leave it in for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> It costs more than LIpogaine and</li>
            <li> People this stuff really works !!!!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this shampoo,I get the results I desire, thank you very much!</li>
            <li> It does work up a nice rich lather once you get it going.</li>
            <li> Nice shampooo love shamppo specially liitle bit</li>
            <li> been using lipogaine shampoo with the drops for 6 months now and the results have been steady and great.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel nice and clean and tingly too.</li>
            <li> Smells nice , hair feels clean</li>
            <li> It has worked great in managing my dandruff outbreaks, I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> This product is great, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My dad says it leaves his hair very clean.</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely and leaves the hair feeling full.</li>
            <li> I think the shampoo is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I can say I have noticed much thicker hair and my fair follicles towards my crown are thicker and seem to be more healthy.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working pretty good.</li>
            <li> Also it smells good and leaves my hair looking good, not flat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Big 3 has a nice scent to it, it doesn&#x27;t get super foamy, and leaves some volume to it after you are done showering.</li>
            <li> That is most important to me. :)</li>
            <li> I have naturally fine hair with some thinning, but I&#x27;ve noticed my hair to be much more manageable and fuller since using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have hair past my shoulders and use the product 2x / week, and one bottle lasts a good 6 months; a more than fair price to pay to maintain and thicken your hair!  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is filled with quality ingredients and leaves your hair nice and clean.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light fragrance and the hair does feel clean after showering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cool and minty feeling.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own, but it&#x27;s highly concentrated and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, much better than the average hairloss shampoo you can get at Walgreens/CVS.</li>
            <li> For me, hair loss was basically ceased, and I experienced modest hair growth on both my hairline and crown.</li>
            <li> most importantly it has ketonconazole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its great product for complete hair problems.</li>
            <li> My son also likes it because it has greatly reduced the acne near his scalp.  </li>
            <li> Combined, they have done an incredible job at halting my hair loss, especially my receding hairline.</li>
            <li> So far I am happy with the result of using his product.</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised that it lathers great, and gives an invigorating tingling feeling as well.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product with my friend, so I decided to try and so far I&#x27;m so happy with it, and I would recomended too.</li>
            <li> and I love it, it&#x27;s hands down the best ketoconazole shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> For those who are willing to seriously let the shampoo rest on their scalp for a good 3.5 minutes or more, this product is excellent, and I think the best product on the market currently.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smelling nice and clean with full volume.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li> Though it is a little more costly than some of its competitors, it also delivers the best results.</li>
            <li> I performed a lot of online research, using a variety of resources, to try and find a shampoo that would hopefully work for my issues and be more hair friendly.  </li>
            <li> (SUCH a good thing!</li>
            <li> (Lipogaine has their own version which really does work better than Rogaine and its generics</li>
            <li> I use it Mondays, Wednesday and Fridays to keep it easy to remember.</li>
            <li> Very mild ingredients.</li>
            <li> What I can be sure of is that it leaves my hair feeling clean and  non greasy.</li>
            <li> This is a great product better than the traditional Rogaine.  </li>
            <li> Smells good and initially leaves a nice tingly sensation on the scalp.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice and feels very gentle for hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it works, it has all the right ingredients!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo hands down</li>
            <li> My hair has always been fine, but I have seen the gradual thinning on the top/crown and around the hairline (horseshoe pattern?).  </li>
            <li> Smell is fine.  </li>
            <li> See, I have really fine hair and all of the time I spend outdoors</li>
            <li> Quick shipping!  </li>
            <li> and I must say, it has quickly become my favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li> and i super LOVE</li>
            <li> Compared to other products, which often require multiple shampoos which each cost as much or more than this one, this is by far the best value along with being the best in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> better than nizoral which makes my hair dry and itchy, this shampoo has emu oil which moisturizes the scalp and makes my hair and scalp feel great.</li>
            <li> Following the instructions to lather and rinse twice while massaging and waiting for the amount of time recommended is also very important to get an optimum result.  </li>
            <li> I dont think they claim this product regrows hair, but I have seen a huge difference in the amount of hair that is lost.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a great shampoo to add to your arsenal of hair loss products.</li>
            <li> the fact that the shampoo is sulfate free is important.  </li>
            <li> I got great results with this shampoo (applied 3 times a week) and combined with 5% minoxidil such as Lipogaine and oral DHT blockers.</li>
            <li> shampoo lather is great , I only used 1/10 of this shampoo in a month .</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great because it has all the essential ingredients that you need to promote hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s particularly great to use, prior to applying minoxidil</li>
            <li> This shampoo is surprisingly gentle, and is effective at slowing hair loss on my front scalp.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s important to do your homework.</li>
            <li> , its great&lt;br /&gt;I am happy that I found this product; it actually works and my hair have grown ..</li>
            <li> Studies for this are readily available online</li>
            <li> On off days I use a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it is the best shampoo for me.</li>
            <li> I actually use Lipogaine&#x27;s minoxidil product, which is great, but this shampoo did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> I have to say this shampoo definitely makes my hair look thicker and feel great.  </li>
            <li> I have reduced my hair shedding greatly and improved the overall health of my scalp.</li>
            <li> If you just want a shampoo that cleans, you can go pick up any cheap shampoo from a drug store or grocery store and it will do the job.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too strong and it smells clean...</li>
            <li> and I definitely would recommend it to anyone wanting a great shampoo.</li>
            <li> but I do feel it is the highest quality ketoconazole shampoo available to date</li>
            <li> I love the peppermint it leaves my hair feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li> I believe I will buy this product after finish my free sample.</li>
            <li> Lipogaine Big 3 is great when combine with Lipogaine 3 in hair treatment</li>
            <li> I just wash before with a sulfate free shampoo and then wash again with the lipogaine, leaving in for the suggested time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t just want to stop/reverse hair loss, I want my hair to look good also which is simply not possible in many medicated shampoo&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant peppermint scent and leaves your hair feeling soft and full.</li>
            <li> Full head of hair despite a strong genetic predisposition toward it.</li>
            <li> Good product, lathers nicely and works well with other Lipogaine products to help with hair loss.</li>
            <li> it helps keep my hair looking full and strong.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality shampoo, with a great cosmetic feel, with proven, effective ingredients against hair thinning and associated scalp issues such as seborrheic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> Lipogaine Big 3 is very effective in preventing hair loss.</li>
            <li> it has a fresh clean smell unlike many others of this type.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair fresh , clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> A number of shampoos were recommended, which I tried, but it was this Lipogaine brand and formula that were consistently referenced by many experienced guys in the same boat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used their other product, the Minoxidil dropper, along with UltraX labs Hair Rush pills, and this shampoo, and the results are incredible.</li>
            <li> My scalp is now clean and dandruff free.</li>
            <li> First of all, you don&#x27;t need to use much product to get a good lather and thoroughly clean your hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> When focusing on the hairline (because that&#x27;s what you see in the mirror), it&#x27;s easy to ignore how much you&#x27;re losing up top so this stuff will keep it in line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my hair and I am fine with being bold.</li>
            <li> I will be reporting and adding pictures every month to see if there will be any significant difference visible.</li>
            <li> One bottle goes a long way and the results are great.</li>
            <li> Totally worth every penny!</li>
            <li> With consistent use ive regrown frontal hair and staved off loss of more hair.</li>
            <li> Each and every one of them has their unique benefits (Research it).  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed a significant difference in the amount of hair loss</li>
            <li> Worth a shot!</li>
            <li> the shampoo, I would recommend using a cheaper shampoo, like baby shampoo, or anything sulfate free before using Lipogaine to get the full effect of it.</li>
            <li> He originally used this in addition to the lipogaine minoxidil tx</li>
            <li> I had pretty rapid hair loss and tried MANY things, including Rogaine.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant regrowth</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t measured or anything, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that my hair is noticeably fuller.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure that people think I got a hair transplant, but</li>
            <li> Bottom line is that it&#x27;s a rich feeling shampoo, and you just feel like your getting all types of quality ingredients into the scalp and follicles.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are good though and that is apparent in using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Originally, I bought Lipogaine for my husband.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> All in all, it is worth trying it!</li>
            <li> I came across Lipogaine and Regenpure on Amazon and decided to use Lipogaine first because it had more added ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells great and one bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> MPB.. shampoo probably isn&#x27;t enough to stop it, but this is by far the best one you could choose.</li>
            <li> Leaves scalp feeling tingling and clean.</li>
            <li> With so many hair loss products out there claiming to do things that they don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s nice to have find one that actually does.  </li>
            <li> after you apply Lipogaine and that should be it, you will notice how clean your hair feels and also it does help you hair to grow shinner and stronger.</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s keeping my scalp clean and repaired my hair after 6 months in use.</li>
            <li> clean out that DHT with this shampoo or something else you can find.</li>
            <li> I can say that you know that you are getting a clean scalp after use.</li>
            <li> Helps with scalp issues, leaves it so clean it literally squeaks will washing it.</li>
            <li> shampoo leaves a clean, minty scent because of the peppermint oil extract in it.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it works very well for me when I use it together with Lipogaine for women.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple shampoos for hair loss and Lipogaine is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo is by far the BEST shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> My hair is supper clean.</li>
            <li> I believe the ketoconazole to clean dht.  </li>
            <li> And, I dont remember that shampoo leaving my hair feeling that clean.</li>
            <li> Lipogaine Big 3 is by far the best shampoo on the market.  </li>
            <li> What it does is clean and \\&quot;pre-treat\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Had tried Nizoral shampoo before and wasn&#x27;t necessarily sure if it made a difference and also didn&#x27;t like the way it made my hair look/feel after using it, leaving it kind of flat.</li>
            <li> It gives my fine hair more body and helps it dry thicker, I&#x27;ve been happy with it and ordered 2 more bottles after my initial order.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t confirm on how much hair loss prevention it does to my hair, but compare to other hair loss shampoo out there, it is one of the best</li>
            <li> The hair on the top of my scalp quits growing after a certain length.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s important that I take care of my hair accordingly and lipogaine does exactly that!</li>
            <li> Fresh smelling and leaves my hair feeling clean and free of residue.</li>
            <li> the contrary-my hair feels light and clean after using Lipogaine, with a fresh, minty smell.&lt;br /&gt;Lipogaine</li>
            <li> But It certainly makes my scalps feel good and my hairline has been kept safe recently, so I will keep on using this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy to be a lifelong customer of Lipogaine.</li>
            <li> Ok, I want to start by saying I&#x27;ve been using regenepure dr for a long time in conjunction with avalon organics biotin thickening shampoo,  which has done amazing things for my hair.  </li>
            <li> It will likely not stop male pattern baldness on its own, but is a great product when combined with the Lipogaine Intensive Treatment as it will help increase absorption of the Minoxidil.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li> and it actually does a good job on your hair as well as your scalp</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of products throughout the years and have managed to hold onto the remaining hair I do have fairly well given the baldness of my younger family members.</li>
            <li> I also recommend buying the cheapest laser hair comb you can for the full routine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, this shampoo leaves my hair actually looking good.</li>
            <li> My hair looks healthy, shinny and much thinker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a real life boost to my self-esteem to be able to keep my hair</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t make a bald person full headed of course.</li>
            <li> Overall good product.</li>
            <li> Shipping time was more than reasonable.</li>
            <li> To manage expectations, the improvement has not resulted in a full head of hair, but it did reverse the hair loss process.</li>
            <li> I leave it on for the duration of the shower and it gives a cool soothing feeling to my scalp.  </li>
            <li> but my hair hasn&#x27;t been this full in 5</li>
            <li> The good results are definitely from this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased Lipogaine&#x27;s Big 3 shampoo hoping it will be just as good as their minoxidil product.</li>
            <li> I decided on Lipogaine after researching the various ingredients between the two and felt they were a bit superior in Lipogaine.</li>
            <li> I tried another good shampoo for thinning hair, but had to use it every night to totally stop the itching.</li>
            <li> i think the product is really good.my hair look like more thicker after 4 time order .i will continue order in future.thanks</li>
            <li> One star withheld because it seems to be a good product for stopping or slowing hair loss and  bringing back some hair, but doesn&#x27;t appear to restore hair to where it was before hair loss began.  </li>
            <li> Overall a good hair loss shampoo</li>
            <li> but it is not a bad shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is nice like regular store bought shampoo not greasy, easy to use, and lasts awhile.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li> It also has some other great ingredients like Biotin and Saw Palmetto.</li>
            <li> I must say, dandruff control is excellent with this shampoo (absolutely zero recurrence) vs Nizoral where a little would still return.</li>
            <li> It has a &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; fragrance - sort of minty, but I use RedKen conditioner which has a little better fragrance - so it&#x27;s all good.  </li>
            <li> After shampooing, my scalp feels clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> but it was harsh and may have done more harm than good.</li>
            <li> did a ton of research before starting on this, &amp;#34;project&amp;#34; and all of the best reviews and recommendations I found on various forums and web sites pointed me to the product here.</li>
            <li> It feels great, and leaves hair thick and healthy.</li>
            <li> hair thinning is more from internal issues like hypothyroidism so wasn&#x27;t sure if this would even help.</li>
            <li> I immediately got back on Amazon and ordered two more bottles to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> At the start of this year, I made the bold decision to stop shaving.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, this product seems to work a lot better in the sense of improving my scalp condition without being harsh.</li>
            <li> My wife is making fun of me for using these products, however I really don&#x27;t care and am glad I did not wait any longer.</li>
            <li> Again, this product may be worthy of a 5-star review, butI</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am happy with this product, my hair is thicker and I have even recently had a compliment from a hair stylist saying how much hair I have, which is flattering</li>
            <li> Lipogaine uses the same key ingredient that Nizoral uses, but Lipogaine is created for hair loss and has excellent additional ingredients.</li>
            <li> It smells awesome, and overall has a better end result than what I was previously using.</li>
            <li> I received it yesterday and therefore, I&#x27;ve had my hair washed with this shampoo only once, could you believe that my hair looks really wonderful with  only one use?</li>
            <li> I have oily hair and was losing hair quickly...</li>
            <li> The shampoo cleans the hair well and suds up quickly.</li>
            <li> Ironically many of them have sodium sulfates of some kind as well which allegedly speeds up hair thinning.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped me tremendously with my hair thinning.</li>
            <li> I also like that the cleaning agents are mild.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is great and leaves my hair full and not weighted down.  </li>
            <li> My son has used this product for a couple years now, and he says it really works well in leaving his scalp feeling clean!</li>
            <li> It has a mild, fresh scent that I would describe as sweet mint.</li>
            <li> did and amazingly I am seeing the same results as I did originally.  </li>
            <li> It smells ok and lathers nice, never had to use any other shampoo after using this once.</li>
            <li> I feel a lot better about my hair after i use this compared to a normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> I got a haircut this morning and my stylist of 6 years told me that my hair looks and feels thicker than it has in several years, and that my scalp looks very healthy now.</li>
            <li> I have being using &amp;#34;Lipogaine Big 3&amp;#34; since the Nizoral shortage and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say for sure just how much the Big 3 shampoo has helped on its own,</li>
            <li> Smells good and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> 1 bottle lasts a long time, it smells good and my scalp has improved.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ketonconazole has been shown to have some great effects in slowing down hair loss in some, it wont work alone</li>
            <li> For now I am happy that the shedding has slowed down a lot.</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo in the sense that it leaves your hair feeling/looking full and thick.</li>
            <li> I have seen more shedding, which i thought was because of the new product, but given the time frame i am hesitating to recommend this one.</li>
            <li> and I have experienced considerably less itch in those areas.</li>
            <li> Both I and my like this shampoo, smell and creamy texture of the shampoo are good, but I think it may be overly drying for people with dry hair or scalps.</li>
            <li> and I strongly recommend this to anyone who wants to prevent hair loss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting pretty sparse on top after about 9 years of thinning, but not so much that I&#x27;m willing to shave clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i honestly dont know if it sloww my hair from falling, because my hair is to short, but &amp;#34; i still need a shampoo to clean my hair right &amp;#34; so this is it, this is my choice...</li>
            <li> This shampoo really does work!!</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo for two months, I am happy to say that the bald spot is smaller, with new hair filling in around the edges.</li>
            <li> I will update this review if anything changes for the positive or negative, but for now I&#x27;m very happy with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a little more effective in helping shampoo absorb into scalp.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best boost combined with minoxidil and finasteride, plus it does not dry the hair unlike the other ketoconazole shampoos.</li>
            <li> She couldn&#x27;t believe how much it had filled out.</li>
            <li> When I was taking this and the lipogain hair serum, my hair looked amazing and now I&#x27;m trying to get back to that fullness that I had before.</li>
            <li> worth the price</li>
            <li> and how they say it works ( wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the manufacturer wrote those)&lt;br /&gt;while using this product i lost more hair in the shower then when was using baby shampoo</li>
            <li> so what if the label says it has all these ingredients that supposedly help the hair, in reality when i keep all these chemicals on my hair for 3-4 minutes (as directed) then end up loosing way more hair then the natural rate</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying it.</li>
            <li> This product is both style and substance, something extraoardinarily rare in the hair loss industry.</li>
            <li> My criteria were: a) a shampoo that contained clinically proven ingredients that combat DHT and stimulate hair regrowth, and b) a shampoo that actually worked like a quality shampoo (volumized hair, smelled nice, foamed up, etc.).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though it does not work overnight (no product does), it is both a solid and effective product.  </li>
            <li> it was worth giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> It goes along way and my scalp feels fresh afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo every day because I love how soft it makes my hair.  </li>
            <li> It was worth going for Lipogaine.</li>
            <li> After seeing the success of this shampoo I even started to use their Lipogaine with Minoxidil.</li>
            <li> , it has a minty fresh scent which to me</li>
            <li> Only one that really worked was Perfect Image solutions which was disapproved by FDA later.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the smell of the shampoo is nice.  </li>
            <li> I thought It may be worth a try (tried all nutragena shampoo products,,head and shoulders..</li>
            <li> I use about a fifty cent piece / dollar piece worth of shampoo each time</li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s worth as a dandruff cure and making my hair look thicker.  </li>
            <li> Keeping the dandruff under control is worth it alone.  </li>
            <li> so it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lipogaine Big 3 has kept my scalp itch free for more than 6 months.</li>
            <li> My bottle is still pretty full and it&#x27;s been a month.  </li>
            <li> Most anti-thinning shampoos have a lot of trash in them as far as fillers and chemicals go.  </li>
            <li> Just the ketoconazole alone for a shampoo is worth buying this.</li>
            <li> My husband is worth it.</li>
            <li> Just for the appearance alone this shampoo is worth it to me.  </li>
            <li> now i rarely see any hair when i shower.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell you for sure how much it works,</li>
            <li> Product came in good condition and as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good shampoo, but I don&#x27;t get as much coverage as when I use Lipogaine Big 3.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I really have the Big Sexy Hair to match my favorite hairspray.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t been able to seen any conclusive results.</li>
            <li> and I figure it is worth a try to see if it works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d say its worth buying as a replacement to Nizoral, but still nothing beats Nizoral,</li>
            <li> My hair felt thicker/fuller right after the first use!</li>
            <li> A little bit lathers up very nice...</li>
            <li> The formula is far from perfect, but it is much cleaner than most other shampoos on the market, and the cleanest anti-thinning shampoo I have found so far.  </li>
            <li> The reviews were mostly very positive, so I figured for the price</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, lathers easily, and does not weight down hair.  </li>
            <li> So I researched and read reviews on the other ketoconazole shampoos on the market (Nizoral, Regenepure, Revita, etc.) and came to the conclusion that Lipogaine Big 3 would probably work the best.</li>
            <li> There might be other options that are more costly or require a prescription, but for the money, you won&#x27;t be able to beat this product.</li>
            <li> Shipping is pretty quick.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed a difference pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Also, it has many more active ingredients than Nizoral.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best hair loss shampoo I have ever used and believe me I have been fighting hair loss actively for 6 years now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;nizoral is good but with laurel sulfate and other ingredients, i can probably use it once a week and lipogane all week, ..</li>
            <li> Will be using this product for a long time. :-)!</li>
            <li> It has ketoconazole along with other good ingredients.</li>
            <li> Compared to other shampoos that claimed to &amp;#34;thicken hair&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;prevent hair loss,&amp;#34; this product appears to be superior.  </li>
            <li> but since this shampoo had Ketoconazole in it and other good ingredients.</li>
            <li> It has other good ingredients for your hair as well.</li>
            <li> But other than that it is a good investment.</li>
            <li> And this led me to the habit of washing my hair twice a day, usually right before I apply the minoxidil.</li>
            <li> You could see right to my scalp.</li>
            <li> You will notice a difference right away.</li>
            <li> This product has the right combination of ingredients that work to reduce DHT on your scalp.  </li>
            <li> Right now I just bought Hair Surge shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair smell great and look thick and full.</li>
            <li> My hair loss is pretty well under control now but for me to give Lipogaine big 3 a 4 or a 5, it would have to yield hair loss on it&#x27;s own (meaning no propecia, minoxidil, or azealic acid)</li>
            <li> The shampoo is sulfate free and paraben free which I love since the less chemicals</li>
            <li> Good product, nice minty smell and definitely feel as if less hair is lost during showers</li>
            <li> 3 weeks is really too soon to be sure the serum is working, however it does appear to be stimulating new hair growth already.</li>
            <li> There are many shampoos that will make my head feel clean, like refreshingly clean, but most of them leave my scalp dry and cause dandruff when applied regularly.</li>
            <li> With both products, I make sure that the product covers areas up front and on the sides that are mostly bare, not just the areas that still have hair.</li>
            <li> At first I was apprehensive about the price, but it ended up being totally worth it</li>
            <li> I use it every other day and it makes your hair feel pretty good and</li>
            <li> I decided to give this product a try since it got good reviews on Amazon and was highly praised several YouTube videos that espoused the product&#x27;s positive effects.  </li>
            <li> This is the perfect shampoo for my normal hair, it doesn&#x27;t dry up my hair and stay in same condition all day.</li>
            <li> However, I am willing to continue to use the shampoo because of the positive comments, and to allow it to work, and hopefully in the very near future, I will be able to provide more information.  </li>
            <li> I have been using both for 6 months and my hair is back, so happy and look younger.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with minoxodil topical and finasteride daily with great results</li>
            <li> it makes my hair soft and can style it easy.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re balding it&#x27;s worth a try to see if you get positive results.</li>
            <li> This is a great product which you won&#x27;t find in stores because why would big business want to sell something that actually helped the consumer ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this shampoo and can say that overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> After years of problems with hair lost and more than 10 different products which i have tried to curb it, it seems that i found the right one.</li>
            <li> Used Nizoral before which was good for dandruff but was too harsh for my scalp, this has been equally good at the same time soft for my scalp without any side effects.</li>
            <li> Whether it will help grow hair is yet to be seen, but my scalp is very much cleaner and hair is fuller looking.</li>
            <li> Very ironic.  </li>
            <li> Have used this shampoo for 1 month now, I like it very much.</li>
            <li> A very gentle &amp; cleansing solution, seems to compliment the Lipogaine Hair treatment.  </li>
            <li> It is not harsh like some of the other shampoos on the market as I use it three to four times per week with great results.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because it is a little drying, but I use a good hydrating conditioner after which helps.</li>
            <li> This shampoo also works as a great 2-in-1 as it actually also contains a conditioner agent, but the composition differs from most shampoo/conditioner blends as it&#x27;s not greasy and hard to wash out at all.</li>
            <li> and they have seen results within the first month or so.</li>
            <li> The Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo is among the top hair loss shampoos.</li>
            <li> These products seem to help most types and I would definitely encourage trying this solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All in all this product did for me exactly what it said it would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine Big 3 Hair Loss prevention shampoo for about a month now, and love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it actually makes my hair FULLER!  </li>
            <li> I can safely say that those reviews were correct and I definitely suggest that you try this shampoo as a part of your hair restoral efforts.</li>
            <li> I had tried so many different products before.</li>
            <li> Hair definitely looks better.  </li>
            <li> Compared to my regular shampoo it leaves my hair and scalp noticeably cleaner and my hair has a lot more body.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than Nizoral at keeping my dandruff away and the associated hair loss that comes with it, considering all the extra ingredients they put in it.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first month and my hair has become thicker and fuller.  </li>
            <li> This is the first one I see a difference in using.  </li>
            <li> I did not notice any change the first month.</li>
            <li> and I am still on my first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product has consistently strengthened and increased my hair.</li>
            <li> Firstly, a Study Conducted at the University of Liege, Belgium, 1998</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ketoconazole is an anti-Fungal agent contained in the popular anti-dandruff Shampoo Nizoral, which, for many years was the only Ketoconazole Shampoo and used widely off label for hair loss</li>
            <li> but at the present, it is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t make the connection at first because I never think anything will help</li>
            <li> Most definitely!!  </li>
            <li> The process ain&#x27;t broke, so until something better comes along, this is the gold standard I&#x27;m sticking to.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> stuff is not expensive.</li>
            <li> I ordered my first bottle in March and used it exclusively.....</li>
            <li> and I have no ill effects.</li>
            <li> I would recommend trying these products and to stay consistent.</li>
            <li> and I definitely see more dense hair regrowing.</li>
            <li> I was interested in this shampoo because I seen that it fights hair loss.</li>
            <li> Still on my first bottle, I use it 3 times a week and my hair has stopped falling out.</li>
            <li> I initially tried RegenePure Dr. and for the first 2 weeks I was astonished of how immediate my results of better feeling hair and reduced shedding was.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the better shampoo on the market.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t go for it because I assumed it was Rx</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months and have purchased more than one bottle because it is definitely doing its job.</li>
            <li> In addition to this, I use a topical minoxidil product all over the top of my head twice a day.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the way my hair looks and feels since using Lipogaine Big 3 and</li>
            <li> Most shampoos only fight hair loss or volumize but this one does both.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really do much more than any regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I have enjoyed the results I have seen since using this product and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Within the first use, we all noticed that his hair fluffed up and looked shiny as well</li>
            <li> Evidently this helps with hair loss, and that I do not know about.</li>
            <li> I am on my third bottle and I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;There</li>
            <li> and I use it mon,wed, fri and have stayed consistent.</li>
            <li> The first two weeks I immediately noticed a decrease in hair shed followed by about 3 weeks of shedding a lot of hair...</li>
            <li> On my second bottle of shampoo now will get more.</li>
            <li> Made me nervous at first, but the shedding has stopped.  </li>
            <li> It has similar ingredients to Regenpure but works much better.</li>
            <li> I noticed immediately that the shampoo in this latest bottle was a different color (more white than beige).</li>
            <li> I can only tell that I am more than satisfaced with this product.</li>
            <li> Not only have stopped my hair loss but also grown more hair that even my co workers noticed and asked me if I was using anything on my hair</li>
            <li> its really doing the job!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Lipogain big 3 is my favorite one.</li>
            <li> but it really does work so it makes it worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo just wish it had a bigger size and with a pump</li>
            <li> He was really consistent about using the products and it made a difference in his hair that stayed with him even after he stopped using it.  </li>
            <li> My fourth and newest bottle just arrived, and it&#x27;s tan and much more watery.</li>
            <li> I read about DHT and that in order for a chance at regrowing hair, I first had to get scalp inflammation under control.</li>
            <li> my hair feels soft, smooth and shiny after using this shampoo and my hair stopped falling after 2-3 weeks of using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> 4 months before I started to use the shampoo), my hairline definitely looks better than it was 6 months ago.</li>
            <li> The only reason I do not give this a 4 star rating is the price, but I think most of the shampoos on the market are overpriced.  </li>
            <li> This is my first review on anything</li>
            <li> I used Lipogain for about three months and noticed that I was getting \\&quot;undergrowth\\&quot; on the area where my hair was thinning most, middle front potion.</li>
            <li> Shampoo didnt work as good, it dried up my hair and it made my scalp itch</li>
            <li> Right after that they asked me to order few bottles for them and so far they are happy with the results...</li>
            <li> Nice clean scent and refreshing a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Price seems fair to cheap compared to other products that state they do the same thing.  </li>
            <li> Love it, nicely scented and does not irritate the scalp like other similar products.</li>
            <li> Honestly one side is already back to 90%, but the other side is more stubborn.</li>
            <li> It seemed like a great fit for him given that he also had seborrheic dermatitis (cradle cap) since he was very young, and the same active ingredient is used to treat that.  </li>
            <li> The bottle will last you over a month and it leaves your hair smelling clean and looking full.</li>
            <li> I do notice that when using it I am more comfortable and it seems my hair is a little thicker.</li>
            <li> Last year my hair started to fall out rapidly and my bald spot was becoming more noticeable, but after a couple of months of using Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo and Lipogaine Intensive treatment</li>
            <li> /&gt;Combined with a regimen of other products I use, this shampoo has all the qualities of a nice shampoo, and I&#x27;ve been using it for about two years.</li>
            <li> since I use it in combination with other products; with that said, I am not stopping anytime soon, as it is a nice tool in the fight against hairloss.  </li>
            <li> Plus this adds a nice thickness, body and grip that other shampoos don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I like to combine with a conditioner because it does level hair flat otherwise , but that dosent stop me from being satisfied.</li>
            <li> I just do every other day, if i skip the weekends, i just stick to Mon-Wed-Fri; it works out nicely.</li>
            <li> Every guy is different, and I can&#x27;t speak for men who are at a more advanced stage of hair loss, or who tried combatting hair loss much later than I chose to, so again, I&#x27;m mainly speaking as a guy who, with a full head of hair, chose to preempt the loss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 47 yrs old and have been using this shampoo in conjunction with the hair treatment and the results have been just short of amazing.</li>
            <li> The smell of peppermint is a nice touch and it lathers up very nicly in wet hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ketoconazole is a harsh ingredient when used on its own as it is a powerful anti-dandruff &amp;amp; anti-androgen.</li>
            <li> kind of useless, but smells nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nizoral for years and Lipogaine Big is way more gentle with the scalp.</li>
            <li> I definitely like this one better as I feel my hair is much smoother after using Lipogaine shampoo.</li>
            <li> No shampoo alone is going to re-grow hair but as far as I&#x27;m concerned this is the best one to use alongside Minoxodil or Lipogaine - especially any of the treatments containing azelaic acid (I&#x27;d tried traditional 5% minoxidil with only little success for about a year - moved on to a higher strength e-auction available treatment with azelaic acid, added Lipogaine Big 3 to help treat/heal the scalp and hair at the same time and have had EXCELLENT results since - my plan is to use that to re-grow and then the basic cheap minoxidil to maintain)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lathers really well,and does not take much to lather up which is great because that means it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Based on the positive reviews, I gave the shampoo a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m positive that this was what I was experiencing.</li>
            <li> I do have another positive comment though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of all the hair loss shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried, this product seems to have all the best ingredients that one looks for in the hair loss shampoo genre, it also lathers up extremely well while only having to use a small amount of the product, and best of all it actually leaves the hair looking good without weighing it down like some of the other hair loss shampoos on the market.</li>
            <li> funny to ready all the five star reviews</li>
            <li> The scent is nice and it lathers much easier than other hair loss shampoos I have used before.</li>
            <li> Will need more time in usage to see in the long run.</li>
            <li> i bought this because i have long hair and wanted to make sure i was taking care of it.  </li>
            <li> The first time you lather your hair and scalp it does not lather very well,</li>
            <li> It is strongly foamy (so a little goes a long way) and has good lubricant properties.</li>
            <li> and I honestly can say that it slows down the hair loss.</li>
            <li> Along with my minoxidil treatment, it helps keeping my hair thinning/loss at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other therapeutic shampoos it produces a very nice lather like a regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> But this is the first time I have ever taken the time to write a review, Lipogaine Big 3 has had a huge impact in my life.</li>
            <li> I am aware that results aren&#x27;t usually expected until after six months or more</li>
            <li> The fact that Lipogaine makes it all in one makes my hair regimen such easy process.</li>
            <li> I have tried two others, but this is the first hair loss shampoo that has all the important ingredients in one for the same price.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and this shampoo seemed to make my hair more manageable and fuller than</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s some nice growth of some strands previously absent.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m back at very healthy, regular</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend you do the same.</li>
            <li> Most shampoo&#x27;s contain a chemical product known as Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS) that like Ketoconazole, is not harmfull in limited exposures to the scalp and skin.</li>
            <li> i take a med called Axiron (basically pure testosterone) because of a side effect from another med.</li>
            <li> Thickens hair a bit, don&#x27;t know for certain if I have hair loss</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certain  </li>
            <li> Looks like they added Emu oil which certainly did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> as a newcomer to this product I hope for good results but so far I do have less hair loss</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had fine coarse curly hair and after bleaching it, it started thinning out.</li>
            <li> (i&#x27;ve got the fine white hairs in the thinning areas).  </li>
            <li> my hair has steadily been diffuse thinning for about ten years, mainly on the top and sides.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 45 year old male who&#x27;s been pretty lucky to have a full head of hair.</li>
            <li> so I cant share any hair growth or thickening results as of yet, just using it a couple times a week and its a pretty basic shampoo that leaves my hair clean.</li>
            <li> It costs a little more but is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t accurately judge the impact it has on hair loss/growth since I&#x27;ve also been using the Lipogaine daily treatment and finesteride.</li>
            <li> One day it really scared me because i was really losing so much hair</li>
            <li> Things are going better than I expected which can be proven by my batch of, &amp;#34;Five Months Later&amp;#34; photos.</li>
            <li> In short, it is filled with spelling and grammatical errors that make me question the quality of anything this this company manufactures.</li>
            <li> I believe these reviews are all FRAUD and this is just a cheap generic shampoo in this bottle</li>
            <li> hahaha</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much thicker after I use it.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> Nothing really worked  the way Lipogaine does.  </li>
            <li> I took photos every month to check if products really worked as it was claimed.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it makes my scalp tingle as well.  </li>
            <li> I used it for a month straight and by week 3 I started noticing regrowth in the front of my hairline.</li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo a couple of months ago and really like it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li> This shampoo goes really well with the Lipogaine drops.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So how much credit does this shampoo deserve?  </li>
            <li> so $1-2 a month isn&#x27;t much when you think about it</li>
            <li> (no, I am not a bot account promoting their products, they just really do work)).</li>
            <li> Too much going on and then just got used of not using.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very selective when it comes to the ingredients in health products.  </li>
            <li> My hair is much fuller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the gentle products I use for my hair...</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> , it is much improved upon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lipogaine Big 3 is firstly free of Sodium Lauryl Sulphate.</li>
            <li> but I felt like I needed to do SOMETHING as I was shedding so much</li>
            <li> I find that it lathers very well, and smells like peppermint.</li>
            <li> Since using this shampoo, people ask me how I got my hair to thicken up so much.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels fuller, I recommend this product to anyone with thinning hair that wants a fuller look.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Tried this shampoo out, it turned out to be better than I expected.....</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers very well and you can feel it working on your scalp.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo has a tea tree oil smell that is very soothing and after using it awhile</li>
            <li> Lathers and cleans really well with no build-up.</li>
            <li> It lathers up very well, so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot</li>
            <li> I really have nothing to fault with this product.</li>
            <li> This does really work.</li>
            <li> shampoo really lathers well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for a while and really like it.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> It cleans my hair well and leaves it looking  thicker, softer and very mangable.</li>
            <li> The Lipogaine lathered well and gently cleaned my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I became discouraged with the whole keto-shampoo buzz.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really liking the feeling it gives me when I step out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> It is very concentrated</li>
            <li> Gentle on your hair</li>
            <li> might give up on it really  </li>
            <li> I tried it 3-4 times a week for 3 weeks and still kept losing hair, which I couldn&#x27;t expect it to work that fast</li>
            <li> It also ruined my hair making it very straw-like to the point where I decided to discontinue use.</li>
            <li> Light weight and terrific ingredients.</li>
            <li> Worked very well for me for preventing additional hair loss.</li>
            <li> For me it is working really well.</li>
            <li> It lathers reasonably well -</li>
            <li> I really do feel as if there is some thickening going on.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this shampoo and will start using minoxidil to see if/how much added benefit that adds.</li>
            <li> My daughter struggles with Lyme disease and was dealing with very itchy scalp and hair loss.</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 weeks straight</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t lose my hair as much as I used to when using this shampoo</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as much when I wash it, though it is a bit drying.  </li>
            <li> My hair is much fuller and thicker than before.</li>
            <li> The hair that was in the tub after shower decreased greatly.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this I have found myself not shedding as much</li>
            <li> Really seems to help with hair loss, will continue to repurchase, along with the Intensive treatment.</li>
            <li> You should experiment with how much AA you add as it can cause a burning sensation on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I alternate Lipogaine with another sulfate free shampoo since I wash every day.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I really like the product.  </li>
            <li> In fact, my hair is left shiny and smooth when it dries.  </li>
            <li> Read all the ingredients carefully to make sure you don&#x27;t have an allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> The regenepure really opens up my scalp to the hair strengthening biotin shampoo.  </li>
            <li> That is saying something because I never something twice unless I really like it.  </li>
            <li> i really like how it leaves my hair fuller, and moe manageable after each use.</li>
            <li> Another thing I don&#x27;t really like is the fact that they peddle the whole &amp;#34;rinse and repeat&amp;#34; method.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> When my hair loss was getting noticeable, I decided to learn as much as I could about root causes and what could be done to counteract them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say that hasn&#x27;t already been said, but figured I&#x27;d throw in my two cents.</li>
            <li> I really do feel that it works and</li>
            <li> this shampoo had a very adverse effect on the condition of my hair; I cannot continue to use it; so I am going to complain to you about the non-return policy because I got two of them (</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I found the Lipogaine shampoo very helpful.  </li>
            <li> really* like the Lipogaine.</li>
            <li> I used Rogain for about a year but didn&#x27;t quite notice too much of an improvement.</li>
            <li> This hair product really works for me and never switching to another shampoo again.</li>
            <li> also, i don&#x27;t really use a conditioner with this,</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It is much gentler and no longer stings the scalp.</li>
            <li> consistency of the shampoo is very \\&quot;honey\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Big 3 makes my already naturally curly hair curl better, without any frizz.  </li>
            <li> Decided to try a few things on my own.</li>
            <li> They are ones that I feel safe using for my extra sensitive scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair is much thicker on top, absolutely no scalp showing.</li>
            <li> I had used generic Rogaine for years and it seemed to reduce hair loss but after switching to Lipogain the difference is far more noticeable.</li>
            <li> Have been using a few months and so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far I am pleased with this product, but only longer term use will determine whether I decide to continue with it or not, as it is pricey $$$.  </li>
            <li> Lipogaine doesn&#x27;t feel chemical-y, smells great, and leaves my hair feeling thick and soft.  </li>
            <li> 26 year old male with thinning on top with a receding hair line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain about the price because I was almost willing to put down 5 grand with Bosley.</li>
            <li> No strange tingling, you just feel clean.</li>
            <li> Lipogaine 3 lathers up very nicely without the harsh ingredients of a regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I tried other ketoconazole shampoos and this is much milder and leaves my hair feeling better.</li>
            <li> It does clean your scalp very throughly however and you will definitely know that everything save skin is washed off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that this product to be at it&#x27;s most effectiveness when its used with other products.</li>
            <li> I feel this shampoo plays a significant role in my overall hair loss prevention regimen.  </li>
            <li> I was losing my hair on the top of my head due to epidural steroid injections after a car accident.</li>
            <li> I have used other products that work better.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other shampoos for this.</li>
            <li> Surely you&#x27;ve had other complaints with it.</li>
            <li> but, the second time you lather it is a rich lather.  </li>
            <li> It does not weigh the hair down resulting in a clean full look.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really say if I&#x27;m getting 5-star results, since I&#x27;m not seriously balding.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have read a lot of research on the main ingredients of these 3 shampoos ( ketonconazole, Caffeine and AHA) and believe they all work together really well.</li>
            <li> The shampoo foams up well, smells nice, and a bottle lasts me over 2 months, which is a long time because I use it almost daily.</li>
            <li> I chose Lipogaine because it has a strong list of limited ingredients.  </li>
            <li> of bubbles with this big 3 specially on the second.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this over many of the other out there on the market.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a nice fragrance and using it as directed, the bottle should last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> one thing I will say is that it left my scalp feeling clean, although it tended to dry my hair out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> For the quality that you get along with the actual positive results in fighting hair loss, Lipogaine 3 is well worth buying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m growing new hair, the loss has certainly slowed or even stopped.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never felt or looked better and with the help of their women&#x27;s minoxidil solution and biotin, my hair is slowly but surely growing back in the thinning spots!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a full head of hair yet, but Lipogaine products are giving me results - and enough faith to keep trying.</li>
            <li> My hair is really shiny now, but definitely have to use deep conditioner on the ends more because they feel dryer than before I started using this.</li>
            <li> I remember being completely blown away the first time i used it.</li>
            <li> I would not be saying this if it weren&#x27;t true, and recently my fiance noticed my hair growth as well.</li>
            <li> Not a bad shampoo though,but conditioning after using this shampoo is definately necessary because its a bit stripping and drying to the hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s help keep my scalp and hair healthy even as the minoxidil and acid do their work to get down to the follicle.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say whether the shampoo is slowing down my hair loss for sure</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the value, its just kind of hard to tell the effects of this since I was already using the Lipogaine solution, but given the ingredients it has in it, the price, and that it helps with other things (i.e. dandruff) without a doubt, I have given it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I can see lots of tiny new hair have grown from originally bared skin, some even from forehead.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say that I am seeing new hair growing</li>
            <li> This has also allowed for the growth of new hair along my formerly receding hairline, particularly in the side areas that create the old &amp;#34;widow&#x27;s peak&amp;#34; that so many men get in the early stages of losing it all.</li>
            <li> I love the slight tingle too-</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would love to hear from Lipogaine or any experts on this subject.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is my top number 1 shampoo for me: big 3 lipogaine  and second place :</li>
            <li> Based on the ingredients I&#x27;ll most likely use this for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and hats off to Lipogaine Big 3.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of the shampoo, and it totally cleared up my flaking but even better my hair is coming in faster.</li>
            <li> and I encourage anyone to research this and point to two studies in particular.</li>
            <li> (minoxidil)- I definitely feel that it works better than the standard drugstore minoxidils like Rogaine</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better hair loss shampoo, my hair feels and even looks fuller, after one bottle I definitely noticed some baby hairs start to grow back on my receding hairline and the hair that&#x27;s not part of your receding hair will grow like bamboo, if you think it&#x27;s costly</li>
            <li> Will update after a few more months as I think you should really give it 6 months to work.</li>
            <li> I actually like this big 3 shampoo a lot more than Nizoral.</li>
            <li> It can keep my hair clean and strong for at least two days -</li>
            <li> I tried so many different shampoo and none worked until I found Lipogaine Big 3.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read about Nizoral and the main ingredient, ketoconazole, which was life-changing for me.</li>
            <li> Healthy hair requires a healthy scalp and Nizoral succeeded where others failed.</li>
            <li> Even if I&#x27;m not growing lost hair back, I still feel confident that this product, used in conjunction with Rogaine, slowed if not totally stopped my hair loss.</li>
            <li> Particularly the ketoconazole and emu oil.</li>
            <li> The cap is very sensitive and if you tighten it too much it will crack or snap off!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shampoo is just as good as any high end shampoo without the harsh ingredients, along with the only ingredient proven to stop hair loss included.  </li>
            <li> so i am really satisfied and have high hopes for this stuff in conjunction with minoxidil because the combination is working; much less shedding or no shedding at all.</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo more often than the generally suggested frequency and have had no problems with dry scalp or hair or itching.</li>
            <li> Biotin and ketonconazole: two of the most effective ingredients to slow down the progression of hair</li>
            <li> It seems like the ingredients has changed because this bottle seems less sticky and more like normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this along with Lipogaine.</li>
            <li> would also highly recommend any hair-loss sufferers to check out the Lipogaine Hair Restoration product</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> but the cost vs. ounces of the product seemed a bit high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended...</li>
            <li> Not only does Big 3 shampoo make your hair feel clean and have volume, but it also leaves your hair feeling soft and mildly conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I highly recommend both products if you have hair loss.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly dissapointed.</li>
            <li> It contains saw palmetto, biotin and many other natural ingredients that promote hair growth.</li>
            <li> It is far superior to anything I have used in the past and believe you me I have spent many years &amp; 1000&#x27;s of $ on trying different hair regrowth shampoos .</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo more than one month, it seems start to work a little.</li>
            <li> the shampoo is a little more runnier.  </li>
            <li> I was a little worried how the Lipogaine would lather since many of these hair loss shampoos tend to struggle in that regard...</li>
            <li> I have had this product a little more than a month.</li>
            <li> But, between the two, I haven&#x27;t lost more hair; and it does look like there is a little more.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , the price may seem a bit high for a shampoo, but it is well worth it as not only does it work, but it also lasts quite a bit of time.</li>
            <li> My scalp feels great after use and it is the only shampoo that I can use every other day that caters to a combination dry and oil</li>
            <li> particularly I was shedding the new hair I had regrown from using Lipogaine.</li>
            <li> makes my scalp feel clean and takes away dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Hair is also soft and very manageable, no conditioner needed.</li>
            <li> All in all great, though expensive.  </li>
            <li> : My scalp feel much better, shedding of dead skin during shower stopped.</li>
            <li> Remember when using it to keep it on your head for at least 5 minutes you&#x27;ll feel the nice tingling sensation on your head.</li>
            <li> It is worth the extra cost.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than  a few days a week.</li>
            <li> This hair loss shampoo has got a lot (pretty much all) of the essential ingredients needed to combat hair loss.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had success in regrowth and thickness in the last 2 years...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s way to harsh to use more than twice a week</li>
            <li> I do think it is worth the purchase especially if you are in a panic about hair loss.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to leave the shampoo in your hair for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s done extensive research on hair regrowth and retention and chose this product specifically based on the ingredients and success stories surrounding the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> witnessing his success with it, I would definitely recommend this product, (and the line of products from this company) to any man looking to enhance and keep his hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which ingredients are the \\&quot;Big 3\\&quot; but it has some good ones.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t use styling products, and this shampoo leaves my hair in a nice thick state that I can comb into something that looks acceptable.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice consistency... not too watery but not too thick.  </li>
            <li> But it is much, much better, and he is less self conscious about it.  </li>
            <li> this shampoo packs a punch of many proven ingredients that support hair growth, such as ketonconazole, biotin and&lt;br /&gt;emu oil which help moisture to ease dry scalp caused by ketoconazole.</li>
            <li> Use it as directed, and I strongly recommend pairing it with a daily treatment of minoxidil and finasteride (doctor prescribed for the latter).</li>
            <li> It really makes your hair look full and the scalp is cleaner than when using other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I am not a serious hair-loss sufferer, and use this in combo with other products- perhaps a more serious hair-loss sufferer using would see even greater results than I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it over traditional ketoconazole shampoos like Nizoral, which seems to have more irritating ingredients and not feel as nice on the scalp.  </li>
            <li> and it leaves my hair very clean and soft, but not dried out at  like a lot of the other hair loss shampoos do.</li>
            <li> After about 6 months I noticed my hair thickening up (I also have been using Lipogaine&#x27;s &amp;#34;Lipogaine for Men: Intensive Treatment &amp; Complete Solution for Hair Loss&amp;#34;) and the results are slowly but surely showing.</li>
            <li> This in combination with this product http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037TM252/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 has shown progressive results for preventing hair loss and encouraging new hair growth.  </li>
            <li> Now what you probably will not get is new hair growth</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen new growth</li>
            <li> I have been using this new formula for a couple months.</li>
            <li> I would attempt to regrow my hair or live with my baldness.</li>
            <li> and there is also some new growth.</li>
            <li> just like advertised it takes time for it to work, and after 6 months my hair has substantially got thicker, and new hairs are growing all over including</li>
            <li> and I have noticed (my hairdresser did too) new growth where I was thinning.</li>
            <li> LOTS OF NEW HAIR STILL GROWING</li>
            <li> The product seems to have stabilized hair loss with a bit of new growth.  </li>
            <li> Just follow the instruction, it will help you keep what you have &amp; regrow new hairs.</li>
            <li> but there are definitely new hairs coming in along the front.</li>
            <li> I have noticed new hair growth, and it&#x27;s thicker and appears fuller.</li>
            <li> I really noticed since using this a significant amount of less hair has been falling out</li>
            <li> so now I noticed less in my brush and shower and noticed it hasn’t been coming out so much or as easily.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo for over a year now and will continue to do so as I really like how much it thickens my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is available in a handful of shampoos such as Regenepure, Revita, Lipogaine - Big 3, Hair Surge, and Nizoral.</li>
            <li> but it was still kind of thin and didn&#x27;t grow as fast.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo has the ketoconazole in an excellent moisturizing base with lots of high quality ingredients and most importantly no sulfates since my hair is colored.</li>
            <li> At this point it seems very reasonable to expect it will be back to 90-100% of what it used to be, perhaps with another 6 months.</li>
            <li> Since then I have maintained the same which is good since I&#x27;m just trying to delay any further loss as long as possible.</li>
            <li> It does not flat my hair like many other shampoos.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed new growth in spots on top of my head and in small areas of my crown.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s helping to grow more hair or just preventing hair loss.</li>
            <li> In the past I used regenpure and lipogaine is byfar a better product....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t promise you it will stop your hair loss, but in my experience, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed fewer hairs in my shower and that&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> just wish it more ketoconazole as that is the only proven ingredient to remove DHT only at a 2% concentration (vs 1% as currently formulated).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy that for sure over this relatively small bottle.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use Nizoral for the first wash then use this product for the 2nd wash.</li>
            <li> shampoo smells great, its thick, and does lather well, especially on the second</li>
            <li> During my research, I learned to expect some initial shedding, which I did for the first month.  </li>
            <li> The first bottle the shampoo was thicker and this bottle (second one)</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft after using as well!</li>
            <li> It also completely got rid of my dandruff!</li>
            <li> The other products i&#x27;ve tried would work for a few days and then dry my scalp out, leading to more dandruff, and more itch.</li>
            <li> I can easily say that this shampoo was able to slow down my hair loss.</li>
            <li> what i also like is that it does not contains laurel sulfato and thats good , because that stuff is bad, specially if u want lo leave it on the hair for 5 minutes</li>
            <li> As as HUGE bonus I also seem to be loosing less hairs since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I have almost zero dandruff, when I rub my hands through my hair over a black surface I see maybe one or two flakes which is a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> I usually have a dryness problem but Big 3 makes my scalp look and feel amazing.</li>
            <li> It does not dry my scalp as much as Nizoral.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different shampoos trying to find something that worked, but have had no success until now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lathers up nicely with only a small amount of shampoo per application.  </li>
            <li> I have been using lipogaine with other shampoos (one caffeine based shampoo and one alpha hydroxy acid shampoo) and so far I have seen significant decrease in shedding.</li>
            <li> Will it slow down hair loss and keep your scalp happy?</li>
            <li> I decided giving lipogaine big 3 a try and found that I had pretty much the same experience.</li>
            <li> In short, I highly recommend this shampoo, especially in combination with the right additional hair-loss treatments.</li>
            <li> The more visible one&#x27;s were there before, but I also noticed some very tiny vellus hairs in spots around my hairline that previously had no hair(most</li>
            <li> thing I noticed on this second purchase is that the formula was changed slightly, for the better.  </li>
            <li> Noticed less hair on hands which only means more stayed on head.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks almost as good as it did a few years ago in less than 8 months time.</li>
            <li> I was a huge promoter of this product when i first bought in 2011 it did everything it was suppose as of late i wondering why i was sheeding so much hair come to find out today that it longer has azelaic acid a key DHT blocker .</li>
            <li> Well, it happened in a big way: I went from being a big-curly haired, happy fellow to nearly bald in a little less than a year.</li>
            <li> so I also use the Women&#x27;s Sensitive Product, and I have had quick results with those, but the Big 3 shampoo took to the next level.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited about the growth to say the least</li>
            <li> It really does my hair well, its not flat!</li>
            <li> my situation may be a little different than many others.</li>
            <li> A little more research led me to Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo, which also has ketoconazole, along with saw palmetto, biotin, emu oil and niacin with no SLS!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, a little expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really not because you only need a small amount and 3 times per week, so one bottle last a long time and the results are priceless, the shampoo also works well with the lipongaine drops, with the combination you&#x27;ll get results even quicker!!</li>
            <li> I wish I could use all natural products</li>
            <li> tried laser combs, saw palmetto, its extract, nioxin etc, now i use minoxidil, but it wasn&#x27;t really working (until recently</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for five months now and am surprised at how well this product has worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using the Lipogaine Intensive Treatment Complete Solution on my balding crown.</li>
            <li> /&gt;so guys i do have to say that so far...</li>
            <li> Too early to tell yet if it helps with hair loss but hair does look fuller.  </li>
            <li> This has worked so far.</li>
            <li> My son uses this product and swears by it, he also accompanies it with the  product Lipogaine for Men Intensive Treatment and complete Solution for Hair Loss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month going on 2 months so its too early to tell no visible sign yet of changes with hair growth.</li>
            <li> Sure - but this is at LEAST a 6 month supply (probably a year)</li>
            <li> but I knew I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is just about the only Clinically Proven ingredient to actually help with Hair Loss as its been demonstrated to inhibit the Hormone DHT (Dihydrotestosterone) which is the primary culprit causing Male Pattern Hair Loss.</li>
            <li> and she could see a ton of baby hairs for the first time in a long time.</li>
            <li> ; so far).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it completely horrified me.</li>
            <li> and before I buy anything, online or in person, I do as much research as I possibly can.</li>
            <li> but my hair legitimately did stop shedding, like completely, after 6 or so months of using it 2 times a week.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and use it daily.</li>
            <li> So far, this seems to be as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Lots of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Too early to say if it impacts hair-loss or promotes re-growth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s Rogaine or if my hair just naturally stopped thinning, but between Rogaine and this I haven&#x27;t lost any hair.</li>
            <li> It is too early to see any hair growth</li>
            <li> This product definitely cleans my hair and scalp very well.</li>
            <li> So far its been almost 2 months since I stopped using this shampoo and</li>
            <li> I was in the early stages of losing hair and freaking out about it.</li>
            <li> I generally wash my hair with a bit of normal shampoo, rinse it out, and then work Lipogaine in immediately after.</li>
            <li> I use in in conjunction with Lipogaine and have not seen any real improvement over the last 8 months.</li>
            <li> Did Lipogaine completely fill in the hair...</li>
            <li> Tried natural stuff...</li>
            <li> , natural stuff didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> I went as far as to put fungus cream on my head...</li>
            <li> I really hope Lipogaine revises their Big 3 shampoo and start making it without salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li> Cleans your hair but doesn&#x27;t strip the natural oil of your hair.</li>
            <li> My “old” dandruff shampoo used sulfates, which I wanted to get away from.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell and how soft and manageable</li>
            <li> I used one bottle so far</li>
            <li> but the hair loss stopped and I am far from bald.</li>
            <li> The old formula had phenoxyethanol in it, which is a hideous ingredient used as a preservative.  </li>
            <li> My hair had NEVER felt that soft.</li>
            <li> if just using the shampoo alone will do as much, as he used the Lipogaine serum along with it, but I&#x27;d definitely try</li>
            <li> My hair loss is completely stopped after one week use of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> As to longer-term effects, I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month or so, but my hair seems like it&#x27;s much improved even on the days I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> The shampoo I will use for as long as it provides thickness and growth; however, the pills and the Minoxidil cause a lot of blood pressure issues, so be aware of that.</li>
            <li> it also has a lot of natural ingredients which leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> No hair restoration product is an instant solution, and I have not been using it as much as the recommended frequency.</li>
            <li> lasts for nearly 1.5 months for me</li>
            <li> Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo really works.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try and one bottle, even though only 8 ounces, should last a couple of months.</li>
            <li> but I am confident that repeated use of the Lipogaine products will help to slow, if not stop, additional hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this product, but there were a lot of good reviews</li>
            <li> I noticed that my hair has started to slowly look better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I have actually grown new hair or the shampoo has just made it look thicker, but I do know it looks better.  </li>
            <li> Although this solution alone will probably not stimulate hair regrowth, it certainly does not aggravate the scalp or cause irritation like other intense shampoos.</li>
            <li> the key to stopping and reversing male hairloss is to catch it early, and attack it with the right products NOW- the longer you wait, the more hair you will lose that you can never get back; in regards to being the RIGHT product, Lipogaine Big 3 is THE keto shampoo of choice for me; it may be $25, but a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is light and has a low odor, I use the shampoo along with other product for re-growing hair.</li>
            <li> shampoo itself smells minty and fresh, due to Peppermint as one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> My hair was thinning and falling, and I read a lot of reviews with other products and this one had a lot of success reviews.</li>
            <li> We highly recommend this product especially for people who have hair thinning combined with seborrheic dermatitis and acne near the hairline.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick enough to not drip down your face when you leave it in which is also a great plus.</li>
            <li> This particular bottle sells for $25 while a larger volume Nizoral sells for $15 at Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the cost and the bottle lasts quite a long time, even with daily application (and 2-3 times a week is the suggested frequesny of usage).</li>
            <li> I just ordered my second bottle because my hair is growing back now and pretty rapidly...</li>
            <li> So it will last a long time and worth money.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this product has been a big part of making that happen, and generally improving the whole situation.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is doing anything or not, I am losing hair or thinning on the top and back of my head.  </li>
            <li> Given how much I have used in the first two weeks of daily use, I think this bottle will last me at least 3 to 4 months which is not a bad deal.  </li>
            <li> Im definitely starting early, I decided to start using this after noticing a little more scalp in the back in photos.</li>
            <li> The trick is to make sure you use a lot of conditioner after as it does tend to dry hair out just a little.</li>
            <li> One major difference I’ve noticed is the complete lack of hair in the shower drain.</li>
            <li> Ketoconazole is the active ingredient in this shampoo which helps with hair loss, although it is loaded with other supportive ingredients.</li>
            <li> Basically it has the good stuff and excludes the bad stuff therefore and still foams up well without having to use a huge amount each time, also only needing 2 to 3 uses a week to gain the necessary benefit.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have definitely seen the hair loss come to a complete halt and all kinds of new growth.</li>
            <li> too much shedding for too long.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works really well to restore hair and its lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo has extra ingredients that normal volume shampoos don&#x27;t have.  </li>
            <li> Regenepure was fine but had a little less lubricant property and a little more peppermint oil, which made it not as pleasing.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t completely back to normal, but it&#x27;s quite a bit improved.</li>
            <li> And you only need a small spoon full to do the whole head.</li>
            <li> Smelled the same, but it took more of it to get the same amount of lather as the green.</li>
            <li> I recommend doing a semi-wash everyday instead of a full wash every 2 or 3 days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether it was a coincidence or the shampoo was really working, but it is the only shampoo that reduced my hair loss, which I noticed right after the first/ second use, judging by how much hair was left on my brush -- much less than before.</li>
            <li> When I tried the Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo around 6 months ago, I can clearly see the hair loss slow down a lot within a few weeks which made me very happy.</li>
            <li> ,my hair is super thin and was always falling out with the littlest tug,anything from putting my hair up,washing it,brushing etc would rip it right out</li>
            <li> looking forward to see new hair grow back in!</li>
            <li> It has lead to a healthier scalp and, used in conjunction with the Lipogaine topical solution, has resulted in thicker hair and new hair growth.</li>
            <li> It seems to make my hair thicker and possibly even started some new hair growth.</li>
            <li> Together, these two products have stopped my hair from receding further and helped stimulate some new growth.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was working at first, but the key is to leave it in your hair for as long (or longer) than they instruct you to on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for the first time in late 2012 I believe and have used in consistently ever since</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, mix a lil bit with some cheap baby shampoo to stretch out The big 3..  </li>
            <li> The only negative effect of this shampoo is that with overuse (more than 3 times a week) it may cause scalp irritation.</li>
            <li> Because it needs to be used consistent for long periods of time, only wish it can be purchased cheaper and in bulk.</li>
            <li> After using Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo, I am pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> No weird chemical or fertilizer-y smells like other products he tried before this one.  </li>
            <li> I would say if you are concerned about regrowing hair use it with Lipogain or try one out first and then compliment it with the other.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for thin hair and definitely slows down shedding.  </li>
            <li> I hope they resolve this because they make other great products and ketoconazole shampoos are difficult to find.</li>
            <li> was originally prescribed Nizoral 2% Ketoconazole shampoo from my dermatologist, but found that it left my hair feeling heavy, as if there was build-up in it, or as if it didn&#x27;t all wash out completely.&lt;br /&gt;Lipogaine</li>
            <li> All of the ingredients that I mentioned especially Ketaconazole (This is a big one, look it up) are the main fundamental ingredients needed to fight hair loss.</li>
            <li> Overall, I noticed an increase in shedding, particularly in areas where I wasn&#x27;t shedding before (like the back of my head).</li>
            <li> Not only does Lipogaine Big 3 contain a high concentration of Ketoconazole (2%)</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that the first bottle that I bought had the shampoo colored light opaque pink -- due to ketoconazole ingredient ( an anti fungal that is used for severe dandruff, and in several studies it was shown to reduce hair loss ); however, the color of the shampoo in my second bottle is grayish opaque white.</li>
            <li> When combined with Ketoconazole for sustained periods on the scalp as is needed to receive the anti-androgenic (anti-DHT) effects, these ingredients can cause itching, redness and general discomfort on the scalp.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t cheap, but at least I don&#x27;t have to wash as often with this type of shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female with long hair, so to not use so much shampoo saves money.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to apply much, and the bottle can last quite a long time</li>
            <li> but what happened immediately was that with Lipogaine Big 3 was that my hair stop shedding almost completely</li>
            <li> On the in between days I just wash my hair with water only to maintain natural oils on my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may experience some shedding in the beginning, however this is natural for any hair loss product, especially ketoconazole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin (particularly my head) feels oily now where before I had dry hair/scalp.  </li>
            <li> It also left my hair feeling soft and well conditioned.  </li>
            <li> A shampoo alone can only get people so far.  </li>
            <li> I am a 38 year old male.  </li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for only 4 weeks so far (started on October 10, 2014).  </li>
            <li> Well along with the lipogaine treatment I have been using the big 3 shampoo for over 2 years now and my hair has completely stopped falling out, thicker than it has ever been.</li>
            <li> I am only giving it a three star because I am in the early stages of usage.</li>
            <li> So far, I can only say my hair is not falling out anymore.</li>
            <li> I think I was sensitive to the SLS and other harsh chemistry in major brand shampoos, which this product is largely free of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the upside, the price for this product has gone down about $5 since it first came</li>
            <li> I have been using PURA DOR for the past year with good results (meaning my hair loss has not goteen worse), but decided to try out lipogaines shampoo as It is new on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shampoo feels and smells like regular shampoo, but definitely produces new hair growth.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo for a few months and while I have not seen any hair regrowth, the rate of hair fallout has been reduced tremendously.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my short just above the shoulder length hair and it normally takes a little more than a month to use up the bottle.</li>
            <li> I was not looking to sprout tons of new hair or anything like that, but just to try and keep what I have as long as I can.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to talk about the effectiveness of this shampoo for hair loss prevention because it should be exactly the same as any other 1% ketoconazole shampoo.</li>
            <li> I do notice that my hair has stopped falling out (no loose hairs in the drain or on the bathroom floor).</li>
            <li> My hair started growing from the back first...and In just 3 months, I can now look in the mirror and see a huge difference, I only have a small area in the front, about the size of a quarter.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and would recommend it compared to other</li>
            <li> The other ketoconazole shampoos that are meant to be for dandruff irritate my scalp too much, but this doesn&#x27;t bother it at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really thickens your hair as some other reviews have stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a 29 year old white female with androgenetic alopecia.</li>
            <li> I have since discontinued use of such topical treatments and am going with natural supplements and washing my hair with combo of shampoo and apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, it contains Emu Oil which is a powerful anti-inflammatory agent that helps to mitigate harsh effects of the skins exposure to Ketoconazole.</li>
            <li> The price is kind of expensive, but is comparable in price to similar products.  </li>
            <li> Many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and pseudo organic products use this as a preservative which sets me off because it is an unhealthy chemical that has potential side effects.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried Regenpure, Pura d&#x27;or, and Hair Surge (p.s. not to be confused with the famous SURGE Movement on Facebook who just brought back SURGE soda).</li>
            <li> Some quality control issues in the past, had one batch where it was visibly thinner than previous orders, seems to have corrected this issue with latest batch.</li>
            <li> The first one, green in color, lasted me six months using three times a week.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair thick and full (noticeably so).</li>
            <li> I have relatively thick, fine hair that I wear long.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, I am headed in the right direction as far as at least preserving what hair I have left.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various things over the past 20 years, from a brief Propecia experiment that I abandoned due to the prospect of &amp;#34;certain sexual side-effects&amp;#34; to propylene-glycol based Rogaine, which caused lesions and actually accelerated he hair loss.  </li>
            <li> I have seen minimal new hairs</li>
            <li> I notice less hair shed in between shampoos thanks to the dht blockers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was coincidence or not, but either way, I&#x27;m sure there were a few factors, including the use of this shampoo that gave me the results I have.  </li>
            <li> The main active ingredient is the ketoconazole which acts as a DHT blocker.</li>
            <li> It does not magically grow your hair back, but it is useful when combined with minoxidil.</li>
            <li> Well, I have a couple bald spots on the sides of my head from hair extensions and my hair grows super slow</li>
            <li> i have only been using it for a couple of months, but i am certain it is getting thicker and there seems to be a lot less hair fall after a shower.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It won&#x27;t regrow hair for most people probably, but in terms of helping slow down hair loss, I believe it helps.</li>
            <li> When I first read the ingredients of this product I was looking for these key ingredients: Ketaconazole, Biotin, Saw Palmetto, Nettles, Castor oil, Emu oil, and Niacin and without any drying and harsh ingredients such as propylene glycol.  </li>
            <li> The only problem was that Nizoral was harsh, contained SLS and other harsh chemicals and left hair kind of frazzled.</li>
            <li> first, a very small amount goes a very long way; like i said, i still have a lot of hair and only a little bit creates a fantastic lather for me.</li>
            <li> Lipogaine Big 3 does not dry out my scalp, and I think I&#x27;m somewhat prone to dandruff as I remember having it as a kid, I definitely do not have it now, and that is also a use for ketoconazole.</li>
            <li> (I have very thin hair, naturally, and even more so after experience shedding over the last several months!)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several different hair products, shampoos and conditioners for my hair loss, and nothing has improved the look and feel of my hair like Lipogaine Big 3.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li> I found this shampoo left my hair feeling much softer and less processed than Nizoral with the same benefits (reduced itching, flaking, and shedding).  </li>
            <li> My hair has got in a little thicker but not by much.</li>
            <li> also, the lather slowly gets absorbed into your hair/scalp.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes about this shampoo after reading the reviews; it seemed like it would be less drying than the Nizoral.</li>
            <li> I went about a year trying out the different ketoconazole shampoos and found that Big 3 was better than Nizoral which irritated my scalp and Regenpure which left the hair very thin after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so, this smallish bottle will last a long time for me; much longer for those with less hair (they recommend 2-3 times/week).</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any growth of new hair, but it has definitely slowed down the thinning.</li>
            <li> I am 22 years old, and when I turned 19, my long-time childhood sweetheart and I broke up; in the aftermath, I underwent extreme stress and emotional upheaval.</li>
            <li> I have always had fairly thin, fine hair, but due to a rare condition of my airway I have had numerous surgeries over the past 12 years.  </li>
            <li> My hair loss is a little severe which I think it&#x27;s from the gene and lack of some particular elements.</li>
            <li> The biggest thing I learned was the benefits from ketoconazole which has been the main ingredient in the shampoos that I have been using for the last few years.</li>
            <li> will say that I used Regenepure and that left my hair flat.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t see his hair as thick and full as it was a few years ago, I have noticed that he has stopped shedding considerably.  </li>
            <li> and it is less shiny, which tells me new growth is popping up.  </li>
            <li> I really thought that nothing would help with this problem,since I have tried a ton of different shampoo’s in the past and nothing worked until I tried this brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this company and will continue to use this as long as I keep maintaining my current follicle count.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time minoxidil user and just recently discovered that my hair loss is starting up again.</li>
            <li> A hair loss shampoo is not complete without one ingredient in Lipogaine Big 3, and that is Ketoconazole, (which is traditionally used as an antifungal shampoo for people with dandruff).</li>
            <li> Seen decent results after a few months and will continue to use the shampoo and solution and hopefully keep improving.</li>
            <li> Sulfate free, and &amp;#34;seems&amp;#34; to slow down shedding when used with minoxidil after 3 months.</li>
            <li> Its is better than all other products that I have waste my time and money in past.</li>
            <li> I was very desperate at that time and tried out many expensive oral supplements which should be good for the hair, however the hair loss continued.</li>
            <li> shampoo is very thick and it takes some work to move it around and get it all over your head; not a bad thing just a description.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a tiny amount every time, so each bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> downside is that if you&#x27;re African American your hair will be dry after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 24 year old male with a slightly receding hairline.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 and have been having the typical receding hairline, male pattern baldness thing going since I was in early college.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this really works as intended.</li>
            <li> I dont see any regrowth, if anything i see some shed, but again, not able to fully, absolutely judge results at this moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shampoo has really worked to thicken my hair and to stop excessive shedding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much of that result is from each product, but I do like this shampoo a lot either way, my hair is also color-treated</li>
            <li> As a now 60 year old man, I have been combatting age related hair loss, proactively, for the past ten years through the use of the following 3 products: Propecia 1mg; Rogaine 5mg (foam); and Lipogaine Big 3 Premium Hair Loss Shampoo.</li>
            <li> At the difference of Regenepure, this shampoo does not let you hairs flat.</li>
            <li> Whether that translates to long term benefits in the setting of male pattern baldness is to be determined but as a shampoo, I like the product a lot.</li>
            <li> long story short, it&#x27;s affordable and it work if you stick with it.</li>
            <li> It seems like a quality product, and I have ordered it numerous times and will continue to order it for six months, which is how long doctors recommend you use a hair product before judging the results.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m thinking it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and sticky, so I would advise rubbing it in between your hands first before lathering your scalp.</li>
            <li> You may need to use a little more conditioner than usual when you use this, I have slightly oily hair</li>
            <li> At first my hair stopped falling out and after a few weeks of using Lipogaine it actually started to grow back a little.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re serious about getting your hair back, get your scalp in shape first.</li>
            <li> During one Nizoral outage, I purchased Lipogaine due to its inclusion of ketokonazole and other high quality ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I had a slight dandruff issue and early stages of “thinning” hair.  </li>
            <li> One bottle lasts a long long time even when I use it daily</li>
            <li> (runs through all the women on one side of my family, its like a genetic switch went off) and my hair is nearly back to the thick, curly mop I&#x27;ve had my whole life.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll describe my experience - the positive and the negative.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Can be pricey, but is comparable in price to the competitors (can be a positive or negative).</li>
            <li> It has several other ingredients such as 1% ketoconazole, Saw Palmetto, etc.</li>
            <li> One bottle last me almost 2 months since I  use it only every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive shampoos.</li>
            <li> With Lipogaine, I only have to shampoo every other night to get total relief from itching.</li>
            <li> My hair feels less flyaway, smoother, and there is less of it in my brush, so it isn&#x27;t falling out as much.  </li>
            <li> In the last several months, I think I have grew back a little bit of hair, not a lot</li>
            <li> So i really recommend that others at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is on the pricey side, but I find the solution to be very efficient and it lasts at least two months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few on amazon, but I didn&#x27;t want a shampoo with 1000 ingredients, nor did I want a shampoo with &amp;#34;fragrence&amp;#34;, dyes, or a boatload of random chemical names (RegenePure suprisingly had a lot of extra additives and chemicals that did not look appealing).  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Nizoral is not always readily available.  </li>
            <li> have kind of oily scalp and at times I get painful pimple like growths on my head.</li>
            <li> so be careful to contact only the hair when u rinse the shampoo off your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used for a long time now - almost 3 years (along with the Lipogaine liquid).  </li>
            <li> Just long term dedication.&lt;br</li>
            <li> far, It has been a few days</li>
            <li> I have been thinning/losing for 15 years, have been on fin for equally as long (and still am), and was losing the battle so shaved my head.  </li>
            <li> I used this product everyday along with the lipogaine intensive treatment complete solution for thinning hair (3 in 1).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months and so far it seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> One bottle lasts long time.</li>
            <li> Will continue ordering this for a long time.</li>
            <li> As for if there is any hair regrowth, I have only seen minimal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: be careful using it because you might give yourself heart disease during prolonged use, but in the short-term, the combination of those three aforementioned products will grow you a lot of hair, and continuous use of the shampoo will help you keep said hair.</li>
            <li> (I have medium long hair with norwood 2 hairline).</li>
            <li> only give it a minus 1 star because of the over drying effect it had on me.</li>
            <li> I had been dealing with it for too long.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo, I&#x27;ve noticed that it has slowed down hair loss but has not seemed to grow any hair back.</li>
            <li> and/or prior to receiving low level laser therapy treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed less shedding, since implementing this product into my existing hair loss regiment.  </li>
            <li> Thirdly, it contains other ingredients that although have not been studied as extensively as Ketoconazole in there anti-androgenic effect, are widely used in just about every hair loss/hair growth shampoo (Saw Palmetto etc.).</li>
            <li> I even found some small new hair sprouts on my head.</li>
            <li> I have used it for about 5 years now (once in the morning every two days), and while I&#x27;m not super obsessive about recording its effectiveness and my hair loss in general, I noticed fewer hairs in the drain.  </li>
            <li> Still not sure if it is really helping other than to reduce the hair loss.</li>
            <li> Id recommend it to anyone with minor hair loss!</li>
            <li> This time the color is white and it does smell a little different.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell whether it has slowed or stopped hairloss as I am using other treatments, but it has a solid list of ingredients.</li>
            <li> The other times i just wash my hair with regular shampoo</li>
            <li> I just use a generic volumizes shampoo for the other</li>
            <li> We use it 1-2Xs per week and use a regular shampoo other days.</li>
            <li> It lasts long and it even helped me grow hair in on the patchy parts of my beard!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend giving this product a go if you&#x27;re concerned with hair loss and can afford to drop $25 every other month or so.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading reviews and watching video testimonials online from other users that reviewed several ketoconazale shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I do have to use a little extra at times since I have longer hair (think Keith Urban cut).  </li>
            <li> The formula contains proven ingredients like ketoconazole and biotin, so why settle for other products that make big claims without science?</li>
            <li> I am using it in conjunction with other hair loss prevention products, but it seems to be a necessary staple in my regiment.</li>
            <li> Since last two months of using this shampoo along with other stuff, I see that my hair loss has stopped or it has reduced.</li>
            <li> It may not suds up as much as other shampoos but is that really necessary?  </li>
            <li> the other shampoo I ever tried can only work for 1 day even for winter time.</li>
            <li> Overall, I recommend this hair loss shampoo over all other brands.</li>
            <li> Since this type of a shampoo is a topical DHT inhibitor you will want to put on the shampoo as soon as you start showering and don&#x27;t rinse it off until the end of your shower, unlike some other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with the regular Kirkland minoxidil due to its added ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this in conjunction with Procerin and Minoxidil and saw little improvement, although the listed ingredients of Lipogaine all have sound science behind them.  </li>
            <li> its excelent , i always had oily hair and this shampoo keeps my hair dry for one day ( for me)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like how dry my hair felt and my hair had no body to it.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp the way Nizoral does.</li>
            <li> It clears out dry and itchy scalp without drying out hair.</li>
            <li> I was having a flakey itchy scalp and I tried all sorts of dry scalp shampoo&#x27;s and none of them worked.</li>
            <li> I prefer Lipogaine&#x27;s minoxidil as it seems to have no odor and dry faster than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend this shampoo for a dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave you hair dry and seems to be working in preventing/slowing my hair loss.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so dry now my go to Redken product for moisture</li>
            <li> dry skin outlining the face and hair even to the point my eyebrows itched and</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out anymore.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair dry or anything.</li>
            <li> It also does not leave my scalp feeling dry or irritated.  </li>
            <li> but this is the combination I will be using including these product: Neogenic Hair Loss Treatment, Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo, Alma Hair oil, and Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been only few days</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive, but trust me its worth it if you are experiencing moderate hair loss.</li>
            <li> Definitely slowed hair loss and thinning after only a few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> The active ingredient,  Ketconizol (Sp?) does actually cause hair growth.</li>
            <li> The shampoo though is thick and you don&#x27;t need very much to lather up so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair flat and lifeless like a lot of other hair loss shampoos.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount, so this bottle should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I have a full set of hair, but after using this shampoo I went from loosing some 50 hairs in the shower to 15 or so.</li>
            <li> Since beginning the shampoo treatment my hair has not only became thicker, but I have noticed a healthier, less dry scalp.   </li>
            <li> but it definitely slowed it down.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way so the bottles last a while.</li>
            <li> I alternate this with Nioxin Normal to Thinning Hair shampoo, letting it set for approximately 2 minutes before rinsing.</li>
            <li> Since using the Big 3 Shampoo I can tell that I lose less hair in the shower and also I feel as though it makes my hair look fuller after using it.</li>
            <li> I would consider this a secondary treatment to Minoxidil however, which is what you want to use for male hairloss at the bare minimum.  </li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of the Lipogaine andI can definitely say I have seen some small hairs sprouting where they had stopped coming through before.</li>
            <li> No particular issues with this shampoo</li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;m only less than 3 months into all of this.  </li>
            <li> I still have over half a bottle of Big 3</li>
            <li> After only a month&#x27;s use, my hair fallout has been cut in half.</li>
            <li> Before, when I would grab a lock of hair and give a slight pull, several strands would always come out.  </li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;ve only used it for about a month and a half the amount of hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I cannot find conclusive researches online on the impact of the use of SA on hair, I find it strange that SA is the only missing ingredient from the list, when compared to the label on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ended up going to a dermatologist and he prescribed me some Ketoconazole 2% shampoo and it did the trick, problem is that its super expensive.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair a little dry, so occasionally I use some conditioner with it.</li>
            <li> After using for a few weeks hairloss has not halted completely but it has slowed down.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for anyone who wants to not grow but slow down whatever hair loss you have.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a little pricey, but I have found a bottle will last me six months.  </li>
            <li> Not many, but it&#x27;s a start, and no other minoxidil formulation has done that for me.</li>
            <li> It has a peppermint scent that does not become obnoxious once your hair is dry like other ketoconazole shampoos have done (Nizoral).  </li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry your hair and scalp like some of the other shampoos that contain ketoconazole.  </li>
            <li> The negative portion is that it dries out your scalp a little too much and it might cause \\&quot;that look\\&quot; if you don&#x27;t apply conditioner.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I wish it came in bigger bottles.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually trust these anti-hair loss shampoo theories, but I have been using this shampoo for the past 6 months, and I am very satisfied.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shampoo contains ketoconazole, which is one of the few compounds that even the FDA actually acknowledge as having hair growth stimulating properties by way of its thorough scalp and follicle cleaning ability.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser just a few weeks ago told me my hair is finally looking like it is growing in</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s harder for me to tell if it&#x27;s working based on any evidence while I&#x27;m shampooing.</li>
            <li> However I found the NT to be a total waste of money</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> but then I am not really looking for it.</li>
            <li> Have a receding line and thin hair, nothing I used worked, I did lipogaine for 4 months straight</li>
            <li> Really wet your hair throughly before applying.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this shampoo for a few months, but I do feel it&#x27;s helped me keep my remaining hair.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday as my regular shampoo, noticed the difference in a week.</li>
            <li> I had been using it for awhile and the only downside was that it really dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> It was a rough cycle.</li>
            <li> I took a chance and ordered a third, green again and lasted for six months.</li>
            <li> Has definitely helped slow my hair loss when combined with the Lipogaine topical solution.  </li>
            <li> I have been slowly thinning in the front since my early 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage son whose hair had already become noticeably thin near the temples.  </li>
            <li> It leaves hair thick with volume and soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> The big 3 is very gentle and does not dry out my hair as bad..  </li>
            <li> simply put, there are less hairs in my shower drain, on my pillow, and in my comb!</li>
            <li> As for the effectiveness against hair loss/hair regrowth, I am not certain how well it works because I also use propecia and Lipogaine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other DHT inhibitor (Ketoconazole) shampoos but, prefer Big 3.  </li>
            <li> Big 3 Shampoo has all the ingredients to reduce inflammation, refresh and energize your scalp, and without the harsh chemicals of Nizoral or other ketoconazole shampoos.</li>
            <li> After less than 3 months of using both products, I feel I am on the road to at least salvaging the hair I have, but I am hopeful for new growth.  </li>
            <li> use the products at this point, overall, to maintain, and can only hope for continued regrowth; while I do not suffer from serious balding at all by any means,</li>
            <li> (dries faster before work), and between the 3, not only have I restored my receding temple about 75%, but I also even have a few baby hairs growing back where my juvenile hairline used to</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive but definitely worth it, I have noticed that I have less hair fall and absolutely no dandruff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Havent used it long enough to see if it&#x27;ll slow or stop the hair loss, lets go ahead and wait to see if it does.</li>
            <li> This little bottle goes a long way</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m also using a minoxidil formula that includes azelaic acid (since Lipogaine had to drop azelaic acid from its topical formula), and the initial shed that I had a month ago when I started using it (which was indeed terrifying) has completely stopped at this point.</li>
            <li> becUse it worked for other just not for me.</li>
            <li> Moreover, unlike other hair treatment products, I haven&#x27;t noticed any side effects.</li>
            <li> I have a hypothyroidism and have been battling extreme hair loss for years.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what the chemical is that does this; but as someone with thinning hair and knows Ketoconazole does work - for me - it also helps to use a shampoo that also volumizes your hair with the same product.</li>
            <li> Lots of other beneficial ingredients</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be continuing to use both the shampoo and serum as I&#x27;m not ready to be bald yet!</li>
            <li> This shampoo cleaning your hair extremely well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use the shampoo, alternated with other shampoos, about 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> other shampoo&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 6 months, along with a variety of other products, including Lipogaine Intensive treatment.</li>
            <li> I use this product every other day in conjunction with Minoxidil.</li>
            <li> and my hair is virtually unchanged since stopping my Propecia intake due to side effects.</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo every other day and the Minoxidil once a day (applied liberally), leaving the shampoo on my scalp for five minutes.</li>
            <li> This was in a couple days of each other.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products that did work some</li>
            <li> It works even without other treatments needed but I recommend other prescriptions and creams to assist with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s growing hair back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to find another shampoo to rotate it with every other day as well.</li>
            <li> can tell you one thing: I am using every other day</li>
            <li> so I know my results are due to the ketoconazole.</li>
            <li> Other days I just use conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lifelong Lipogaine customer!</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t use that either due to salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li> boyfriend use it every other day and it works for him.</li>
            <li> Also, as other have mentioned it contains ketoconazole to fight thinning and emu oil for soothing.</li>
            <li> In addition, the folks at the company are extremely responsive if you have any questions.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure yet about visible hair regrowth, but the loss has DEFINITELY slowed.</li>
            <li> Although I have not seen a big change in the appearance of my hair (yet), I do notice that less hair is falling out in the shower and less hair will come out when slightly tugged.  </li>
            <li> i intend to keep using it every other day from now on.  </li>
            <li> Probably due to the aloe.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for 3 months every other day combined with the minoxidil solution (started to use the solution</li>
            <li> I believe that is largely due to the Aloe ingredient in the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> As other people have said, it foams up well and seems to thicken your hair.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know about putting the name of other companies within product reviews.</li>
            <li> There is no more redness or irritation to the scalp as I started using it daily, and it seems as if the hair stopped thinning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use it every other day for now with my Rogaine foam (I also take 380mg of Saw Palmetto).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the shampoo looks a little expensive, I think it is worth buying.</li>
            <li> If I ever get tired (which I doubt) of using the Lipogaine solution on the back of my head, I&#x27;m still going to use the Big 3 Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I absolutely refuse to use Rogaine because of the nasty skin side effects they don&#x27;t print on the box and because it just seems like a huge pain in the rear to use</li>
            <li> I thought if this was just a weird coincidence and that maybe I was just going through a natural shedding phase when I was on the Big 3.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not even half empty</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and since I&#x27;ve been using it, I see a lot less hairs in the sink.  </li>
            <li> Head felt really clean, but within 10 minutes my whole body was itching terribly and still going on after 10 days of no continued use.  </li>
            <li> After 6 months of continuous use with the pills (the pills are the worst thing, btw), my blood pressure was regularly in pre-hypertension ranges; now, using only the shampoo, my hair still looks fine</li>
            <li> but I have no success until I found this stuff.</li>
            <li> Small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use it almost daily, letting it set for at least a minute before washing it out.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to tell how much it helps in the process</li>
            <li> I used to buy all of the ingredients separately and apply them all to my scalp (Not fun at all).</li>
            <li> I was specifically looking for a shampoo that included at least 1% ketoconazole but not one necessarily for dandruff.</li>
            <li> I use it at least 3 times a week and when I travel, which is a lot, I use it every day because I don&#x27;t want to pack 2 different shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I use it almost daily, at least 4 times a week.</li>
            <li> My hair will never come back but at least it is improving.  </li>
            <li> This stuff has helped thicken it at least 30% and it has only be a month!</li>
            <li> They said shedding is common, but when does it stop and actual hair is kept?  </li>
            <li> Anyway, that is the only negative portion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still early in the game</li>
            <li> My scalp is really sensitive, and my hairs are naturally thin</li>
            <li> I started using this about a year ago and continue to buy it because it actually does seem to slow down the receding.</li>
            <li> Also, I hope the price eventually comes down.  </li>
            <li> This bottle seems watered down, or of a thinner consistency.</li>
            <li> Seems like it might be slowing down my thinning.  </li>
            <li> Makes hair feel thicker and slows down shedding.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down and makes it look thicker.</li>
            <li> and I think it has slowed down my hair loss</li>
            <li> it has slowed down..</li>
            <li> I have  used it for a year and it slowed it down or stoped it.</li>
            <li> While the dryness from Nizoral usually lasts a couple of days, this shampoo seemed to permanently dry and damage my hair.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on other products, by Lipogaine.</li>
            <li> So here&#x27;s the conclusion:  hair on other parts of my head started growing that I had not noticed were missing.</li>
            <li> I had to switch to every other day and it still had loads of shedding and dried my scalp.  </li>
            <li> read the other reviews, and the ingredients because I did want something with Ketoconazole that may not be too harsh and this stuff did the trick</li>
            <li> I use it together with a few other products and it seems to have minimized any hair loss.</li>
            <li> months ago I got started on what you might call my, &amp;#34;hair restoral project.&amp;#34; I took a bunch of pictures of balding pate and then got started on a serious regimen which included the the use of Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo.</li>
            <li> but I see less hair in the shower after using that.</li>
            <li> I noticed less hair failing out once I began using the product.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight thickening effect whilst maintaining softness and weight.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a year and my hair is falling less</li>
            <li> I had used Nizoral previously, and it worked..  </li>
            <li> I didnt notice any regrowth or less shedding.</li>
            <li> Hair dropping is much less.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s less than $5/month on shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I now find myself wearing my ball cap less and less.</li>
            <li> I also notice less hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> I see less shedding and itching on the head.</li>
            <li> I have been seeing significantly less hair fall.</li>
            <li> #34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; and even has a slight tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> Less hair loss, and appear stronger, and dandruff never returned after using the product after just a week.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know that my hair has regrown, but it does feel thicker and I can tell I have less shedding</li>
            <li> less is falling out in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Less hair falling.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed less hair falling out when I shower.</li>
            <li> Within a month or so, the thinning of his hair at his temples was already less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed less hair coming out in my hands when I am in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I have less hair loss in the shower with Lipogaine, where I saw a slight increase with Regenpure.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s my &amp;#34;formula&amp;#34; for combating hair loss: Lipogaine shampoo and morning and night applications of  Lipogaine Intensive treatment hair solution to which I add about half a gram of Azelaic Acid flakes.</li>
            <li> protocol had me going from losing 50 plus hairs in the shower each day to less than 10</li>
            <li> I see less hair in my comb after a shampoo.  </li>
            <li> My hair is now less oily and softer than ever.</li>
            <li> I saw a slight difference in the growth of my hair or preventing ones from breaking and falling out.  </li>
            <li> I still see slight hair loss</li>
            <li> Though, the longer i use it, the less i notice the effects.</li>
            <li> --I&#x27;ve used a bottle for about a month and a half now</li>
            <li> You may notice a slight increase in hair falling out as it causes the hair underneath to grow faster.  </li>
            <li> has been significantly less.  </li>
            <li> Some of the shampoos I have used leaves my hair feeling heavy and not very clean, not this product though.</li>
            <li> I noticed if you mess with the cap it will snap off or crack which I&#x27;ve never had happen with a shampoo bottle.  </li>
            <li> Due to the mentioned factors, I can use this product just about daily (at least 5-6 times Weekly) without any negative or adverse affects keeping the DHT on my head at bay and hair loss to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed less hair loss in the shower after a few days.</li>
            <li> My scalp no longer itches with this shampoo; it did a little while I used</li>
            <li> My hairdresser told me that while it works a little that you have to keep using it.</li>
            <li> This is what I&#x27;ve been using a little over a year now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle shampoo but every little bit counts.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that the shampoo already has conditioner included, which save me a little time in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have not been using this shampoo for a little over 12 months now</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for the past 2 years or so every other day as a treatment for my dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I use a very small amount to wash my scalp, then use the remaining foam to de-tangle my (long)</li>
            <li> My only negative is that it leaves my hair feeling somewhat hard.</li>
            <li> I never knew the shadyness behind all these commercial shampoos and sulfate and how they damage your hair.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work, only makes it worse</li>
            <li> I have been using Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo for approximately 2 years and my hair feels fuller and thicker.  </li>
            <li> so I needed an everyday keto shampoo</li>
            <li> so I tried regenpure and it was to harsh also</li>
            <li> But it dried the hell out of my hair and scalp..  </li>
            <li> and it looks like all the brands that used to work, changed their formula and looked like a waste of time.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a few years.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t use this product everyday.  </li>
            <li> I use this shampoo everyday for about a month now</li>
            <li> I would recommend using this every few days in addition to another organic argan oil shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few months</li>
            <li> I used Nizoral for a few months to get rid of it and Lipogaine to keep it gone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few that I like for thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> and I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair everyday.  </li>
            <li> Also, made my hair feel dried out.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I began purchasing Nizoral shampoo to help control my scalp psoriasis and shedding.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a few months now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a few bottles of this shampoo</li>
            <li> This product takes a few months before it starts working.</li>
            <li> On contrary to a few people here</li>
            <li> My hair does not have that firm sticky feeling to it while during or after using Lipogaine 3, so I do not feel the need for a conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Bought it with lipogaine oil, I apply it few minutes before going to shower.</li>
            <li> /o and have been thinning for a few years.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it has kept my hair from falling out and has improved the amount of hair growing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of rubbing chemicals on my head, so gave that up.  </li>
            <li> Had other side effects too such as episode of ed (scary), tight chest, breathing difficulty, blurred vision.  </li>
            <li> I really did not care for the scent,it smells like mint which isn’t horrible but just not a scent I typically buy or like that much,but that’s only a minor factor and wouldn’t stop me from repurchasing.</li>
            <li> + years (especially down the center of my head)  </li>
            <li> Im not sure if its regrowing hair, but I do notice much less hair in the tub after a shower.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed a lot less shedding since using it!</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s just one less thing i have to buy!  </li>
            <li> Obviously hard to isolate the effects of one or the other</li>
            <li> The other product left my hair looking flat and when you are thinning that is a bad thing.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo at least every other day while applying Lipogaine for Men Intensive Treatment 2 times a day, and my hair fall out</li>
            <li> Just as the other reviewers have commented, the consistency of the shampoo is thick.  </li>
            <li> But, if you have thin hair; you don&#x27;t want it to be flat.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dinged it a star because they don&#x27;t offer a larger volume at a less expensive rate.</li>
            <li> Ive notice a few small hairs start to grow</li>
            <li> I usually leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen the loss slow down quite a bit.</li>
            <li> This will slow it down, but I can&#x27;t say it stops it.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product, no shampoo will be a miracle for hair loss but this at least slows the process down.</li>
            <li> It seems to have stopped or at least slowed down hair loss.</li>
            <li> I have found that it is helping me to maintain what I have and slow down the process of MPB.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m scratching myself raw.  </li>
            <li> So,  if you&#x27;re looking looking for a little scalp relief.. Buy this shiz!</li>
            <li> but was afraid to try in supplement form due the the possible liver damage.</li>
            <li> Obviously the peppermint oil in action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a very bad dandruff problem and this instantly helped with the itching and dry scalp after just one use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past year.  </li>
            <li> Lipogaine has maintained my hair count while getting rid of the itchy scalp and the dreaded hair loss that usually follows.</li>
            <li> Usually before I go out as it makes my hair</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money product now sucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I can say I&#x27;m regrowing hair but the desertion seems to have halted and my forehead and hairline are at a stalemate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope this continues past the 2 week period.  </li>
            <li> I usually rotate between Lipogaine and Regenepure</li>
            <li> I have tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> No more itching and flaking.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the shampoo or Lipo minox or both,</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts me between a month and two months usually, about six weeks.</li>
            <li> but after that&#x27;s gone, I&#x27;m not sure what to do.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it helps hair growth (there does seem to be some growth</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this shampoo has helped my thin/thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s adding any regrowth on</li>
            <li> Send me some green!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I lived with being bald for about two years, and then this past January I found this Lipogaine shampoo.</li>
            <li> Over the past year, I&#x27;ve started using non-pg Rogain (foam from Costco) and Lipogaine.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Nizoral 1%, which smelled bad and often left my scalp dry.  </li>
            <li> This stuff does wonders, but it grows VERY slowly unless you combine it with other products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Problem is that it is very expensive, so it’s not really worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> It also helps to make the hair less frizzy, which can be an issue since I have thin hair.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the shampoo does not contain all the hard edged sulfates that can meanwhile beat your hair up over prolonged use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to use all the time.</li>
            <li> I had problems with hard grainy sandlike balls on my scalp which where hardened oil balls.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really hard to comb through.</li>
            <li> but it is hard to tell.  </li>
            <li> at least I didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> , at least for awhile.  </li>
            <li> the lady cutting my hair actually wanted to use &amp;#34;Thinning Scissors&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my hair has been thinning out lately</li>
            <li> The directions say to use at least two to three times a week.  </li>
            <li> However, after prolonged use, It started to affect my scalp negatively.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this shampoo  for at least 4 months</li>
            <li> and I never liked Nizoral.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff at least once a day and always put it in at the beginning of my shower and rinse it out at the end.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has helped to slow hair loss and also makes my hair appear fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li> stuff will prevent hair loss, make your hair thick, and regrow some of your hair.</li>
            <li> ; on my hair cause she said it was thick.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a product to slow hair fall.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference in the strength of my hair still falling out slowly.</li>
            <li> Nizoral is a thick a shampoo.</li>
            <li> It creates a thick lather which I leave on my scalp for about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> so it is not as thick as it once was, so</li>
            <li> The shampoo is extremely thick</li>
            <li> I have noticed hair loss stopped / decreased, after few months of usage .</li>
            <li> I mean give it a shot</li>
            <li> mean a lot.</li>
            <li> Follow instructions and you will see small baby hairs growing!</li>
            <li> I do not reccomend this product to anyone is NW2a or less!!!</li>
            <li> I was certainly skeptical but after ~ 2 months of using 3 times per week I have noticed less hair coming out in the shower.</li>
            <li> Stopped my hair loss or at least significantly decreased it.</li>
            <li> as well as just constant painful, itchy.</li>
            <li> but I have notice that at least it is not getting worse.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that it makes the false claim that you don&#x27;t need conditioner.</li>
            <li> anyway, i am in my late 30s and after a little while, my hair started shedding like crazy.</li>
            <li> It being so expensive is disappointing but it does last 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> Tired of the expensive an messy Minoxidil, it seems to reduce production of oil on my scalp as well.  </li>
            <li> Could be a coincidence, but I think it may be time to find a different shampoo:(</li>
            <li> Essentials\\&quot; along with \\&quot;B Stress\\&quot; complex and a couple others and a lot of prayer!</li>
            <li> I try and keep it in at least 3 minutes while I work on the rest of my body which sometimes can become a pain if you are in a rush!  </li>
            <li> Tough to say</li>
            <li> but I recommend it - at the very least</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working - very slowly, but it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick</li>
            <li> Well, my shedding has decreased dramatically.</li>
            <li> and I was not happy with the results.</li>
            <li> and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as thin as it was when I started the two products.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money and an exploitation of men who are desperate to preserve their hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend giving it a try if you have thin or thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shedding has definitely decreased.</li>
            <li> Other than that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell bad or anything</li>
            <li> I have had a dramatic increase of hair in the frontal hairline.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling thick and luxurious!!</li>
            <li> I guess you could say random hair came in that made my hair thicker.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t give it a 5 stars because it&#x27;s a bit expensive</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t difficult to take advantage of the advertised benefits.</li>
            <li> it was terrifying how suddenly hair loss hit me.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical, but went ahead and purchased the shampoo from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I give this product a 2.5, partly because I think I have somewhat unrealistic expectations.</li>
            <li> Noticable improvement in hair quality and outperformed the ever expensive Nizoral in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have a receding hairline which seems to be irreversible.</li>
            <li> some weird reason Nizoral has stopped manufacturing their shampoo, so</li>
            <li> and my hair shed got worse!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve referred people who have very thin hair</li>
            <li> My hair are very thin and oily.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a sulfate-free shampoo with ketoconazole, but have been very disappointed by others I have tried, because they made my hair dry and tangled.  </li>
            <li> i was shedding like crazy and spots were appearing in my crown area.</li>
            <li> I looked at all these shampoos thinking that it was a desperate attempt to save my cowardly hair</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of peppermint oil in it, so it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp feel cold</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s impossible to tell how well this product specifically is working for hair loss prevention.</li>
            <li> , I gave it 3 stars because it tangles your hair so bad</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have a lot of bad ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I use this shampoo for the ketonconazole as I&#x27;ve suffered really bad scalp itch.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  </li>
            <li> They are bad, any who says otherwise is uninformed.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s probably because it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of bad sulfates..</li>
            <li> bad product, wont buy this again.</li>
            <li> I started getting a redicioulsy bad itch</li>
            <li> Very painful and uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it will be loaded with sulfates and parabens that are terrible for the health of your hair.</li>
            <li> I was stupid and delayed treatment hoping it would just go away, like a sore leg.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given some recommendations that turned out to be crap, but then a friend who&#x27;s been through all of this told me about ketoconazole.</li>
            <li> I hate chemicals.  </li>
            <li> but I hated it because it made my hair feel all tangled up.  </li>
            <li> -you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> it is dangerous!!!!!!</li>
            <li> But this shampoo gets rid of that annoying scalp pain!!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something to help regrow hair but don&#x27;t want to pay the outrageous price of competitors</li>
            <li> Hate to say but...it sucked!</li>
            <li> I was miserable before trying this stuff!</li>
            <li> I was quite miserable.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Shampoo smells great (minty) and I like how it leaves my hair feeling. Can&#x27;t accurately judge the impact it has on hair loss/growth since I&#x27;ve also been using the Lipogaine daily treatment and finesteride.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this shampoo by Chris from Hairlossfromsteroids. I never knew the shadyness behind all these commercial shampoos and sulfate and how they damage your hair. The biggest thing I learned was the benefits from ketoconazole which has been the main ingredient in the shampoos that I have been using for the last few years. I went about a year trying out the different ketoconazole shampoos and found that Big 3 was better than Nizoral which irritated my scalp and Regenpure which left the hair very thin after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big 3 has a nice scent to it, it doesn&#x27;t get super foamy, and leaves some volume to it after you are done showering. I&#x27;ve referred people who have very thin hair and they have seen results within the first month or so. This is a great product which you won&#x27;t find in stores because why would big business want to sell something that actually helped the consumer ;)</li>
            <li> I decided to give a try to hair loss products after doing my research. I don&#x27;t have big expectations but I was told that trying won&#x27;t hurt. I&#x27;ve been loosing my hair since my 20&#x27;s and it I stopped hair loss around 25.  Now I&#x27;m 28. I&#x27;ve been shaving my hair and I am fine with being bold. I wish I could use all natural products but this is the combination I will be using including these product: Neogenic Hair Loss Treatment, Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo, Alma Hair oil, and Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been only few days so I can&#x27;t say anything besides that: My scalp feel much better, shedding of dead skin during shower stopped. No flaking. I will be reporting and adding pictures every month to see if there will be any significant difference visible.</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo for 2 months and I like it. I use it about 3 times a week. A little bit goes a long way so the bottles last a while. It seems to be giving my hair more volume. Not sure if it&#x27;s helping to grow more hair or just preventing hair loss. I gave it 4 stars because it is a little drying, but I use a good hydrating conditioner after which helps. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> The Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo is among the top hair loss shampoos. It will likely not stop male pattern baldness on its own, but is a great product when combined with the Lipogaine Intensive Treatment as it will help increase absorption of the Minoxidil. Keep in mind, that the product will need to be used continuously for up to 6 months in order to see noticeable results. The biggest result I have seen is that the hair will stop falling out rapidly. I have seen minimal new hairs but I am confident that repeated use of the Lipogaine products will help to slow, if not stop, additional hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself smells minty and fresh, due to Peppermint as one of the ingredients. It lathers nicely and leaves the hair feeling full. It has several other ingredients such as 1% ketoconazole, Saw Palmetto, etc. that have been shown to help block the effects of DHT on the scalp. Overall, it is a great shampoo to add to your arsenal of hair loss products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past year.  This in combination with this product http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037TM252/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 has shown progressive results for preventing hair loss and encouraging new hair growth.  Everyone&#x27;s hair type is different and some products work for others while some do not.  These products seem to help most types and I would definitely encourage trying this solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle of this shampoo I have ordered. I don&#x27;t know whether it was a coincidence or the shampoo was really working, but it is the only shampoo that reduced my hair loss, which I noticed right after the first/ second use, judging by how much hair was left on my brush -- much less than before. The only issue I have is that the first bottle that I bought had the shampoo colored light opaque pink -- due to ketoconazole ingredient ( an anti fungal that is used for severe dandruff, and in several studies it was shown to reduce hair loss ); however, the color of the shampoo in my second bottle is grayish opaque white. I keep wondering whether they changed the formula, and it will work the same .....</li>
            <li> This is good shampoo. It lathers well and has improved the appearance of my hair. My wife and mother in law want their own bottles, so I guess that says something!</li>
            <li> Well, my shedding has decreased dramatically. My hair after it sheds actually grows back. My scalp also doesn&#x27;t hurt all the time. All in all this product did for me exactly what it said it would. Stopped my hair loss or at least significantly decreased it. My hair has never felt better. Wish I knew about this earlier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine Big 3 Hair Loss prevention shampoo for about a month now, and love it!&lt;br /&gt;I was originally prescribed Nizoral 2% Ketoconazole shampoo from my dermatologist, but found that it left my hair feeling heavy, as if there was build-up in it, or as if it didn&#x27;t all wash out completely.&lt;br /&gt;Lipogaine has 1% Ketoconazole, yet it works as effectively as the Nizoral 2%, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling filmy and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;On the contrary-my hair feels light and clean after using Lipogaine, with a fresh, minty smell.&lt;br /&gt;Lipogaine Big 3 makes my already naturally curly hair curl better, without any frizz.  Most importantly, it actually makes my hair FULLER!  (I have very thin hair, naturally, and even more so after experience shedding over the last several months!)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several different hair products, shampoos and conditioners for my hair loss, and nothing has improved the look and feel of my hair like Lipogaine Big 3.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the price-you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Ok so i tried the lipogaine drops and it did wonders... For a bit i couldnt keep buying them so i decided to try the shampoo since the drops worked. Yeah... Shampoo didnt work as good, it dried up my hair and it made my scalp itch i stopped using it because i noticed more hair fell off my head. I mean give it a shot becUse it worked for other just not for me.</li>
            <li> this is a really good product for dudes with hair loss. i can only speak for myself but i appear to be seeing results, results i am happy with. my situation may be a little different than many others. i take a med called Axiron (basically pure testosterone) because of a side effect from another med. anyway, i am in my late 30s and after a little while, my hair started shedding like crazy. having had plenty of hair, this simply wouldn&#x27;t do. tried laser combs, saw palmetto, its extract, nioxin etc, now i use minoxidil, but it wasn&#x27;t really working (until recently...stay tuned). i was shedding like crazy and spots were appearing in my crown area. i read about ketaco... and bought some nizral but it was harsh and may have done more harm than good. so, i saw the Lipogaine Big 3 product on a website i trust and bought it on amazon. started using it and was pleased immediately by a couple of things. first, a very small amount goes a very long way; like i said, i still have a lot of hair and only a little bit creates a fantastic lather for me. also, the lather slowly gets absorbed into your hair/scalp. so, this smallish bottle will last a long time for me; much longer for those with less hair (they recommend 2-3 times/week). so i am really satisfied and have high hopes for this stuff in conjunction with minoxidil because the combination is working; much less shedding or no shedding at all. and, the only change i made was adding the Lipogaine. So i really recommend that others at least give it a try. hopefully i will get my med situation sorted out sometime, but for now, and as someone for whom hair loss just isn&#x27;t acceptable, i recommend Lipogaine Big 3 without reservation.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, much better than the average hairloss shampoo you can get at Walgreens/CVS.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for the price. The bottle will last you over a month and it leaves your hair smelling clean and looking full. I&#x27;ve noticed good results with using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for five months now and am surprised at how well this product has worked. I&#x27;ve even received comments from family members about how my hair looks thicker than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five months ago I got started on what you might call my, &amp;#34;hair restoral project.&amp;#34; I took a bunch of pictures of balding pate and then got started on a serious regimen which included the the use of Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo. I&#x27;ve also been using the Lipogaine Intensive Treatment Complete Solution on my balding crown. Things are going better than I expected which can be proven by my batch of, &amp;#34;Five Months Later&amp;#34; photos. I am aware that results aren&#x27;t usually expected until after six months or more and I&#x27;m glad to find that my progress is a good bit ahead of the curve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a ton of research before starting on this, &amp;#34;project&amp;#34; and all of the best reviews and recommendations I found on various forums and web sites pointed me to the product here. Lipogaine received the best reviews so it made it onto my list. I can safely say that those reviews were correct and I definitely suggest that you try this shampoo as a part of your hair restoral efforts. If I ever get tired (which I doubt) of using the Lipogaine solution on the back of my head, I&#x27;m still going to use the Big 3 Shampoo. One bottle goes a long way and the results are great. I won&#x27;t be switching back to any drug store shampoos. Best of luck to all of you out there doing the same, &amp;#34;project.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Was about to buy this, good thing I didn&#x27;t. I decided to visit Lipogaine&#x27;s website out of curiosity. In short, it is filled with spelling and grammatical errors that make me question the quality of anything this this company manufactures. How good is this company&#x27;s quality control if they cannot even edit their website? I&#x27;ll give a couple examples: &amp;#34;FAD&amp;#34; (instead of FDA), and &amp;#34;Saw palmetto works by the same mechanism as Finasteride works.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m staying with Regenepure.</li>
            <li> I have been using PURA DOR for the past year with good results (meaning my hair loss has not goteen worse), but decided to try out lipogaines shampoo as It is new on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A MONTH in I believe these reviews are all FRAUD and this is just a cheap generic shampoo in this bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SCAM RUN RUN RUN AWAY!!!</li>
            <li> ok listen guys! this is one of the best shampoos i had so far! its excelent , i always had oily hair and this shampoo keeps my hair dry for one day ( for me) and i do use it every day with no problems at all, so no itchy , and nothing , it just feels healthy. what i also like is that it does not contains laurel sulfato and thats good , because that stuff is bad, specially if u want lo leave it on the hair for 5 minutes every day,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i honestly dont know if it sloww my hair from falling, because my hair is to short, but &amp;#34; i still need a shampoo to clean my hair right &amp;#34; so this is it, this is my choice...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nizoral is good but with laurel sulfate and other ingredients, i can probably use it once a week and lipogane all week, ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i always like to add shampoo twice, so you will get  ALOT! of bubbles with this big 3 specially on the second.&lt;br /&gt;so guys i do have to say that so far...&lt;br /&gt;this is my top number 1 shampoo for me: big 3 lipogaine  and second place : nora ross shampoo oily hair with garlic ( doesnot smell like garlic , jjust to mention that) nora ross shampoo 1 bottle will last you a 1 YEAR!!! and its good stuff, so you can definetly mix this 2 or three shampoos over the week if you want, and i will promise that you will get hair ALL OVER YOUR BODY!!! hahaha so be careful to contact only the hair when u rinse the shampoo off your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i definetly recomend lipogaine and that bottle will last you months trust me &amp;#34;months&amp;#34;, so this is my choice i have been using it for months and i love it, and now i recomend it to you guys even if you dont have oily hair.</li>
            <li> People this stuff really works !!!! I&#x27;ve tried every shampoo out there and all the pills but I have no success until I found this stuff. I&#x27;m a 45 year old male who&#x27;s been pretty lucky to have a full head of hair. When I hit 40 I noticed my hair was thinning and I ran to the dematologist. He gave me some pills and rogaine but it didn&#x27;t help. My hair was shedding and I started to just accept this came with age. After trying everything and reading all the great reviews about this shampoo I decided to try it and boy I&#x27;m glad I did. Now what you probably will not get is new hair growth at least I didn&#x27;t but what happened immediately was that with Lipogaine Big 3 was that my hair stop shedding almost completely and it&#x27;s much thicker after I use it. So I am now on my 3rd bottle and each bottle has last me about 2 months since you only have to use it around 3 times a week and you don&#x27;t need much. Remember when using it to keep it on your head for at least 5 minutes you&#x27;ll feel the nice tingling sensation on your head. I&#x27;ve had no side effects whatsoever and this stuff smells great !!!!!</li>
            <li> After using the product for more than 2 years, I must say this is the best hair loss product in the market. I had tried so many different products before. Nothing really worked  the way Lipogaine does.  I can&#x27;t assure it will work for everyone but it surely works for me wonderfully.  I am at my 40&#x27;s and I didn&#x27;t notice severe balding until couple of years ago.  After two years usage, I got about 60-80% of my lost hair back. I took photos every month to check if products really worked as it was claimed. I noticed the difference around 4-6 months. I wish I could have shown your guys the photos I took. Unfortunately I deleted them after I knew it was the magical product I looked for.  I strongly recommend you do the same. Try 3-6 months. If it doesn&#x27;t work, you can stop and it is not a big loss.  Moreover, unlike other hair treatment products, I haven&#x27;t noticed any side effects.</li>
            <li> After using a couple weeks I&#x27;ve noticed it feels like quality shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good shampoo for hair loss prevention, like everything MPB.. shampoo probably isn&#x27;t enough to stop it, but this is by far the best one you could choose. I&#x27;ve seen the loss slow down quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  It is worth the extra cost.  I have relatively thick, fine hair that I wear long. I take meds that have the side effect of thinning hair.  Plus I color it, so the fact that the shampoo is sulfate free is important.  My hair feels less flyaway, smoother, and there is less of it in my brush, so it isn&#x27;t falling out as much.  I get a lot of compliments on my hair.  I use Lipogaine Big 3 exclusively, since I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day.  I am so glad to have found this shampoo!</li>
            <li> Since I started using Lipogaine I have definitely noticed my hair to be fuller.  Im not sure if its regrowing hair, but I do notice much less hair in the tub after a shower.  I really like the way it makes my scalp tingle as well.  I will continue using this product!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like how dry my hair felt and my hair had no body to it.  I went back to using Perfect Hair Shampoo</li>
            <li> I alternate this with Nioxin Normal to Thinning Hair shampoo, letting it set for approximately 2 minutes before rinsing. It feels great, and leaves hair thick and healthy. In conjunction with Lipogaine&#x27;s minoxidil solution, I&#x27;ve noticed regrowth on the crown and temple areas - my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this shampoo. Lathers well. Leaves scalp feeling tingling and clean. Small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works! I used it for a month straight and by week 3 I started noticing regrowth in the front of my hairline. I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle now and I&#x27;m noticing regrowth in the crown area as well. In addition, it&#x27;s a great all around shampoo. Leaves your hair feeling nice and soft. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo a couple of months ago and really like it. I use it 3 to 4 times a week. I prefer the Big 3 to the Regenepure DR &amp; NT. It lathers up a lot better... and it&#x27;s much cheaper. It&#x27;s still early in the game but my hair feels somewhat thicker. I guess time will tell.</li>
            <li> This shampoo contains ketoconazole, which is one of the few compounds that even the FDA actually acknowledge as having hair growth stimulating properties by way of its thorough scalp and follicle cleaning ability. Furthermore, the shampoo does not contain all the hard edged sulfates that can meanwhile beat your hair up over prolonged use. Basically it has the good stuff and excludes the bad stuff therefore and still foams up well without having to use a huge amount each time, also only needing 2 to 3 uses a week to gain the necessary benefit. I can&#x27;t necessarily claim I&#x27;ve seen hair regrowth but it does seem to be contributing to stemming any further thinning.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve used yet.  Hair definitely looks better.  Too early to tell yet if it helps with hair loss but hair does look fuller.  My only complaint is I wish it came in bigger bottles.  Also, I hope the price eventually comes down.  Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li> This has worked so far. No dandruff, this is the best product I&#x27;ve used thus far. Thickens hair a bit, don&#x27;t know for certain if I have hair loss (haven&#x27;t visited the dermatologist) but hair looks great.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair loss shampoo, contains Ketoconazole to prevent help loss (inhibit DHT) and no Sodium Lauryl Sulphate unlike the well-konwn Nizoral shampoo. At the difference of Regenepure, this shampoo does not let you hairs flat. I got great results with this shampoo (applied 3 times a week) and combined with 5% minoxidil such as Lipogaine and oral DHT blockers. Totally worth every penny!</li>
            <li> been using for 3--- 4 months haven&#x27;t seen no difference</li>
            <li> The shampoo feels and smells like regular shampoo, but definitely produces new hair growth.  I use it almost daily, letting it set for at least a minute before washing it out.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best I&#x27;ve found so far. Its not going to miraculously grow your hair back but that product doesn&#x27;t exist in a shampoo. I haven&#x27;t seen new growth but I think it slows the thinning. Based on the ingredients I&#x27;ll most likely use this for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo for a month with Lipogaine minoxidil .&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo lather is great , I only used 1/10 of this shampoo in a month . Although my hair is too short and I used it twice each time. I also can say it smells good and it has very good ingredients and its easy to style hair after using that. Since I&#x27;m using the finpecia and lipogaine minoxidil and I&#x27;m in the shedding process I can&#x27;t say about dandruf controlling but I see less hair in the shower after using that. Lipogaine is a really good brand . You can also use good conditioner towards.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work, only makes it worse&lt;br /&gt;batter to use baby shampoo ( like been doing for years)&lt;br /&gt;its funny to ready all the five star reviews and how they say it works ( wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the manufacturer wrote those)&lt;br /&gt;while using this product i lost more hair in the shower then when was using baby shampoo&lt;br /&gt;my final conclusion: so what if the label says it has all these ingredients that supposedly help the hair, in reality when i keep all these chemicals on my hair for 3-4 minutes (as directed) then end up loosing way more hair then the natural rate&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t know about you but im done with this product</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this product, but there were a lot of good reviews and I had nothing to lose (except my hair).  I&#x27;ve tried many different shampoos trying to find something that worked, but have had no success until now. I love this product! My hair has never felt or looked better and with the help of their women&#x27;s minoxidil solution and biotin, my hair is slowly but surely growing back in the thinning spots! I am now on my second bottle and will continue to buy this product!</li>
            <li> Great product and works as intended. Compared to my regular shampoo it leaves my hair and scalp noticeably cleaner and my hair has a lot more body. I&#x27;m certain  I will order again. Shipping was quick and hats off to Lipogaine Big 3.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for nine months. Since I have started using lipogaine I have noticed hair regrowth  around my hairline and thickening of hair.  In the past I used regenpure and lipogaine is byfar a better product.... Dont waste your money on other products, by Lipogaine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do reviews, for amazon, but I wanted to give this my nod. For those who are willing to seriously let the shampoo rest on their scalp for a good 3.5 minutes or more, this product is excellent, and I think the best product on the market currently.</li>
            <li> This is a review after 6 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figure it&#x27;s better than Nizoral at keeping my dandruff away and the associated hair loss that comes with it, considering all the extra ingredients they put in it. I must say, dandruff control is excellent with this shampoo (absolutely zero recurrence) vs Nizoral where a little would still return. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp the way Nizoral does. My scalp no longer itches with this shampoo; it did a little while I used Nizoral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak about its hair regrowth claims, since I don&#x27;t notice any hair regrowing. I do notice that my hair has stopped falling out (no loose hairs in the drain or on the bathroom floor). Even with Nizoral, I had hair falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is much more expensive than Nizoral. This particular bottle sells for $25 while a larger volume Nizoral sells for $15 at Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three stars for essentially curing my dandruff and hair loss problem and the lack of hair regrowth as claimed.</li>
            <li> My son uses this product and swears by it, he also accompanies it with the  product Lipogaine for Men Intensive Treatment and complete Solution for Hair Loss.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have been using Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo for approximately 2 years and my hair feels fuller and thicker.  I am a repeat customer and will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> This is a marvelous product.  Hair growth seen at about 6 weeks, and still there.  Also great shampoo!</li>
            <li> This shampoo goes really well with the Lipogaine drops. I bought this shampoo for my dad along with the Lipogaine drops. My dad says it leaves his hair very clean. He has noticed hair growth from the combined use of the Lipogaine shampoo and Lipogaine drops.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two months now coupled with rogaine and biotin supplements. I noticed a difference after the first month and my hair has become thicker and fuller.  This shampoo is great because it has all the essential ingredients that you need to promote hair regrowth. Definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t see results and made my hair feel brittle after a while of use. I gave 3 stars because it does have some good ingredients in it.&lt;br /&gt;My hair thinning is more from internal issues like hypothyroidism so wasn&#x27;t sure if this would even help. It may help those who just have some regular thinning. I have a lot more luck with using dr bronners soap as a shampoo and diluted apple cider vinegar as a conditioner , hair fall comes close to zero after use! Sometimes I add aloe in with the acv as well. However my hair holds the smell where as some peoples don&#x27;t so It&#x27;s hard for me to use all the time.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo for over a year now and will continue to do so as I really like how much it thickens my hair.  I have naturally fine hair with some thinning, but I&#x27;ve noticed my hair to be much more manageable and fuller since using this shampoo.  I can&#x27;t promise you it will stop your hair loss, but in my experience, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed fewer hairs in my shower and that&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month going on 2 months so its too early to tell no visible sign yet of changes with hair growth. Will update after 4-6 months of use as some have suggested will take time.</li>
            <li> Lipogaine is the best hair loss shampoo I have ever used: it contains ingredients that have demonstrated legitimate clinical efficacy in fighting hair loss and decreasing scalp DHT levels (ketokonazole) and anti-inflammation agents such as copper peptides and biotin.  I use this shampoo as a multi-therapy approach to my hair loss, partnering it with Finasteride, Minoxidil, Low Level Laser Therapy and vitamins.  I believe it&#x27;s particularly great to use, prior to applying minoxidil and/or prior to receiving low level laser therapy treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed less shedding, since implementing this product into my existing hair loss regiment.  Excellent shampoo.</li>
            <li> I like the product. With consistent use ive regrown frontal hair and staved off loss of more hair. Id recommend it to anyone with minor hair loss!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is surprisingly gentle, and is effective at slowing hair loss on my front scalp.</li>
            <li> No shampoo alone is going to re-grow hair but as far as I&#x27;m concerned this is the best one to use alongside Minoxodil or Lipogaine - especially any of the treatments containing azelaic acid (I&#x27;d tried traditional 5% minoxidil with only little success for about a year - moved on to a higher strength e-auction available treatment with azelaic acid, added Lipogaine Big 3 to help treat/heal the scalp and hair at the same time and have had EXCELLENT results since - my plan is to use that to re-grow and then the basic cheap minoxidil to maintain)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how much credit does this shampoo deserve?  Tough to say but I recommend it - at the very least it&#x27;s help keep my scalp and hair healthy even as the minoxidil and acid do their work to get down to the follicle.  I tried Nizoral and while it had the ketoconazole this product has that and much more - plus a nice peppermint smell and it actually does a good job on your hair as well as your scalp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this a bit pricier than others?  Sure - but this is at LEAST a 6 month supply (probably a year) so $1-2 a month isn&#x27;t much when you think about it</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of the shampoo, and it totally cleared up my flaking but even better my hair is coming in faster. I started with the men&#x27;s product but I knew I have sensitive skin so I also use the Women&#x27;s Sensitive Product, and I have had quick results with those, but the Big 3 shampoo took to the next level. The fastest results for me to date!</li>
            <li> I am a 25 year-old male who has been balding since I was about 18. I suffer both genetically with a receding hairline and hormonally with a balding crown. I&#x27;ve tried a variety of products throughout the years and have managed to hold onto the remaining hair I do have fairly well given the baldness of my younger family members. Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo definitely delivers as promised. No, you aren&#x27;t going to be looking like Chewbacca or growing an afro anytime soon using this product, but it does what it was advertised to do. For me, hair loss was basically ceased, and I experienced modest hair growth on both my hairline and crown. With enough remaining hair, this product, and shorter hairstyles, you can either hide or drastically reduce the appearance of your male pattern baldness. Compared to other products, which often require multiple shampoos which each cost as much or more than this one, this is by far the best value along with being the best in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to maximize your hair gains, I suggest also using minoxidil (Lipogaine has their own version which really does work better than Rogaine and its generics (no, I am not a bot account promoting their products, they just really do work)). I also recommend buying the cheapest laser hair comb you can for the full routine.</li>
            <li> Used for a long time now - almost 3 years (along with the Lipogaine liquid).  Started getting comments from friends and family about 4 months in. Hair definitely felt thicker, even when just running hands through.  Then I stopped using about 8 months ago when I was moving.  Too much going on and then just got used of not using.  The change was noticeable within about 5 months.  Comments from those same friends and family that I should maybe think about using again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did and amazingly I am seeing the same results as I did originally.  Have some catching up to do, but it just amazes how well this product (and the liquid) work.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo together with Lipogaine hair growth liquid for 4 month. The effect is very obvious. I can see lots of tiny new hair have grown from originally bared skin, some even from forehead. It is best set I have ever tried. The shampoo has good fragrant and good for many months of use.&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> this product is work for me. my hair looks more stronger .(i have two moths using this shampoo.)</li>
            <li> Good product. Does not do miracles however I believe this is the best product on the market in it&#x27;s category. I have tried many products advertised to be comparable however Lipogaine I believe is the best.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Lipogaine for Women and LIPOGAINE BIG 3. Shampoo.  I have been using both for almost a month and the lipogaine for women is OK but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the shampoo as it stings and burns my eyes.  I won&#x27;t be buying the shampoo again but will use the  Lipogaine for Women., at least for awhile.  My hairdresser told me that while it works a little that you have to keep using it. I have noticed a decrease in my hair that it is not falling out, so I am optimistic</li>
            <li> I bought this product at the recommendation of a friend as a use in conjunction with rogaine. It being so expensive is disappointing but it does last 2-3 months. It is difficult to tell how much it helps in the process but I believe my hair has stopped falling out at the rate it was. Rogaine or Lipogaine or both is the question. I can say that flakiness has diminished and that I love the smell of this shampoo. it has a fresh clean smell unlike many others of this type. the smell is almost a teatree scent but not quite.</li>
            <li> Using the Lipogaine Big 3 leaves my hair cleaner than I have ever felt it and my scalp has a very healthy clean feeling also.  I immediately got back on Amazon and ordered two more bottles to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Tried it once. It dried my scalp and caused so much dandruff that I haven&#x27;t used it since.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair regrowing products for many years. This is the first one I see a difference in using.  The shampoo is nice like regular store bought shampoo not greasy, easy to use, and lasts awhile.  Definitely worth trying it.</li>
            <li> Decided to give Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo a try after being extremely impressed with their minoxidil. Had tried Nizoral shampoo before and wasn&#x27;t necessarily sure if it made a difference and also didn&#x27;t like the way it made my hair look/feel after using it, leaving it kind of flat. Since using the Big 3 Shampoo I can tell that I lose less hair in the shower and also I feel as though it makes my hair look fuller after using it. The bottle recommends using 2-3 times a week but I use it every day and feel like I can notice difference in my hair if I go a day or two without using. With so many hair loss products out there claiming to do things that they don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s nice to have find one that actually does.  Definitely plan on continuing to use the Big 3 Shampoo and also Lipogaine&#x27;s minoxidil product.</li>
            <li> I am a female with male pattern baldness after chemo and radiation. (2.5 years out). Dermatologist said there was nothing I could do. Decided to try a few things on my own. Minoxidil did nothing. Purchased this shampoo in October, using daily. I like that it has emu oil, which was very effective on irritated/dry chemo skin. I did not notice any change the first month. After second month I noticed that my scalp wasn&#x27;t quite as visible through my short hair. My hair dresser had gone on maternity leave and just recently returned. She couldn&#x27;t believe how much it had filled out. She said that whatever I was doing, to keep doing it! I may try the minoxidil with it. I never have any itching or irritation with this shampoo. February and I am still on my first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;February 2015 update: I have since ordered another bottle of Lipogaine. As others have stated there is some change to the formula. This time the color is white and it does smell a little different. I have been using this new formula for a couple months. I have not noticed any difference in the quality of the product. There has been no increase in hair loss or breakage. This product has consistently strengthened and increased my hair. I  chose not to add the Minoxidil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update June 2016: I purchased my fourth bottle two months ago. This bottle seems watered down, or of a thinner consistency. I have noticed some increase of hair in my shower drain after showering. Could be a coincidence, but I think it may be time to find a different shampoo:(</li>
            <li> Both I and my like this shampoo, smell and creamy texture of the shampoo are good, but I think it may be overly drying for people with dry hair or scalps. I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than  a few days a week. I alternate it with tricomin, and T-Sal</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo in the sense that it leaves your hair feeling/looking full and thick. I can&#x27;t tell whether it has slowed or stopped hairloss as I am using other treatments, but it has a solid list of ingredients.</li>
            <li> I just finished using a product that is similar to this and I was not happy with the results. The other product left my hair looking flat and when you are thinning that is a bad thing. I should have stayed on Big 3. When I was taking this and the lipogain hair serum, my hair looked amazing and now I&#x27;m trying to get back to that fullness that I had before. I&#x27;m a big fan of this company and will continue to use this as long as I keep maintaining my current follicle count.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a 6 month trial which I feel is fair as the hair works in cycles. You obviously can&#x27;t expect something like this to work overnight.&lt;br /&gt;I use it as directed which it says 2 to 3 times a week. I use it Mondays, Wednesday and Fridays to keep it easy to remember. On the in between days I just wash my hair with water only to maintain natural oils on my scalp and hair. I pair it with a nice conditioner free of parabens and dilithicone or any type of silicone which you want to avoid. Lipogaine has maintained my hair count while getting rid of the itchy scalp and the dreaded hair loss that usually follows. The trick is to make sure you use a lot of conditioner after as it does tend to dry hair out just a little. If you do this it makes a perfect balance. I will continue using this as it has the ketoconazole which is proven to aid in stopping hair loss. It also has some other great ingredients like Biotin and Saw Palmetto.</li>
            <li> This product contains ingredients that are supposed to help with hair loss- I got it bc I had tried the Lipogaine (with minoxidil) solution which definitely works - so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try as well. I am satisfied with the value, its just kind of hard to tell the effects of this since I was already using the Lipogaine solution, but given the ingredients it has in it, the price, and that it helps with other things (i.e. dandruff) without a doubt, I have given it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This hair loss shampoo has got a lot (pretty much all) of the essential ingredients needed to combat hair loss.  I have been using this product together with the Lipogaine solution and it has done wonders to my scalp.  Finally, a regimen that doesn&#x27;t cost thousands and thousands dollars! Just long term dedication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very selective when it comes to the ingredients in health products.  When I first read the ingredients of this product I was looking for these key ingredients: Ketaconazole, Biotin, Saw Palmetto, Nettles, Castor oil, Emu oil, and Niacin and without any drying and harsh ingredients such as propylene glycol.  All of the ingredients that I mentioned especially Ketaconazole (This is a big one, look it up) are the main fundamental ingredients needed to fight hair loss. I&#x27;ve done a lot of research on them. Each and every one of them has their unique benefits (Research it).  I used to buy all of the ingredients separately and apply them all to my scalp (Not fun at all). The fact that Lipogaine makes it all in one makes my hair regimen such easy process. Kudos!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that this product to be at it&#x27;s most effectiveness when its used with other products. This is what I&#x27;ve been using a little over a year now and it has done wonders: Lipogaine Shampoo, Lipogaine Solution, Propecia (Or the generic version Finasteride), Biotin tablets, Saw Palmetto Capsules, and a Multivitamin. It&#x27;s working excellent for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key here to combating hair loss is to reduce or eliminate DHT in your body.  All the products that I use including lipogaine decreases DHT.  Remember, it&#x27;s important to do your homework. Understand what DHT does to your hair. Learn the key ingredients thats needed to combat hair loss.</li>
            <li> Smells great and one bottle lasts a very long time. I noticed that my hair has started to slowly look better. Combined with rogaine i have slowed my hair loss drastically. Will be using this product for a long time. :-)!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for my husband regularly for almost a year now. While I don&#x27;t see his hair as thick and full as it was a few years ago, I have noticed that he has stopped shedding considerably.  He used to have a lot of hairs on his pillow and that has stopped. It&#x27;s not a miracle shampoo but every little bit counts. He also uses the lipogaine fluid if that helps anyone!</li>
            <li> I noticed less hair failing out once I began using the product.  My hair is much fuller.</li>
            <li> Great product. There are many hair loss shampoos out there to choose from. I have tried two others, but this is the first hair loss shampoo that has all the important ingredients in one for the same price. No side effects on my end. My scalp and hair always feels better after i use this stuff. No scalp iratation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the gentle products I use for my hair...It makes me feel with comfort. .. and I use it to speed up the regrowth of my hair with Lipogaine for men product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only a month and already I notice the change, its the only shampoo product that I use, its great&lt;br /&gt;I am happy that I found this product; it actually works and my hair have grown .. thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased just about every hair loss shampoo on the market. To date, Lipogaine Big 3 is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order for me to even try a Hair Loss Shampoo, it must contain Ketoconazole. This is just about the only Clinically Proven ingredient to actually help with Hair Loss as its been demonstrated to inhibit the Hormone DHT (Dihydrotestosterone) which is the primary culprit causing Male Pattern Hair Loss. Studies for this are readily available online and I encourage anyone to research this and point to two studies in particular. Firstly, a Study Conducted at the University of Liege, Belgium, 1998 ([...]) &amp;amp; Juntendo University School of Medicine, Japan, 2005 ([...]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ketoconazole is an anti-Fungal agent contained in the popular anti-dandruff Shampoo Nizoral, which, for many years was the only Ketoconazole Shampoo and used widely off label for hair loss prevention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what makes Lipogaine Big 3 so good? Well, like Nizoral it contains Ketoconazole, proven to aid in hair loss prevention however, it is much improved upon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ketoconazole is a harsh ingredient when used on its own as it is a powerful anti-dandruff &amp;amp; anti-androgen. Most shampoo&#x27;s contain a chemical product known as Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS) that like Ketoconazole, is not harmfull in limited exposures to the scalp and skin. SLS is the agent in soaps and cleaners that causes them to &#x27;Foam&#x27; up. When combined with Ketoconazole for sustained periods on the scalp as is needed to receive the anti-androgenic (anti-DHT) effects, these ingredients can cause itching, redness and general discomfort on the scalp. Especially when used daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipogaine Big 3 is firstly free of Sodium Lauryl Sulphate. Secondly, it contains Emu Oil which is a powerful anti-inflammatory agent that helps to mitigate harsh effects of the skins exposure to Ketoconazole. Thirdly, it contains other ingredients that although have not been studied as extensively as Ketoconazole in there anti-androgenic effect, are widely used in just about every hair loss/hair growth shampoo (Saw Palmetto etc.). Due to the mentioned factors, I can use this product just about daily (at least 5-6 times Weekly) without any negative or adverse affects keeping the DHT on my head at bay and hair loss to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, this shampoo leaves my hair actually looking good. It has a slight thickening effect whilst maintaining softness and weight. I suffer from male pattern baldness and these aesthetic components mean a lot. I don&#x27;t just want to stop/reverse hair loss, I want my hair to look good also which is simply not possible in many medicated shampoo&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipogaine Big 3 is not the only hair loss shampoo on the market (Revita is Good, Regenepure DR is great also) but at the present, it is my favorite. I can&#x27;t stress the importance of doing thorough homework when purchasing hair loss prevention products. Most are all style and no substance. This product is both style and substance, something extraoardinarily rare in the hair loss industry.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo leaves my hair fuller and thicker. Can&#x27;t say for sure if I am regrowing any hair from it. Only places in receding are in the front. Best I can hope is that it is prevents further thinning/loss. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo. Fresh smelling and leaves my hair feeling clean and free of residue. I like that ingredients include ketoconazole, a product that has been shown to promote hair growth. Whether that translates to long term benefits in the setting of male pattern baldness is to be determined but as a shampoo, I like the product a lot.</li>
            <li> Best keto shampoo on the market and I&#x27;ve used most!</li>
            <li> Finally, a shampoo that WORKS!  When used with Lipogaine topical serum, i see a noticeable improvement in density and growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine for a few months now, and I must say it really works.  Last year my hair started to fall out rapidly and my bald spot was becoming more noticeable, but after a couple of months of using Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo and Lipogaine Intensive treatment I began to see results.  At first my hair stopped falling out and after a few weeks of using Lipogaine it actually started to grow back a little.  I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shampoo.  It clears out dry and itchy scalp without drying out hair. The shampoo is filled with quality ingredients and leaves your hair nice and clean.</li>
            <li> The shampoo works great! I&#x27;ve noticed fuller/thicker hair when coupled with fin. and minox. Obviously hard to isolate the effects of one or the other but I haven&#x27;t noticed any drawbacks as of yet.</li>
            <li> I began losing my hair about 15 years ago, mostly on the crown of my head. I would shave my head on a regular basis to hide my baldness - but I knew it was there. At the start of this year, I made the bold decision to stop shaving. I would attempt to regrow my hair or live with my baldness. I researched hair loss causes and treatments on the internet and I discovered Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo on Amazon. It contains saw palmetto, biotin and many other natural ingredients that promote hair growth. Based on the positive reviews, I gave the shampoo a try. I been washing (what&#x27;s left of) my hair with it for 3 months and I&#x27;ve noticed new growth in spots on top of my head and in small areas of my crown. It&#x27;s working - very slowly, but it&#x27;s working. I also began using the Lipogaine minoxidil treatments. I don&#x27;t have a full head of hair yet, but Lipogaine products are giving me results - and enough faith to keep trying.</li>
            <li> I have a hypothyroidism and have been battling extreme hair loss for years. I have tried everything under the sun to try and keep the hair I have and find a away to create regrowth. I am only in my 30&#x27;s so it been a big part of my life. I have done a ton of research and have read a million reviews of different products. But this is the first time I have ever taken the time to write a review, Lipogaine Big 3 has had a huge impact in my life. I have been using it for about a year and my hair is falling less and I have regrowth! My hair dresser just a few weeks ago told me my hair is finally looking like it is growing in and she could see a ton of baby hairs for the first time in a long time. I love this product and it works, it has all the right ingredients! If you have done any research on your hair loss, you will see this product has all the ingredients you have been seeing that are need to stimulate regrowth!</li>
            <li> kind of useless, but smells nice</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s not going to work a miracle on your head but I can definitely notice a difference -- in fact not only is my hairloss stopping but it is even growing back (very fine &amp;#34;baby hair&amp;#34; so far). I didn&#x27;t think it was working at first, but the key is to leave it in your hair for as long (or longer) than they instruct you to on the bottle. It has also helped with itchiness and scalp irritation.</li>
            <li> Like the name indicates, this is a hair-loss prevention shampoo.  Since I started using it, i noticed that my hair seems healthier, and thicker overall.  Lipogaine promotes healthy hair, and consequently it makes the hair you have stay in place.  It has a &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; fragrance - sort of minty, but I use RedKen conditioner which has a little better fragrance - so it&#x27;s all good.  Proof that I&#x27;m pleased with this product is that I&#x27;ve bought it more than once.  I recommend it for those who&#x27;s hair is thinning out a bit, and want to keep what&#x27;s left.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this shampoo is preventing any hair loss but I have also been using it with minoxidil and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as thin as it was when I started the two products.  I tried other ketoconazole shampoos and this is much milder and leaves my hair feeling better.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo any guy can use. I use to have dandruff problem since I was a kid. The only way around it was to use a shampoo loaded with chemicals. However, ever since I started using Lipogaine,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- I no longer have dandruff&lt;br /&gt;2- I don&#x27;t see any hairs on my pillow or when i run my hand through my dry/wet hair&lt;br /&gt;3- My hair looks healthy, shinny and much thinker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you don&#x27;t have any of my problems, I think you should get it simply because it&#x27;s not loaded with chemicals.</li>
            <li> I am loving this shampoo! It really does my hair well, its not flat!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had success in regrowth and thickness in the last 2 years... but thought this shampoo would perhaps make things even better. Unfortunately, it completely horrified me. Tonight is the second night of use and tons and tons of hair falling out!  DO NOT USE- it is dangerous!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product! I am a 29 year old white female with androgenetic alopecia. This isn&#x27;t diagnosed but I have all the telltale signs, hair loss in both genders on both sides of my family, and my hair has steadily been diffuse thinning for about ten years, mainly on the top and sides. I absolutely refuse to use Rogaine because of the nasty skin side effects they don&#x27;t print on the box and because it just seems like a huge pain in the rear to use but I felt like I needed to do SOMETHING as I was shedding so much and my hair wasn&#x27;t growing back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Lipogaine Big 3. I order from Amazon probably 200 times a year and before I buy anything, online or in person, I do as much research as I possibly can. I was specifically looking for a shampoo that included at least 1% ketoconazole but not one necessarily for dandruff. So I researched and read reviews on the other ketoconazole shampoos on the market (Nizoral, Regenepure, Revita, etc.) and came to the conclusion that Lipogaine Big 3 would probably work the best. They had the best reviews, the best price on Amazon than anywhere else, and the ingredients list includes lots of other things know to help hair growth/reduce shedding as well as the ketoconazole: Emu oil, Niacin, Biotin, Saw Palmetto, Copper tripeptides, and Castor oil. I ordered this product for the first time in late 2012 I believe and have used in consistently ever since and there&#x27;s one reason why: IT WORKS. I didn&#x27;t make the connection at first because I never think anything will help but my hair legitimately did stop shedding, like completely, after 6 or so months of using it 2 times a week. The other times i just wash my hair with regular shampoo and I have no dryness at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So long story short, it&#x27;s affordable and it work if you stick with it. Make it part of your routine and just relax because eventually you will notice you&#x27;re not losing hair in the shower or during styling like you may once havebeen. One bottle will last you about 3-4 months so the value is truly unbeatable. It&#x27;s been a real life boost to my self-esteem to be able to keep my hair and I&#x27;m happy to be a lifelong customer of Lipogaine.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the popular Ketoconazole shampoos and this one by far is the best, as it leaves my hair fuller and with more volume. I am not sure what the chemical is that does this; but as someone with thinning hair and knows Ketoconazole does work - for me - it also helps to use a shampoo that also volumizes your hair with the same product. However, I would still read the directions and only use it 2-3 times a week. I just use a generic volumizes shampoo for the other days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I have since added as my &amp;#34;other shampoo&amp;#34; a product that uses Fo-Ti root. It it something that I have heard whispers of online; but was afraid to try in supplement form due the the possible liver damage. The topical treatment seems to be showing improved results too.</li>
            <li> I apply minoxidil products twice a day, in the morning and before I go to sleep. And this led me to the habit of washing my hair twice a day, usually right before I apply the minoxidil. There are many shampoos that will make my head feel clean, like refreshingly clean, but most of them leave my scalp dry and cause dandruff when applied regularly. Surprisingly, this product seems to work a lot better in the sense of improving my scalp condition without being harsh. I can&#x27;t tell if this shampoo is actually preventing my further hair loss, since this isn&#x27;t the only product I use in my daily routine. But It certainly makes my scalps feel good and my hairline has been kept safe recently, so I will keep on using this product.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this product. I use it as part of the actual &amp;#34;Big Three&amp;#34; triad of finasteride, minoxidil, and ketoconazole. Ketoconazole is the active ingredient in this shampoo which helps with hair loss, although it is loaded with other supportive ingredients. I find that it lathers very well, and smells like peppermint. I use the product as the directions say, and as a result this stretches the shampoo for months of usage. Well worth the money, and a great addition to anyone&#x27;s hair loss regime.</li>
            <li> I have hairloss and a Keto shampoo is a must in my routine and I have always used nizoral but it&#x27;s way to harsh to use more than twice a week so I needed an everyday keto shampoo so I tried regenpure and it was to harsh also so everybody on hair loss site told me try the big 3, it&#x27;s perfect cleans has keto and not harsh with emu oil. Lots of other beneficial ingredients</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 2 years and I must say.. It works wonders!!  Will it regrow hair? Maybe..  Will it slow down hair loss and keep your scalp happy? Most definitely!!  I had used Nizoral previously, and it worked..  But it dried the hell out of my hair and scalp..  The big 3 is very gentle and does not dry out my hair as bad..  It also lasts forever, about six months for me.. I use it everyday, mix a lil bit with some cheap baby shampoo to stretch out The big 3..  I also have a tendency to go out drinking a couple times a week, and about 90% of the time, the following day my scalp hurts like hell, I don&#x27;t know why..  But this shampoo gets rid of that annoying scalp pain!! Within minutes of use..  So,  if you&#x27;re looking looking for a little scalp relief.. Buy this shiz! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Used it for two months and already notice an improvement. Hair if fuller.  Prior to using this product, I had noticed thinning on front of hairline above forehead.  Hair looks healthier and thicker after using this product and I expect it to improve each month I continue. So glad to of found this product.</li>
            <li> I have been losing my hair for awhile now.  This will slow it down, but I can&#x27;t say it stops it.  I do think it is worth the purchase especially if you are in a panic about hair loss.  It does help.  Very mild ingredients.</li>
            <li> I started my hair loss regimen (minoxidil and finasteride) about 10 years ago as a way to preempt any hair loss, and as the years ticked on, I had been very happy with my results. Full head of hair despite a strong genetic predisposition toward it. I&#x27;d been wanting to supplement my treatment with a shampoo. I researched a number of products designed to counter hair loss. My criteria were: a) a shampoo that contained clinically proven ingredients that combat DHT and stimulate hair regrowth, and b) a shampoo that actually worked like a quality shampoo (volumized hair, smelled nice, foamed up, etc.). A number of shampoos were recommended, which I tried, but it was this Lipogaine brand and formula that were consistently referenced by many experienced guys in the same boat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combined with a regimen of other products I use, this shampoo has all the qualities of a nice shampoo, and I&#x27;ve been using it for about two years. Every guy is different, and I can&#x27;t speak for men who are at a more advanced stage of hair loss, or who tried combatting hair loss much later than I chose to, so again, I&#x27;m mainly speaking as a guy who, with a full head of hair, chose to preempt the loss. The process ain&#x27;t broke, so until something better comes along, this is the gold standard I&#x27;m sticking to. Use it as directed, and I strongly recommend pairing it with a daily treatment of minoxidil and finasteride (doctor prescribed for the latter). Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I have been using Lipogaine shampoo for 2 months to combat a somewhat receding and thinning hairline. I decided to combine it with the Lipogaine serum and have been using this for 3 weeks. The shampoo has helped to slow hair loss and also makes my hair appear fuller and thicker. 3 weeks is really too soon to be sure the serum is working, however it does appear to be stimulating new hair growth already. I&#x27;ll be continuing to use both the shampoo and serum as I&#x27;m not ready to be bald yet! I feel like they are working for me and expect to see more hair regrowth in the coming months.I also like the fact that the shampoo already has conditioner included, which save me a little time in the morning. My wife is making fun of me for using these products, however I really don&#x27;t care and am glad I did not wait any longer.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo for a couple of years now and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results! It has a nice light mint smell to it , it lathers up really nicely and it leaves my hair very clean and soft, but not dried out at  like a lot of the other hair loss shampoos do. It&#x27;s well worth every penny. You only need to use a tiny amount every time, so each bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this really works as intended. it doesnt grow hair, but it does add volume, shine, and stability. It seems like a quality product, and I have ordered it numerous times and will continue to order it for six months, which is how long doctors recommend you use a hair product before judging the results. I dont see any regrowth, if anything i see some shed, but again, not able to fully, absolutely judge results at this moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;follow up: months later&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont think this product is really effective at treating hair loss or helping to promote a climate that engages hair growth. I have seen more shedding, which i thought was because of the new product, but given the time frame i am hesitating to recommend this one. too much shedding for too long.</li>
            <li> My search for a shampoo that did not have chemicals in it as well as was god for my hair ended with lipogaine.Used Nizoral before which was good for dandruff but was too harsh for my scalp, this has been equally good at the same time soft for my scalp without any side effects. It is a bit expensive but definitely worth it, I have noticed that I have less hair fall and absolutely no dandruff.It smells ok and lathers nice, never had to use any other shampoo after using this once. Good Product to try if you have hair loss, seems to be one of the best available at a great price from amazon.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has really worked to thicken my hair and to stop excessive shedding.</li>
            <li> Just starting using this for about 2 weeks now. It really makes your hair look full and the scalp is cleaner than when using other shampoos. I had problems with hard grainy sandlike balls on my scalp which where hardened oil balls. After using this product I sure see a difference. Whether it will help grow hair is yet to be seen, but my scalp is very much cleaner and hair is fuller looking. I use no conditioner with this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and use it daily. My hair is oily and lipogaine makes it feel healthy. I can&#x27;t confirm on how much hair loss prevention it does to my hair, but compare to other hair loss shampoo out there, it is one of the best</li>
            <li> This shampoo cleaning your hair extremely well, I gave it 3 stars because it tangles your hair so bad, it&#x27;s really hard to comb through. I didnt notice any regrowth or less shedding.</li>
            <li> I bought twice of this product. Actually I have been using it for about 41 days till now. My hair loss is a little severe which I think it&#x27;s from the gene and lack of some particular elements. After using this shampoo more than one month, it seems start to work a little. Hair dropping is much less. I even found some small new hair sprouts on my head. Yes, I also apply the 3 in 1 Lipogaine intensive treatment fluid after washing my hair. Maybe this set works to me. I will continue my treatment to see what will happen after 3 months.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure how effective this product is but it does make my hair feel thicker after use. Smells good and initially leaves a nice tingly sensation on the scalp. For now I&#x27;d buy again, may update in the future.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend. Too costly and I didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> I have always had fairly thin, fine hair, but due to a rare condition of my airway I have had numerous surgeries over the past 12 years.  The repeated anesthesia had made my hair even thinner than before.  Since using this shampoo, people ask me how I got my hair to thicken up so much.  This shampoo really does work!!</li>
            <li> I was having a flakey itchy scalp and I tried all sorts of dry scalp shampoo&#x27;s and none of them worked. I ended up going to a dermatologist and he prescribed me some Ketoconazole 2% shampoo and it did the trick, problem is that its super expensive. So I looked around on amazon with Ketoconazole as my look up and came up with this shampoo, so I decided to give it a shot.. a lot cheaper. Worked like a champ, going to be ordering my 3rd bottle here soon.</li>
            <li> Great product and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> While Lipogaine has not regrown any hair for me, it definitely thickens what hair does remain on my scalp while removing dandruff and flakes (a problem with me since childhood). My scalp feels great after use and it is the only shampoo that I can use every other day that caters to a combination dry and oil scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it more ketoconazole as that is the only proven ingredient to remove DHT only at a 2% concentration (vs 1% as currently formulated).</li>
            <li> My wife and I both use this shampoo. We use it 1-2Xs per week and use a regular shampoo other days. I have really short hair so it&#x27;s harder for me to tell if it&#x27;s working based on any evidence while I&#x27;m shampooing. For my wife, it appears to limit the amount of hair that comes out while washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s worth trying. We will update when we go through our second bottle.</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels fuller, I recommend this product to anyone with thinning hair that wants a fuller look.</li>
            <li> I started using ketoconazole shampoos to address some hair loss.  The degree of hair loss does seem to have leveled off since switching to this kind of shampoo.  I started off with another brand but it didn&#x27;t lather up as well.  They aren&#x27;t cheap, but at least I don&#x27;t have to wash as often with this type of shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo regularly for six months now. I can honestly say that it is a great product! I use it about 3 times a week and I have noticed a significant difference in the amount of hair loss I experience. simply put, there are less hairs in my shower drain, on my pillow, and in my comb! It is a bit expensive, but trust me its worth it if you are experiencing moderate hair loss.</li>
            <li> Works great. I recommend using it. I also take Hair, Nails and skin supplements.</li>
            <li> After my satisfactory experience with Lipogaine, I tried this shampoo and it has been great. Smells great, cleans your scalp thoroughly and works great with Lipogaine. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The shampoo works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may experience some shedding in the beginning, however this is natural for any hair loss product, especially ketoconazole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with biotin, you experience some shedding as the hair grows faster and thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stuff is not expensive. It lasted me about 5-6 months just from one bottle. That&#x27;s less than $5/month on shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Revita but I dropped it after they changed the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff will prevent hair loss, make your hair thick, and regrow some of your hair. It won&#x27;t make a bald person full headed of course. But if you see yourself starting to bald, you can stop the process and reverse it slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it once a day. Usually before I go out as it makes my hair thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve just recently run out and I can already start noticing effects of 1 week of non-use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With any hair care solution, you simply have to keep on using it. That&#x27;s it. It works.</li>
            <li> So far, this seems to be as advertised.  I appreciate all of the Lipogaine products, and plan to continue using these.  It seems to be doing what it states, and it is a fine shampoo to boot!  Price seems fair to cheap compared to other products that state they do the same thing.  I will continue to update this review if anything changes, going forward.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has extra ingredients that normal volume shampoos don&#x27;t have.  I have used it for about 5 years now (once in the morning every two days), and while I&#x27;m not super obsessive about recording its effectiveness and my hair loss in general, I noticed fewer hairs in the drain.  I would consider this a secondary treatment to Minoxidil however, which is what you want to use for male hairloss at the bare minimum.  I also don&#x27;t use styling products, and this shampoo leaves my hair in a nice thick state that I can comb into something that looks acceptable.  Note that this product just slowed my hairloss... I&#x27;m getting pretty sparse on top after about 9 years of thinning, but not so much that I&#x27;m willing to shave clean.  In addition, I liked that the label peels off of the bottle easily, so people aren&#x27;t scoping my hairloss products in the shower when they go in my bathroom.  That&#x27;s just a quirk of mine, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dinged it a star because they don&#x27;t offer a larger volume at a less expensive rate. I&#x27;d buy that for sure over this relatively small bottle.</li>
            <li> I started to use this the same date I started with Lipogaine, using it each two days like this: Monday, Thursday, Sunday, Wednesdar, Saturday, Tuesday, Friday, Monday.  The smell is really pleasant and it does fresh your hair. I also had dandruff and this shampoo also helped me with that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it 3 hours before/after you apply Lipogaine and that should be it, you will notice how clean your hair feels and also it does help you hair to grow shinner and stronger. I highly recommend this along with Lipogaine. I have been using both for 6 months and my hair is back, so happy and look younger.</li>
            <li> Great product-- I used to use Nizoral 1%, which smelled bad and often left my scalp dry.  This product leaves my hair and scalp moisturized and it smells great (like peppermint) and seems to be effective in combating hair loss.</li>
            <li> In addition to the fairly well-established hair-loss prevention attributes of the ingredients, this is just altogether a really nice shampoo.  I use the shampoo more often than the generally suggested frequency and have had no problems with dry scalp or hair or itching. After shampooing, my scalp feels clean and fresh.  I feel this shampoo plays a significant role in my overall hair loss prevention regimen.  It&#x27;s worth the cost and the bottle lasts quite a long time, even with daily application (and 2-3 times a week is the suggested frequesny of usage).</li>
            <li> I was losing my hair on the top of my head due to epidural steroid injections after a car accident. One day it really scared me because i was really losing so much hair and I had never had this happen. I ordered my first bottle in March and used it exclusively.....I just ordered my second bottle because my hair is growing back now and pretty rapidly...I am thrilled with the results, also I am not losing any....it is worth a try. My hair started growing from the back first...and In just 3 months, I can now look in the mirror and see a huge difference, I only have a small area in the front, about the size of a quarter. I can now use a color spray on that area and you can&#x27;t even tell. Another thing that happened is that my eyebrows are growing back in....it has worked wonders for me:)</li>
            <li> great shampoo, clean and effective ingredients. Some quality control issues in the past, had one batch where it was visibly thinner than previous orders, seems to have corrected this issue with latest batch. Very happy. I use it in conjunction with Lipogaine for men, and my hair is fuller, stronger for sure.</li>
            <li> Has definitely helped slow my hair loss when combined with the Lipogaine topical solution.  Must use 3 times per week as recommended.  Pleasant smell and leaves your hair feeling very clean.  Make sure to leave the shampoo in your hair for a few minutes.  Shipping is pretty quick.  Overall good product.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo! makes my scalp feel clean and takes away dry scalp.In 2 months of use my hair loss has stopped! looking forward to see new hair grow back in!</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo with a lot of good ingredients for helping block DHT and promote hair growth. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple months and it does seem to help while using Lipogaine minoxodil (which is great!) along with it. I am also using Nizoral shampoo and emu oil. Worth a shot! Good luck!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a little pricey, but I have found a bottle will last me six months.  It has a peppermint aroma and stimulates the scalps.  It complements Rogaine for fullness with thinning hair.  Shipping time was more than reasonable.</li>
            <li> It is perfect to use the kit compleate, pills, spray and shampoo, works great and i use it 2 times a week</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shampoo that can help combat hair loss. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair flat and lifeless like a lot of other hair loss shampoos.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping!  I researched a lot before buying. I&#x27;ve been using for a couple of months now.  I have alopecia areata and 100% of the time it grows back; however this time it was months and there was nothing growing back.  So here&#x27;s the conclusion:  hair on other parts of my head started growing that I had not noticed were missing. I guess you could say random hair came in that made my hair thicker.  The hair in my larger bald spot from the alopecia started coming in about two weeks after I started using this. I&#x27;m not sure if it was coincidence or not, but either way, I&#x27;m sure there were a few factors, including the use of this shampoo that gave me the results I have.  I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li> My son has used this product for a couple years now, and he says it really works well in leaving his scalp feeling clean! And it smells great! Just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes...</li>
            <li> Take this 4-star review as a possible 5- it seems to be a good product with quality ingredients- I would definitely recommend it over traditional ketoconazole shampoos like Nizoral, which seems to have more irritating ingredients and not feel as nice on the scalp.  I am not a serious hair-loss sufferer, and use this in combo with other products- perhaps a more serious hair-loss sufferer using would see even greater results than I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 29 and have been using the traditional &amp;#34;Big 3&amp;#34; (finasteride, minoxidil, ketoconazole shampoo) for the last 18 months- I noticed thinning up front, particularly on my left temple, and began fin shortly before my 28th birthday, then soon followed by minoxidil, then finally, the keto shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say for sure just how much the Big 3 shampoo has helped on its own, since I use it in combination with other products; with that said, I am not stopping anytime soon, as it is a nice tool in the fight against hairloss.  I also use Lipogaine minoxidil at night, and regular off-label minoxidil in the morning (dries faster before work), and between the 3, not only have I restored my receding temple about 75%, but I also even have a few baby hairs growing back where my juvenile hairline used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the products at this point, overall, to maintain, and can only hope for continued regrowth; while I do not suffer from serious balding at all by any means, the key to stopping and reversing male hairloss is to catch it early, and attack it with the right products NOW- the longer you wait, the more hair you will lose that you can never get back; in regards to being the RIGHT product, Lipogaine Big 3 is THE keto shampoo of choice for me; it may be $25, but a little goes a long way!  I have hair past my shoulders and use the product 2x / week, and one bottle lasts a good 6 months; a more than fair price to pay to maintain and thicken your hair!  Again, this product may be worthy of a 5-star review, butI can&#x27;t really say if I&#x27;m getting 5-star results, since I&#x27;m not seriously balding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also highly recommend any hair-loss sufferers to check out the Lipogaine Hair Restoration product (minoxidil)- I definitely feel that it works better than the standard drugstore minoxidils like Rogaine (Lipogaine has more supposed DHT-blocking products...check out &#x27;Azetinol&#x27;).</li>
            <li> works well will likely order again.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair feel thicker and more dense. Smells good and lasts a long time. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over a year now, and I am very happy with the results. My hair was thinning and falling, and I read a lot of reviews with other products and this one had a lot of success reviews. After about 6 months I noticed my hair thickening up (I also have been using Lipogaine&#x27;s &amp;#34;Lipogaine for Men: Intensive Treatment &amp; Complete Solution for Hair Loss&amp;#34;) and the results are slowly but surely showing. I went to get my haircut a month or so back and the lady cutting my hair actually wanted to use &amp;#34;Thinning Scissors&amp;#34; on my hair cause she said it was thick. I told her to do no such thing, that the thickness stayed! Was a nice feeling to have a bit of my identity and dignity returned to me. I now find myself wearing my ball cap less and less.</li>
            <li> I recently started using the Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo along with the Lipogaine minoxidil liquid. I&#x27;ll use the shampoo, alternated with other shampoos, about 3 times a week. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed that my hair feels fuller when I do use it. The smell is good and I&#x27;ve noticed that I only lose a hair or two each shower, but I&#x27;m unsure if that is the shampoo helping or the minoxidil, which I apply at night. Overall, I would recommend this product and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Biotin and ketonconazole: two of the most effective ingredients to slow down the progression of hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it does not work overnight (no product does), it is both a solid and effective product.  Five stars.</li>
            <li> Tried this shampoo out, it turned out to be better than I expected.....I have dry hair and this shampoo seemed to make my hair more manageable and fuller than other shampoo&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried. I also noticed it started working on my dandruff and itchy scalp...probably because of the ketoconazole. I also notice less hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this shampoo as a great volumizer and a DHT blocker. The main active ingredient is the ketoconazole which acts as a DHT blocker. I recommend doing a semi-wash everyday instead of a full wash every 2 or 3 days.</li>
            <li> Nice clean scent and refreshing a little bit goes a long way.So it will last a long time and worth money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 6 months, along with a variety of other products, including Lipogaine Intensive treatment. Its been working amazing well and I encourage for people to do their independent research before starting the product. I did and there is a lot of good feedback on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the shampoo, I would recommend using a cheaper shampoo, like baby shampoo, or anything sulfate free before using Lipogaine to get the full effect of it. The cheaper shampoo would take away any hair products you would be wearing and make Lipogaine more effective. If you can afford it and the bottle says it too, just wash your hair twice with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s defiantly become a staple for me!</li>
            <li> DID NOT MAKE A DIFFERENCE!!  WILL NOT BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> Using in conjunction with the lipogaine minoxidil.  Seems like it might be slowing down my thinning.  Also love the feel and smell of this shampoo!  Optimistic about continuing use.</li>
            <li> The best of the bunch so far, a very good and quality product!! Of all the hair loss shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried, this product seems to have all the best ingredients that one looks for in the hair loss shampoo genre, it also lathers up extremely well while only having to use a small amount of the product, and best of all it actually leaves the hair looking good without weighing it down like some of the other hair loss shampoos on the market. Better than advertised and very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love it, nicely scented and does not irritate the scalp like other similar products. As as HUGE bonus I also seem to be loosing less hairs since I started using it. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I have a full set of hair, but after using this shampoo I went from loosing some 50 hairs in the shower to 15 or so. Definitely big thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> Works well.  Some regrowth after 6 months along with Minox and Fin.  Noticed shed when discontinued so went back on and shed was gone.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Big 3 shampoo in combination with Lipogain[[ASIN:B00CBI31SM Lipogaine for Men, Premium Minoxidil Hair Loss/ Hair Regrowth Stimulting Solution, 3 Month Supply]]. I have not noticed any growth of new hair, but it has definitely slowed down the thinning. I have observed no side-effects, therefore I am happy to recommend it for hair loss prevention.</li>
            <li> I am only on my second month of using this product but I have to say my hair feels great and there is also some new growth. Some of the shampoos I have used leaves my hair feeling heavy and not very clean, not this product though. I would recommend this shampoo and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product , its worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying the shampoo now for about 2 months. I use it in conjunction with the Lipogain for Men with Minoxidil. I can honestly say that I have noticed hair regrowth after about 4 weeks of use. Its not a ton, but it is noticeable. I think the shampoo is pretty good. It has a great peppermint like smell which is very light and refreshing. The shampoo lathers very well and you can feel it working on your scalp.  My only negative is that it leaves my hair feeling somewhat hard. But you know what, if it keeps my hair growing its a small price that i&#x27;m willing to pay. I say check it out and see if you like it.</li>
            <li> I use this product every other day in conjunction with Minoxidil. I love this shampoo! Lipogaine all the way! Will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo along with Rogaine foam and my hair is virtually unchanged since stopping my Propecia intake due to side effects. I would say this cocktail is 85% as effective as Finasteride and I have no ill effects. I use the shampoo every other day and the Minoxidil once a day (applied liberally), leaving the shampoo on my scalp for five minutes. This system has served me well for 2 1/2 years. On off days I use a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner. I would recommend trying these products and to stay consistent. It does work for most people.</li>
            <li> very good shampoo. i been using it for over 2 years now my hair stop falling. it has a lot of good ingredients which help to regrow and stop the hair falling. been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better hair loss shampoo, my hair feels and even looks fuller, after one bottle I definitely noticed some baby hairs start to grow back on my receding hairline and the hair that&#x27;s not part of your receding hair will grow like bamboo, if you think it&#x27;s costly it&#x27;s really not because you only need a small amount and 3 times per week, so one bottle last a long time and the results are priceless, the shampoo also works well with the lipongaine drops, with the combination you&#x27;ll get results even quicker!! Much better than rogaine, also has a nice scent!!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of the Lipogaine andI can definitely say I have seen some small hairs sprouting where they had stopped coming through before. The shampoo is great.</li>
            <li> Great product! It&#x60;s keeping my scalp clean and repaired my hair after 6 months in use. I recommend.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo on the market if you are experiencing hair loss. I&#x27;m 47 yrs old and have been using this shampoo in conjunction with the hair treatment and the results have been just short of amazing. It has totally stopped my hair loss and I definitely see more dense hair regrowing. Hair is also soft and very manageable, no conditioner needed.</li>
            <li> I found that the shampoo improved my hairline and hair thickness. It has greatly boosted my self confidence and sex life.</li>
            <li> Lots of natural ingredients. Great shampoo for preventing hair loss. I noticed improvement after 2 months using it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair feel great. I see less shedding and itching on the head. I would recommend for anyone who wants to not grow but slow down whatever hair loss you have.</li>
            <li> I was interested in this shampoo because I seen that it fights hair loss.I have noticed that my hair has been thinning out lately and I felt like this product would help me to both thicken up and regrow more hair for a fuller look.This shampoo has a tea tree oil smell that is very soothing and after using it awhile I noticed it does indeed make my hair fuller and I&#x27;ve been really happy with the results from it.The big 3 in the name is for Combating hair loss,thinning and dermatologist recommended.If you are looking for something to help regrow hair but don&#x27;t want to pay the outrageous price of competitors then you&#x27;re gonna want this shampoo.It&#x27;s a great product that works at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for purpose of review,all views and claims are 100 percent my own.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now, and I can say it really works. I have been seeing significantly less hair fall. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a product to slow hair fall.</li>
            <li> My scalp is really sensitive, and my hairs are naturally thin I think this shampoo is the Best Shampoo ever used. I don&#x27;t usually trust these anti-hair loss shampoo theories, but I have been using this shampoo for the past 6 months, and I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Although the shampoo looks a little expensive, I think it is worth buying.</li>
            <li> Product is great.  Excellent and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the shampoo and it is effective. He originally used this in addition to the lipogaine minoxidil tx but his scalp began breaking out and weeping. Seems the shampoo formula has stayed the same since he began using it but their lipogaine minoxidil formula changed. My husband has more hair as a result of this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since Aug. 2014. I can say I have noticed much thicker hair and my fair follicles towards my crown are thicker and seem to be more healthy. After proper use I notice that my scalp feels &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; and even has a slight tingling sensation. Make sure you follow the instructions and wash your hair twice with it. I sometimes use Nizoral for the first wash then use this product for the 2nd wash. I also use the Lipogaine Hair Regrowth product in addition to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with this product, my hair is thicker and I have even recently had a compliment from a hair stylist saying how much hair I have, which is flattering considering I am losing my hair.</li>
            <li> Started using this product about 3 months and started to notice definite thickening especially in the front and back. I use this 3 times a day and in combination with the intensive treatment solution. Ive notice a few small hairs start to grow so I am happy. With regards to my hair thinning it has just started so Im definitely starting early, I decided to start using this after noticing a little more scalp in the back in photos. Will update after a few more months as I think you should really give it 6 months to work. It won&#x27;t work overnight or even after a month but given some time I have noticed some thickening.</li>
            <li> I bought generic minoxidil to start and used it once.  Then bought Lipogaine minoxidil and used it once.  This was in a couple days of each other.  Finally, used Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo couple days later (once).  Head felt really clean, but within 10 minutes my whole body was itching terribly and still going on after 10 days of no continued use.  Had other side effects too such as episode of ed (scary), tight chest, breathing difficulty, blurred vision.  Itch rash still ongoing.  My skin (particularly my head) feels oily now where before I had dry hair/scalp.  This oil (whatever it is) is a severe irritant to my system.  May be the nettle oil I don&#x27;t know.  Poison oak/ivy soap helped to relieve some of the discomfort.  Very painful and uncomfortable and I&#x27;m scratching myself raw.  I have since discontinued use of such topical treatments and am going with natural supplements and washing my hair with combo of shampoo and apple cider vinegar.  I&#x27;m using \\&quot;Hair Essentials\\&quot; along with \\&quot;B Stress\\&quot; complex and a couple others and a lot of prayer! which has all but stopped the hair loss anyway.</li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo within the last year or so. So far I have been very happy with it. The scent is nice and it lathers much easier than other hair loss shampoos I have used before. I have been using the Lipogaine topical solution for about three years and have not noticed any progression of my hair loss in that time frame. I have actually seen a big difference in the overall thickness and feel of my hair since starting with Lipogaine. I am only a 2 on the NW hair loss chart and with the aid of Lipogaine products I hope to stay that way for a while. Very happy with my results and plan to continue using this product!</li>
            <li> The smell of peppermint is a nice touch and it lathers up very nicly in wet hair. I feel a lot better about my hair after i use this compared to a normal shampoo. I am using both lipogaine products and have got some pretty good results even with my inconsistant applications! I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li> Good product! Lathers and cleans really well with no build-up. Makes hair feel thicker and slows down shedding. Too early to say if it impacts hair-loss or promotes re-growth. Recommend.</li>
            <li> I have ordered and re-ordered this product as it does what it says. My hair stylist noticed that my hair has been growing around an inch per month since I started using this product, and it noticeably makes the hair feel thicker. It also helps to make the hair less frizzy, which can be an issue since I have thin hair. Will keep buying :)</li>
            <li> It lasts long and it even helped me grow hair in on the patchy parts of my beard! Use it Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday each week for best outcome.</li>
            <li> I was a huge promoter of this product when i first bought in 2011 it did everything it was suppose as of late i wondering why i was sheeding so much hair come to find out today that it longer has azelaic acid a key DHT blocker . Dont waste your money product now sucks.</li>
            <li> I have been slowly thinning in the front since my early 30&#x27;s (I&#x27;m 38 now) and was looking for a way to combat it. During my research I came across this product about 13 months ago. The reviews were mostly very positive, so I figured for the price it was worth giving it a shot. I was not looking to sprout tons of new hair or anything like that, but just to try and keep what I have as long as I can. I also wanted to wait before writing a review because you have to give hair loss products time to work.  I have not been using this shampoo for a little over 12 months now and I can happily say that it has done what I was hoping it would do, which is help me keep what I have. I have no noticeable hair loss in the last year, and in fact, my hair actually looks and feels thicker. I&#x27;m not sure if I have actually grown new hair or the shampoo has just made it look thicker, but I do know it looks better.  I got a haircut this morning and my stylist of 6 years told me that my hair looks and feels thicker than it has in several years, and that my scalp looks very healthy now. I use this every 2-3 days and leave it in 5-7 minutes while I shower. It lathers up very well, so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot but you must make sure you massage it in very good as it needs to get in the hair follicles to be effective. I will update this review if anything changes for the positive or negative, but for now I&#x27;m very happy with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Less hair loss, and appear stronger, and dandruff never returned after using the product after just a week. Leaves hair manageable.</li>
            <li> I really have nothing to fault with this product. It has lead to a healthier scalp and, used in conjunction with the Lipogaine topical solution, has resulted in thicker hair and new hair growth. To manage expectations, the improvement has not resulted in a full head of hair, but it did reverse the hair loss process. The shampoo is on the pricey side, but I find the solution to be very efficient and it lasts at least two months. I use three times per week, and shampoo and rinse twice. It would be an effective product for an irritated scalp without the hair growth component, but addressing both is a win-win. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> This does really work. I&#x27;ve tried other products that did work some but I think overall this is the best. It works even without other treatments needed but I recommend other prescriptions and creams to assist with the shampoo. However this is a must have.</li>
            <li> I had pretty rapid hair loss and tried MANY things, including Rogaine.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of rubbing chemicals on my head, so gave that up.  Decided to give this a try and I&#x27;m sold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m growing new hair, the loss has certainly slowed or even stopped.  This shampoo has me a believer!  I only wish it had caffeine as an ingredient as well, then it would truly have it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo really lathers well and you use it 2-3 times a week, so 1 bottle should last 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> feels great! smells great! It goes along way and my scalp feels fresh afterwards. Hopefully it helps with my receding hair like it&#x27;s supposed too!</li>
            <li> Like much better than Nizoral, no sulfates and seems to be quite effective. Smells really nice too, like mint, and doesn&#x27;t seem to be drying to the hair. I have been shampooing with Lipogaine about twice a week and using minoxidil twice daily ever since my hair started thinning (runs through all the women on one side of my family, its like a genetic switch went off) and my hair is nearly back to the thick, curly mop I&#x27;ve had my whole life. I&#x27;m not sure how much of that result is from each product, but I do like this shampoo a lot either way, my hair is also color-treated so I never use sulfates. Also I don&#x27;t like shampoo that gets too frothy. Did I mention the smell? :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for a while and really like it. I use it every other day and it makes your hair feel pretty good and the bit I&#x27;ve read about the product shows science supports that it actually does promote hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t give it a 5 stars because it&#x27;s a bit expensive and it&#x27;s impossible to tell how well this product specifically is working for hair loss prevention. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s Rogaine or if my hair just naturally stopped thinning, but between Rogaine and this I haven&#x27;t lost any hair. I&#x27;d definitely recommend giving this product a go if you&#x27;re concerned with hair loss and can afford to drop $25 every other month or so.</li>
            <li> Still on my first bottle, I use it 3 times a week and my hair has stopped falling out. This little bottle goes a long way so don&#x27;t let the price scare you off. A little bit lathers up very nice...Just wish they left the menthol out of it, the tingle I get from it doesn&#x27;t make me &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; its working...Just makes me know I have menthol on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Lipogaine is a trusted brand when comes to hair loss, so i decided to give this shampoo a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a good smell, a good lather, its sulfate free and most importantly it has ketonconazole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ketonconazole has been shown to have some great effects in slowing down hair loss in some, it wont work alone but this shampoo plus minoxidil seems to do the trick. I prefer Lipogaine&#x27;s minoxidil as it seems to have no odor and dry faster than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All arund great shampoo.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say whether the shampoo is slowing down my hair loss for sure but I feel like it is. What I can be sure of is that it leaves my hair feeling clean and  non greasy. It isn&#x27;t difficult to take advantage of the advertised benefits. You need to have the shampoo on your hair for 3 minutes for it to do what it&#x27;s supposed to do. The way I see it is I need a shampoo anyway. This product lasts me at least 4 months and if you are losing your hair, any extra help is worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this shampoo and can say that overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. My hair has been thinning since I was 18 and I am now 28. I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of products to help combat my hair loss and I think this is one of the better ones. It is not a miracle shampoo, but it does make my hair feel healthy and I do think it has helped maintain the hair I have. I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant regrowth but I&#x27;m optimistic. I have also used their minoxidil product before and am going to try it again. Overall would recommend this for anyone combatting thinning hair!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo every day because I love how soft it makes my hair.  The directions say to use at least two to three times a week.  Well, I have a couple bald spots on the sides of my head from hair extensions and my hair grows super slow and I need the extra help.  It is too early to see any hair growth but, I love the formula of this shampoo.  Even if you do not have hair loss I recommend this shampoo for a dry scalp.  I do not need to use conditioner afterwards.  Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Sample Provided.</li>
            <li> A very good and quality product. I see an improvement to my hair. My hair is thicken up. It&#x27;s stronger and healthier. I am happy with the product , its worth the money.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and advertised. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s growing hair back but it does seem to be thickening my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect shampoo for my normal hair, it doesn&#x27;t dry up my hair and stay in same condition all day. It smells great and I will definitely keep using this shampoo and nothing else.</li>
            <li> Been using Lipogaine for 2 years now. Works great and will continue to purchase. great product</li>
            <li> This product definitely cleans my hair and scalp very well. I have noticed a thickening of hair, and continue to order this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo. It really works. I use it in conjuction with Rogaine and a laser comb. I have had a dramatic increase of hair in the frontal hairline.  Many of my friends have told me that there is an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers up nicely with only a small amount of shampoo per application.  One bottle last me almost 2 months since I  use it only every other day. It cleans my hair well and leaves it looking  thicker, softer and very mangable. It&#x27;s a really good shampoo. If your experiencing hair loss and are using Rogaine, this is a must.</li>
            <li> My hair was jumping off like rats on a sinking ship. it was terrifying how suddenly hair loss hit me. I was stupid and delayed treatment hoping it would just go away, like a sore leg. Tried rogaine but discovered that any benefit I get from it would go away if I stopped using it. I looked at all these shampoos thinking that it was a desperate attempt to save my cowardly hair and it looks like all the brands that used to work, changed their formula and looked like a waste of time. So I tried this big 3 shampoo and a biotin conditioner that I mixed in some rosemary oil with. the biotin and rosemary are supposed to be great foods for your hair. I started this routine several months ago and I noticed a difference pretty quickly. I&#x27;m not sure that I can say I&#x27;m regrowing hair but the desertion seems to have halted and my forehead and hairline are at a stalemate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t delay guys. as soon as you see your hair thinning or think it might be, do something about it. clean out that DHT with this shampoo or something else you can find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Lipogaine Big 3 Premium shampoo for 2 months now. It gives my fine hair more body and helps it dry thicker, I&#x27;ve been happy with it and ordered 2 more bottles after my initial order. It makes my hair a little dry, so occasionally I use some conditioner with it. Will be reordering it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo for a few months and while I have not seen any hair regrowth, the rate of hair fallout has been reduced tremendously. I was losing hair rapidly and that has all but stopped. I am still hoping for some regrowth and will continue to use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair feel great and I have noticed a lot less shedding since using it!</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo. I use it every morning.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I haven&#x27;t measured or anything, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that my hair is noticeably fuller. Pricy, but it works.</li>
            <li> After using Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo, I am pleasantly surprised!  I was looking for a sulfate-free shampoo with ketoconazole, but have been very disappointed by others I have tried, because they made my hair dry and tangled.  The Lipogaine lathered well and gently cleaned my hair.  You only need a small amount, so this bottle should last a long time. It also left my hair feeling soft and well conditioned.  I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> Works well, I don&#x27;t know that my hair has regrown, but it does feel thicker and I can tell I have less shedding</li>
            <li> When It comes to shampoo for hair-loss you got to set your expectations somewhat low.  A shampoo alone can only get people so far.  This is my second swing at the keto-shampoo and I have to say I love it.  I initially tried RegenePure Dr. and for the first 2 weeks I was astonished of how immediate my results of better feeling hair and reduced shedding was.  However, after prolonged use, It started to affect my scalp negatively.  I did transition from sulfate/paraben shampoo to RegenePure so that might have been why those 2 weeks were so great.  I had to switch to every other day and it still had loads of shedding and dried my scalp.  I thought if I purchased NT and used that alongside it would help.  However I found the NT to be a total waste of money and I became discouraged with the whole keto-shampoo buzz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I&#x27;ve been looking for shampoos to give that 2 week feeling I had with RegenPure.  I&#x27;ve had shampoos that would come close, but their performance deteriorated overtime.  After losing a bit more hair I decided to try to incorporate keto again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few on amazon, but I didn&#x27;t want a shampoo with 1000 ingredients, nor did I want a shampoo with &amp;#34;fragrence&amp;#34;, dyes, or a boatload of random chemical names (RegenePure suprisingly had a lot of extra additives and chemicals that did not look appealing).  I chose Lipogaine because it has a strong list of limited ingredients.  They are ones that I feel safe using for my extra sensitive scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, It has been a few days and I&#x27;m really liking the feeling it gives me when I step out of the shower.  My hair is not stripped, any itchiness is calmed, and my scalp feel refreshed.  I hope this continues past the 2 week period.  I&#x27;m trying to find another shampoo to rotate it with every other day as well.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for 3 weeks and during that time I started to lose my hair even more. I would run my fingers across the top of my scalp and boom... more hair kept falling off. So far its been almost 2 months since I stopped using this shampoo and my hair shedding has stopped. I don&#x27;t post to many reviews but after having to go through what this product did to me, I felt I needed to speak out. But if you don&#x27;t believe me? Then go ahead and buy it....just don&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t warn you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using this shampoo for close to 6 months.  I can say that it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo smells great, its thick, and does lather well, especially on the second application.&lt;br /&gt;I use it 3 times a week, and I do noticed that it helps hair loss.  My hair are fuller, and I feel great.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shampoo! This is definitely one of the better shampoo on the market. I usually rotate between Lipogaine and Regenepure and I strongly recommend this to anyone who wants to prevent hair loss.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with minoxodil topical and finasteride daily with great results</li>
            <li> I was in the early stages of losing hair and freaking out about it. One day I realized that the top of my head was thinning out big time, and if it got wet or sweaty in the gym or something, it was even worse. You could see right to my scalp. And then there was the receding hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given some recommendations that turned out to be crap, but then a friend who&#x27;s been through all of this told me about ketoconazole. At first, I didn&#x27;t go for it because I assumed it was Rx only (he got it from his doctor). But once I looked into it, I found out that even non-Rx levels of the ingredient were just about as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months and have purchased more than one bottle because it is definitely doing its job. I generally wash my hair with a bit of normal shampoo, rinse it out, and then work Lipogaine in immediately after. I let it lather and sit for the rest of the shower, perhaps 2-5 minutes. Contrary to the directions, I use this almost every day. In addition to this, I use a topical minoxidil product all over the top of my head twice a day. With both products, I make sure that the product covers areas up front and on the sides that are mostly bare, not just the areas that still have hair. How else can you expect to regrow in areas where you&#x27;ve lost a bunch of hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the last 6 months I have definitely seen the hair loss come to a complete halt and all kinds of new growth. Hair is much thicker on top, absolutely no scalp showing. This has also allowed for the growth of new hair along my formerly receding hairline, particularly in the side areas that create the old &amp;#34;widow&#x27;s peak&amp;#34; that so many men get in the early stages of losing it all. At this point it seems very reasonable to expect it will be back to 90-100% of what it used to be, perhaps with another 6 months. And that&#x27;s hair I lost years ago before it started all falling out. Honestly one side is already back to 90%, but the other side is more stubborn. Anyway, this product has been a big part of making that happen, and generally improving the whole situation. When focusing on the hairline (because that&#x27;s what you see in the mirror), it&#x27;s easy to ignore how much you&#x27;re losing up top so this stuff will keep it in line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. Also smells great, which is not what I was expecting out of a &#x27;medicine&#x27;-like product. I&#x27;ll be re-buying this probably for years to come (until they discover a cure, fingers crossed).</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the way my hair looks and feels since using Lipogaine Big 3 and the peppermint oil cools my scalp.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes about this shampoo after reading the reviews; it seemed like it would be less drying than the Nizoral. This was not the case at all with me. While the dryness from Nizoral usually lasts a couple of days, this shampoo seemed to permanently dry and damage my hair. I tried it on three different occasions, but each time the result was horrendous for me.</li>
            <li> I have used other products that work better.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and would recommend it compared to other I have tried in the past.  It doesn&#x27;t leave you hair dry and seems to be working in preventing/slowing my hair loss.</li>
            <li> Made me shed, and irritated my scalp. I do not reccomend this product to anyone is NW2a or less!!! You are better off with 1percent Nizoral...</li>
            <li> After years of problems with hair lost and more than 10 different products which i have tried to curb it, it seems that i found the right one. The results are obvious after 20 days as I use this shampoo . I use it 3 to 4 times a week. I do not see any hair falling any more. Now my hair is stronger and shinier than before. My girlfriend immediately noticed the difference of using this shampoo. That is most important to me. :)</li>
            <li> I do not know if this is any good for hair growth but it is not a bad shampoo or conditioner. I use it twice a week.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. I will definitely get it again. Has a pleasant smell and I genuinely feel that it invigorates my scalp. I&#x27;m looking forward to using it again and again.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a few years. I use it everyday and it is the best shampoo for me. I have oily hair and this stuff keeps my hair from being so oily. It is very concentrated so I only have to use a tiny amount each time. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to supplement the Lipogaine hair regrowth solution. Best shampoo hands down I have ever used. My head used to itch and my scalp would flake quite often.  After using this shampoo I can feel my overall scalp health has improved.  No more itching and flaking. I use it 3 times a week as recommended. I may not be a dermatologist but I know when something works.</li>
            <li> Gentle on your hair and I feel like I have seen improvement...</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  I use it in combination with Lipogaine topical.  I feel the two together create the best results.  I leave it on for the duration of the shower and it gives a cool soothing feeling to my scalp.  Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair loss shampoo on the market. I have tried a lot of different shampoos since my hair started thinning and I like this one the best. I noticed less hair loss in the shower after a few days. It smells good and makes my scalp feel healthy and clean.  It has ketoconazole along with other good ingredients. One big plus is that the shampoo also acts as a volumizer. Most shampoos only fight hair loss or volumize but this one does both. I&#x27;m going to stick with this one for awhile.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. I use it in combination with minox, and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;After 3 month hairs feel thicker and more shiny.</li>
            <li> I started using the shampoo at the same time I started using the Lipo minox topical, which probably wasn&#x27;t the best idea for assessing results, but the outcome has been awesome.  I have been thinning/losing for 15 years, have been on fin for equally as long (and still am), and was losing the battle so shaved my head.  3 years later, about 4 months ago, after finding the Lipogaine products, I decided to try growing my hair out again.  I am now 4 months in and am extremely happy.  It didn&#x27;t look great for the first 2 months and I debated shaving it back off, but I stuck with it and I started to fill-in around the &amp;#34;patches&amp;#34; - which I never thought would happen.  Not sure if it&#x27;s the shampoo or Lipo minox or both, but my hair hasn&#x27;t been this full in 5+ years (especially down the center of my head)  so I would recommend to anyone.  Whichever product it is, the Lipogaine products are working.  Pretty sure that people think I got a hair transplant, but whatever...I have hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the shampoo specifically - I have no issues.  No irritation and foams very nicely.  I use it at least 3 times a week and when I travel, which is a lot, I use it every day because I don&#x27;t want to pack 2 different shampoos.  Last week I used it 7 days in a row and had no issues  at all, although I know it&#x27;s not recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s been 4 months and it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Wife said she saw hair growth even though she did not know I was using this product. Did combine use with minoxidil but had been using minox. only for several years.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great and doesn&#x27;t have any sodium lauryl sulfate!  The reason I use it is because it has ketonconazole which some say prevents hair loss.  It works in conjunction with their minoxidil and is a potent combination. I noticed my hair is thicker and less is falling out in the shower.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I’ve used the Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo and Lipogain Intensive Treatment (topical formula) for about a year now. One major difference I’ve noticed is the complete lack of hair in the shower drain. It appears as though I’m not losing hair in the same amount I was prior to using the Lipogain products. My hair is also noticeably thicker to the touch and look. I had used generic Rogaine for years and it seemed to reduce hair loss but after switching to Lipogain the difference is far more noticeable. It seems to have effect on the entire scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using lipogaine 5% for 4 months, giving this a try alongside it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how it makes my hair look, will update to 5 stars if the product helps hair growth noticeably</li>
            <li> Very nice shampoo. One bottle lasts about 2 months</li>
            <li> Still using it and haven&#x27;t  seen  no improvements 😞😞  might give up on it really  soon I&#x27;m going to give it a try one more  time</li>
            <li> Great Product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used several different Shampoos  over the years none of them shown any results.Finally i have found Lipogaine  Big 3 Shampoo that solve my hair loss problem. It is far superior to anything I have used in the past and believe you me I have spent many years &amp; 1000&#x27;s of $ on trying different hair regrowth shampoos . It was worth going for Lipogaine. Its great product for complete hair problems.Try it you will definelty like this product.</li>
            <li> My hair are very thin and oily. So it falls a lot. I have tried many other shampoos for this. None of them worked like Lipogaine Big 3 yet. This is the best shampoo I have ever used. I am using this product more then 1 year now and very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo with great ingredients (Ketoconazole, Saw Palmetto, Niacin, Biotin, Propylene Glycol).&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> No particular issues with this shampoo but it doesn&#x27;t really do much more than any regular shampoo.  I use in in conjunction with Lipogaine and have not seen any real improvement over the last 8 months.</li>
            <li> I have being using &amp;#34;Lipogaine Big 3&amp;#34; since the Nizoral shortage and I am very pleased. Along with my minoxidil treatment, it helps keeping my hair thinning/loss at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other therapeutic shampoos it produces a very nice lather like a regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> This stuff works in combination with minoxidil. When you use it you can definitely feel it working on your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is that if you&#x27;re African American your hair will be dry after use. I personally recommend using once a week.</li>
            <li> I started using the big 3 shampoo about 2 years ago. My hair looks thicker and fuller even my barber has noticed it. I used this product everyday along with the lipogaine intensive treatment complete solution for thinning hair (3 in 1). I truly recommend this product it has worked for me.</li>
            <li> It takes time and patience, but the product works.  Less hair falling.  Follow instructions and you will see small baby hairs growing! Thank you!</li>
            <li> The shampoo does what it says. It cleans your scalp thoroughly and has a minty feel and smell. I have only been using it for a few weeks so I cant share any hair growth or thickening results as of yet, just using it a couple times a week and its a pretty basic shampoo that leaves my hair clean. After using for a while longer I will be able to share growth and or improved thickness and over all health of my hair review. Not a bad shampoo though,but conditioning after using this shampoo is definately necessary because its a bit stripping and drying to the hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now.  Compared to other shampoos that claimed to &amp;#34;thicken hair&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;prevent hair loss,&amp;#34; this product appears to be superior.  The shampoo also has a nice scent and as others have mentioned, it lathers easily, so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get the job done.  Rather than using it the recommended 2 to 3 times a week, I am using it 5 times a week, but I think it depends on the person/hair.  Overall, I have enjoyed the results I have seen since using this product and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Definitely slowed hair loss and thinning after only a few weeks of use.  One bottle lasts about 10 weeks, so a great value for the money.  Would recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> Same review for this product as for the regular solution, as I&#x27;ve used them together and feel thats the way to go with these products. Seen decent results after a few months and will continue to use the shampoo and solution and hopefully keep improving.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is doing anything or not, I am losing hair or thinning on the top and back of my head.  I used this before and it seemed to be doing something.  It might have just been counteracting some of the irritation of using minoxidil.  I do notice that when using it I am more comfortable and it seems my hair is a little thicker.</li>
            <li> Hate to say but...it sucked! I actually use Lipogaine&#x27;s minoxidil product, which is great, but this shampoo did not work for me at all. I tried it 3-4 times a week for 3 weeks and still kept losing hair, which I couldn&#x27;t expect it to work that fast but it didn&#x27;t even resolve the fungi issue - I still had flakes. It also ruined my hair making it very straw-like to the point where I decided to discontinue use. I remember reading this in another customer&#x27;s review but bought it anyway.  I hope they resolve this because they make other great products and ketoconazole shampoos are difficult to find. I&#x27;m thinking about trying Regenepure&#x27;s keto shampoo, anyone have feedback?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nizoral for years and Lipogaine Big is way more gentle with the scalp. If you&#x27;re looking for a shampoo with Ketokonazole this is your product. Also, it has many more active ingredients than Nizoral.</li>
            <li> I have been using Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo for about 3 weeks now.  I have to say this shampoo definitely makes my hair look thicker and feel great.  I have also noticed less hair falling out when I shower. I will definitely continue to use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I used to use Nizoral for years. It wasn&#x27;t purposed for hair loss, but had the additional benefit apart from it&#x27;s intended use, which is dandruff control. Lipogaine uses the same key ingredient that Nizoral uses, but Lipogaine is created for hair loss and has excellent additional ingredients. It smells awesome, and overall has a better end result than what I was previously using. My hair looks noticeably better than before and is an excellent step in my daily regimen. Definitely buying again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage son whose hair had already become noticeably thin near the temples.  It seemed like a great fit for him given that he also had seborrheic dermatitis (cradle cap) since he was very young, and the same active ingredient is used to treat that.  Overall, it is a terrific product.  Within the first use, we all noticed that his hair fluffed up and looked shiny as well ( he did have to start using a conditioner, however, since the shampoo is rather drying).  Within a month or so, the thinning of his hair at his temples was already less noticeable.  Now after about 3 months of using it 2-3 times per week, I&#x27;d say it is even fuller.  Did Lipogaine completely fill in the hair...no.  But it is much, much better, and he is less self conscious about it.  My son also likes it because it has greatly reduced the acne near his scalp.  We highly recommend this product especially for people who have hair thinning combined with seborrheic dermatitis and acne near the hairline.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo! Way overpriced. Evidently this helps with hair loss, and that I do not know about. I can say that you know that you are getting a clean scalp after use. No strange tingling, you just feel clean. Light weight and terrific ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle. I can easily say that this shampoo was able to slow down my hair loss. I can&#x27;t really say that I am seeing new hair growing but then I am not really looking for it. After seeing the success of this shampoo I even started to use their Lipogaine with Minoxidil. Coming from Regenepure I definitely like this one better as I feel my hair is much smoother after using Lipogaine shampoo. If you are in the market you should give this one a go.</li>
            <li> This shampoo seems to work well between ketoconazole uses.</li>
            <li> Worked very well for me for preventing additional hair loss. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> What can I say about this product.I am on my third bottle and I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;There is a reviews out there complaining about by using this shampoo your hair getting too dry.&lt;br /&gt;I am using this shampoo to battle oily scalp and hair receding. If you using this product as 2-3 times a week you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems.&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you one thing: I am using every other day and I love it.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews and took a chance. Helps with scalp issues, leaves it so clean it literally squeaks will washing it. It&#x27;s seems to be stripping my hair and has turned it into straw! It&#x27;s so dry now my go to Redken product for moisture doesn&#x27;t help. Just tried mixing it Alterna Replenishing Moisture Shampoo and clogged the drain with hair. Regenepure is even more drying.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to any male experiencing male pattern baldness. Makes my hair feel thicker than it did before, and doesn&#x27;t harm my scalp. Give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Have a receding line and thin hair, nothing I used worked, I did lipogaine for 4 months straight and my hair started coming back and was alot thicker, I regret that I stopped.Im back on it once again for 2 months now and will never stop using this awesome product, in tandem with the lipogaine serum and biotin supplements my hair is returning once again fuller and thicker</li>
            <li> Using the Big 3 shampoo with Lipogaine Premium Minoxidil. It works!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has actually helped to regrow my hair and keeps it noticably thicker and healthier looking. You don&#x27;t need a conditioner with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try the two products. If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ll be ecstatic. Exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> been using lipogaine shampoo with the drops for 6 months now and the results have been steady and great. just like advertised it takes time for it to work, and after 6 months my hair has substantially got thicker, and new hairs are growing all over including the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work; it did nothing for my hair except make it brittle. Waste of money and an exploitation of men who are desperate to preserve their hair.</li>
            <li> Good product, lathers nicely and works well with other Lipogaine products to help with hair loss.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference in the strength of my hair still falling out slowly. I&#x27;m sure there a better products out there.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo in combination with the Lipogaine Intensive Treatment Solution. I am satisfied with the results that I am getting. I wish I could have started sooner with this product before I started losing hair as a preventative measure against my hair loss. Overall, I will continue using this shampoo because I like the results. I like the smell of it as well, it has a minty fresh scent which to me it was a plus. The smell of mint helps me to reduce stress and I feel rejuvenated after a shower.</li>
            <li> When combined with lipogaine, this stuff works. Also it smells good and leaves my hair looking good, not flat.</li>
            <li> Great smell and makes my scalp feeling clean</li>
            <li> This product has controlled my hair loss. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Have been using the shampoo for about 4 months and must say that i has made my hair smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> I tried many shampoos up to now. Only one that really worked was Perfect Image solutions which was disapproved by FDA later. I am using this shampoo for almost 2 months. For me it is working really well. I feel that my hair is getting cleaned. I am also using Lipogaine minoxidil which works great as well. I wish Lipogaine sell this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I am using this shampoo for the last 4 years and have no regret still.</li>
            <li> as a newcomer to this product I hope for good results but so far I do have less hair loss</li>
            <li> I am a 38 year old male.  I bought this product after reading reviews and watching video testimonials online from other users that reviewed several ketoconazale shampoos.  I was a bit skeptical, but went ahead and purchased the shampoo from Amazon.  I was not concerned too much about the price based off the great reviews the product had already.  I have been using the shampoo pretty much daily now for the past 2 1/2 months (mornings and sometimes evenings if I exercised later in the day) and I must say, it has quickly become my favorite shampoo.  First of all, it leaves my hair feeling and looking great once I have showered and blow dryed it.  It does not weigh my hair down.  My hair has always been fine, but I have seen the gradual thinning on the top/crown and around the hairline (horseshoe pattern?).  I have noticed less hair coming out in my hands when I am in the shower.  I lather up about a quarter size amount of this shampoo.  It lathers reasonably well - I do have to use a little extra at times since I have longer hair (think Keith Urban cut).  Really wet your hair throughly before applying.  I try and keep it in at least 3 minutes while I work on the rest of my body which sometimes can become a pain if you are in a rush!  Secondly, the smell of the shampoo is nice.  It has a peppermint scent that does not become obnoxious once your hair is dry like other ketoconazole shampoos have done (Nizoral).  I have used this shampoo in conjunction with generic Equate minoxidil since someone said the Equate version made in Israel is the best.  After less than 3 months of using both products, I feel I am on the road to at least salvaging the hair I have, but I am hopeful for new growth.  I really do feel as if there is some thickening going on.  Again, I&#x27;m only less than 3 months into all of this.  I will be purchasing my next bottle of Lipogaine soon from Amazon.  It&#x27;s looking like I can get about 3 months usage from one bottle while using it most days.</li>
            <li> Edit (1 year later) I&#x27;ve now been using this shampoo 3 days a week for one year. I&#x27;m a 24 year old male with a slightly receding hairline. I leave it in my hair for 5-10 minutes and I use it mon,wed, fri and have stayed consistent. I also did not use minoxidil or anything else for hairloss during this time period so I know my results are due to the ketoconazole. The first two weeks I immediately noticed a decrease in hair shed followed by about 3 weeks of shedding a lot of hair... I knew this was a good sign and that it was working. About 3 months later I noticed some very short hairs coming in around my hairline. The more visible one&#x27;s were there before, but I also noticed some very tiny vellus hairs in spots around my hairline that previously had no hair(most likely there actually was hair there but it was not visible before) Since then I have maintained the same which is good since I&#x27;m just trying to delay any further loss as long as possible. I have reduced my hair shedding greatly and improved the overall health of my scalp. I have almost zero dandruff, when I rub my hands through my hair over a black surface I see maybe one or two flakes which is a huge improvement. I will continue to use this shampoo and will start using minoxidil to see if/how much added benefit that adds.</li>
            <li> Terrific shampoo. The best over-the-counter hair loss shampoo I&#x27;ve used, actually. There might be other options that are more costly or require a prescription, but for the money, you won&#x27;t be able to beat this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple years now. Prior to this, I tried Avalon Organics Thickening Shampoo, Nioxin (multiple systems), DS Laboratories Revita Hair Stimulating Shampoo, and L&#x27;Oreal Paris Vive Pro for Men Daily Thickening Shampoo to deal with my hair loss. Out of all of them, I like Lipogaine Big 3 the best. Though it is a little more costly than some of its competitors, it also delivers the best results. If you just want a shampoo that cleans, you can go pick up any cheap shampoo from a drug store or grocery store and it will do the job. Unfortunately, it will be loaded with sulfates and parabens that are terrible for the health of your hair. On the upside, the price for this product has gone down about $5 since it first came out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo leaves a clean, minty scent because of the peppermint oil extract in it. It does a great job leaving your hair clean and not oily. I use it almost daily, at least 4 times a week. Other days I just use conditioner.The bottle lasts me between a month and two months usually, about six weeks. I recommend pairing it with Lipogaine&#x27;s Minoxidil product. Combined, they have done an incredible job at halting my hair loss, especially my receding hairline. The formula contains proven ingredients like ketoconazole and biotin, so why settle for other products that make big claims without science? I wouldn&#x27;t even consider another shampoo now. I&#x27;m a lifelong Lipogaine customer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this shampoo for a few months, but I do feel it&#x27;s helped me keep my remaining hair. I am using it in conjunction with other hair loss prevention products, but it seems to be a necessary staple in my regiment.</li>
            <li> My daughter struggles with Lyme disease and was dealing with very itchy scalp and hair loss. This product has greatly reduced the itchiness and reversed the hair loss. The hair loss and itching started again when she ran out between bottles. The good results are definitely from this product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t go to a dermatologist.  I wanted to avoid the costs etc..I had heard very good things about \\&quot;Ketoconazole\\&quot; but the cost vs. ounces of the product seemed a bit high. (however this was my next option) but since this shampoo had Ketoconazole in it and other good ingredients. I thought It may be worth a try (tried all nutragena shampoo products,,head and shoulders..ingredients such as tar, zinc, etc...these products did not help.  Tried natural stuff...tea tree oil, apple cider vinegar, natural stuff didn&#x27;t help.  I went as far as to put fungus cream on my head...and no it didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;I read the other reviews, and the ingredients because I did want something with Ketoconazole that may not be too harsh and this stuff did the trick...I was miserable before trying this stuff! I thought the added bonus of hair loss/thinning hair wouldn&#x27;t hurt because that was a big side effect. as well as just constant painful, itchy. dry skin outlining the face and hair even to the point my eyebrows itched and my nose...I was quite miserable.  I hope they keep selling this shampoo otherwise I may need to stock up on it in case the problem reoccurs.</li>
            <li> First of all, I just wanna say I love Lipogaine, I gave it 5 stars in my review because I believe it is a very effective product and I have gotten great results. I purchased Lipogaine&#x27;s Big 3 shampoo hoping it will be just as good as their minoxidil product. The shampoo smells good(nice minty smell) and it leaves your scalp feeling great and clean.  I used it for 2 weeks straight but over that time, I have noticed hair lost..particularly I was shedding the new hair I had regrown from using Lipogaine. I was concerned that it may have been the shampoo so I switched back to Nizoral and the hair loss stopped. I thought if this was just a weird coincidence and that maybe I was just going through a natural shedding phase when I was on the Big 3. Anyways, I switched back to the Big 3 to test my reaction to it and again I was shedding hair again.  I decided to do some research today and found out salicylic acid can weaken hair shafts and make them susceptible to breakage. I&#x27;m positive that this was what I was experiencing. I really hope Lipogaine revises their Big 3 shampoo and start making it without salicylic acid.  Everything else about the shampoo is great. I still have over half a bottle of Big 3 but I can not continue using it because of the salicylic acid.  I will continue using Nizoral but after that&#x27;s gone, I&#x27;m not sure what to do. There has been a shortage of Nizoral recently.  I looked up Regenpure and I can&#x27;t use that either due to salicylic acid.  I&#x27;m thinking of giving Revita a try even though it has gotten mixed reviews with some saying the quality of the product is deteriorating...</li>
            <li> better than nizoral which makes my hair dry and itchy, this shampoo has emu oil which moisturizes the scalp and makes my hair and scalp feel great.</li>
            <li> Selsun Blue was making me lose hair. So I did a LOT of research on shampoo and finally decided on this one. I have no compliants. It seems to make my hair thicker and possibly even started some new hair growth. It smells good and lathers great. It also doesn&#x27;t have a lot of bad ingredients.  I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t lose my hair as much as I used to when using this shampoo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months and so far it seems to be working.  My hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as much when I wash it, though it is a bit drying.  I wash my hair daily so I can&#x27;t use this product everyday.  It foams up nicely.  The smell isn&#x27;t too strong and it smells clean...nothing fruity or flowery...just...clean.  I would recommend this product and will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nizoral ever since I used minoxidil hair growth product. I started to use Lipogaine big 3 shampoo after I couldn&#x27;t find Nizoral anywhere recently. I actually like this big 3 shampoo a lot more than Nizoral. Nizoral is a thick a shampoo. But this is even thicker. One bottle lasts long time. It does not dry my scalp as much as Nizoral. It lathers well, smells nice. It does not flat my hair like many other shampoos. Most importantly, it works very well for me when I use it together with Lipogaine for women. My hair is much fuller and thicker than before.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is light and has a low odor, I use the shampoo along with other product for re-growing hair. I can&#x27;t say that my hair is growing back but I have notice that at least it is not getting worse. My advice is if you have baldness in the family I would use the product as a preventative maintenance; I figure that I need to take showers and shampoo my hair anyways why not use a shampoo designed to help it?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slowed the hair loss. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive shampoos. This is the best I&#x27;ve used. It helped stop hairless for me. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday as my regular shampoo, noticed the difference in a week. The hair that was in the tub after shower decreased greatly. I also use the lipogaine for men. On my second bottle of shampoo now will get more.</li>
            <li> I received it yesterday and therefore, I&#x27;ve had my hair washed with this shampoo only once, could you believe that my hair looks really wonderful with  only one use? Everybody told me today. Wowww, really happy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great, helps my hair thicken, and relieves itching. I am especially fond of the ingredient ketonconazole. My head used to itch around the area where my hairline was receding. I use this shampoo everyday for about a month now and I have experienced considerably less itch in those areas. Best product I have used so far on my hair.</li>
            <li> Have been using this shampoo  for at least 4 months and I honestly can say that it slows down the hair loss. Cleans your hair but doesn&#x27;t strip the natural oil of your hair. I use it everyday on my short just above the shoulder length hair and it normally takes a little more than a month to use up the bottle. I&#x27;m a long time minoxidil user and just recently discovered that my hair loss is starting up again. That is why I added this shampoo in my regimen and found that it started working after a month. You should try it....</li>
            <li> I had a slight dandruff issue and early stages of “thinning” hair.  I did not want to start a rigorous regime of Minoxidil at this point.  My “old” dandruff shampoo used sulfates, which I wanted to get away from.  I performed a lot of online research, using a variety of resources, to try and find a shampoo that would hopefully work for my issues and be more hair friendly.  I started using Lipogaine Big 3 about 7 weeks ago.  Since that time my dandruff has not been an issue.  During my research, I learned to expect some initial shedding, which I did for the first month.  Made me nervous at first, but the shedding has stopped.  The shampoo has a nice fragrance and using it as directed, the bottle should last a very long time.  Looking forward to continually using this product.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working pretty good. Since I started using this I have found myself not shedding as much</li>
            <li> Great shampoo!  Really seems to help with hair loss, will continue to repurchase, along with the Intensive treatment.</li>
            <li> So far I am happy with the result of using his product. I use this shampoo along with lipogaine minoxidil solution, bitotin and multivitamin supply.&lt;br /&gt;I am also trying to follow moderate diet to reverse hair loss. Since last two months of using this shampoo along with other stuff, I see that my hair loss has stopped or it has reduced. Hair are getting thicker gradually. Its is better than all other products that I have waste my time and money in past.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for thin hair and definitely slows down shedding.  It also doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down and makes it look thicker. Overall, a must have product for those with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, lathers easily, and does not weight down hair.  I have used this and bought it again.  Not sure if it helps hair growth (there does seem to be some growth but it&#x27;s not like the bald spot is gone) but the hair I have does look fuller.  I would recommend using this every few days in addition to another organic argan oil shampoo.</li>
            <li> I like the product and will order again. It seems to be helping with the thinning hair. I use it together with a few other products and it seems to have minimized any hair loss.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this shampoo has helped my thin/thinning hair.  I like the smell and how soft and manageable my hair is after use.  I used one bottle so far and I did order two more bottles and will update my review if I feel my hair thickens.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a recommendation that it can help with hair loss.  I have used it a few months so I&#x27;ll describe my experience - the positive and the negative. I&#x27;m on my second bottle now.  The first bottle the shampoo was thicker and this bottle (second one) the shampoo is a little more runnier.  I use about a fifty cent piece / dollar piece worth of shampoo each time (I have short hair).  The shampoo smells really good - a peppermint scent.  It makes my hair appear thicker and my family thought it looked thicker.  I believe it&#x27;s too soon to say if it stopped any hair loss or regrew anything.  Immediately, I noticed that I don&#x27;t get any dandruff or itching.  I use minoxidil and generic propecia as well.  I have always had dandruff and minoxidil made my hair itch, so even if it ends up not working too well for me with preventing hair loss, I think it&#x27;s worth as a dandruff cure and making my hair look thicker.  None of the dandruff OTC products I used did anything for me.  The price is kind of expensive, but is comparable in price to similar products.  I noticed if you mess with the cap it will snap off or crack which I&#x27;ve never had happen with a shampoo bottle.  In summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;- Lasts months between bottles&lt;br /&gt;- Smells good&lt;br /&gt;- Makes my hair look thicker&lt;br /&gt;- Prevents / cures dandruff&lt;br /&gt;- Prevents / cures the itch from minoxidil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;- The product isn&#x27;t the same from bottle to bottle, one bottle had thicker shampoo and one was runnier.&lt;br /&gt;- The cap is very sensitive and if you tighten it too much it will crack or snap off!&lt;br /&gt;- Can be pricey, but is comparable in price to the competitors (can be a positive or negative).</li>
            <li> So far, so good. Leaves hair thick and full (noticeably so). Through a couple weeks (combined with Rogaine) there&#x27;s some nice growth of some strands previously absent. Will keep using!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple shampoos for hair loss and Lipogaine is by far the best. It has similar ingredients to Regenpure but works much better. I have less hair loss in the shower with Lipogaine, where I saw a slight increase with Regenpure. I will continue to buy this product, no shampoo will be a miracle for hair loss but this at least slows the process down.</li>
            <li> Was debating between this shampoo and Regenepure. I decided on Lipogaine after researching the various ingredients between the two and felt they were a bit superior in Lipogaine. I was a little worried how the Lipogaine would lather since many of these hair loss shampoos tend to struggle in that regard...but I was pleasantly surprised that it lathers great, and gives an invigorating tingling feeling as well. Bottom line is that it&#x27;s a rich feeling shampoo, and you just feel like your getting all types of quality ingredients into the scalp and follicles. Will continue ordering this for a long time. And it&#x27;s at a great price point too!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, a little expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> I am a female who struggles with hair loss from thyroid disease and low iron in addition to some genetic FPB. My hair restoration Dr had prescribed me some Nizoral 2% shampoo which wrecked my hair and scalp. This shampoo has the ketoconazole in an excellent moisturizing base with lots of high quality ingredients and most importantly no sulfates since my hair is colored. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I love it, it&#x27;s hands down the best ketoconazole shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. I was so impressed with the shampoo that I decided to try Lipogaine minoxidil solution and I&#x27;m also very happy with that product I can see lots of tiny hairs growing in.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for the past 2 years or so every other day as a treatment for my dandruff.  It has worked great in managing my dandruff outbreaks, I highly recommend it.  It&#x27;s also wonderful that it doesn&#x27;t contain SLS, which can be very drying on the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the price may seem a bit high for a shampoo, but it is well worth it as not only does it work, but it also lasts quite a bit of time.</li>
            <li> I love this Shampoo. I had been using it for awhile and the only downside was that it really dried out my hair. I noticed immediately that the shampoo in this latest bottle was a different color (more white than beige). I also noticed that it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out anymore. Looks like they added Emu oil which certainly did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my &amp;#34;formula&amp;#34; for combating hair loss: Lipogaine shampoo and morning and night applications of  Lipogaine Intensive treatment hair solution to which I add about half a gram of Azelaic Acid flakes. You should experiment with how much AA you add as it can cause a burning sensation on the scalp. You can buy the Azelaic Acid here: http://fludan.com/.&lt;br /&gt;This protocol had me going from losing 50 plus hairs in the shower each day to less than 10 (yes, I confess I did count them).</li>
            <li> After only a month&#x27;s use, my hair fallout has been cut in half. I am encouraged that the thinning of my hair will stop.</li>
            <li> I started to lose hair since I was 17. I have used many many products include the most popular Rogaine but I just simple gave up until I found this shampoo on amazon. I decided to give it a shot...I can only tell that I am more than satisfaced with this product. Not only have stopped my hair loss but also grown more hair that even my co workers noticed and asked me if I was using anything on my hair and I told them about this shampoo..Right after that they asked me to order few bottles for them and so far they are happy with the results...&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for such a great product..Now even my manager is using it lol</li>
            <li> Keeping the dandruff under control is worth it alone.  Dandruff is a fungus and that can&#x27;t be good for a healthy scalp.  I used Nizoral for a few months to get rid of it and Lipogaine to keep it gone.  I use it three to four days a week and I am on my second bottle.  It may not suds up as much as other shampoos but is that really necessary?  I see less hair in my comb after a shampoo.  The hair on the top of my scalp quits growing after a certain length.  That length is now about one inch longer since I started on Lipogaine.  My hair loss came from stress and rapid weight loss.  My hair will never come back but at least it is improving.  Follow the directions and let it sit on your scalp the proper amount of time.  I also use the WalMart version of Rogaine for Women and Nioxin Conditioner for Noticeably Thinning hair.  I alternate Lipogaine with another sulfate free shampoo since I wash every day.</li>
            <li> A step above the rest.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other DHT inhibitor (Ketoconazole) shampoos but, prefer Big 3.  It contains Biotin and Emu oil to moisturize the scalp.  It leaves my hair looking and feeling more dense.  It has a pleasant minty scent.  The Big 3, is essential in aiding in stronger hair growth</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! its really doing the job! i would recommend using this 3 times a week and the topical solution in combo, but only once a day with the topical solution.</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo.  It&#x27;s one of the few that I like for thinning hair.  It has a nice consistency... not too watery but not too thick.  It smells nice and feels great going on.  It lathers well.  I usually leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing.  Ingredients look solid for battling hair loss.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! I&#x27;ve always had fine coarse curly hair and after bleaching it, it started thinning out. This stuff has helped thicken it at least 30% and it has only be a month!</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair smell great and look thick and full. I usually have a dryness problem but Big 3 makes my scalp look and feel amazing. At first I was apprehensive about the price, but it ended up being totally worth it and I definitely would recommend it to anyone wanting a great shampoo.</li>
            <li> It works.&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend use it every other day and it works for him. It doesn&#x27;t smell, which is good.</li>
            <li> I bought this for hair loss caused by medication I have to take for my stomach. I have been using it for 2 weeks and I think it has slowed down my hair loss but it is hard to tell.  My hair is really shiny now, but definitely have to use deep conditioner on the ends more because they feel dryer than before I started using this.</li>
            <li> Nice shampooo love shamppo specially liitle bit shampooo wash my hair goood nice smell also</li>
            <li> This is a pretty wonderful shampoo, it smells good and does exactly what it is supposed to do! I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this shampoo. My hair is thinning on top and the thinning area always itched a lot. I tried another good shampoo for thinning hair, but had to use it every night to totally stop the itching. With Lipogaine, I only have to shampoo every other night to get total relief from itching. I think it is doing a great job of keeping my scalp clean, which is so important in preventing hair loss. Also, as other have mentioned it contains ketoconazole to fight thinning and emu oil for soothing. Also, I color my hair and it does not damage the color. I plan on using Lipogaine indefinitely.</li>
            <li> Have used it for more than 2 year.  The best product for me so far.  It can keep my hair clean and strong for at least two days - the other shampoo I ever tried can only work for 1 day even for winter time.</li>
            <li> Have been using a few months and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I tried two different shampoos with 1% ketoconazole, this one and the Regenepure DR. Of the two, this is my favorite. It has a mild, fresh scent that I would describe as sweet mint. It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of peppermint oil in it, so it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp feel cold (I know some people like that but I don&#x27;t.) It is strongly foamy (so a little goes a long way) and has good lubricant properties. I use a very small amount to wash my scalp, then use the remaining foam to de-tangle my (long) hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Regenepure was fine but had a little less lubricant property and a little more peppermint oil, which made it not as pleasing. The Lipogain also has a gentler ingredient list since it relies only on Cocoamidopropyl Betain for foaming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to talk about the effectiveness of this shampoo for hair loss prevention because it should be exactly the same as any other 1% ketoconazole shampoo. I use this in combination with a 5% minoxydil once per day and my hair loss has reversed to some extent. It isn&#x27;t completely back to normal, but it&#x27;s quite a bit improved. I also coat my hair with coconut oil and braid it at night to increase strength and reduce breakage, which has made a big difference in the appearance of my hair, if not the amount.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  Within a week of constant use, it reduced daily hair loss by 90%!  In addition, the folks at the company are extremely responsive if you have any questions.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair and was losing hair quickly... I tried so many different shampoo and none worked until I found Lipogaine Big 3.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever bought and I&#x27;ve been using it for close to 2 years now. The shampoo is not drying and the ingredients helped stop my hair loss. My hair is now less oily and softer than ever. I used it together with Minoxidil and this combination works great. One bottle lasts a long long time even when I use it daily so it is definitely worth the price. Highly recommended...</li>
            <li> i think the product is really good.my hair look like more thicker after 4 time order .i will continue order in future.thanks</li>
            <li> I have been using ketoconazole shampoos since 2012. Lipogain big 3 is my favorite one. The shampoo foams up well, smells nice, and a bottle lasts me over 2 months, which is a long time because I use it almost daily. As for the effectiveness against hair loss/hair regrowth, I am not certain how well it works because I also use propecia and Lipogaine minoxidil with a separate azealic acid cream. I have also had 2 hair transplants since June 2012, so my hair is looking damn good now. I will continue to use Lipogaine Big 3 as I just prefer the quality over Revita or RegenPure (I like Revita over RegenPure) and I never liked Nizoral. Lipogaine Big 3 does not dry out my scalp, and I think I&#x27;m somewhat prone to dandruff as I remember having it as a kid, I definitely do not have it now, and that is also a use for ketoconazole. I give this product a 2.5, partly because I think I have somewhat unrealistic expectations. My hair loss is pretty well under control now but for me to give Lipogaine big 3 a 4 or a 5, it would have to yield hair loss on it&#x27;s own (meaning no propecia, minoxidil, or azealic acid) but I do feel it is the highest quality ketoconazole shampoo available to date and therefore I will continue using it until something better comes along. Combating hair loss gets to be a pain in the balls, but I have to wash my hair any way, so might as well use the best ketoconazole shampoo to hopefully kill some DHT and preserve some of my hair. I truly hope this post helps others in making a decision on which shampoo to use to go with to help fight hair loss.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo for the ketonconazole as I&#x27;ve suffered really bad scalp itch. The other products i&#x27;ve tried would work for a few days and then dry my scalp out, leading to more dandruff, and more itch. It was a rough cycle. I think I was sensitive to the SLS and other harsh chemistry in major brand shampoos, which this product is largely free of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipogaine Big 3 has kept my scalp itch free for more than 6 months. Very glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased Lipogaine shampoo to work with the Lipogaine hair treatment. The shampoo cleans the hair well and suds up quickly. It does not weigh the hair down resulting in a clean full look. I have no idea if the shampoo increases the hair growth if used with the Lipogiene hair treatment but the results that I am getting using both products works for me.</li>
            <li> Works amazing , makes your hair feel great also !! I can tell it works because when I stop using the product I shed more hair then when I&#x27;m on it. Smells great too !</li>
            <li> Amazing shampoo, amazing ingredients and amazing company.  Made my hair feel great.  Anyone experiencing hair loss should give this shampoo a shot!</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo.  It gives my hair a lot of body and has helped me with my thinning hair.  I like all of the nutritious ingredients.  I would recommend giving it a try if you have thin or thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo just over two weeks ago and I have to say I really like the product.  First of all, you don&#x27;t need to use much product to get a good lather and thoroughly clean your hair and scalp.  Although the directions say you can use the product two to three times a week, I have been using it daily with no problems at all.  The shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry your hair and scalp like some of the other shampoos that contain ketoconazole.  Given how much I have used in the first two weeks of daily use, I think this bottle will last me at least 3 to 4 months which is not a bad deal.  I plan to keep this product as part of my daily regimen to combat hair loss.</li>
            <li> I recommend that you try it</li>
            <li> Still not sure if it is really helping other than to reduce the hair loss. Will need more time in usage to see in the long run. The shampoo though is thick and you don&#x27;t need very much to lather up so a little goes a long way. It has a nice light fragrance and the hair does feel clean after showering.</li>
            <li> love it. Noticable improvement in hair quality and outperformed the ever expensive Nizoral in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works really well to restore hair and its lasts a long time.  You will notice a difference right away.</li>
            <li> Repeated use of this shampoo appears to have slowed my hair loss and also it makes my hair fuller and thicker after each application.&lt;br /&gt;You only need about a dime size amount per shampoo.  It creates a thick lather which I leave on my scalp for about 5 minutes.  It rinses clean.&lt;br /&gt;I use it about 3-4x/week.  I&#x27;ve experienced no ill side affects after using a couple bottles of this shampoo.  If you&#x27;re balding it&#x27;s worth a try to see if you get positive results.</li>
            <li> Smells nice... noticed no change.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for about 3 weeks, and used it about 5 times overall. Overall, I noticed an increase in shedding, particularly in areas where I wasn&#x27;t shedding before (like the back of my head). Nizoral worked better for me, but unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find the stuff anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I will say is that it left my scalp feeling clean, although it tended to dry my hair out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great- I am actually on my second bottle. I am not sure yet about visible hair regrowth, but the loss has DEFINITELY slowed. Plus this adds a nice thickness, body and grip that other shampoos don&#x27;t. People keep telling me that my hair looks great.  I love the slight tingle too- almost minty. I will keep buying this for sure!</li>
            <li> This is a high quality shampoo, with a great cosmetic feel, with proven, effective ingredients against hair thinning and associated scalp issues such as seborrheic dermatitis. I use it 1-2 a week, and my scalp always feels healthier. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!!!  I am on my second bottle and I have noticed (my hairdresser did too) new growth where I was thinning. I don&#x27;t suds up once than suds up again and let it sit. I suds up once and let it sit in my hair for 15-20minutes. I use it 2-3x a week. I would love to use it more often but at $25 for 8oz I can&#x27;t. You may need to use a little more conditioner than usual when you use this, I have slightly oily hair so it&#x27;s perfect for me. I have thinning hair and this has made a difference in the thinning spots. I also take biotin and zinc every day to help. I would so recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is my second time getting this shampoo from this company. I got this shampoo to replace my shampoo they don&#x27;t make anymore. Its a really good shampoo I recommend this shampoo to anyone who has psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I have only tried it for 3 weeks and I use it everyday.  I saw a slight difference in the growth of my hair or preventing ones from breaking and falling out.  What I like about this shampoo is that it foams up.  Unlike a lot of shampoos especially ones with  ketoconazole in it, it actually lathers and you can have it sit in your hair feeling like it&#x27;s is washed.  I haven&#x27;t had any itchy scalp whatsoever.  In fact, my hair is left shiny and smooth when it dries.  As for if there is any hair regrowth, I have only seen minimal.  I&#x27;m not sure if it works but I was told to stick with it and that i have to wait 6 months to see results.  I still have a lot of hair that falls out in the drain every time I wash it. That hasn&#x27;t changed.  They said shedding is common, but when does it stop and actual hair is kept?  Still experimenting.  The product doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  And you only need a small spoon full to do the whole head. I&#x27;m a female with long hair, so to not use so much shampoo saves money.  My bottle is still pretty full and it&#x27;s been a month.  I wash my hair everyday.  So I&#x27;m thinking it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Big 3 shampoo for 3 months now.  I have been using Nioxin products for years and have been satisfied.  However I wanted to try something different.  The shampoo is great and leaves my hair full and not weighted down.  It&#x27;s too soon to tell if it&#x27;s helping my hair loss but Lipogaine solution sure has so I will combine as recommended 2 to 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> Read all the ingredients carefully to make sure you don&#x27;t have an allergic reaction.  I&#x27;m allergic to peppermint oil and it&#x27;s in this stuff.  Also, made my hair feel dried out.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo.  Dries the hair somewhat but seems to be helping with hair loss!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done lots of research and have found this shampoo has the best ingredients for mens hair loss.</li>
            <li> I really thought that nothing would help with this problem,since I have tried a ton of different shampoo’s in the past and nothing worked until I tried this brand.I had never heard of this company or brand before getting it to review.I really did not care for the scent,it smells like mint which isn’t horrible but just not a scent I typically buy or like that much,but that’s only a minor factor and wouldn’t stop me from repurchasing.It lathers really well,and does not take much to lather up which is great because that means it will last a long time.This product is currently listed on Amazon for $25 which is a lot of money for a shampoo but it really does work so it makes it worth every penny.The shampoo is sulfate free and paraben free which I love since the less chemicals the better the product is for us to use.I really noticed since using this a significant amount of less hair has been falling out,my hair is super thin and was always falling out with the littlest tug,anything from putting my hair up,washing it,brushing etc would rip it right out so now I noticed less in my brush and shower and noticed it hasn’t been coming out so much or as easily. I have used prescription Ketoconazole and biotin and neither has helped with lessening the falling out of my hair until this.Like I mentioned before this product is sold on amazon and I will include the link below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004N1EQNO/ref&#x3D;sr_ph?ie&#x3D;U</li>
            <li> Ok, I want to start by saying I&#x27;ve been using regenepure dr for a long time in conjunction with avalon organics biotin thickening shampoo,  which has done amazing things for my hair.  The regenepure really opens up my scalp to the hair strengthening biotin shampoo.  I decided giving lipogaine big 3 a try and found that I had pretty much the same experience. The emu oil and aloe both play essential rules for circulation and stimulating the follicles.  I did run out of shampoo without ketokenazol (or whatever it&#x27;s called) and my scalp went through hell before buying this shampoo.  Overall I like this product.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this product a try since it got good reviews on Amazon and was highly praised several YouTube videos that espoused the product&#x27;s positive effects.  Ultimately, this is one of the 3 shampoos that contains ketoconazole, the chemical that blocks DHT production in the hair follicle.  DHT is the testosterone culpable for hair loss, specifically male pattern baldness which I am experiencing.  I have used this shampoo for only 4 weeks so far (started on October 10, 2014).  Although I have not seen a big change in the appearance of my hair (yet), I do notice that less hair is falling out in the shower and less hair will come out when slightly tugged.  Before, when I would grab a lock of hair and give a slight pull, several strands would always come out.  Now, this no longer happens, and if does, its only one or two.  Hopefully, I am headed in the right direction as far as at least preserving what hair I have left.  So far I am pleased with this product, but only longer term use will determine whether I decide to continue with it or not, as it is pricey $$$.  NOTE:  I am using this shampoo in conjunction with daily 1 mg Finesteride (aka Propecia) and have been taking this for one month.</li>
            <li> With daily use this product has stopped my hair loss. Quality ingredients. I like to combine with a conditioner because it does level hair flat otherwise , but that dosent stop me from being satisfied.</li>
            <li> A year ago I began losing a lot of hair at every hair wash. At that rate I figured I would be bald within 6 months. I was very desperate at that time and tried out many expensive oral supplements which should be good for the hair, however the hair loss continued. When I tried the Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo around 6 months ago, I can clearly see the hair loss slow down a lot within a few weeks which made me very happy. In the last several months, I think I have grew back a little bit of hair, not a lot but the hair loss stopped and I am far from bald. I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this shampoo twice.  That is saying something because I never something twice unless I really like it.  I use it in the hopes that is does something beneficial for my seemingly thinning hair.  That aside, it also performs well and is concentrated.  Smell is fine.  All in all great, though expensive.  The ingredients are good though and that is apparent in using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed on this second purchase is that the formula was changed slightly, for the better.  The old formula had phenoxyethanol in it, which is a hideous ingredient used as a preservative.  Many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and pseudo organic products use this as a preservative which sets me off because it is an unhealthy chemical that has potential side effects.  I hate chemicals.  They are bad, any who says otherwise is uninformed.  This is another reason I bought this shampoo.  The formula is far from perfect, but it is much cleaner than most other shampoos on the market, and the cleanest anti-thinning shampoo I have found so far.  I have looked at a lot too.  Most anti-thinning shampoos have a lot of trash in them as far as fillers and chemicals go.  Ironically many of them have sodium sulfates of some kind as well which allegedly speeds up hair thinning.  Very ironic.  So anyway, get this if you want an all around solid &amp;#34;anti-thinning&amp;#34; shampoo.</li>
            <li> i bought this because i have long hair and wanted to make sure i was taking care of it.  i am a man in his forties so it is not as thick as it once was, so i wanted a good shampoo.  i have only been using it for a couple of months, but i am certain it is getting thicker and there seems to be a lot less hair fall after a shower.  it is also has more body and just a very healthy look no matter how i wear it now.  i intend to keep using it every other day from now on.  great product.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo!! Leaves my hair feeling thick and luxurious!! I love the peppermint it leaves my hair feeling fresh.  I notice less hair shed in between shampoos thanks to the dht blockers. My favorite shampoo just wish it had a bigger size and with a pump</li>
            <li> Great product! I still see slight hair loss but it definitely slowed it down. It feels very good on the hair</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo. Works exceptionally well for dandruff. The peppermint leaves your scalp feeling amazing. Though, the longer i use it, the less i notice the effects. I remember being completely blown away the first time i used it. My hair had NEVER felt that soft. The Emu Oil really is a nice touch. Follow the instructions. I just do every other day, if i skip the weekends, i just stick to Mon-Wed-Fri; it works out nicely.</li>
            <li> I have been using Lipogaine Big 3 for about 4 years now.  In that time, I have experienced zero hair loss.  I used to use Nioxin products, but they contain some chemicals that I didn&#x27;t like.  I tried Lipogaine and honestly, haven&#x27;t looked elsewhere since.  This product has the right combination of ingredients that work to reduce DHT on your scalp.  As a result, my hair looks great, and I am confident that I have totally stopped my hair loss for good.  I plan to continue using Lipogaine, and have recommended it to several friends who are experiencing hair loss.  If your hair is thinning or falling out, I encourage you to try this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I have two autoimmune disorders affecting my scalp, both of which have probably contributed to hair loss.  A few years ago, I began purchasing Nizoral shampoo to help control my scalp psoriasis and shedding.  Unfortunately, Nizoral is not always readily available.  During one Nizoral outage, I purchased Lipogaine due to its inclusion of ketokonazole and other high quality ingredients.  I found this shampoo left my hair feeling much softer and less processed than Nizoral with the same benefits (reduced itching, flaking, and shedding).  I will continue to purchase this shampoo for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo is by far the BEST shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.</li>
            <li> I have been using lipogaine with other shampoos (one caffeine based shampoo and one alpha hydroxy acid shampoo) and so far I have seen significant decrease in shedding. Will there be actual regrowth?  I hope so but I also think that would take a while to see. For now I am happy that the shedding has slowed down a lot. I don&#x27;t know which shampoo have played the biggest part in slowing the shedding but I will keep using all 3. I have read a lot of research on the main ingredients of these 3 shampoos ( ketonconazole, Caffeine and AHA) and believe they all work together really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a few months now. It seems to have stopped or at least slowed down hair loss. Makes your hair feel nice and clean and tingly too. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product in combination with Lipogaine for Men, Premium Minoxidil Hair Loss/ Hair Regrowth Stimulating Solution for over a year and have been impressed with the results.  Together, these two products have stopped my hair from receding further and helped stimulate some new growth.  One star withheld because it seems to be a good product for stopping or slowing hair loss and  bringing back some hair, but doesn&#x27;t appear to restore hair to where it was before hair loss began.  If you had to choose between the shampoo and the stimulation solution, I&#x27;d definitely go with the Hair Regrowth Stimulating Solution.</li>
            <li> this shampoo packs a punch of many proven ingredients that support hair growth, such as ketonconazole, biotin and&lt;br /&gt;emu oil which help moisture to ease dry scalp caused by ketoconazole. Just the ketoconazole alone for a shampoo is worth buying this.</li>
            <li> My husband used this with the Lipogaine serum for about a year.  He&#x27;s done extensive research on hair regrowth and retention and chose this product specifically based on the ingredients and success stories surrounding the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my perspective, I noticed his hair to be noticeably thicker and fuller with this product.  No weird chemical or fertilizer-y smells like other products he tried before this one.  (SUCH a good thing! LOL)  He was really consistent about using the products and it made a difference in his hair that stayed with him even after he stopped using it.  I&#x27;m not sure if just using the shampoo alone will do as much, as he used the Lipogaine serum along with it, but I&#x27;d definitely try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product support with this company is also excellent.  I know he emailed them several times with questions and they always were happy to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From witnessing his success with it, I would definitely recommend this product, (and the line of products from this company) to any man looking to enhance and keep his hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a great week!</li>
            <li> Sulfate free, and &amp;#34;seems&amp;#34; to slow down shedding when used with minoxidil after 3 months. Not sure if it&#x27;s adding any regrowth on it&#x27;s own, but it&#x27;s highly concentrated and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. My hair is getting fuller by the day. Will be ordering again! Must have if your hair is thinning.</li>
            <li> I love this product it helped fight my receding hairline. I recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a hair loss solution</li>
            <li> I am on my 4th bottle of Big 3 shampoo. The first one, green in color, lasted me six months using three times a week. The second one they sent was tan in color. Smelled the same, but it took more of it to get the same amount of lather as the green. Only lasted 3 1/2 months. I took a chance and ordered a third, green again and lasted for six months. My fourth and newest bottle just arrived, and it&#x27;s tan and much more watery. I feel ripped off, for $25 I need it to last six months! Send me some green! And why the watery tan? Surely you&#x27;ve had other complaints with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for my husband who, despite using topical Minoxidil for several years, was not seeing hair regrowth. After using this shampoo for two months, I am happy to say that the bald spot is smaller, with new hair filling in around the edges. I do not know if the shampoo alone stimulates hair growth, but adding the Lipogaine Big 3 to the Minoxidil application has made a difference. Also, it does a nice job washing hair. My husband is worth it.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this shampoo,I get the results I desire, thank you very much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 and have been having the typical receding hairline, male pattern baldness thing going since I was in early college. I started using this about a year ago and continue to buy it because it actually does seem to slow down the receding. No shampoo alone will eliminate it, so most recommend a minoxidil treatment as well. I&#x27;ve also tried Regenpure, Pura d&#x27;or, and Hair Surge (p.s. not to be confused with the famous SURGE Movement on Facebook who just brought back SURGE soda). A hair loss shampoo is not complete without one ingredient in Lipogaine Big 3, and that is Ketoconazole, (which is traditionally used as an antifungal shampoo for people with dandruff). Ketoconazole is the only clinically proven shampoo ingredient to disrupt the synthesis of testosterone to DHT in scalp hair. It is available in a handful of shampoos such as Regenepure, Revita, Lipogaine - Big 3, Hair Surge, and Nizoral. This shampoo also works as a great 2-in-1 as it actually also contains a conditioner agent, but the composition differs from most shampoo/conditioner blends as it&#x27;s not greasy and hard to wash out at all. It&#x27;s thick enough to not drip down your face when you leave it in which is also a great plus. The peppermint-like scent is a neat choice too. Overall, I recommend this hair loss shampoo over all other brands. For the price and efficacy, this shampoo is probably the smartest one to buy on the market.</li>
            <li> Smells nice , hair feels clean</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have been using it now for three months and am seeing results. i really like how it leaves my hair fuller, and moe manageable after each use.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. LOTS OF NEW HAIR STILL GROWING</li>
            <li> This shampoo definitely cleans your hair well. My one complaint is that it makes the false claim that you don&#x27;t need conditioner. I skipped conditioning and my hair felt like straw afterwards. As a rule of thumb, I think people should ALWAYS condition their hair after using a ketoconazole shampoo. Another thing I don&#x27;t really like is the fact that they peddle the whole &amp;#34;rinse and repeat&amp;#34; method. Can anyone tell me what&#x27;s the point? Regenepure doesn&#x27;t instruct you to rinse and repeat, and it has the same amount of ketoconazole. Why can&#x27;t I just apply it once, leave it in for 5 minutes, then rinse it out? Also I need to use conditioner after using this shampoo. What conditioner works well with this shampoo? Thanks.</li>
            <li> IT LITERALLY STOP THE FALLING OF HAIR I AM NOT FOOLING AROUND THE PRODUCT IS AMAZING IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS</li>
            <li> Husband loves it.  We will write a review after he has used a bottle and see if there is a difference.</li>
            <li> I love this anti-DHT shampoo. It lathers well. My hair is supper clean. My hair loss is completely stopped after one week use of this shampoo. No growth yet. I guess it will take some time. I believe I will buy this product after finish my free sample.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is awesome.  A little goes a long way, and since I&#x27;ve been using it, I see a lot less hairs in the sink.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> When my hair loss was getting noticeable, I decided to learn as much as I could about root causes and what could be done to counteract them. I read about DHT and that in order for a chance at regrowing hair, I first had to get scalp inflammation under control. I had problems with redness and scalp itch for years, and no dandruff shampoo seemed to help. I read about Nizoral and the main ingredient, ketoconazole, which was life-changing for me. Healthy hair requires a healthy scalp and Nizoral succeeded where others failed. The only problem was that Nizoral was harsh, contained SLS and other harsh chemicals and left hair kind of frazzled. A little more research led me to Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo, which also has ketoconazole, along with saw palmetto, biotin, emu oil and niacin with no SLS!&lt;br /&gt; It has a pleasant peppermint scent and leaves your hair feeling soft and full. Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo has all the ingredients to reduce inflammation, refresh and energize your scalp, and without the harsh chemicals of Nizoral or other ketoconazole shampoos. If you&#x27;re serious about getting your hair back, get your scalp in shape first. Use Lipogaine Big 3 Shampoo and feel the difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a few bottles of this shampoo and I&#x27;ve started using it for about a month. The ingredients in the shampoo are the type that you want to fight mpb hairloss and is probably the best one you can get on Amazon right now for the price. The shampoo is extremely thick so you don&#x27;t have to apply much, and the bottle can last quite a long time--I&#x27;ve used a bottle for about a month and a half now and it&#x27;s not even half empty yet so you it can definitely last a while. Even though I&#x27;ve only used it for about a month and a half the amount of hair I&#x27;m shedding has definitely decreased. Since this type of a shampoo is a topical DHT inhibitor you will want to put on the shampoo as soon as you start showering and don&#x27;t rinse it off until the end of your shower, unlike some other shampoos.</li>
            <li> Have used this shampoo for 1 month now, I like it very much. 1 bottle lasts a long time, it smells good and my scalp has improved. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I don&#x27;t have much to say that hasn&#x27;t already been said, but figured I&#x27;d throw in my two cents. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different shampoos during my adventures in hair loss - including Revita, Regenepure, Nizoral - and this is BY FAR the best. It smalls great, and I look forward to the 2-3 times a week that I use it because of how much better my hair looks over the course of that day. As to longer-term effects, I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month or so, but my hair seems like it&#x27;s much improved even on the days I don&#x27;t use it. For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m also using a minoxidil formula that includes azelaic acid (since Lipogaine had to drop azelaic acid from its topical formula), and the initial shed that I had a month ago when I started using it (which was indeed terrifying) has completely stopped at this point. In short, I highly recommend this shampoo, especially in combination with the right additional hair-loss treatments.</li>
            <li> Well along with the lipogaine treatment I have been using the big 3 shampoo for over 2 years now and my hair has completely stopped falling out, thicker than it has ever been. The shampoo I wash hair with and then reapply and let sit for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is a really great shampoo. It has awesome and healthy ingredients to help prevent hair loss and hair thinning. I really do feel that it works and it helps keep my hair looking full and strong. This is a really great product!</li>
            <li> It is a good quality shampooI suppose  but I didn&#x27;t see anything  more that clean hair and nice pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped me tremendously with my hair thinning. I am 22 years old, and when I turned 19, my long-time childhood sweetheart and I broke up; in the aftermath, I underwent extreme stress and emotional upheaval. Stress and emotional distress, of course, can trigger hair loss. Well, it happened in a big way: I went from being a big-curly haired, happy fellow to nearly bald in a little less than a year. It was quite tragic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I lived with being bald for about two years, and then this past January I found this Lipogaine shampoo. This stuff does wonders, but it grows VERY slowly unless you combine it with other products. I have used their other product, the Minoxidil dropper, along with UltraX labs Hair Rush pills, and this shampoo, and the results are incredible. My hair looks almost as good as it did a few years ago in less than 8 months time. The shampoo I will use for as long as it provides thickness and growth; however, the pills and the Minoxidil cause a lot of blood pressure issues, so be aware of that. After 6 months of continuous use with the pills (the pills are the worst thing, btw), my blood pressure was regularly in pre-hypertension ranges; now, using only the shampoo, my hair still looks fine and I&#x27;m back at very healthy, regular pressures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: be careful using it because you might give yourself heart disease during prolonged use, but in the short-term, the combination of those three aforementioned products will grow you a lot of hair, and continuous use of the shampoo will help you keep said hair.</li>
            <li> It feels good on my hair, but I don&#x27;t know whether it prevents my hair from losing.</li>
            <li> This product takes a few months before it starts working. I use this in combination with the regular Kirkland minoxidil due to its added ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is that it is very expensive, so it’s not really worth the extra money. The difference is not that noticeable from just using Kirkland minoxidil.</li>
            <li> My hair felt thicker/fuller right after the first use! Just for the appearance alone this shampoo is worth it to me.  I waited a month to see if anything changed before I made a comment, and I believe it is working! The balding spot on the crown seams to shrink and it is less shiny, which tells me new growth is popping up.  I am planning on continuing with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> this shampoo had a very adverse effect on the condition of my hair; I cannot continue to use it; so I am going to complain to you about the non-return policy because I got two of them (one by mistake from pushing the buy button twice!</li>
            <li> Great product, works as advertised</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. You may notice a slight increase in hair falling out as it causes the hair underneath to grow faster.  These hairs would have fallen out on their own any ways. It is great quality and again really works.</li>
            <li> I started using Lipogaine during a time when Nizoral was not being produced.  Now that Nizoral is back, I have decided to stick with Lipogaine.  I have found that it is helping me to maintain what I have and slow down the process of MPB.  It does not magically grow your hair back, but it is useful when combined with minoxidil.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo with Ketoconazole for hair loss prevention and without harmful ingredients like sodium lauryl sulfates. Not only does Lipogaine Big 3 contain a high concentration of Ketoconazole (2%) it also has a lot of natural ingredients which leaves my hair soft. The only negative effect of this shampoo is that with overuse (more than 3 times a week) it may cause scalp irritation. Overall a good hair loss shampoo and I will definitely continue to buy.</li>
            <li> This is the one of the best shampoo to use if you&#x27;re gonna try to fight male pattern baldness. After using for a few weeks hairloss has not halted completely but it has slowed down. Unfortunately I have a receding hairline which seems to be irreversible. This shampoo does a good job in making hair look thicker. I would say add this to any hair loss regimen stick with a while see what results you get. One thing I do is when I apply the shampoo on hairline I use dermaroller to help the shampoo absorb. Seems to be a little more effective in helping shampoo absorb into scalp. You will need another product to encourage hair growth like minoxdil. I been using essential oils. But think I will give the Lipogaine minoxidil a try, along with the shampoo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will keep you guys posted.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t anything great</li>
            <li> This is a great product better than the traditional Rogaine.  Quite pricey but works.  Because it needs to be used consistent for long periods of time, only wish it can be purchased cheaper and in bulk.</li>
            <li> Definitely like this shampoo and is the only hair loss shampoo I use. Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair dry or anything. Can style it however you want and the fact it has ketoconazole makes it even better.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is the best shampoo for hair loss. I have been using it for about a yr now. I also use finasteride and rogaine. i started seeing results about 5-6 months in. now i rarely see any hair when i shower. on top of that it smells good. way better than regenpure. people complain about being too pricey. one bottle should last you about 2.5 month. that&#x27;s only $10 a month.</li>
            <li> It was a recent purchase but I can say after 2 wks.. the hair is not coming out like it was.. it has slowed down.. so hopefully this is as advertised</li>
            <li> I used this in conjunction with Procerin and Minoxidil and saw little improvement, although the listed ingredients of Lipogaine all have sound science behind them.  I switched to Hair Chi scalp treatment and Minoxidil plus Lipogaine and things improved dramatically.  I may continue to use Lipogaine as another weapon in the arsenal to combat the damaging effects of DHT, but by itself it did not turn my situation around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product 3 or 4 times, so , it is too soon for me to tell whether or not it is working.  Just as the other reviewers have commented, the consistency of the shampoo is thick.  The first time you lather your hair and scalp it does not lather very well, but, the second time you lather it is a rich lather.  I do not understand the reasons for that.  However, I am willing to continue to use the shampoo because of the positive comments, and to allow it to work, and hopefully in the very near future, I will be able to provide more information.  I am only giving it a three star because I am in the early stages of usage.</li>
            <li> I definitely can see the difference. I&#x27;ve been using the Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo for 6 months now and my hair is fuller and thicker than it has been in years. Great Product, Recommended!</li>
            <li> I have had this product a little more than a month. It smells great, lathers great, and gets my hair so clean. No hair restoration product is an instant solution, and I have not been using it as much as the recommended frequency. I use it with a combination of Rogaine, and I feel if I used it as directed, I would definitely see results. So far, I can only say my hair is not falling out anymore. Even if I&#x27;m not growing lost hair back, I still feel confident that this product, used in conjunction with Rogaine, slowed if not totally stopped my hair loss. I can&#x27;t complain about the price because I was almost willing to put down 5 grand with Bosley. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I have used for problem scalp.  Leaves scalp feeling great after use.  Hair noticeably thicker.  Gets rid of scalp itch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for months, cause I believe the ketoconazole to clean dht.  I can&#x27;t really tell you for sure how much it works, cause I combine it with using minoxidil.  But, between the two, I haven&#x27;t lost more hair; and it does look like there is a little more.&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I used Regenepure and that left my hair flat. Probably due to the aloe.  But, if you have thin hair; you don&#x27;t want it to be flat.  So, you have to use another shampoo after to put the volume back in it.  And, I dont remember that shampoo leaving my hair feeling that clean. Not only does Big 3 shampoo make your hair feel clean and have volume, but it also leaves your hair feeling soft and mildly conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wish is that you could get it in bigger bottles to save some money.</li>
            <li> Decidec to pick this up and use it in addition to the Lipogaine Intensive Treatment. Since combining the two products, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed some improvement. Not only with my hair loss, but also the thickness and fullness of my hair. Since beginning the shampoo treatment my hair has not only became thicker, but I have noticed a healthier, less dry scalp.   Can&#x27;t recombined these enough!</li>
            <li> Love the product! Good size, and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot. My hair feels soft after using as well!</li>
            <li> I\\&quot;ve used the product for 9 months now. My hair has got in a little thicker but not by much.</li>
            <li> The product seems to have stabilized hair loss with a bit of new growth.  Tired of the expensive an messy Minoxidil, it seems to reduce production of oil on my scalp as well.  I have short hair, so get about 1.5 months out of a bottle.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something with ketoconazole and no salicylic acid that I could use as a dandruff shampoo, and this fits the bill perfectly. It works well for that purpose. The other ketoconazole shampoos that are meant to be for dandruff irritate my scalp too much, but this doesn&#x27;t bother it at all.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for hair ! my hair feels soft, smooth and shiny after using this shampoo and my hair stopped falling after 2-3 weeks of using this shampoo. It smells really nice and feels very gentle for hair. I definitely recommend this shampoo for people who are experiencing hair loss !</li>
            <li> Product came in good condition and as expected.</li>
            <li> too soon to tell just used twice but it lathers well and i super LOVE the tingly  feel on scalp.</li>
            <li> I have  used it for a year and it slowed it down or stoped it.</li>
            <li> A very gentle &amp; cleansing solution, seems to compliment the Lipogaine Hair treatment.  Smells great and is effective at eliminating dandruff.  Although this solution alone will probably not stimulate hair regrowth, it certainly does not aggravate the scalp or cause irritation like other intense shampoos.</li>
            <li> At age 20, my hair began thinning.  I&#x27;ve tried various things over the past 20 years, from a brief Propecia experiment that I abandoned due to the prospect of &amp;#34;certain sexual side-effects&amp;#34; to propylene-glycol based Rogaine, which caused lesions and actually accelerated he hair loss.  Over the past year, I&#x27;ve started using non-pg Rogain (foam from Costco) and Lipogaine.  I have thicker healthier hair than I have had in years.  Lipogaine doesn&#x27;t feel chemical-y, smells great, and leaves my hair feeling thick and soft.  And you get a lot out of a pretty small bottle.  Great product that I plan to continue using as my exclusive shampoo.  No burning or side effects, even leaving it on my scalp for extended periods.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for 3 months every other day combined with the minoxidil solution (started to use the solution 4 months before I started to use the shampoo), my hairline definitely looks better than it was 6 months ago. This shampoo is the best boost combined with minoxidil and finasteride, plus it does not dry the hair unlike the other ketoconazole shampoos. On contrary to a few people here I like the smell and one bottle lasts for nearly 1.5 months for me (I have medium long hair with norwood 2 hairline). Definitely the best hair loss shampoo I have ever used and believe me I have been fighting hair loss actively for 6 years now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Regenpure for two years now, and it has probably slowed my hair loss quite a bit.  It&#x27;s a good shampoo, but I don&#x27;t get as much coverage as when I use Lipogaine Big 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think they&#x27;re both effective, but I prefer Lipogaine because it foams up better (and it smells better).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t regrow hair for most people probably, but in terms of helping slow down hair loss, I believe it helps.</li>
            <li> I use this product regularly, works great for me and hair feels very good and smooth after each shampoo, it is good to know it contains all the great ingredients that are good for hair.</li>
            <li> Gave away and am still waiting for opinion.</li>
            <li> Originally, I bought Lipogaine for my husband. But when I saw hair regrowth on him, I thought I&#x27;d try it for myself. See, I have really fine hair and all of the time I spend outdoors has taken its toll on thickness. I started shampooing with Lipogaine a month ago and the complements on my salon gorgeous hair won&#x27;t stop! Before, all I could do is ponytail or straighten and go. Now I really have the Big Sexy Hair to match my favorite hairspray. Love Lipogaine, my husband loves Lipogaine. We would recommend it without hesitation - and have!</li>
            <li> Lipogaine Big 3 is by far the best shampoo on the market.  It leaves hair thick with volume and soft to the touch.  It is not harsh like some of the other shampoos on the market as I use it three to four times per week with great results.  I highly recommend this over many of the other out there on the market.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient,  Ketconizol (Sp?) does actually cause hair growth. It kills fungus on your scalp. It has other good ingredients for your hair as well. I didn&#x27;t like the fact it doesn&#x27;t lather well but that&#x27;s probably because it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of bad sulfates..</li>
            <li> I have purchased two bottles of this and I just started in on the second bottle. It seems like the ingredients has changed because this bottle seems less sticky and more like normal shampoo. I use this stuff at least once a day and always put it in at the beginning of my shower and rinse it out at the end. So far I haven&#x27;t been able to seen any conclusive results. I&#x27;m using this shampoo with kirkland %5 minoxidil. Other than that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell bad or anything and I figure it is worth a try to see if it works.</li>
            <li> Using this shampoo feels great. It will make your hair feel great, fuller. Just follow the instruction, it will help you keep what you have &amp; regrow new hairs. This is the best shampoo I have used so far.</li>
            <li> Lipogaine 3 lathers up very nicely without the harsh ingredients of a regular shampoo.  It also does not leave my scalp feeling dry or irritated.  My hair does not have that firm sticky feeling to it while during or after using Lipogaine 3, so I do not feel the need for a conditioner.  I believe that is largely due to the Aloe ingredient in the shampoo.  Following the instructions to lather and rinse twice while massaging and waiting for the amount of time recommended is also very important to get an optimum result.  I use this shampoo at least every other day while applying Lipogaine for Men Intensive Treatment 2 times a day, and my hair fall out has been significantly less.  I also notice an overall thicker and healthier head of hair.  I definately recommend this shampoo for anyone in any stage of hair loss to buy this shampoo.  Do not wait if you are just starting to notice thinning.  This shampoo is just as good as any high end shampoo without the harsh ingredients, along with the only ingredient proven to stop hair loss included.  The only reason I do not give this a 4 star rating is the price, but I think most of the shampoos on the market are overpriced.  For the quality that you get along with the actual positive results in fighting hair loss, Lipogaine 3 is well worth buying.</li>
            <li> definitely helps improve thickness when used with the lipogaine product, will continue to use it</li>
            <li> Very good product. Bought it with lipogaine oil, I apply it few minutes before going to shower. I have noticed hair loss stopped / decreased, after few months of usage . I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works great. Can be used more often than Nizoral and without the unwanted side effect of leaving your hair feeling like straw.</li>
            <li> this shampoo is amazing, it stopped my hair loss, and I got rid of my dandruff problems, my hair is now thicker, every bottle lasts two months, in my case.&lt;br /&gt;I love this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willy Z.</li>
            <li> I found the Lipogaine shampoo very helpful.  Must be diligent in applying it along with the Lipogaine solution and eating your daily hair vitamins&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;see results in 3-6 months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which ingredients are the \\&quot;Big 3\\&quot; but it has some good ones. Particularly the ketoconazole and emu oil. I also like that the cleaning agents are mild. Aside from the ingredients, it&#x27;s a great shampoo. It&#x27;s very thick so it doesn&#x27;t take much and the bottle will probably last for a few months. As other people have said, it foams up well and seems to thicken your hair. I like the peppermint scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep in mind that using a shampoo isn&#x27;t enough to stop MPB. I also take Propecia and use minoxidil (both Rogaine Foam and Lipogaine). I *really* like the Lipogaine. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple months but there are definitely new hairs coming in along the front. Not many, but it&#x27;s a start, and no other minoxidil formulation has done that for me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo appears to be a great product, but it contains Salicylic Acid, which is not listed in the ingredient list on Amazon. Had I seen it listed there, I would have not bought it. The use of SA in a shampoo formula was questioned by another reviewer here, and I would not want to take any chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I cannot find conclusive researches online on the impact of the use of SA on hair, I find it strange that SA is the only missing ingredient from the list, when compared to the label on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to hear from Lipogaine or any experts on this subject. Until then, it stays on my shelf, untouched.</li>
            <li> This is my first review on anything so I hope it helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 40 y/o and have been thinning for a few years. I used Rogain for about a year but didn&#x27;t quite notice too much of an improvement. I used Lipogain for about three months and noticed that I was getting \\&quot;undergrowth\\&quot; on the area where my hair was thinning most, middle front potion. I was pretty excited about the growth to say the least but it was still kind of thin and didn&#x27;t grow as fast.  I like Lipogain so I figured what the heck let me get another of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, Big 3 helped out a lot in my case. What it does is clean and \\&quot;pre-treat\\&quot; the area for the Lipogain application. Now, I have no clue what it would do for my hair without the combined use so I&#x27;ll describe what I think about the product without bringing hair growth into the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is very thick and it takes some work to move it around and get it all over your head; not a bad thing just a description. It does clean your scalp very throughly however and you will definitely know that everything save skin is washed off. The negative portion is that it dries out your scalp a little too much and it might cause \\&quot;that look\\&quot; if you don&#x27;t apply conditioner. I use one that is working awesome for me but I don&#x27;t know about putting the name of other companies within product reviews. Anyway, that is the only negative portion. I do have another positive comment though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have kind of oily scalp and at times I get painful pimple like growths on my head. I have been given Clindamycin to treat it. Well, when I started to use this shampoo the need for me to use the medicine was drastically reduced. I have gone about 3 months without having to do daily applications of medicine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only give it a minus 1 star because of the over drying effect it had on me. Once I started using it every day if I didn&#x27;t use conditioner a day or two my scalp would look like i was peeling. But other than that it is a good investment. I would say if you are concerned about regrowing hair use it with Lipogain or try one out first and then compliment it with the other.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. After having hair transplant surgery it&#x27;s important that I take care of my hair accordingly and lipogaine does exactly that! Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo really works.  I have been using it for over 2 years and it has helped to keep my hair growing and healthy.  I use it everyday and it has kept my hair from falling out and has improved the amount of hair growing.  This product combined with the Lipogaine scalp treatment has kept my hair healthy and not falling out.  I highly recommend both products if you have hair loss.</li>
            <li> I received this and I am very pleased so far. The hair and the scalp are looking good. There is no more redness or irritation to the scalp as I started using it daily, and it seems as if the hair stopped thinning. All in all, it is worth trying it!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Noticed less hair on hands which only means more stayed on head.  Leaves hair smelling nice and clean with full volume.</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo, smells nice, and doesn&#x27;t leave hair oily. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This hair product really works for me and never switching to another shampoo again. I have noticed new hair growth, and it&#x27;s thicker and appears fuller. I would not be saying this if it weren&#x27;t true, and recently my fiance noticed my hair growth as well. I kid you not, Lipogaine shampoo is a must for hair loss and thinning hair. I just don&#x27;t give out 5 stars, but because of my results, it deserves 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Lipogaine Big 3 is very effective in preventing hair loss. I have used Lipogaine for over a year and volume of my hair have noticeably increased. My scalp is now clean and dandruff free.</li>
            <li> this shampoo is pretty great.  i&#x27;m not big into products, but this shampoo and the topical product from lipogaine have definitely started the hair regrowth process (i&#x27;ve got the fine white hairs in the thinning areas).  also, i don&#x27;t really use a conditioner with this, so that&#x27;s just one less thing i have to buy!  great product.</li>
            <li> As a now 60 year old man, I have been combatting age related hair loss, proactively, for the past ten years through the use of the following 3 products: Propecia 1mg; Rogaine 5mg (foam); and Lipogaine Big 3 Premium Hair Loss Shampoo. When all 3 are in simultaneous use, my hair loss is zero; forfeit one, however, hair loss will usually become evident one to two weeks thereafter. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo.  Using this combined with a microneedle roller I have not lost any more hair and have even re-grown some.  It also completely got rid of my dandruff!</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo, I&#x27;ve noticed that it has slowed down hair loss but has not seemed to grow any hair back. I dont think they claim this product regrows hair, but I have seen a huge difference in the amount of hair that is lost. I will continue to use and recommend this product to those who want to stop premature hair loss.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo made with the best ingredients to stop thinning hair. Love the way it feels when you leave it in for 5 minutes. Leaves hair fresh , clean and healthy. Lipogaine Big 3 is great when combine with Lipogaine 3 in hair treatment</li>
            <li> I was certainly skeptical but after ~ 2 months of using 3 times per week I have noticed less hair coming out in the shower. Lipogaine Shampoo also lathers up nicely, smells good and makes my hair and scalp feel very clean. Definitely worth a try and one bottle, even though only 8 ounces, should last a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through 1 bottle (lasted about a month), and I haven&#x27;t see any improvements to my hairline.  I&#x27;m still thinning in the front.  However I like the smell and I like that it makes my hair soft and can style it easy.  I also tried Bosley.  Bosley is cheaper but I hated it because it made my hair feel all tangled up.  I&#x27;m giving it a 3.  Right now I just bought Hair Surge shampoo.  It costs more than LIpogaine and if I don&#x27;t see good results with Hair Surge, then I think I will give LIpogaine another try.</li>
            <li> Good product, nice minty smell and definitely feel as if less hair is lost during showers</li>
            <li> I heard about this product with my friend, so I decided to try and so far I&#x27;m so happy with it, and I would recomended too.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product and I feel the hair loss has been reduced.</li>
            <li> The formula seems to have changed recently.It is much gentler and no longer stings the scalp.For best results wash hair twice instead of using conditioner.I found the product to be the best shampoo I have used and have been using now for over a year.Use as part of your daily regimin.</li>
            <li> 26 year old male with thinning on top with a receding hair line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some weird reason Nizoral has stopped manufacturing their shampoo, so I needed another shampoo with Ketoconazole. I came across Lipogaine and Regenpure on Amazon and decided to use Lipogaine first because it had more added ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it seemed pricey, but when you add it up, it costs about the same as Nizoral per ounce. I saw Nizoral on Drugstore selling at 12 dollars for four ounces, and now they don&#x27;t even carry it anymore. Hopefully it&#x27;ll restock soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8oz may not seem like alot but if you use this twice a week this bottle should last 2 months or so. I&#x27;m going to use it every other day for now with my Rogaine foam (I also take 380mg of Saw Palmetto).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the shampoo is very \\&quot;honey\\&quot; like. It&#x27;s thick and sticky, so I would advise rubbing it in between your hands first before lathering your scalp. It does work up a nice rich lather once you get it going. It says to wash once and then wash again, but leave it in for 3-4 minutes. I just wash before with a sulfate free shampoo and then wash again with the lipogaine, leaving in for the suggested time. It&#x27;s very cool and minty feeling. Obviously the peppermint oil in action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a very bad dandruff problem and this instantly helped with the itching and dry scalp after just one use. I was very pleased with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Havent used it long enough to see if it&#x27;ll slow or stop the hair loss, lets go ahead and wait to see if it does. I don&#x27;t think it really thickens your hair as some other reviews have stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say its worth buying as a replacement to Nizoral, but still nothing beats Nizoral, that stuff is great.</li>
            <li> bad product, wont buy this again. makes yorr hair fall.</li>
            <li> no problems, great service!</li>
            <li> Within a couple days of using, my itchy scalp was gone. I had been dealing with it for too long. This product is great, highly recommended. It costs a little more but is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> After using their minoxidil solution for months, I decided to get this shampoo. I started getting a redicioulsy bad itch and my hair shed got worse! I gave it two weeks and probably going to throw the shampoo away.  Highly dissapointed.</li>
