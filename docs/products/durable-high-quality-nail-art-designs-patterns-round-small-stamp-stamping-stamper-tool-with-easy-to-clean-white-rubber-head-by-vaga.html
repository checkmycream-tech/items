            <li> I was desperate to see how well it stamped, so I tried it anyways.  </li>

            <li> This stamper is very sticky, soft and squishy, however I did have to prime it but after that it seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> The white rubber nail art design stamper was junk. the white  rubber part was not attached to the stamper and was merely just thrown in the bag and shipped.</li>
            <li> Received this product in a timely manner.  Works well and I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Works great after its primed a bit.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for marshmallow stampers these are it! Be careful though as with most marsh&#x27;s they are very sticky and attract dust, hair, etc. very easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a squishy, but it&#x27;s tiny compared to the original squishy stampers. Not sure it will work for my long nails.</li>
            <li> LOVE this little stamper. Super squishy and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that I was getting the XL &amp;#34;squishy&amp;#34; stamper, so you can imagine my surprise when it came and it was an extra small!  I was desperate to see how well it stamped, so I tried it anyways.  It works GREAT!!!  I have very large nail beds, so you can imagine my surprise when I was actually able to get a design to cover my ENTIRE thumb nail with this!!!  I will absolutely be ordering a few more to have on hand!  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get this to work for me. So sad about that.</li>
            <li> I love this thing!!! I wish I could give it all of the stars!!!! So soft and squishy and works beautifully after priming! What a great deal!!!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic squishy soft stamper!</li>
            <li> Yay! Soft squishy and sticky. My new favorite.</li>
            <li> Nice soft marshmallowy stamper..works great</li>
            <li> I love all of the VAGA stampers in every shape and texture.  It&#x27;s hard to find a maker of softer stampers and VAGA has done it!  I will continue to buy VAGA stampers!</li>
            <li> It does an okay job. I primed it up a few times and the image still didn&#x27;t transfer very well. I gave it 2 stars because I didn&#x27;t spend a whole lot. The XL is much better. It took forever to arrive.</li>
            <li> I wrecked this stamper trying to prime it. Don&#x27;t use acetone on the stamper.</li>
            <li> It doesnt work well. I am barely able to grab the design from the pallet on to this.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these they are to gummy for me, however if that is the way you want your stamper then this product is for you i did receive these a week early which i loved  but i wont be using them that is why i only gave it two stars.</li>
            <li> Super squishy and sticky! Love it!! but be aware that they dont describe this as a marshmellow so you could get a squishy firm I guess, I hope they continue to sell the marshmellow.</li>
            <li> It sucks, nothing I tried would stick on it. Total waste of money. I read a few people saying to prime it, ?? with what, it should have came with instructions if it needed some type of priming</li>
