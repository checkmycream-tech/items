            <li>one does not turn the water colors, but it smells amazing, and is great for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After laying in the bath for maybe 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Good job Village Naturals, keep up the good work.  </li>
            <li>and I loved this one, even my husband commented on the smell.  </li>
            <li>oh so good.</li>
            <li>It makes the water smell so good and relaxing</li>
            <li>Loved this however, it arrived with the lid off and the bath crystals were all over the box.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and feels nice!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I love the smell!</li>
            <li>Love this company!</li>
            <li>Will buy more!</li>
            <li>These salts smell great and are a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li>P.S. Have a glass of scotch while bathing, the fragrance adds a nice flavor while sipping.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make the water bubbly or murky either which was nice.</li>
            <li>I bought this for when I do my own pedicures.</li>
            <li>Loving it.</li>
            <li>Nicely scented too.</li>
            <li>Wonderful scent, very relaxing</li>
            <li>Another reviewer liked this but found the scent to be &amp;#34;quite strong&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells great and makes you feel clean when you get out of the bath.</li>
            <li>I put just a cap full into each bath and it smells great and seems to soften skin.</li>
            <li>The price is great for this bath salt because I&#x27;ve experienced some cheaper bath salts have an intense chemical smell or the fragrance isn&#x27;t strong.</li>
            <li>These products are wonderful and do leave my skin feeling soft and</li>
            <li>This product makes my feet feel soft and easier to manage with an excellent combination of scents</li>
            <li>This is a perfect adult fragrance...</li>
            <li>Although it is quite strong, it is not at all overwhelming!</li>
            <li>These bath salts have such a delightful light scent and really leave my skin feeling wonderful after a soak in the bath.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like many bath products that have a very strong scent because they occasionally trigger my headaches, but this is just about perfect.  </li>
            <li>And with me doing my own pedicures the foot bath doesn&#x27;t require much of the salt to fill a room just pleasantly without being too overbearing.</li>
            <li>Fills the whole bathroom with a great scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to get out of the jar.  </li>
            <li>I was worried about the scent being overwhelming</li>
            <li>Love the pricing, but I am upset with the packaging.</li>
            <li>I wish there was more for the price</li>
            <li>Very refreshing and sweet.</li>
            <li>Lovely skin softening bath salts.</li>
            <li>Relaxing, refreshing, &amp; enjoyable.</li>
            <li>Again this is safe to use in our whirlpool tub.</li>
            <li>I would have to say this is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>and she says that it leaves her skin silky smooth as advertised!  </li>
            <li>My mom purchased this for me since I love taking relaxing baths!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This bath salt is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It is more of a powder then a salt</li>
            <li>Love these</li>
            <li>Generally, I turn to Lavender for a comforting scent, but I have to say that this one has been the most relaxing and pleasant for me!</li>
            <li>I was ordering this for a gift from Amazon, and I was very excited for it to arrive.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice and light but not so light it fades.</li>
            <li>but wow it feels great and the scent is not overpowering....</li>
            <li>They smell so good and really soften my skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for a pedicure, you barely even have to use a buffer or work on it yourself!</li>
            <li>Great product, would definitely recommend.    </li>
            <li>This really does soften your skin and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Enhances a soothing and relaxing bath and leaves skin feelin smooth.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly, lightly scented, not cloying.</li>
            <li>It really does smell nice</li>
            <li>Feel relaxed and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this product as I listened to my favorite music and really relaxed while my muscles soaked.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased with this bath soak and highly recommend it for anyone who doesn&#x27;t appreciate overwhelming scents in the tub.</li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t have to clean up the product I paid for.</li>
            <li>and I was able to contact the actual company to send me some from their own warehouse, which did come  in time to gift it, and I kept the others in a jar for myself.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t yet had the pleasure to try all of Village Naturals products, but from everything I&#x27;ve ever tried before in my life, this is BY FAR my favorite body soak!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much, it just doesn&#x27;t feel right to take a bath without it!</li>
            <li>And dissolves rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I use it pretty often with no complaints!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>Why can&#x27;t the producer of the product seal the top properly - perhaps strong tape?  </li>
            <li>It is light smell and very soothing.</li>
            <li>and I love how soft my skin feels after a bath.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fresh and calming with no super-sweet notes.</li>
            <li>I really like it but in order to get the full effects, you have to use a lot of the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sensual, smooth and gentle.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and will order this bath salt again in other fragrances.</li>
            <li>I mix this product with equal part epsom salt for the bath so that I can stretch how many baths</li>
            <li>Obviously they knew about it because they taped all the holes in the box so now most of the product was in the tape.</li>
            <li>It is challenging to return to my bathe area and find the product doesn&#x27;t last that long - lol - because my entire family loves it!!  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells fantastic and my skin feels incredibly soft after using it.</li>
            <li>Only one jar arrived OK.  </li>
            <li>I actually bought it to share with my husband, to inspire him to pamper himself more.</li>
            <li>and I like that it is safe for daily usage.  </li>
            <li>It arrives in sealed bags with the top open inside the bag and much of the product spilled.  </li>
            <li>I use in the bath and can still smell the gorgeous scent lingering for a few hours afterward!</li>
            <li>I, too, am very particular in what scents I like</li>
            <li>Once the tub is a little below the halfway mark, I turn the water to warm (room temperature) for the rest.      </li>
            <li>Afterwards, my body felt relieved and muscles didn&#x27;t ache as much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really fragrant</li>
            <li>Very relaxing touch to any bath.</li>
            <li>Very aromatic.</li>
            <li>Scent doesn&#x27;t linger as much as cheaper quality salts.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use too much to get the fragrance, which lasts a long time in the bathroom and stays lightly on your skin.</li>
            <li>Would recommend especially for those sensitive to strong smells like</li>
            <li>It is a decent sized bottle, so it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very mild, not overwhelming or invading at all, but just right for me.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I had always bought these from Target for less than $5.00 a jar &amp; the Amazon price is higher, but I am just glad to be able to purchase them!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick at all.</li>
            <li>The aroma that fills the entire bathroom is so fresh &amp; the body soak makes you feel so relaxed.    </li>
            <li>I plan on buying a few more.</li>
            <li>It does make a very slight difference in the bath water, but the  salts more irritate my skin than anything, so I can&#x27;t stand to \\&quot;relax?\\&quot; in the water for more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try several scents of the Village Natural body soaks, and I was surprised to discover that the White Tea &amp; Jasmine turned out to be a favorite.  </li>
            <li>I have been buying up all kinds of bath salts for my jacuzzi tub in my new home</li>
            <li>So, I started up the bath, only using hot water so the bathroom begins to steam.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased the same salt, the same weight and brand for $3.50 in our local Wall-mart in Huntsville, AL :-)</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>love this product and have used one version of their salts for the past 13 years.</li>
            <li>I consider myself to be quite particular about scents and smells, especially since I am very prone to migraines.</li>
            <li>The aroma is therapeutic to me, especially after working overtime for 3 months on my job, although I don&#x27;t feel pretty, this softens me again and brings back the real me.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth and my legs muscles aren&#x27;t as tight after my run tonight.</li>
            <li>It was sealed but only half full!</li>
            <li>This was a trick I learned when I ran cross country in high school.  </li>
            <li>For being a guy, it&#x27;s hard to admit to taking baths, but this is a huge stress reliever.</li>
            <li>I do suggested using small amounts if you&#x27;re also purchasing for the same reason as sometimes using too much can have a very intense smell.</li>
            <li>better than regular epsom salt at preserving body moisture, but it has the flowery scent that I am having a hard time getting used to based on my regular use of quality essentials oils for health and wellbeing.  </li>
            <li>I seem to have a hard time finding bath salts that are Dead Sea salts and actually smell good.  </li>
            <li>I found it to be a light and delicate scent that I also find pleasing.  </li>
            <li>As the hot water is filling the tub, I sprinkled about a handful and a half into the water.  </li>
            <li>I put them in a separate hard plastic container and the salt etched it, so store it in glass or the original bottle.</li>
            <li>The smell is not over bearing it is subtle and sweet.</li>

            <li> It really does smell nice</li>
            <li> Feel relaxed and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product as I listened to my favorite music and really relaxed while my muscles soaked.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with this bath soak and highly recommend it for anyone who doesn&#x27;t appreciate overwhelming scents in the tub.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have to clean up the product I paid for.</li>
            <li> and I was able to contact the actual company to send me some from their own warehouse, which did come  in time to gift it, and I kept the others in a jar for myself.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet had the pleasure to try all of Village Naturals products, but from everything I&#x27;ve ever tried before in my life, this is BY FAR my favorite body soak!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much, it just doesn&#x27;t feel right to take a bath without it!</li>
            <li> And dissolves rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I use it pretty often with no complaints!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t the producer of the product seal the top properly - perhaps strong tape?  </li>
            <li> It is light smell and very soothing.</li>
            <li> and I love how soft my skin feels after a bath.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fresh and calming with no super-sweet notes.</li>
            <li> I really like it but in order to get the full effects, you have to use a lot of the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sensual, smooth and gentle.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased and will order this bath salt again in other fragrances.</li>
            <li> I mix this product with equal part epsom salt for the bath so that I can stretch how many baths</li>
            <li> Obviously they knew about it because they taped all the holes in the box so now most of the product was in the tape.</li>
            <li> It is challenging to return to my bathe area and find the product doesn&#x27;t last that long - lol - because my entire family loves it!!  </li>
            <li> This stuff smells fantastic and my skin feels incredibly soft after using it.</li>
            <li> Only one jar arrived OK.  </li>
            <li> I actually bought it to share with my husband, to inspire him to pamper himself more.</li>
            <li> and I like that it is safe for daily usage.  </li>
            <li> It arrives in sealed bags with the top open inside the bag and much of the product spilled.  </li>
            <li> I use in the bath and can still smell the gorgeous scent lingering for a few hours afterward!</li>
            <li> I, too, am very particular in what scents I like</li>
            <li> Once the tub is a little below the halfway mark, I turn the water to warm (room temperature) for the rest.      </li>
            <li> Afterwards, my body felt relieved and muscles didn&#x27;t ache as much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really fragrant</li>
            <li> Very relaxing touch to any bath.</li>
            <li> Very aromatic.</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t linger as much as cheaper quality salts.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use too much to get the fragrance, which lasts a long time in the bathroom and stays lightly on your skin.</li>
            <li> Would recommend especially for those sensitive to strong smells like</li>
            <li> It is a decent sized bottle, so it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very mild, not overwhelming or invading at all, but just right for me.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I had always bought these from Target for less than $5.00 a jar &amp; the Amazon price is higher, but I am just glad to be able to purchase them!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick at all.</li>
            <li> The aroma that fills the entire bathroom is so fresh &amp; the body soak makes you feel so relaxed.    </li>
            <li> I plan on buying a few more.</li>
            <li> It does make a very slight difference in the bath water, but the  salts more irritate my skin than anything, so I can&#x27;t stand to \\&quot;relax?\\&quot; in the water for more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try several scents of the Village Natural body soaks, and I was surprised to discover that the White Tea &amp; Jasmine turned out to be a favorite.  </li>
            <li> I have been buying up all kinds of bath salts for my jacuzzi tub in my new home</li>
            <li> So, I started up the bath, only using hot water so the bathroom begins to steam.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased the same salt, the same weight and brand for $3.50 in our local Wall-mart in Huntsville, AL :-)</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> love this product and have used one version of their salts for the past 13 years.</li>
            <li> I consider myself to be quite particular about scents and smells, especially since I am very prone to migraines.</li>
            <li> The aroma is therapeutic to me, especially after working overtime for 3 months on my job, although I don&#x27;t feel pretty, this softens me again and brings back the real me.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth and my legs muscles aren&#x27;t as tight after my run tonight.</li>
            <li> It was sealed but only half full!</li>
            <li> This was a trick I learned when I ran cross country in high school.  </li>
            <li> For being a guy, it&#x27;s hard to admit to taking baths, but this is a huge stress reliever.</li>
            <li> I do suggested using small amounts if you&#x27;re also purchasing for the same reason as sometimes using too much can have a very intense smell.</li>
            <li> better than regular epsom salt at preserving body moisture, but it has the flowery scent that I am having a hard time getting used to based on my regular use of quality essentials oils for health and wellbeing.  </li>
            <li> I seem to have a hard time finding bath salts that are Dead Sea salts and actually smell good.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be a light and delicate scent that I also find pleasing.  </li>
            <li> As the hot water is filling the tub, I sprinkled about a handful and a half into the water.  </li>
            <li> I put them in a separate hard plastic container and the salt etched it, so store it in glass or the original bottle.</li>
            <li> The smell is not over bearing it is subtle and sweet.</li>
            <li> It softens the water slightly and makes your skin very soft when you get out.  </li>
            <li> but the scent does not last as long as I hoped it would and it does not come with a measuring cup.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys taking long baths.</li>
            <li> The jar states fragrance lingers in your bath room long after a bath.</li>
            <li> By the time you got your nose close enough to the water to smell it, you had a wet nose.</li>
            <li> This has been going on for a long time</li>
            <li> Now they wrap every single jar in a tied plastic bag.</li>
            <li> Two lids of my nine jar order were loose.  </li>
            <li> My skin definitely felt smoother and there was a slight aroma in the bathroom afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It would only take the person packing to ensure a tight the lid.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is I didn&#x27;t smell the white tea.</li>
            <li> The small handful of the White Tea and Jasmine leaves the bath water scented, and gives the bathroom a slight hint of scent that lingers throughout the bath and for a short time afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy the lavender or eucalyptus body soak, but having tried the white tea and jasmine, I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I am now going to find the other scents and buy those too.</li>
            <li> When I got the product it was in a box that was too small and there wasn&#x27;t enough packaging (bubble wrap, packing peanuts, etc.)</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t have any problems with the packaging during shipping, like some other reviewers did.</li>
            <li> I have learned to do this with any bottles of liquid I buy in the store; e.g., bleach, due to one accident.</li>
            <li> Makes the long day you just had a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another reviewer complained about the jar arriving open.  </li>
            <li> I will never use another body soak again...except to try one of their other scents!</li>
            <li> Just not true.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for myself a little spoil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the other two reviewers said there was no scent.</li>
            <li> I can tell when someone else is using it because I can smell it through the door and down the hall!</li>
            <li> I would NOT order this product again; I feel it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> But since Amazon doesn&#x27;t want to do that...the way they &amp;#34;solved&amp;#34; the problem was with a wasted plastic bag for</li>
            <li> IF ONLY the people packing the jars twisted the jar lid tight, that would solve the problem and save plastic.  </li>
            <li> and the dead skin was coming off, literally, from my heel!</li>
            <li> The smell was subtle but not too little that you could hardly smell anything.  </li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t much smell at all, and I was rather disappointed.  </li>
            <li> After a hard days lift and cardio, my muscles get a bit sore.  </li>
            <li> I tried some of the competitors and their scents were hardly there.</li>
            <li> Sadly I got 2 jars of the White Tea and they are just a disappointing waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to the smell</li>
            <li> shipping from Amazon is not great.  </li>
            <li> Since the jars are extremely thin flimsy plastic,</li>
            <li> Due to the poor container and bad packaging, one jar broke and spilled out all over.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers   are smelling, maybe I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m angry.</li>
            <li> I am just really sad with Amazon for not giving me a discount or anything after my boxing review.</li>
            <li> this product is very disappointing.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the different scents that Village Naturals sells and I like them all.  I can totally recommend them for their quality and value.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from shoppers in need for a soothing bath salt.  The smell was subtle but not too little that you could hardly smell anything.  After a hard days lift and cardio, my muscles get a bit sore.  So, I started up the bath, only using hot water so the bathroom begins to steam.  This was a trick I learned when I ran cross country in high school.  As the hot water is filling the tub, I sprinkled about a handful and a half into the water.  Before I even added the salt, I could smell the product, just from opening the lid.  Once the tub is a little below the halfway mark, I turn the water to warm (room temperature) for the rest.      I enjoyed this product as I listened to my favorite music and really relaxed while my muscles soaked.  Afterwards, my body felt relieved and muscles didn&#x27;t ache as much.  My skin definitely felt smoother and there was a slight aroma in the bathroom afterwards.  Great product, would definitely recommend.    P.S. Have a glass of scotch while bathing, the fragrance adds a nice flavor while sipping.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Fills the whole bathroom with a great scent.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the lavender or eucalyptus body soak, but having tried the white tea and jasmine, I will never use anything else. I am addicted to the smell and I love how soft my skin feels after a bath. I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys taking long baths.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and leaves my skin soft. This is the only bath salts I will use.</li>
            <li> Just received this and took a bath. No scent at all and I don&#x27;t think is softened my skin.  Don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers   are smelling, maybe I got a bad batch.Sadly I got 2 jars of the White Tea and they are just a disappointing waste of my money. The jar states fragrance lingers in your bath room long after a bath. Just not true.</li>
            <li> Product is wonderful.....shipping from Amazon is not great.  Two out of three containers lids came off during shipping.  To clarify, the four stars is for the product.</li>
            <li> These bath salts are great! They smell so good and really soften my skin. Taking a bath with these is wonderful and they are a great value as well.</li>
            <li> All of the bath salt was spilled in the box! I shouldn&#x27;t have to clean up the product I paid for. I&#x27;m angry.</li>
            <li> These bath salts have such a delightful light scent and really leave my skin feeling wonderful after a soak in the bath.  I get migraines, so I don&#x27;t like many bath products that have a very strong scent because they occasionally trigger my headaches, but this is just about perfect.  I mix this product with equal part epsom salt for the bath so that I can stretch how many baths I&#x27;m able to get out of the jar.  The small handful of the White Tea and Jasmine leaves the bath water scented, and gives the bathroom a slight hint of scent that lingers throughout the bath and for a short time afterwards.  I&#x27;m quite pleased with this bath soak and highly recommend it for anyone who doesn&#x27;t appreciate overwhelming scents in the tub.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet had the pleasure to try all of Village Naturals products, but from everything I&#x27;ve ever tried before in my life, this is BY FAR my favorite body soak!  It&#x27;s so soothing, smells wonderfully, and leaves a wonderful smell for days afterwards!  I will never use another body soak again...except to try one of their other scents! I love this stuff!  It was one of the best gifts I&#x27;ve ever gotten!</li>
            <li> I just used this in my bath and love it!!! The smell is perfect and not too strong. I was worried about the scent being overwhelming but it is wonderful. It didn&#x27;t make the water bubbly or murky either which was nice. I am now going to find the other scents and buy those too. My skin feels so smooth and my legs muscles aren&#x27;t as tight after my run tonight.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year &amp; it is awesome!    The aroma that fills the entire bathroom is so fresh &amp; the body soak makes you feel so relaxed.    My only complaint is that I had always bought these from Target for less than $5.00 a jar &amp; the Amazon price is higher, but I am just glad to be able to purchase them!</li>
            <li> This really does soften your skin and smells amazing. Love the pricing, but I am upset with the packaging. When I got my package it was soaked in the smell, which I thought was just because it was from a some salt warehouse, but no. It was open and EVERYWHERE! They didnt wrap it in plastic or anything, just the tube with no protection cap so it was just all over the box. Obviously they knew about it because they taped all the holes in the box so now most of the product was in the tape. Besides that the product is great! I am just really sad with Amazon for not giving me a discount or anything after my boxing review.</li>
            <li> better than regular epsom salt at preserving body moisture, but it has the flowery scent that I am having a hard time getting used to based on my regular use of quality essentials oils for health and wellbeing.  people not using essential oils would probably not have this reference.</li>
            <li> I am not going to actually use this bath salt in the tub, so I can&#x27;t review that. I am going to use it as a room freshener and the scent is great. It&#x27;s really fragrant so I could imagine it filling up the entire house if you were to bathe in it. I am very pleased and will order this bath salt again in other fragrances. The price is great for this bath salt because I&#x27;ve experienced some cheaper bath salts have an intense chemical smell or the fragrance isn&#x27;t strong.</li>
            <li> They smell heavenly and soften the water wonderfully, making soap lather gloriously and giving me a perfect shave on my legs every time.  Definitely reccomended.</li>
            <li> this product is very disappointing.  if you want something that has no smell at all, then you&#x27;ll like it!!  supposed to leave a lingering smell after bath, there is no smell at all.</li>
            <li> These products are wonderful and do leave my skin feeling soft and just a \\&quot;hint\\&quot; of fragrance is left on my skin.  The aroma is therapeutic to me, especially after working overtime for 3 months on my job, although I don&#x27;t feel pretty, this softens me again and brings back the real me.  The fragrance is very mild, not overwhelming or invading at all, but just right for me.  I would recommend this fragrance and product to everyone. It is challenging to return to my bathe area and find the product doesn&#x27;t last that long - lol - because my entire family loves it!!  Good job Village Naturals, keep up the good work.  I have only been using these products for about 8 months.</li>
            <li> I was ordering this for a gift from Amazon, and I was very excited for it to arrive.  When I got the product it was in a box that was too small and there wasn&#x27;t enough packaging (bubble wrap, packing peanuts, etc.) in with it, so when it was getting shipped and thrown around the casing to the salts became shattered the lid broke into several pieces and the spilled everywhere in the box.  I had to call and complain to customer service.  After being hung up on once, I finally got through to another person who heard me out.  They issued a refund to me which went through almost immediately (thankfully) and I was able to contact the actual company to send me some from their own warehouse, which did come  in time to gift it, and I kept the others in a jar for myself.  As for the product itself- it says that it is a White Tea and Jasmine.  There wasn&#x27;t much smell at all, and I was rather disappointed.  It does make a very slight difference in the bath water, but the  salts more irritate my skin than anything, so I can&#x27;t stand to \\&quot;relax?\\&quot; in the water for more than a few minutes.  Like others have said there was no \\&quot;lingering scent\\&quot; after I got out and drained my bathtub.  I would NOT order this product again; I feel it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells fantastic and my skin feels incredibly soft after using it. I wish there was more for the price but wow it feels great and the scent is not overpowering....but the scent does not last as long as I hoped it would and it does not come with a measuring cup.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for myself a little spoil. The scent is nice and light but not so light it fades. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on you or the tub when you&#x27;re done. Very relaxing touch to any bath. Great price as well for the size you get.</li>
            <li> The aroma of this is beyond relaxing... It&#x27;s very sensual, smooth and gentle. I bought this for when I do my own pedicures. I do suggested using small amounts if you&#x27;re also purchasing for the same reason as sometimes using too much can have a very intense smell. And with me doing my own pedicures the foot bath doesn&#x27;t require much of the salt to fill a room just pleasantly without being too overbearing. This product makes my feet feel soft and easier to manage with an excellent combination of scents &#x3D; perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.</li>
            <li> smells wonderful! ive used it 2 times and id definitely buy this product again. it makes me feel wonderfully relaxed.</li>
            <li> These salts smell great and are a fantastic deal. I plan on buying a few more. Just one note - I put them in a separate hard plastic container and the salt etched it, so store it in glass or the original bottle.</li>
            <li> I ordered three jars and only one arrived unopened.  Due to the poor container and bad packaging, one jar broke and spilled out all over.  Another jar opened and spilled out all over.  Only one jar arrived OK.  There was no tape on the lids or a seal inside to keep the contents inside the jars.  Since the jars are extremely thin flimsy plastic, no wonder they broke / opened in shipping.</li>
            <li> I decided to try several scents of the Village Natural body soaks, and I was surprised to discover that the White Tea &amp; Jasmine turned out to be a favorite.  Generally, I turn to Lavender for a comforting scent, but I have to say that this one has been the most relaxing and pleasant for me!</li>
            <li> I love the smell! It&#x27;s not thick at all. Very refreshing and sweet. It&#x27;s my second bottle already. They dissolve well in the bath. Loving it.</li>
            <li> Lovely skin softening bath salts. Enhances a soothing and relaxing bath and leaves skin feelin smooth. Nicely scented too. Attractive plastic container sits in tub corner.</li>
            <li> This is the best-smelling bath product I&#x27;ve ever bought. I actually bought it to share with my husband, to inspire him to pamper himself more. But I knew he wouldn&#x27;t want to end up smelling all girly. This is a perfect adult fragrance...it&#x27;s fresh and calming with no super-sweet notes. It is a decent sized bottle, so it lasts quite a while. You don&#x27;t have to use too much to get the fragrance, which lasts a long time in the bathroom and stays lightly on your skin. I also didn&#x27;t have any problems with the packaging during shipping, like some other reviewers did.</li>
            <li> I relaxed in my tub with this. It has a very pleasant smell. Went in bathroom hours later &amp; could still smell. Very aromatic.</li>
            <li> What a great gift!  Give the gift of beauty &amp; relaxation at an affordable price. Pleasantly, lightly scented, not cloying. Moisturizing, luxurious soak. Recipient looks forward to using this great gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generous quantity at a great price. Non-breakable container, attractive packaging. Looks substantial.&lt;br /&gt;Great gift at a great price!</li>
            <li> I consider myself to be quite particular about scents and smells, especially since I am very prone to migraines. Although it is quite strong, it is not at all overwhelming! I&#x27;m not sure why the other two reviewers said there was no scent. I can tell when someone else is using it because I can smell it through the door and down the hall! I love this stuff so much, it just doesn&#x27;t feel right to take a bath without it! Plus for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. I use it almost every day and it has lasted me about six months.</li>
            <li> Yet another awesome aroma. Relaxing, refreshing, &amp; enjoyable. Again this is safe to use in our whirlpool tub. I would have to say this is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and feels nice! Scent doesn&#x27;t linger as much as cheaper quality salts. I will be ordering again. Only complaint is I didn&#x27;t smell the white tea.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the same salt, the same weight and brand for $3.50 in our local Wall-mart in Huntsville, AL :-)</li>
            <li> Baught this as a gift for my girlfriend and she says that it leaves her skin silky smooth as advertised!  Love this company!</li>
            <li> My mom purchased this for me since I love taking relaxing baths!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one does not turn the water colors, but it smells amazing, and is great for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After laying in the bath for maybe 10 minutes, I checked my feet (they severely needed a pedicure, eww!) and the dead skin was coming off, literally, from my heel! This stuff is great for a pedicure, you barely even have to use a buffer or work on it yourself! (You still do, it just makes your job easier!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:D Wow!</li>
            <li> This bath salt is my favorite. It is light smell and very soothing. It is more of a powder then a salt but I dont care since it is just going to dissolve anyway. Smells great and makes you feel clean when you get out of the bath.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of scented bath confetti I used as a kid. It really does smell nice and I can see how people use it as an air freshener.</li>
            <li> I have been buying up all kinds of bath salts for my jacuzzi tub in my new home and I loved this one, even my husband commented on the smell.  The salts dissolve very easily and they have a very pleasant and relaxing smell.  It softens the water slightly and makes your skin very soft when you get out.  I will definitely purchase these again.</li>
            <li> The smell is not over bearing it is subtle and sweet. Very nice product. Would recommend especially for those sensitive to strong smells like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for a detox and supplement for magnesium. Epson salt is great for releasing toxins from the body.</li>
            <li> This is the best bath salts I have purchased.  I actually softens the water and your skin and it smells oh so good.</li>
            <li> Smells great when poured in bath... Feel relaxed and comfortable. I like this product, and use it every three to four days. Thank you!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat Village Naturals bath salts. I tried some of the competitors and their scents were hardly there. By the time you got your nose close enough to the water to smell it, you had a wet nose.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. For being a guy, it&#x27;s hard to admit to taking baths, but this is a huge stress reliever. Makes the long day you just had a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to go with the bubble bath, and it serves it purpose!  It softens the water and I like that it is safe for daily usage.  I use it pretty often with no complaints!</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely wonderful. I put just a cap full into each bath and it smells great and seems to soften skin. I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> I really like it but in order to get the full effects, you have to use a lot of the product. The bottles need to be larger or come in two packs.</li>
            <li> I purchased  these bath salts for use in the bathroom as an air freshener.  I placed the contents in a bamboo container with hinged lid.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Keep it in production!!!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! And dissolves rather quickly.</li>
            <li> It makes the water smell so good and relaxing but you have to use a lot if you have a lg tub like mine.  The scent along sold me once i poured it in my tub but would i buy it again just for that.  I do not think so.</li>
            <li> I use in the bath and can still smell the gorgeous scent lingering for a few hours afterward! Love these</li>
            <li> It was sealed but only half full!</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent, very relaxing</li>
            <li> We have used this before and this is just what we wanted. We could not find this at the store.</li>
            <li> We like the product and order it regularly from Amazon.  It arrives in sealed bags with the top open inside the bag and much of the product spilled.  Even the bags do not contain the product fully and the box has bath beads in it.  Why can&#x27;t the producer of the product seal the top properly - perhaps strong tape?  This has been going on for a long time and I don&#x27;t get the reason for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer liked this but found the scent to be &amp;#34;quite strong&amp;#34;.  I found it to be a light and delicate scent that I also find pleasing.  I, too, am very particular in what scents I like but I am not prone to migraines. I really liked this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer complained about the jar arriving open.  Now they wrap every single jar in a tied plastic bag. IF ONLY the people packing the jars twisted the jar lid tight, that would solve the problem and save plastic.  Two lids of my nine jar order were loose.  It would only take the person packing to ensure a tight the lid.  I have learned to do this with any bottles of liquid I buy in the store; e.g., bleach, due to one accident. But since Amazon doesn&#x27;t want to do that...the way they &amp;#34;solved&amp;#34; the problem was with a wasted plastic bag for every jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and have used one version of their salts for the past 13 years.</li>
            <li> Loved this however, it arrived with the lid off and the bath crystals were all over the box. So nobody checked it before it went out? Or did someone deliberately loosen the lid?</li>
            <li> I seem to have a hard time finding bath salts that are Dead Sea salts and actually smell good.  This is it and at a great price!  Will buy more!</li>
