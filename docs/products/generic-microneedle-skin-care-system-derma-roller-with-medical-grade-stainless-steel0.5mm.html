            <li>This a very nicely made unit.  </li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>made well.on time loved it</li>
            <li>After a couple uses they were already fading, and she loved how her face felt and looked after a couple weeks of using it.</li>
            <li>And the needles were all in good condition.  </li>
            <li>rinse it good and spray it with barber shop sanitizer from Sally&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Together makes my skin look and feel amazing.  </li>
            <li>Nice.  </li>
            <li>LOVE it</li>
            <li>I love Dermarollers and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and I feel does what it promises.  </li>
            <li>But in the other hand, I thought it was a good thing since MT roller had good</li>
            <li>Stopped rolling smoothly and now snags the skin.</li>
            <li>so if your on the fence about getting it what the hell its cheap just buy it.</li>
            <li>im rolling around on my sensitive face, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to feel good...</li>
            <li>I always start with a clean face and finish with hydraulic acid.  </li>
            <li>It has been a couple months now and the results are amazing, the scars are nearly gone</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>.my best beauty secret.</li>
            <li>I used it only for two weeks so far great result and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>The box was not in a good condition, but the roller and case were tightly sealed.</li>
            <li>I suffered through acne more than 5 years and finally it&#x27;s helping them go away from my face.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I got mine in the mail and its exactly as pictured and the price is great; I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and the only thing I can honestly say I notice is that my skin hasn&#x27;t broken out and its absorbs my creams I put on right after very well,</li>
            <li>It will give longterm results,  and I am not expecting to see much change before three months.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy this product because it was priced cheap (9$) and had only 10 reviews.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s possible it is effective after using it multiple times.</li>
            <li>I rinse it and store it upright in an open container and pour bleach and let it air dry once a week, just for safe measure.</li>
            <li>I decided to save extra bucks, and purchase this one, since this is my first dermaroller.  </li>
            <li>My face stays very read for the first day and then calms down for the 2nd day and us pretty much gone after 2nd day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this specifically for my face and so far I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times.</li>
            <li>making my skin soft.</li>
            <li>love to also follow up this procedure with the Indian Aztec clay I ordered on amazon mixed with Bragg&#x27;s raw, unfiltered apple vinegar purchased on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:  When you view the product, you will see \\&quot;Other Sellers on Amazon\\&quot; on the right bar of the page.</li>
            <li>When I received the roller, I was surprised that it was actually \\&quot;MT</li>
            <li>It is not painful to use, and my usual face creams work well with it.  </li>
            <li>This is an interesting idea, but too painful and time consuming to be worth it.</li>
            <li>Shipping took a little long, but China is pretty far from me.</li>
            <li>first, I felt I&#x27;ve wasted time debating between MT Roller and MelodySusie because this product actually was a MT Roller.</li>
            <li>I have been using this 2 or 3 times a week, very gently, and I am not sure if it is improving skin texture or elasticity.</li>

            <li> If you look up on YouTube the proper way to use this tool, you will see that they actually do it hard and long enough in one spot to draw tiny drops of blood.</li>

            <li> Other reviewers who say it is painless must not be doing it correctly.</li>
            <li> , if you were to buy this product: Do not put any pressure on it when rolling and do not roll with active acne.</li>
            <li> and if you use it with active acne it will spread it all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used it for less than 3 weeks at the moment  </li>
            <li> It hurts and brings slight blood to the surface.  </li>
            <li> To me it seems like the areas where I barely had hair now do have random hairs growing.</li>
            <li> If you press to hard it will make your scars worse and not work properly</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is doing anything for me.</li>

            <li> this will change your life. . I use it twice a day. . .my best beauty secret.</li>
            <li> made well.on time loved it</li>
            <li> This a very nicely made unit.  It will give longterm results,  and I am not expecting to see much change before three months.  I have used it for less than 3 weeks at the moment  It is not painful to use, and my usual face creams work well with it.  It is not necessary to buy speciall creams or numbing cream.</li>
            <li> was NOT a stainless steal roller like it said. VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend because she had some acne scars. After a couple uses they were already fading, and she loved how her face felt and looked after a couple weeks of using it. It has been a couple months now and the results are amazing, the scars are nearly gone and she is getting her confidence back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to point something out though, if you were to buy this product: Do not put any pressure on it when rolling and do not roll with active acne. If you press to hard it will make your scars worse and not work properly and if you use it with active acne it will spread it all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product has done what it has promised and continues to work great. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product after cleaning my face I&#x27;ve noticed that when I start to get the beginning signs of a break out I use this and my skin clears up immediately.  It is very gentle and easy to use.  I rinse it and store it upright in an open container and pour bleach and let it air dry once a week, just for safe measure.</li>
            <li> Transformed my skin, works great! There is no reason for anyone to suffer from acne scars because this works wonders.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is doing anything for me. I have been using this 2 or 3 times a week, very gently, and I am not sure if it is improving skin texture or elasticity. Not seeing any change.</li>
            <li> Works miracle. I suffered through acne more than 5 years and finally it&#x27;s helping them go away from my face. I used it only for two weeks so far great result and works like a charm. It&#x27;s a must for suffering people like me!! LOVE it, Thank you for shipping it on time and great packages!!</li>
            <li> Broke after 6 weeks. Stopped rolling smoothly and now snags the skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically for my face and so far I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times. The only thing I regret is not buying the numbing cream to accompany my derma roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, good product!</li>
            <li> Nice.  Need a larger 1.</li>
            <li> I love Dermarollers and this one is my favorite. Same Results at home that people pay $$$ for. Amazing!</li>
            <li> Does leave your face really red! But does allow my products to sink into my skin quicker! I only use about once a week.</li>
            <li> I feel tricked. As what my title says, this is a MT roller and not Melody Susie brand.  I was debating whether to buy this one or MT roller.  I was hesitant to buy this product because it was priced cheap (9$) and had only 10 reviews.  I decided to save extra bucks, and purchase this one, since this is my first dermaroller.  When I received the roller, I was surprised that it was actually \\&quot;MT Roller\\&quot; brand, and not Melodysusie brand.  The box was not in a good condition, but the roller and case were tightly sealed. And the needles were all in good condition.  I added pictures for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I felt I&#x27;ve wasted time debating between MT Roller and MelodySusie because this product actually was a MT Roller. But in the other hand, I thought it was a good thing since MT roller had good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked for this roller to give my 4 star review. But I changed my mind to 3 stars, because I was not only tricked about the brand, but also the price.  This product is not sold by one seller.  Every time you refresh the page or research for the product, you will see a different price listed for this product. I bought this for 9.00$, but when I came back to this page, it was listed for 4.95$... What?!  And when I refreshed the page, it was back up to $6+... I was confused, how this is happening. Then, I realized the seller also changed with the price.  I am upset because it does not say anywhere that this product is sold by different sellers. If I knew, I would&#x27;ve chosen the seller myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP:  When you view the product, you will see \\&quot;Other Sellers on Amazon\\&quot; on the right bar of the page. Here is the link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CPJBUQ2/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 .  You can choose price and seller from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will just keep the roller since it&#x27;s a hassle returning the product.  I just hope I see the results I am looking for from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I recommend it? YES if you want a MT roller for cheaper price.or cheaper price.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better!  I try to use this once a week.  It hurts and brings slight blood to the surface.  Makes my eyes water.  It&#x27;s easy to use and I feel does what it promises.  I always start with a clean face and finish with hydraulic acid.  My face stays very read for the first day and then calms down for the 2nd day and us pretty much gone after 2nd day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rinse it good and spray it with barber shop sanitizer from Sally&#x27;s.  Let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love to also follow up this procedure with the Indian Aztec clay I ordered on amazon mixed with Bragg&#x27;s raw, unfiltered apple vinegar purchased on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together makes my skin look and feel amazing.  I use DoTerra skin care products in addition.</li>
            <li> I got mine in the mail and its exactly as pictured and the price is great; I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and the only thing I can honestly say I notice is that my skin hasn&#x27;t broken out and its absorbs my creams I put on right after very well, making my skin soft. It is a little painful and its every single time I use it...but I mean its needles im rolling around on my sensitive face, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to feel good...so if your on the fence about getting it what the hell its cheap just buy it. Shipping took a little long, but China is pretty far from me. &#x3D;) Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for months now (2-3 times a week) with Minoxidil along my hairline. To me it seems like the areas where I barely had hair now do have random hairs growing. This isn&#x27;t a miracle device and anything short of a transplant isn&#x27;t going to make a giant difference but I&#x27;m just happy it&#x27;s helping me keep the hair I have left.</li>
            <li> Expected to work like the other brand guess not, no recommend</li>
            <li> This is an interesting idea, but too painful and time consuming to be worth it. I tried it once, and never again. If you do decide to use this, you will need to purchase some numbing gel to make it bearable. If you look up on YouTube the proper way to use this tool, you will see that they actually do it hard and long enough in one spot to draw tiny drops of blood. Other reviewers who say it is painless must not be doing it correctly. It also takes forever! I was trying to get rid of stretch marks from pregnancy and after one use I saw no results. I gave 2 stars since I did only try it once and it&#x27;s possible it is effective after using it multiple times. I have been using Bio Oil on my stretch marks since then and have seen great improvement!</li>
            <li> just make the skin red and no results</li>
