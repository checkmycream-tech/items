            <li>One of my favorite colors ever.</li>
            <li>but this is probably my favorite color ever</li>
            <li>I love the color that is shown in the picture</li>
            <li>I use OPI and have many colors and none had had that problem</li>
            <li>I love opi nail polish...</li>
            <li>It seems most people believe water was added to each bottle in order to compensate for the polish that was removed by the seller.</li>
            <li>However, if the seller removes more than a couple of ounces</li>
            <li>i really love it.&lt;br /&gt;gorgeous</li>
            <li>color for fall if i do say so myself:)</li>
            <li>Fraud don&#x27;t buy they  changed the label on the bottom of the bottle to make it believable.</li>
            <li>i love the color of this nail polish</li>
            <li>TO LOOK LOVELY.</li>
            <li>love this winter/fall colour</li>
            <li>love it &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>customers Love this so much!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>, I love it, I&#x27;ve had so many compliments.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Reds and blacks are always used but this color is incredibly elegant and very unique.</li>
            <li>I love the color and how smoothly it goes on.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, dries easily and lasts.  </li>
            <li>The perfect green color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already 3 weeks into my last polish application and it looks great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect crayon green color.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, opaque-one coat will do the job.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a great nail polish and a great green color.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast and the item was bubble wrapped and very secure in the package.</li>
            <li>It was the exact color I was expecting, which is kind of rare when you buy polish online.</li>
            <li>my big toe curves up and hits the top of the toe box on every pair of covered shoe I own (to the point that every sneaker ends up with a toe hole and even my leather shoes eventually wear there too).  </li>
            <li>I love the color it goes on smooth and dries fast.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>I will say I ALWAYS google the color, brand (OPI) and \\&quot;swatch\\&quot; to see the true color on nails.</li>
            <li>It is nice to have a nail color that is natural looking.</li>
            <li>The seller would have to remove polish from 10-15 bottles just to make one full bottle.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product... :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cute and so much cheaper than buying it at the salon.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for the HUGE variety of items on your online shop!!</li>
            <li>More blue than green, but it&#x27;s a beautiful color!</li>
            <li>The green is unique, but great to have.</li>
            <li>I would highly recomend this to anyone!!!</li>
            <li>any case, Opi polish in general is most excellent, and this particular color of green is just</li>
            <li>it also has amazing lasting power.</li>
            <li>it dries fast and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this kind  green</li>
            <li>I got this color for my last pedicure and loved it so much I bought some</li>
            <li>The polish is nice and opaque so you will only need two coats.</li>
            <li>but I liked three coats personally for a deeper color.</li>
            <li>I love opi, I don&#x27;t know if this was old or used</li>
            <li>and I have been looking for a good true green for years.</li>
            <li>Great little buy from this site!</li>
            <li>A warmer green with more yellow tones, or any kind of shimmer would have been better for me.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do it, particularly as I don&#x27;t have the luxury of frequent pedis!  </li>
            <li>Very fast to get to me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a pretty color though.</li>
            <li>As another reviewer stated, it is not that pretty on dark-skin.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty</li>
            <li>What a pretty color looks just like</li>
            <li>But it was actually really pretty</li>
            <li>I received exactly what I saw in the picture.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty tho when it&#x27;s where it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li>First, there are plenty of polishes that just have a watery consistency.</li>
            <li>be buying more next time.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>by far my new favorite color that OPI has to offer</li>
            <li>Long wearing, impervious to chips, love it.</li>
            <li>the nails look very nice, but  after removing the color my nails are stained and very difficult to remove stains,  I don&#x27;t use any more this nail polish.</li>
            <li>so vibrant - OPI does it again!</li>
            <li>This is a very unique green nail polish &amp; so pretty!</li>
            <li>Probably too much.</li>
            <li>I really like the Texas collection.  </li>
            <li>This color is much cuter on toes then fingers.</li>
            <li>I really like opi nail polishes</li>
            <li>know its not the real deal.simple as that</li>
            <li>I like that this color is a bit unusual to have as a nail polish</li>
            <li>I wanted a nice muted bottle green and this does not disappoint.</li>
            <li>the bottles are not sealed (i.e. kind of leave the impression they have been very very slightly used &amp; cleaned up again....</li>
            <li>I also used a clear topcoat just to add a little bit of extra shine to it, but it looks great either way.</li>
            <li>I bought this nail polish thinking that it would be as vibrant as it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, only takes two coats to get the color like in the picture, very much worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>After years of getting a pedicure and only getting French color...this year I have decided to venture into colors, and this one by far with a black and white design has been my best!!</li>
            <li>I am head over heels in love with this green</li>
            <li>I so love OPI polishes, this shade of green reminds me of jade</li>
            <li>This one is a very nice dark green.</li>
            <li>THIS IS SUCH A PRETTY SHADE OF GREEN AND GOES WITH SO MANY THINGS</li>
            <li>I felt this color was truly beautiful on the nail, but unfortunately after it was removed, it had stained my nails light green.</li>
            <li>The lavender is beautiful but the green was a total different color then I expected.</li>
            <li>It is an incredibly classy color.</li>
            <li>Most green nail polishes, especially with OPI, are either metallic or almost neon.</li>
            <li>a TRUE rich green with NO undertones of any other colors.</li>
            <li>Even if you&#x27;re replacing an older version with a perfect formula, a newer version with a watery formula doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the new version is a fake.</li>
            <li>This is because companies make minor changes to polishes all the time due to an ingredient becoming unavailable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is a little darker than what I usually go for during the warmer/sandal month, but it was such a nice rich (without being too deep a color) that I just had to try</li>
            <li>It is so vibrant and different.</li>
            <li>Its due to the lighting that it looks so pretty in the picture.</li>
            <li>but my bottle was very thick and clumpy, love the color though</li>
            <li>I was expecting more of a jade and less of a matte/pastel looking green.</li>
            <li>It last a couple days without chipping I really like OPI products they last a long time</li>
            <li>Exactly the correct color green for decorating your nails to look like watermelon slices.  </li>
            <li>My feet are a little funny, among other things (like high arches)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure that the posters claiming this (or any other nail polish) is fake have put much thought into that claim.</li>

            <li> What a pretty color looks just like</li>
            <li> But it was actually really pretty</li>
            <li> I received exactly what I saw in the picture.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty tho when it&#x27;s where it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> First, there are plenty of polishes that just have a watery consistency.</li>
            <li> be buying more next time.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> by far my new favorite color that OPI has to offer</li>
            <li> Long wearing, impervious to chips, love it.</li>
            <li> the nails look very nice, but  after removing the color my nails are stained and very difficult to remove stains,  I don&#x27;t use any more this nail polish.</li>
            <li> so vibrant - OPI does it again!</li>
            <li> This is a very unique green nail polish &amp; so pretty!</li>
            <li> Probably too much.</li>
            <li> I really like the Texas collection.  </li>
            <li> This color is much cuter on toes then fingers.</li>
            <li> I really like opi nail polishes</li>
            <li> know its not the real deal.simple as that</li>
            <li> I like that this color is a bit unusual to have as a nail polish</li>
            <li> I wanted a nice muted bottle green and this does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> the bottles are not sealed (i.e. kind of leave the impression they have been very very slightly used &amp; cleaned up again....</li>
            <li> I also used a clear topcoat just to add a little bit of extra shine to it, but it looks great either way.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail polish thinking that it would be as vibrant as it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, only takes two coats to get the color like in the picture, very much worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> After years of getting a pedicure and only getting French color...this year I have decided to venture into colors, and this one by far with a black and white design has been my best!!</li>
            <li> I am head over heels in love with this green</li>
            <li> I so love OPI polishes, this shade of green reminds me of jade</li>
            <li> This one is a very nice dark green.</li>
            <li> THIS IS SUCH A PRETTY SHADE OF GREEN AND GOES WITH SO MANY THINGS</li>
            <li> I felt this color was truly beautiful on the nail, but unfortunately after it was removed, it had stained my nails light green.</li>
            <li> The lavender is beautiful but the green was a total different color then I expected.</li>
            <li> It is an incredibly classy color.</li>
            <li> Most green nail polishes, especially with OPI, are either metallic or almost neon.</li>
            <li> a TRUE rich green with NO undertones of any other colors.</li>
            <li> Even if you&#x27;re replacing an older version with a perfect formula, a newer version with a watery formula doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the new version is a fake.</li>
            <li> This is because companies make minor changes to polishes all the time due to an ingredient becoming unavailable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color is a little darker than what I usually go for during the warmer/sandal month, but it was such a nice rich (without being too deep a color) that I just had to try</li>
            <li> It is so vibrant and different.</li>
            <li> Its due to the lighting that it looks so pretty in the picture.</li>
            <li> but my bottle was very thick and clumpy, love the color though</li>
            <li> I was expecting more of a jade and less of a matte/pastel looking green.</li>
            <li> It last a couple days without chipping I really like OPI products they last a long time</li>
            <li> Exactly the correct color green for decorating your nails to look like watermelon slices.  </li>
            <li> My feet are a little funny, among other things (like high arches)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure that the posters claiming this (or any other nail polish) is fake have put much thought into that claim.</li>
            <li> is the new black (also by OPI).  </li>
            <li> It seems the primary complaint is that the polish is watered down.</li>
            <li> any case, I don&#x27;t think there is much money to be made in the counterfeit nail polish business, unless you have nothing to do except remove small amounts of polish from multiple bottles to produce a single polish.</li>
            <li> Not only is it not the green seen in the picture, but the Polish is so watery it goes on almost clear.</li>
            <li> This particular can be worn all year round,  in my opinion!</li>
            <li> This polish lasts a long time before it starts to chip.</li>
            <li> I have pale white skin with pink undertones and this green really stands out!</li>
            <li> Note to other buyers (&amp; reason I only gave 4 stars):  </li>
            <li> It does not chip easy and is not super thick feeling on nails!!</li>
            <li> No extreme chippage but not want I wanted in a green nail polish hence the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I tried putting couple coats over to make it as dark as its shown but didnt get the same results :</li>
            <li> I have a hard time believing there are that many people selling fake nail polish.</li>
            <li> The seller would also need empty OPI bottles and have a means of replicating the stickers OPI uses to identify the polish inside the bottle.</li>
            <li> Texas and Opi does it big with this color.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful shade of green</li>
            <li> arrived safely, individually wrapped in bubble pack, in a small padded envelope.   </li>
            <li> Nail polish rubs off usually in a matter of a week, but the Opi definitely lasts longer...</li>
            <li> Other than that it stays longer than other nail polishes if applied underneath a transparent coating.</li>
            <li> this has never happened with any other o.p.i polish....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I don&#x27;t see how anyone could make much of a profit by selling fake OPI polishes.</li>
            <li> Well I did like it after I tried it on, but a little upset that it wasn&#x27;t the shade of green I expected.</li>
            <li> I have a few other colors</li>
            <li> This color is slightly darker than it seems in the photo online.</li>
            <li> Tickle My France-Y, Don&#x27;t mess with OPI &amp; You</li>
            <li> so i just opened this and realized the nail polish is a little watery.....and it hit me</li>
            <li> I took a star off because it is a little streaky, which I didn&#x27;t expect, it being OPI and all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Loveliest shade of green</li>
            <li> if you like green then this is the one you want.</li>
            <li> This one stands out because it is green in it&#x27;s purest form.</li>
            <li> I advise anyone viewing this NOT to buy it if you don&#x27;t want to waste $7.00.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had some bottles for a few months/years and they’re still going.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this shade of green without the sparkle bulls</li>
            <li> However, Amazon nail polish buyers frequently complain that they received a fake polish.</li>
            <li> I bought this color to match the green scrubs I have to where to work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every woman needs a green in her</li>
            <li> I ordered it not sure about the color, but now I&#x27;ve been trying It for quite awhile</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what these people mean by watery.</li>
            <li> It can be hard to tell in bottle and unfortunately the OPI swatches on the website are almost never close.</li>
            <li> you simply can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI.</li>
            <li> Is weird,  </li>
            <li> Receiving a polish that is watery is not a reason to jump to conclusions that the polish is fake.</li>
            <li> (Please note that separation itself is not indicative of a fake and it quite common).&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s watery fake...</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointing.</li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews before I bought this color and whoever said it is fake is crazy!</li>
            <li> this is a fake!</li>
            <li> This color bleeds through the base coat and stains your nails.</li>
            <li> Worst polish ive ever purchased...beautiful color but</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> you simply can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI. lovely colour!!</li>
            <li> This green was really one of the \\&quot;it\\&quot; colors last summer, but it just wasn&#x27;t flattering for my skin tone. A warmer green with more yellow tones, or any kind of shimmer would have been better for me. It&#x27;s still a pretty color though.</li>
            <li> The three polishes I ordered (Tickle My France-Y, Don&#x27;t mess with OPI &amp; You don&#x27;t know Jacques!) arrived safely, individually wrapped in bubble pack, in a small padded envelope.   I really love the colors! OPI has SUCH a great selection of colors, one for ANY occasion and color of clothing! :))    Note to other buyers (&amp; reason I only gave 4 stars):  the bottles are not sealed (i.e. kind of leave the impression they have been very very slightly used &amp; cleaned up again....).\\&quot;</li>
            <li> As another reviewer stated, it is not that pretty on dark-skin. I was expecting more of a jade and less of a matte/pastel looking green. No extreme chippage but not want I wanted in a green nail polish hence the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Loveliest shade of green I have ever seen. Of course O,P.I. never disappoints. Long wearing, impervious to chips, love it.</li>
            <li> FINALLY!!! a TRUE rich green with NO undertones of any other colors. I am head over heels in love with this green and I have been looking for a good true green for years. it also has amazing lasting power. if you like green then this is the one you want. by far my new favorite color that OPI has to offer</li>
            <li> What a pretty color looks just like the picture had my toe nails painted and love it ! Will be great around Christmas also</li>
            <li> Bought this to wear for st Patrick&#x27;s day. The perfect green color. I wear it all the time. Probably too much.</li>
            <li> I got this color for my last pedicure and loved it so much I bought some...couldn&#x27;t stand the idea that once it eventually needed a touch up I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do it, particularly as I don&#x27;t have the luxury of frequent pedis!  The color is a little darker than what I usually go for during the warmer/sandal month, but it was such a nice rich (without being too deep a color) that I just had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two coats are all that are needed, and it LASTS.  My feet are a little funny, among other things (like high arches) my big toe curves up and hits the top of the toe box on every pair of covered shoe I own (to the point that every sneaker ends up with a toe hole and even my leather shoes eventually wear there too).  Nail polish rubs off usually in a matter of a week, but the Opi definitely lasts longer...I&#x27;m already 3 weeks into my last polish application and it looks great.  It&#x27;s the only brand I&#x27;ll pick at the salon now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, Opi polish in general is most excellent, and this particular color of green is just gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JTG</li>
            <li> This is a great polish. It was the exact color I was expecting, which is kind of rare when you buy polish online. But it was actually really pretty and it goes great with my tan skin color. You won&#x27;t regret this buy.</li>
            <li> After years of getting a pedicure and only getting French color...this year I have decided to venture into colors, and this one by far with a black and white design has been my best!!</li>
            <li> Most green nail polishes, especially with OPI, are either metallic or almost neon. This one stands out because it is green in it&#x27;s purest form. I have received SO many compliments on this nail color. I like to call it \\&quot;Gumby Green\\&quot; (lol) it dries fast and smooth. I also used a clear topcoat just to add a little bit of extra shine to it, but it looks great either way.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this OPI color although I have to say I am rarely displeased with any OPI. I have tried several different bran of polish as I get a manicure every 7-10 days and OPI stands up to the rest. I will say I ALWAYS google the color, brand (OPI) and \\&quot;swatch\\&quot; to see the true color on nails. It can be hard to tell in bottle and unfortunately the OPI swatches on the website are almost never close. I always purchase from XPRESSURSELF, I have NEVER had a problem. Quick ship, fair prices, and he combines shipping. This is a BIG plus for me since I tend to hold off and buy 3-5 different colors at a time.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish. I don&#x27;t know what these people mean by watery. Unless they are talking about having to apply two coats but that is required by the majority of nail polishes. It is an incredibly classy color. Reds and blacks are always used but this color is incredibly elegant and very unique.</li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews before I bought this color and whoever said it is fake is crazy! This is not a fraud nail polish. I love it! It&#x27;s super cute and so much cheaper than buying it at the salon. I received exactly what I saw in the picture. Thoroughly satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this color.  I love OPI.  I always get compliments when I wear this polish.  It is great for St. Patty&#x27;s Day!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very unique green nail polish &amp; so pretty! OPI always comes out with great colors. Love this one!</li>
            <li> I really like the Texas collection.  The color is so close to nature&#x27;s actual colors.  It is nice to have a nail color that is natural looking.</li>
            <li> I simply loved this color. It is so vibrant and different. It just sets itself apart. I&#x27;m glad it suited my skin color as well.</li>
            <li> I so love OPI polishes, this shade of green reminds me of jade is the new black (also by OPI).  The polish is nice and opaque so you will only need two coats. This particular can be worn all year round,  in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I bought this nail polish thinking that it would be as vibrant as it looks in the picture. Its due to the lighting that it looks so pretty in the picture. Well I did like it after I tried it on, but a little upset that it wasn&#x27;t the shade of green I expected. Other than that it stays longer than other nail polishes if applied underneath a transparent coating. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> OPI products go on smooth and look beautiful on nails.  This is a great color.  Received many complements on it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color. The shipping was very fast and the item was bubble wrapped and very secure in the package. I was actually really impressed with the shipping. Painted my nails with it on the 29th and they still haven&#x27;t chipped at all! Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This color is much cuter on toes then fingers. It made me feel like I had mold on my fingers but are cute on toes when you wear them with sandles.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colors ever. It is so beautiful and in two coats you will be all done, but don&#x27;t forget a top coat! This polish lasts a long time before it starts to chip. I really like opi nail polishes but this is probably my favorite color ever and it suits EVERY skin color and skin tone!</li>
            <li> I love the color that is shown in the picture and i couldnt wait for this item to arrive. After waiting impatiently for this OPI color, it cam in and is much much much lighter than this. I already have a similar lighter shade. I tried putting couple coats over to make it as dark as its shown but didnt get the same results :(&lt;br /&gt;I WANT THAT GREEEN COLOR!</li>
            <li> I know nail polish and I know this is not OPI quality. Not only is it not the green seen in the picture, but the Polish is so watery it goes on almost clear. And the seller says they don&#x27;t accept returns. Extremely disappointing. I advise anyone viewing this NOT to buy it if you don&#x27;t want to waste $7.00.</li>
            <li> I love the color it goes on smooth and dries fast. It last a couple days without chipping I really like OPI products they last a long time and I&#x27;ve had some bottles for a few months/years and they’re still going.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this shade of green without the sparkle bulls***. It looks great too, I like it. Good job.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for the HUGE variety of items on your online shop!! I recommend it to everyone!! Merry Christmas!</li>
            <li> I love this kind  green the nails look very nice, but  after removing the color my nails are stained and very difficult to remove stains,  I don&#x27;t use any more this nail polish. Is weird,  I use OPI and have many colors and none had had that problem</li>
            <li> so i just opened this and realized the nail polish is a little watery.....and it hit me this is a fake! how i know? under the nail polish where it is written OPI if you dont see made in USA California know its not the real deal.simple as that</li>
            <li> I love opi nail polish... The lavender is beautiful but the green was a total different color then I expected.</li>
            <li> It chipped a lot. I regret my purchase.</li>
            <li> This color bleeds through the base coat and stains your nails. It&#x27;s pretty tho when it&#x27;s where it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color! I&#x27;m not quite sure that the posters claiming this (or any other nail polish) is fake have put much thought into that claim. It seems the primary complaint is that the polish is watered down. Receiving a polish that is watery is not a reason to jump to conclusions that the polish is fake. First, there are plenty of polishes that just have a watery consistency. Even if you&#x27;re replacing an older version with a perfect formula, a newer version with a watery formula doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the new version is a fake. This is because companies make minor changes to polishes all the time due to an ingredient becoming unavailable.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I don&#x27;t see how anyone could make much of a profit by selling fake OPI polishes. It seems most people believe water was added to each bottle in order to compensate for the polish that was removed by the seller. However, if the seller removes more than a couple of ounces the color of the polish would be diluted by the addition of water and the polish would likely separate because water would not keep the pigments (glitter pieces, etc.) suspended. (Please note that separation itself is not indicative of a fake and it quite common).&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I don&#x27;t think there is much money to be made in the counterfeit nail polish business, unless you have nothing to do except remove small amounts of polish from multiple bottles to produce a single polish. The seller would have to remove polish from 10-15 bottles just to make one full bottle. The seller would also need empty OPI bottles and have a means of replicating the stickers OPI uses to identify the polish inside the bottle. The profit, if any, would be minimal.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not arguing that no one has ever sold a fake OPI because I&#x27;m sure it has happened. However, Amazon nail polish buyers frequently complain that they received a fake polish. I have a hard time believing there are that many people selling fake nail polish.</li>
            <li> This color is just truly amazing i really love it.&lt;br /&gt;gorgeous color for fall if i do say so myself:)</li>
            <li> Fraud don&#x27;t buy they  changed the label on the bottom of the bottle to make it believable. It&#x27;s watery fake... They know what they&#x27;re doing.... This is a Warning!!!!</li>
            <li> i love the color of this nail polish i got a lot of compliment on it . i&#x27;m happy to buy more product of this seller.</li>
            <li> THIS IS SUCH A PRETTY SHADE OF GREEN AND GOES WITH SO MANY THINGS YOU WEAR I DEFINITLY RECOMMEND IT TO WOMAN WHO WANT THERE NAILS TO LOOK LOVELY. THANKYOU</li>
            <li> I love the color!! It does not chip easy and is not super thick feeling on nails!! I would highly recomend this to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this color to match the green scrubs I have to where to work. This color is slightly darker than it seems in the photo online. I only buy OPI nail polish because it goes on the smoothest, cleanest, shiniest, and brightest. This one is a very nice dark green.</li>
            <li> Very fast to get to me and I also love the color! Great color to use for St. Patrick&#x27;s day</li>
            <li> love this winter/fall colour</li>
            <li> Love this color! It comes out so vibrant - OPI does it again!</li>
            <li> The colour is exactly as it appears in the picture which is great! I wanted a nice muted bottle green and this does not disappoint. I took a star off because it is a little streaky, which I didn&#x27;t expect, it being OPI and all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But still a really nice colour!</li>
            <li> I felt this color was truly beautiful on the nail, but unfortunately after it was removed, it had stained my nails light green. I had to let my nails grow out because I simply could not remove the polish.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, only takes two coats to get the color like in the picture, very much worth the purchase. love it &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Also great for summer toes!!!</li>
            <li> nice wintery color top quality</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, dries easily and lasts.  I have a few other colors and I like all of them.  A friend recommended the OPI brand to me a couple of years ago, and I continue to like their polish.</li>
            <li> Texas and Opi does it big with this color.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful shade of green and it wears well.&lt;br /&gt;Every woman needs a green in her collection.&lt;br /&gt;This is it!!</li>
            <li> I have been really happy with this color. I have pale white skin with pink undertones and this green really stands out! It&#x27;s the perfect crayon green color. I needed two coats to be opaque but I liked three coats personally for a deeper color.</li>
            <li> More blue than green, but it&#x27;s a beautiful color!</li>
            <li> Worst polish ive ever purchased...beautiful color but stained my nails, took weeks of buffings and remove stain...this has never happened with any other o.p.i polish....this purcahse made me stop ordering nail polish online!</li>
            <li> What a great color!  OPI nail polish is always great.  It goes on smoothly and dries quickly.  This color is great for the 2013 season.</li>
            <li> I love opi, I don&#x27;t know if this was old or used but my bottle was very thick and clumpy, love the color though</li>
            <li> IT DIDNT LOOK LIKE COLOR IN THE PICTURE. MY HUSBAND MADE ME GIVE IT AWAY HE JUST DIDNT LIKE IT ON ME. BUT IT DID COME ON TIME AND IN GOOD SHAPE</li>
            <li> 。☆。。☆ 。&lt;br /&gt;★。＼\｜/／。★&lt;br /&gt;  I used this for my nail Spa. customers Love this so much!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying more next time.&lt;br /&gt;★。／/｜\＼。★&lt;br /&gt;。☆。。☆</li>

            <li> Exactly the correct color green for decorating your nails to look like watermelon slices.  This will be great at Christmas also.</li>
            <li> I love the color and how smoothly it goes on. Great little buy from this site! I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, opaque-one coat will do the job. got this for st. patty&#x27;s day but it&#x27;s great for my skin tone, so i wear it all the time.</li>
            <li> I like that this color is a bit unusual to have as a nail polish so I ordered it and I am glad I did. The green is unique, but great to have. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a great nail polish and a great green color.</li>
