            <li>Seems to whiten clothes nicely as well.</li>
            <li>I use this soap for making my own laundry detergent.</li>
            <li>The most important driving force for me, however, is that I no longer have detergent residue clinging to my clothes that causes eczema, so even if this soap cost me much more than 5-10 cents per load, I&#x27;d still use it, because the relief is priceless.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who is intersested in making their own laundry soap.</li>

            <li>I bought this product to make my own laundry detergent, but I ended up buying it at wal-mart.</li>
            <li>zote is great because it cleans very effectively and from what i&#x27;ve read, it&#x27;s gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend and will purchase again. :D</li>
            <li>Smells good and easy to shred.  </li>
            <li>I love using Zote for making so many things!</li>
            <li>and add some of your own favorite scents.</li>
            <li>After discovering that my eczema is caused by a sensitivity to detergent (for more details, see the site solveeczema dot org), I chucked out any and all laundry cleaning products that contained detergent and made my own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try the latest craze of making my own laundry detergent.  </li>
            <li>I make my own laundry soap and this does the job better than felsa naptha, I think.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This creates a very finely powdered and well-mixed laundry soap.</li>
            <li>It has a mild non-lingering fragrance that is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Scent is very important to my laundry needs.  </li>
            <li>Using this soap does not require us to use bleach or clothes softener any longer and leaves a pleasant, fresh odor in the clothing.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap use it for washing, makeup brushes, fine washables, getting stains out of clothes pre-wash!  </li>
            <li>Huge bars!  </li>
            <li>Huge bar of soap!</li>
            <li>Try it. :)</li>
            <li>this is my favorite soap.</li>
            <li>Fabulous scent!  </li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>but, I wanted to try this Zote to see if it worked any better</li>
            <li>Will buy more as needed</li>
            <li>Love this product in my homemade laundry soap but</li>
            <li>I love this soap.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li>the most cost-effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I was really pleased with that.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SOAP..  ..</li>
            <li>I am glad that I gave it a try</li>
            <li>and I like the zote soap much better than fels naphtha.  </li>
            <li>and I love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>Then the light went on in my head!</li>
            <li>and I paid 1.19 a bar :)</li>
            <li>However, I would make sure you receive what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon and will continue to buy from here, but not from this seller again.</li>
            <li>Wish I would have bought more.</li>
            <li>We have started making our own laundry soap, and I love this soap the best from the other recommended soaps.</li>
            <li>Never having used this soap before, I was pleasantly surprises by the pretty scent.  </li>
            <li>It gets the clothes clean and smells nice.</li>
            <li>it was a pretty good buy.</li>
            <li>Pretty good size.</li>
            <li>It also does a pretty good job of cleaning clothes.</li>
            <li>I had thought we&#x27;d need to buy new pants, so I&#x27;m really happy.</li>
            <li>It foams really well, has pleasant smell, and gets the dirt out.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have a food processor, you may use a cheese grater or Microplane to grate the Zote, but this is much more time-consuming and it doesn&#x27;t give you a fine texture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s deffinately worth checking out! :)</li>
            <li>I love the color and the smell it adds to my homemade laundry soap, but it didn&#x27;t clean as well as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li>It is softer than Fels Naptha and grated easily, but it took foreverrrr to melt, and I didn&#x27;t like the scent as well as the Fels.  </li>
            <li>so easy and affordable.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely, light, clean scent, and most importantly - it cleans.</li>
            <li>works well, strong scent</li>
            <li>Works very well and has mild pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Smells nice but not too strong and removes stains very well.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are affordable and easy to find, and they are friendly to the environment, so what have you got to lose?</li>
            <li>I got three HUGE bars of zote soap.  </li>
            <li>I will come back to post my results and am happy to find Zote available here on Amazon.com</li>
            <li>It worked great after using a cheese shredder to get it into smaller bits.</li>
            <li>nice smell;soft to clothes; cleans very well</li>
            <li>so it is easy to use, cleans very well, nice mild smell.</li>
            <li>it leaves my clothes smelling very fresh.</li>
            <li>My clothes are clean and free of stains and they do not smell like any fragrance whatsoever.</li>
            <li>i purchased this to make home made laundry soap - super easy to grate if the recipe calls for it.</li>
            <li>I used this finely grated with the mule team borax and arm and hammer super washing soda variety pack to make laundry soap.  </li>
            <li>The smell is great and the soap works much better than store bought and last much much longer.  </li>
            <li>The Zote pink soap is a very nice easy sudsing soap.</li>
            <li>Works well and has a clean smell.</li>
            <li>Even though the stains were dry and set, the Zote soap worked great as a pretreater.</li>
            <li>The smell was so clean and had a pine scent.</li>
            <li>My clothes came clean but smelled like my kitchen floor; not satisfactory for us in the fragreance department.</li>
            <li>Scent is quite strange, but doesn&#x27;t linger on your clothes so that is a moot point :-) !!</li>
            <li>I am making my own laundry detergent and this was much easier to grate than the Fels Naptha and has a nice, light scent, but I used some of each in the last batch I made.  </li>
            <li>The shavings are also a lot easier to mix with the other detergent ingredients and make sure you get a good mix.</li>
            <li>Nice citronella smell, and the clothes come out soft and clean.</li>
            <li>And it does an awesome job in our hard rusty well water.</li>
            <li>Mixed with washing soda and borax, this makes a good soap for laundry.  </li>
            <li>But they gave a full refund.</li>
            <li>The bar is big, and easy to grate for making my own laundry detergent.</li>
            <li>Definitely cost effective, grates easily using grandmother&#x27;s hand grater.</li>
            <li>and you want to get them clean, white, bright and/or fresh</li>
            <li>This soft is incredibly soft and feels great even on your body.</li>
            <li>Just run it through the food processor to shave it quickly</li>
            <li>It was packed well and arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I purchase it to quickly handwash some baby</li>
            <li>I started making my own laundry soap because I can&#x27;t handle the smell of commercial ones, and the fragrance free &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; soaps are either too pricey or still make me itchy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love the smell of this at first, but once I mixed it in with the other ingredients for laundry soap it turned out perfect.</li>
            <li>These soaps clean well on the clothes and left a nice scent after wash the clothes.</li>
            <li>made it look super fun)</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands of soap but this one seems to clean really well while smelling great.</li>
            <li>So much greener for the environment and incredibly cheap compered to retail detergents.</li>
            <li>Seems to be ok for baby skin, although my kid never had sensitive skin issues.</li>
            <li>Fresh</li>
            <li>I recently made my own laundry detergent</li>
            <li>I used this Zote for homemade laundry soap and it made it a really fun color</li>
            <li>I will never buy from them again if they do not make this right.</li>
            <li>Zote takes it right out.</li>
            <li>that makes 10 gallons and will last you and your family a year of not having to spend a lot of money and is very easy to make.</li>
            <li>The bars are very large and can be cut to suit or grated for use in the laundry.</li>
            <li>Powerful in cleaning and gentle to hands!</li>
            <li>so easy and cloths have never been so clean, not only</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, easy to cut through and shred.</li>
            <li>I also love this soap because it does not dry up my hands.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping</li>
            <li>First I grate it, then add Borax and Arm &amp; Hammer washing soda then blend in my food processor.  </li>
            <li>so well it looks really pretty in the glass Jar</li>
            <li>(pretty) for my uses.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>I got zote on amazon and it does exactly what it&#x27;s advertised to do.</li>
            <li>I love this soap, and bought it several times until I realized walmart has it for $0.97 a bar.</li>
            <li>I first used this soap on my wedding dress that had been dragged through mud and grass.</li>
            <li>Thanks Zote!</li>
            <li>This knowledge led me to eliminate many sources of detergent from my home, including commercial laundry detergent.</li>
            <li>However since it fell out of the bag and was left in the floorboard of my truck and got stepped on I decided it would work better for the truck.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, there it was in the laundry aisle</li>
            <li>I did notify after the first incorrect order and was instructed to order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the laundry detergent, I used Fels Naptha first.  </li>
            <li>Whitens my washcloths pretty well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it (the pink kind)</li>
            <li>it was exactly as advertised and precisly what I needed for my homemade laundry detergent project I did.</li>
            <li>I made my own laundry detergent using this and a number of other products.</li>
            <li>The first bar I bought was a large bar.</li>
            <li>Very easy to shred and as a combination with the other products (borax and arm&amp;hammer laundry soda) with 1:1:1 ratio - it worked pretty well, but not as brialliantly as claimed.  </li>
            <li>I tried it this week on my son&#x27;s bright white karate pants after he spilled several large drops of chocolate smoothie on them.</li>
            <li>At one tablespoon per load (I have a small washing machine), I am able to get more than 100 loads using one full bar of Zote and 3 cups of borax and washing soda each, with some powder left in both boxes.</li>
            <li>What an easy way to wash clothing if you&#x27;re in a situation without regular laundry facilities.  </li>
            <li>I received one large bar.</li>
            <li>Even her husband is sold on the cleaning power and scent of the very inexpensive laundry soap.</li>
            <li>I placed my online  order and received the product incredibly fast.  </li>
            <li>is you do have to dissolve it really well into the mix at the start</li>
            <li>Have not experimented with really heavy/older stains though.</li>
            <li>i cut mine in 4s so that it&#x27;s a reasonable size to handle when washing my clothes in a sink.</li>
            <li>It cleans and gentle.</li>
            <li>I found all the reviews here very helpful, so......</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll pay too much here for it.</li>
            <li>You can by  6 bars of the same size (14 oz) for the same price at the popular online auction site.</li>
            <li>Looks old fashioned but certainly gets out any stain -- even mustard and blood!  </li>
            <li>cup Washing Soda (sodium carbonate, most common brand is Arm &amp; Hammer Super Washing Soda)&lt;br /&gt;Approximately</li>
            <li>I just know it grates easily (for homemade detergent), smells like heaven and is PINK</li>
            <li>Good price for these big and heavy bars of soap.</li>
            <li>The description doesn&#x27;t state that this is the pink kind and now looking back at it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it as a laundry detergent.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I just need this kind of laundry soaps to wash some delicate clothes by hands.</li>
            <li>This soap keeps white very white and also keeps other color bright.  </li>
            <li>I only ordered this item to accompany the first order and to share with family member and my neighbor</li>
            <li>It foams richly and can be used to make laundry soap and any number of other things.</li>
            <li>My significant other</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I picked my first bar up at my local 99 Cent Store</li>
            <li>we just found this exact bar for 97 cents each at our local Super Center (in the cleaners isle).</li>
            <li>Then I tried pink Zote; super cleaning power, fragrance and ease of grinding.  </li>
            <li>So this is clearly overpriced.</li>
            <li>Semi soft</li>
            <li>Not only was it gentle, but it removed everything from the dress without any sign of damage.</li>
            <li>cup Borax (sodium borate/sodium tetraborate/disodium tetraborate, most common brand is 20 Mule Team, manufactured by Dial)&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>an excettlent when washing more delicate clothes.  </li>
            <li>thanks ladies and possibly any gentlemen too!!</li>
            <li>I have recently becomr very frugal, and Zote soap is one of my household miracles.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive, long lasting and can be used for everything from bathing the dog to a full load of laundry (I grate 1/2 cup into my washer as it fills), to your finest lingerie.</li>
            <li>Eczema manifests itself differently in everyone, but since I&#x27;ve been using the recipe above for laundry soap, my skin has improved drastically and I&#x27;m no longer compelled to scratch because there isn&#x27;t any irritation in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had several bras that still had antiperspirant residue even though they had been through the washing machine (high efficiency machine in a lingerie bag), so I decided to try using this soap to handwash the items.</li>
            <li>I bought a bar of this soap locally (I live near the Mexican border) in the hopes that it would help remove stains from clothes.</li>
            <li>The slight fragrance of the pink Zote works OK for me.</li>
            <li>I could not find this single large bar, so I ordered the \\&quot;3 bars\\&quot; from this vendor.</li>
            <li>I wrapped a rubber band around the middle since the bar is very slippery, but you could probably also cut the bar in smaller pieces.</li>
            <li>I buy the large 14.1 ounce bars of Zote from Big Lots for $.95 per bar, and borax and washing soda from my local grocery store for $5 and $4 a box, respectively.</li>
            <li>I was going to a picnic, and showered with it before I went, very gentle, and got no mosquito or any other bug bites!</li>
            <li>keep a small knob of Zote and a separate spray bottle full of water for spot cleaning.</li>
            <li>I have my badly stained and smelly sheets in the washer at this very moment after following some good advice from other users ;0)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different things on my clothing and sheets in the past with semi</li>
            <li>essential oils (made for clothing or sensitive skin, Only!)</li>
            <li>and I also both wear uniforms to work - white and blue shirts - and spot cleaning directly on the collar after every wear (even if there isn&#x27;t a stain) prevents it from getting dingy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was unable to find ZOTE soap locally and wanted to make my own laundry detergent.  </li>
            <li>It has never failed to remove stains the other brands can&#x27;t touch !!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more expensive to buy on Amazon than at the local store, but I will still recommend it to friends and family living far away.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is distinct but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Clothes are clean, and it cuts the price of regular laundry detergent in less than half.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle even for little kids.</li>
            <li>Finally, it didn&#x27;t work well with the recipe I used, I&#x27;m not sure why, but it left a white film on my clothes that was easily seen on my dark colored</li>

            <li> Seems to whiten clothes nicely as well.</li>
            <li> I use this soap for making my own laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> The most important driving force for me, however, is that I no longer have detergent residue clinging to my clothes that causes eczema, so even if this soap cost me much more than 5-10 cents per load, I&#x27;d still use it, because the relief is priceless.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is intersested in making their own laundry soap.</li>

            <li> I bought this product to make my own laundry detergent, but I ended up buying it at wal-mart.</li>
            <li> zote is great because it cleans very effectively and from what i&#x27;ve read, it&#x27;s gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend and will purchase again. :D</li>
            <li> Smells good and easy to shred.  </li>
            <li> I love using Zote for making so many things!</li>
            <li> and add some of your own favorite scents.</li>
            <li> After discovering that my eczema is caused by a sensitivity to detergent (for more details, see the site solveeczema dot org), I chucked out any and all laundry cleaning products that contained detergent and made my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the latest craze of making my own laundry detergent.  </li>
            <li> I make my own laundry soap and this does the job better than felsa naptha, I think.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This creates a very finely powdered and well-mixed laundry soap.</li>
            <li> It has a mild non-lingering fragrance that is pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Scent is very important to my laundry needs.  </li>
            <li> Using this soap does not require us to use bleach or clothes softener any longer and leaves a pleasant, fresh odor in the clothing.  </li>
            <li> I love this soap use it for washing, makeup brushes, fine washables, getting stains out of clothes pre-wash!  </li>
            <li> Huge bars!  </li>
            <li> Huge bar of soap!</li>
            <li> Try it. :)</li>
            <li> this is my favorite soap.</li>
            <li> Fabulous scent!  </li>
            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> but, I wanted to try this Zote to see if it worked any better</li>
            <li> Will buy more as needed</li>
            <li> Love this product in my homemade laundry soap but</li>
            <li> I love this soap.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li> the most cost-effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I was really pleased with that.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SOAP..  ..</li>
            <li> I am glad that I gave it a try</li>
            <li> and I like the zote soap much better than fels naphtha.  </li>
            <li> and I love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li> Then the light went on in my head!</li>
            <li> and I paid 1.19 a bar :)</li>
            <li> However, I would make sure you receive what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon and will continue to buy from here, but not from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have bought more.</li>
            <li> We have started making our own laundry soap, and I love this soap the best from the other recommended soaps.</li>
            <li> Never having used this soap before, I was pleasantly surprises by the pretty scent.  </li>
            <li> It gets the clothes clean and smells nice.</li>
            <li> it was a pretty good buy.</li>
            <li> Pretty good size.</li>
            <li> It also does a pretty good job of cleaning clothes.</li>
            <li> I had thought we&#x27;d need to buy new pants, so I&#x27;m really happy.</li>
            <li> It foams really well, has pleasant smell, and gets the dirt out.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have a food processor, you may use a cheese grater or Microplane to grate the Zote, but this is much more time-consuming and it doesn&#x27;t give you a fine texture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deffinately worth checking out! :)</li>
            <li> I love the color and the smell it adds to my homemade laundry soap, but it didn&#x27;t clean as well as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li> It is softer than Fels Naptha and grated easily, but it took foreverrrr to melt, and I didn&#x27;t like the scent as well as the Fels.  </li>
            <li> so easy and affordable.</li>
            <li> It has a lovely, light, clean scent, and most importantly - it cleans.</li>
            <li> works well, strong scent</li>
            <li> Works very well and has mild pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but not too strong and removes stains very well.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are affordable and easy to find, and they are friendly to the environment, so what have you got to lose?</li>
            <li> I got three HUGE bars of zote soap.  </li>
            <li> I will come back to post my results and am happy to find Zote available here on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> It worked great after using a cheese shredder to get it into smaller bits.</li>
            <li> nice smell;soft to clothes; cleans very well</li>
            <li> so it is easy to use, cleans very well, nice mild smell.</li>
            <li> it leaves my clothes smelling very fresh.</li>
            <li> My clothes are clean and free of stains and they do not smell like any fragrance whatsoever.</li>
            <li> i purchased this to make home made laundry soap - super easy to grate if the recipe calls for it.</li>
            <li> I used this finely grated with the mule team borax and arm and hammer super washing soda variety pack to make laundry soap.  </li>
            <li> The smell is great and the soap works much better than store bought and last much much longer.  </li>
            <li> The Zote pink soap is a very nice easy sudsing soap.</li>
            <li> Works well and has a clean smell.</li>
            <li> Even though the stains were dry and set, the Zote soap worked great as a pretreater.</li>
            <li> The smell was so clean and had a pine scent.</li>
            <li> My clothes came clean but smelled like my kitchen floor; not satisfactory for us in the fragreance department.</li>
            <li> Scent is quite strange, but doesn&#x27;t linger on your clothes so that is a moot point :-) !!</li>
            <li> I am making my own laundry detergent and this was much easier to grate than the Fels Naptha and has a nice, light scent, but I used some of each in the last batch I made.  </li>
            <li> The shavings are also a lot easier to mix with the other detergent ingredients and make sure you get a good mix.</li>
            <li> Nice citronella smell, and the clothes come out soft and clean.</li>
            <li> And it does an awesome job in our hard rusty well water.</li>
            <li> Mixed with washing soda and borax, this makes a good soap for laundry.  </li>
            <li> But they gave a full refund.</li>
            <li> The bar is big, and easy to grate for making my own laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> Definitely cost effective, grates easily using grandmother&#x27;s hand grater.</li>
            <li> and you want to get them clean, white, bright and/or fresh</li>
            <li> This soft is incredibly soft and feels great even on your body.</li>
            <li> Just run it through the food processor to shave it quickly</li>
            <li> It was packed well and arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> I purchase it to quickly handwash some baby</li>
            <li> I started making my own laundry soap because I can&#x27;t handle the smell of commercial ones, and the fragrance free &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; soaps are either too pricey or still make me itchy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love the smell of this at first, but once I mixed it in with the other ingredients for laundry soap it turned out perfect.</li>
            <li> These soaps clean well on the clothes and left a nice scent after wash the clothes.</li>
            <li> made it look super fun)</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of soap but this one seems to clean really well while smelling great.</li>
            <li> So much greener for the environment and incredibly cheap compered to retail detergents.</li>
            <li> Seems to be ok for baby skin, although my kid never had sensitive skin issues.</li>
            <li> Fresh</li>
            <li> I recently made my own laundry detergent</li>
            <li> I used this Zote for homemade laundry soap and it made it a really fun color</li>
            <li> I will never buy from them again if they do not make this right.</li>
            <li> Zote takes it right out.</li>
            <li> that makes 10 gallons and will last you and your family a year of not having to spend a lot of money and is very easy to make.</li>
            <li> The bars are very large and can be cut to suit or grated for use in the laundry.</li>
            <li> Powerful in cleaning and gentle to hands!</li>
            <li> so easy and cloths have never been so clean, not only</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, easy to cut through and shred.</li>
            <li> I also love this soap because it does not dry up my hands.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping</li>
            <li> First I grate it, then add Borax and Arm &amp; Hammer washing soda then blend in my food processor.  </li>
            <li> so well it looks really pretty in the glass Jar</li>
            <li> (pretty) for my uses.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I got zote on amazon and it does exactly what it&#x27;s advertised to do.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, and bought it several times until I realized walmart has it for $0.97 a bar.</li>
            <li> I first used this soap on my wedding dress that had been dragged through mud and grass.</li>
            <li> Thanks Zote!</li>
            <li> This knowledge led me to eliminate many sources of detergent from my home, including commercial laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> However since it fell out of the bag and was left in the floorboard of my truck and got stepped on I decided it would work better for the truck.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, there it was in the laundry aisle</li>
            <li> I did notify after the first incorrect order and was instructed to order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the laundry detergent, I used Fels Naptha first.  </li>
            <li> Whitens my washcloths pretty well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it (the pink kind)</li>
            <li> it was exactly as advertised and precisly what I needed for my homemade laundry detergent project I did.</li>
            <li> I made my own laundry detergent using this and a number of other products.</li>
            <li> The first bar I bought was a large bar.</li>
            <li> Very easy to shred and as a combination with the other products (borax and arm&amp;hammer laundry soda) with 1:1:1 ratio - it worked pretty well, but not as brialliantly as claimed.  </li>
            <li> I tried it this week on my son&#x27;s bright white karate pants after he spilled several large drops of chocolate smoothie on them.</li>
            <li> At one tablespoon per load (I have a small washing machine), I am able to get more than 100 loads using one full bar of Zote and 3 cups of borax and washing soda each, with some powder left in both boxes.</li>
            <li> What an easy way to wash clothing if you&#x27;re in a situation without regular laundry facilities.  </li>
            <li> I received one large bar.</li>
            <li> Even her husband is sold on the cleaning power and scent of the very inexpensive laundry soap.</li>
            <li> I placed my online  order and received the product incredibly fast.  </li>
            <li> is you do have to dissolve it really well into the mix at the start</li>
            <li> Have not experimented with really heavy/older stains though.</li>
            <li> i cut mine in 4s so that it&#x27;s a reasonable size to handle when washing my clothes in a sink.</li>
            <li> It cleans and gentle.</li>
            <li> I found all the reviews here very helpful, so......</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll pay too much here for it.</li>
            <li> You can by  6 bars of the same size (14 oz) for the same price at the popular online auction site.</li>
            <li> Looks old fashioned but certainly gets out any stain -- even mustard and blood!  </li>
            <li> cup Washing Soda (sodium carbonate, most common brand is Arm &amp; Hammer Super Washing Soda)&lt;br /&gt;Approximately</li>
            <li> I just know it grates easily (for homemade detergent), smells like heaven and is PINK</li>
            <li> Good price for these big and heavy bars of soap.</li>
            <li> The description doesn&#x27;t state that this is the pink kind and now looking back at it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it as a laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I just need this kind of laundry soaps to wash some delicate clothes by hands.</li>
            <li> This soap keeps white very white and also keeps other color bright.  </li>
            <li> I only ordered this item to accompany the first order and to share with family member and my neighbor</li>
            <li> It foams richly and can be used to make laundry soap and any number of other things.</li>
            <li> My significant other</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I picked my first bar up at my local 99 Cent Store</li>
            <li> we just found this exact bar for 97 cents each at our local Super Center (in the cleaners isle).</li>
            <li> Then I tried pink Zote; super cleaning power, fragrance and ease of grinding.  </li>
            <li> So this is clearly overpriced.</li>
            <li> Semi soft</li>
            <li> Not only was it gentle, but it removed everything from the dress without any sign of damage.</li>
            <li> cup Borax (sodium borate/sodium tetraborate/disodium tetraborate, most common brand is 20 Mule Team, manufactured by Dial)&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> an excettlent when washing more delicate clothes.  </li>
            <li> thanks ladies and possibly any gentlemen too!!</li>
            <li> I have recently becomr very frugal, and Zote soap is one of my household miracles.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, long lasting and can be used for everything from bathing the dog to a full load of laundry (I grate 1/2 cup into my washer as it fills), to your finest lingerie.</li>
            <li> Eczema manifests itself differently in everyone, but since I&#x27;ve been using the recipe above for laundry soap, my skin has improved drastically and I&#x27;m no longer compelled to scratch because there isn&#x27;t any irritation in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had several bras that still had antiperspirant residue even though they had been through the washing machine (high efficiency machine in a lingerie bag), so I decided to try using this soap to handwash the items.</li>
            <li> I bought a bar of this soap locally (I live near the Mexican border) in the hopes that it would help remove stains from clothes.</li>
            <li> The slight fragrance of the pink Zote works OK for me.</li>
            <li> I could not find this single large bar, so I ordered the \\&quot;3 bars\\&quot; from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I wrapped a rubber band around the middle since the bar is very slippery, but you could probably also cut the bar in smaller pieces.</li>
            <li> I buy the large 14.1 ounce bars of Zote from Big Lots for $.95 per bar, and borax and washing soda from my local grocery store for $5 and $4 a box, respectively.</li>
            <li> I was going to a picnic, and showered with it before I went, very gentle, and got no mosquito or any other bug bites!</li>
            <li> keep a small knob of Zote and a separate spray bottle full of water for spot cleaning.</li>
            <li> I have my badly stained and smelly sheets in the washer at this very moment after following some good advice from other users ;0)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different things on my clothing and sheets in the past with semi</li>
            <li> essential oils (made for clothing or sensitive skin, Only!)</li>
            <li> and I also both wear uniforms to work - white and blue shirts - and spot cleaning directly on the collar after every wear (even if there isn&#x27;t a stain) prevents it from getting dingy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was unable to find ZOTE soap locally and wanted to make my own laundry detergent.  </li>
            <li> It has never failed to remove stains the other brands can&#x27;t touch !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more expensive to buy on Amazon than at the local store, but I will still recommend it to friends and family living far away.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is distinct but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Clothes are clean, and it cuts the price of regular laundry detergent in less than half.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle even for little kids.</li>
            <li> Finally, it didn&#x27;t work well with the recipe I used, I&#x27;m not sure why, but it left a white film on my clothes that was easily seen on my dark colored</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very soft, so cutting it was easy.</li>
            <li> They last long too.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t need some for a while.</li>
            <li> Now I have taken the cover off and set the bar out to dry for the next batch to see if that helps.</li>
            <li> My comments are the same as with the Zote Pink Laundry Bar Soap with Soap Grater.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the pink zote soap at my Big Lots store and had a percent off discount</li>
            <li> I am now saving on my laundry costs as this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I prefer the pink bar to the white bar.</li>
            <li> For crying out loud, it&#x27;s a review not an assignment.</li>
            <li> I have had it for as long as I remember, and figured it was just genetic.</li>
            <li> I will try the other recipes next time without Zote.</li>
            <li> Dry before storing.</li>
            <li> This soap easily remove dirty spots.</li>
            <li> Gentle on fabric but tough on dirt.</li>
            <li> It is effective, but smells bad and is hard to shred/flake, which is necessary while making detergent.</li>
            <li> just wet the spot and rub the bar of soap on the spot.</li>
            <li> I bought the 3 pack of pink 14.1oz.</li>
            <li> I need to update this, the company has offered a partial  refund , after they looked into it saying it was an inventory error.  </li>
            <li> I use the pink Zote.</li>
            <li> but they also have the Pink</li>
            <li> Just be careful on this postiing-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back when I need to mix up another round of soap!</li>
            <li> You can use Fels-Naptha, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, or any other lye-derived soap, but I found Zote</li>
            <li> I was actually getting 1 bar of 14.1 oz soap, or the equivalent of 3 small bars.</li>
            <li> I prefer Zote&#x27;s over the other bar soap.</li>
            <li> Usually cost me $30 to make but that batch has lasted us 6 months already with some still left (washing for 2).</li>
            <li> I have a seven month old baby who go through at least 3-5 bibs everyday.  </li>
            <li> soap itself is a little harder to grate than Fels-Naptha.</li>
            <li> My son has very sensitive skin and was always breaking out in terrible rashes until I started making our laundry detergent using 3 bars of this soap (finely grated), container of washing soda, baking soda, box of borax along with container of oxi-clean</li>
            <li> It took several washes, but now only the largest stain is at all visible, and only very faintly.</li>
            <li> and I think I got mine for less than $.90 per bar.  </li>
            <li> I made a half batch of the detergent and it made a lot.</li>
            <li> I had to write a follow up on my previous review.  </li>
            <li> (I know, I should) and find that I get lots of little grease splatters on my clothes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The label also states:&amp;#34;Pink laundry soap with a minimum fatty acid content (66%))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s far too expensive for one bar.</li>
            <li> but the bars were the small 7 oz bars.</li>
            <li> (I usually eyeball it), cut into cubes.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, it stopped me from breaking out in hives that I thought were random</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not appropriate for hand-washing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the person who packages the box or the seller itself.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if that is Amazon-</li>
            <li> I was very confused when my package arrived, but I double checked the product description on here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there are negative reviews...</li>
            <li> Although it has been said you can melt it and rub on stains till dry and peel off like silly putty with the stain stuck to it</li>
            <li> and I had a hard time shredding it for the soap I was making.</li>
            <li> Some nights I would have to pop Benadryl in order to stop myself from scratching so hard that I&#x27;d draw blood, and I&#x27;d find relief, but the eczema did not go</li>
            <li> too hard to work with.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding this soap until I realized it was made in Mexico.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe these reviews require at least 20 words.</li>
            <li> (the base was white powder and the shreds of pink</li>
            <li> It works well washing delicate clothes.</li>
            <li> seller, CV Trading Corp, is poor.</li>
            <li> I want something that doesn&#x27;t leave soap scum in my washing machine!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Fels Naptha and was not impressed</li>
            <li> It has a faint citronella smell that is not offensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have some really angry rash days, and all doctors could do was prescribe me hydrocortisone cream, which helped with the itch but did not make the eczema go away.</li>
            <li> , I guess I was given the wrong soap.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, it dissolves well even in cold water, and though Zote smells like citronella, my clothes do not smell like it after they run in the dryer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> well, bad...</li>
            <li> supposed to be &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;, terrible toxic odor, threw them out vs. paying for return postage.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product for hand washing. It gets the clothes clean and smells nice. Try it. Dry before storing.</li>
            <li> My comments are the same as with the Zote Pink Laundry Bar Soap with Soap Grater.  I only ordered this item to accompany the first order and to share with family member and my neighbor</li>
            <li> I love the color and the smell it adds to my homemade laundry soap, but it didn&#x27;t clean as well as I&#x27;d hoped.  SO.... I just combined it with a bar of Fells Naptha Soap Bar, which cleans great, but smells .... well, bad... and it made my laundry soap smell great while still cleaning well!! Try it. :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this on the recommendation of making my own detergent.  Very easy to shred and as a combination with the other products (borax and arm&amp;hammer laundry soda) with 1:1:1 ratio - it worked pretty well, but not as brialliantly as claimed.  but I believe you can use any soap.</li>
            <li> I NEVER travel without this soap.  It cleans all laundry great and rinses easily.  I do all our laundry by hand when we travel and this is my favorite soap.</li>
            <li> Huge bars!  Fabulous scent!  I make my daughters laundry soap with this ground into it.  Even her husband is sold on the cleaning power and scent of the very inexpensive laundry soap.</li>
            <li> I use this soap (grated to a powder in my food processor with some Borax to keep it from sticking) in my homemade laundry soap recipe.  It has a lovely, light, clean scent, and most importantly - it cleans.</li>
            <li> The bar is big, and easy to grate for making my own laundry detergent. The smell is good too.  Work great as a pretreater also..just wet the spot and rub the bar of soap on the spot.</li>
            <li> I purchased the pink zote soap at my Big Lots store and had a percent off discount and I think I got mine for less than $.90 per bar.  I am making my own laundry detergent and this was much easier to grate than the Fels Naptha and has a nice, light scent, but I used some of each in the last batch I made.  I picked up the Zote in the laundry/cleaning section of Big Lots.</li>
            <li> Purchased this Zote soap for use in homemade laundry soap. This was the cheapest option I found. It worked great after using a cheese shredder to get it into smaller bits. I&#x27;ll be back when I need to mix up another round of soap!</li>
            <li> If you any reason you have to wash clothes by hand and you want to get them clean, white, bright and/or fresh, this is the product for you. This soft is incredibly soft and feels great even on your body. This is simply a great product.</li>
            <li> One bar, not 3! But it was the 14 oz. One bar is about the size of a double soap bar.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It smells great and I use it to make my own homemade liquid laundry soap! I&#x27;ve tried Fels Naptha and was not impressed so I went back to using Zote!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. We have started making our own laundry soap, and I love this soap the best from the other recommended soaps. It has a GREAT smell, and is easier to grate than the others.. :)</li>
            <li> I use this soap in my homemade laundry detergent. Works very well and has mild pleasant scent. I highly recommend it as a laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap to make homemade laundry detergent.  It is softer than Fels Naptha and grated easily, but it took foreverrrr to melt, and I didn&#x27;t like the scent as well as the Fels.  Finally, it didn&#x27;t work well with the recipe I used, I&#x27;m not sure why, but it left a white film on my clothes that was easily seen on my dark colored items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller shipped my order promptly, and I did receive three 14.1 ounce bars.</li>
            <li> I just need this kind of laundry soaps to wash some delicate clothes by hands. Haven&#x27;t used it yet, hope it is good.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this everywhere!  I make my own laundry soap and couldn&#x27;t find this one I have been using Fels Paptha, which works great but, I wanted to try this Zote to see if it worked any better I want something that doesn&#x27;t leave soap scum in my washing machine!!</li>
            <li> google the recipe. so easy and affordable. works amazingly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lightly scented.  i highly recommend and will purchase again. :D</li>
            <li> We use in our laundry soap.  Just run it through the food processor to shave it quickly</li>
            <li> I use this for pre-treating stubborn stains before washing. It has never failed to remove stains the other brands can&#x27;t touch !! Inexpensive, long lasting and can be used for everything from bathing the dog to a full load of laundry (I grate 1/2 cup into my washer as it fills), to your finest lingerie. Love this product !  Scent is quite strange, but doesn&#x27;t linger on your clothes so that is a moot point :-) !! Great stuff !!</li>
            <li> Huge bar of soap! Semi soft so it is easy to use, cleans very well, nice mild smell. This soap is what I use to hand wash my laundry on the wash board if the stains of dirt won&#x27;t come out. Works amazing on my jeans without pulling the color out. Gentle on fabric but tough on dirt. Will buy more as needed</li>
            <li> I use this to make homemade laundry detergent and it works and smells great.  First I grate it, then add Borax and Arm &amp; Hammer washing soda then blend in my food processor.  So much greener for the environment and incredibly cheap compered to retail detergents.</li>
            <li> Great product which I order about every 3 months to use in my homemade laundry soap. Works well and has a clean smell. It has caused no allergies.</li>
            <li> Zote is a soap that can be used for a number of things. It foams richly and can be used to make laundry soap and any number of other things. It has a faint citronella smell that is not offensive. Seems to whiten clothes nicely as well. The bars are very large and can be cut to suit or grated for use in the laundry.</li>
            <li> I used this finely grated with the mule team borax and arm and hammer super washing soda variety pack to make laundry soap.  The smell is great and the soap works much better than store bought and last much much longer.  Wouldn&#x27;t wash our clothes in anything else.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love the smell of this at first, but once I mixed it in with the other ingredients for laundry soap it turned out perfect. Makes clothes clean and wonderful smelling.</li>
            <li> Since using this I wont go back to regular laundry detergent ! so easy and cloths have never been so clean, not only does it work so well it looks really pretty in the glass Jar I put it in... my &amp;#34;receipe&amp;#34;  includes this with Borax and Super Washing Soda.. best Laudry detergent you can use... Will never use anything else</li>
            <li> Great addition to home-made laundry soap.  Definitely cost effective, grates easily using grandmother&#x27;s hand grater. Great ingredient in the recipe.</li>
            <li> I bought a bar of this soap locally (I live near the Mexican border) in the hopes that it would help remove stains from clothes. I tried it this week on my son&#x27;s bright white karate pants after he spilled several large drops of chocolate smoothie on them. Even though the stains were dry and set, the Zote soap worked great as a pretreater. It took several washes, but now only the largest stain is at all visible, and only very faintly. I had thought we&#x27;d need to buy new pants, so I&#x27;m really happy. It&#x27;s more expensive to buy on Amazon than at the local store, but I will still recommend it to friends and family living far away.</li>
            <li> Good price for these big and heavy bars of soap. They last long too.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t need some for a while.</li>
            <li> I love this soap use it for washing, makeup brushes, fine washables, getting stains out of clothes pre-wash!  I grate with a combo of washing powder, borax for a great clean laundry!  It contains citronella, which is good for keeping pests off of you.  I was going to a picnic, and showered with it before I went, very gentle, and got no mosquito or any other bug bites!</li>
            <li> Used this for homemade laundry soap; never going back to the junk they sell in stores.</li>
            <li> These soaps clean well on the clothes and left a nice scent after wash the clothes. This soap easily remove dirty spots.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t looked at the label to see what&#x27;s actually IN this. I just know it grates easily (for homemade detergent), smells like heaven and is PINK (pretty) for my uses.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find ZOTE soap locally and wanted to make my own laundry detergent.  I placed my online  order and received the product incredibly fast.  Using this soap does not require us to use bleach or clothes softener any longer and leaves a pleasant, fresh odor in the clothing.  I am now saving on my laundry costs as this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> No stars....  Beware I bought the 3 pack of pink 14.1oz. Bars. When I opened the box I had a 3 pack but the bars were the small 7 oz bars. I will never buy from them again if they do not make this right. If and when they do I will be happy to change my review. Until then beware.  I need to update this, the company has offered a partial  refund , after they looked into it saying it was an inventory error.  I think you should still  check you orders.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works well.</li>
            <li> Great soap for my homemade laundry soap recipe.</li>
            <li> I love using Zote for making so many things! It&#x27;s great for making homemade soap, fabric softener, shampoo, conditioner and best of all saving dollars! I use the pink Zote. It&#x27;s soft, easy to cut through and shred. It does already have a very nice smell to it, but you can still add extracts that you buy at the grocery store and/or essential oils (made for clothing or sensitive skin, Only!) and add some of your own favorite scents. There&#x27;s a recipe I found on youtube by Janie Pendleton at&lt;br /&gt;[...]  that makes 10 gallons and will last you and your family a year of not having to spend a lot of money and is very easy to make. You can also make extra, if you like, and Pay it Forward by helping others out. It&#x27;s deffinately worth checking out! :)</li>
            <li> I do like Zote for making detergent, trick with this soap is you do have to dissolve it really well into the mix at the start otherwise it clumps up in the detergent bottle.</li>
            <li> I use this soap for making my own laundry detergent. It smells really good. The only problem I had with it was there seemed to be a lot of moisture in it and I had a hard time shredding it for the soap I was making. Now I have taken the cover off and set the bar out to dry for the next batch to see if that helps.</li>
            <li> Love this product in my homemade laundry soap but it WAY overpriced on Amazon....I can get it at Big Lots for .90 per 14.1oz bar.  I prefer the pink bar to the white bar.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.&lt;br /&gt;And it was a pretty good buy. Since they keep running out at my local grocery store</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there are negative reviews...I got three HUGE bars of zote soap.  It was packed well and arrived quickly.  I am satisfied.  I haven&#x27;t used it for my homemade laundry soap yet so I&#x27;ll update you on that soon.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. I cannot believe these reviews require at least 20 words. For crying out loud, it&#x27;s a review not an assignment. I got zote on amazon and it does exactly what it&#x27;s advertised to do. Laundry.</li>
            <li> I use this in my homemade laundry detergent and it works great!! I didn&#x27;t buy it online-it was at Wal-Mart for $2 a bar!</li>
            <li> nice smell;soft to clothes; cleans very well</li>
            <li> I love this soap, and bought it several times until I realized walmart has it for $0.97 a bar.</li>
            <li> I made my own laundry detergent using this and a number of other products. Clothes are clean, and it cuts the price of regular laundry detergent in less than half.</li>
            <li> This soap smells like citronella! Gross</li>
            <li> Speedy service from vendor. The Zote pink soap is a very nice easy sudsing soap. It is not overly sudsey, just enough to get soil out of clothes. It has a mild non-lingering fragrance that is pleasant.  I have used a couple of bars already comparing side by side with Fels Naphtha and Octagon, and find I like the Zote suds quality best. The first bar I bought was a large bar. I could not find this single large bar, so I ordered the \\&quot;3 bars\\&quot; from this vendor. I received one large bar. So that worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered this again on recommendation of Amazon customer service, but still only received 1 bar. Amazon has taken care of this for me, but buyers should know even though the ad and the shipping list say (3 bars) only (1) 14.1 oz bar will be shipped by the vendor.</li>
            <li> I first used this soap on my wedding dress that had been dragged through mud and grass. Not only was it gentle, but it removed everything from the dress without any sign of damage. I now use it on my son&#x27;s clothes when they are covered in food or his diaper leaks. It is a miracle worker! Even if something has set in for days, almost always, it still comes out! There have really only been 2 or 3 exceptions but whenever I have a laundry issues, I always try zote on it to get it out.</li>
            <li> What an easy way to wash clothing if you&#x27;re in a situation without regular laundry facilities.  Works great!  Thanks Zote!</li>
            <li> Reliable seller, good product</li>
            <li> Pretty good size. I won&#x27;t need to to buy one maybe in 5 years</li>
            <li> After discovering that my eczema is caused by a sensitivity to detergent (for more details, see the site solveeczema dot org), I chucked out any and all laundry cleaning products that contained detergent and made my own. My ideal recipe is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 cup Borax (sodium borate/sodium tetraborate/disodium tetraborate, most common brand is 20 Mule Team, manufactured by Dial)&lt;br /&gt;1 cup Washing Soda (sodium carbonate, most common brand is Arm &amp; Hammer Super Washing Soda)&lt;br /&gt;Approximately 4.5 - 5 ounces of Zote, or 1/3 of a 14.1 ounce bar (I usually eyeball it), cut into cubes. You can use Fels-Naptha, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, or any other lye-derived soap, but I found Zote the most cost-effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I add the borax, washing soda, and Zote cubes to a food processor bowl and pulse about 5 times to mix it a bit, then fully process for about 30 seconds. This creates a very finely powdered and well-mixed laundry soap. I then transfer it into mason jars. I use about 1 tablespoon per load of clothes. If you don&#x27;t have a food processor, you may use a cheese grater or Microplane to grate the Zote, but this is much more time-consuming and it doesn&#x27;t give you a fine texture. Nevertheless, it dissolves well even in cold water, and though Zote smells like citronella, my clothes do not smell like it after they run in the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep a small knob of Zote and a separate spray bottle full of water for spot cleaning. Lightly wet the stain, then rub the soap directly onto the fabric and launder. I don&#x27;t cook with an apron (I know, I should) and find that I get lots of little grease splatters on my clothes. Zote takes it right out. My significant other and I also both wear uniforms to work - white and blue shirts - and spot cleaning directly on the collar after every wear (even if there isn&#x27;t a stain) prevents it from getting dingy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zote&#x27;s ingredients: Sodium tallowate, sodium cocoate, fragrance, optical brightener, violet 10&lt;br /&gt;The label also states:&amp;#34;Pink laundry soap with a minimum fatty acid content (66%))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now back to the very personal part: I, along with all members of my family, have eczema. I have had it for as long as I remember, and figured it was just genetic. I&#x27;d have some really angry rash days, and all doctors could do was prescribe me hydrocortisone cream, which helped with the itch but did not make the eczema go away. I found that &amp;#34;free and clear&amp;#34; soaps and cleaning products also helped, but the eczema did not go away. Some nights I would have to pop Benadryl in order to stop myself from scratching so hard that I&#x27;d draw blood, and I&#x27;d find relief, but the eczema did not go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across Solve Eczema and learned that soap is different from detergent. This knowledge led me to eliminate many sources of detergent from my home, including commercial laundry detergent. Ultimately, it stopped me from breaking out in hives that I thought were random but I now know can be attributed to detergent, and eliminated the scaly, goosebump-like patches on my arms, chest, and legs. Eczema manifests itself differently in everyone, but since I&#x27;ve been using the recipe above for laundry soap, my skin has improved drastically and I&#x27;m no longer compelled to scratch because there isn&#x27;t any irritation in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have skin issues, consider switching from regular detergent. The ingredients are affordable and easy to find, and they are friendly to the environment, so what have you got to lose? I buy the large 14.1 ounce bars of Zote from Big Lots for $.95 per bar, and borax and washing soda from my local grocery store for $5 and $4 a box, respectively. At one tablespoon per load (I have a small washing machine), I am able to get more than 100 loads using one full bar of Zote and 3 cups of borax and washing soda each, with some powder left in both boxes. My clothes are clean and free of stains and they do not smell like any fragrance whatsoever. The most important driving force for me, however, is that I no longer have detergent residue clinging to my clothes that causes eczema, so even if this soap cost me much more than 5-10 cents per load, I&#x27;d still use it, because the relief is priceless.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for one buck per bar at my local family dollar store. My intent was to wash clothes. However since it fell out of the bag and was left in the floorboard of my truck and got stepped on I decided it would work better for the truck. The smell was so clean and had a pine scent. I found myself rubbing it into the carpet and cleaning the dash with it. It actually made my dash polish up well with a shiny coat like it had been waxed. And it is non-toxic so I was really pleased with that. Although it has been said you can melt it and rub on stains till dry and peel off like silly putty with the stain stuck to it I have not tried it yet.</li>
            <li> **Pay close attention to the item description!** I thought I was getting 3 bars of 14.1 oz soap. I was actually getting 1 bar of 14.1 oz soap, or the equivalent of 3 small bars. I was very confused when my package arrived, but I double checked the product description on here. Turns out I was the one who made a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this soap as an ingredient for homemade laundry detergent powder. I found the recipe on the blog How Does She and used that. I made a half batch of the detergent and it made a lot. I am very happy with the detergent recipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap itself is a little harder to grate than Fels-Naptha. It&#x27;s softer, like cheese. So it gunks up the grater a bit and makes it more difficult. But it smells sooooo much better than FN! It&#x27;s a soapy citrusy smell with a floral note as well. It reminds me a lot of Ivory soap. The shavings are also a lot easier to mix with the other detergent ingredients and make sure you get a good mix. I combined mine with Lavender Blossom Purex Crystals and my detergent smells heavenly!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is intersested in making their own laundry soap. There is nothing i do not like about this product i couldn&#x27;t be happier. I chose this reating because i do LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SOAP..  ..I RECOMMEND IT!</li>
            <li> I found this soap in the 14.1 oz. size at BigLots for 90 cents.  I had never heard of it before, but I thought that I would give it a try.  I had several bras that still had antiperspirant residue even though they had been through the washing machine (high efficiency machine in a lingerie bag), so I decided to try using this soap to handwash the items. It worked beautifully.  It sudsed up nicely and had a very pleasant scent and also rinsed out easily. This could be the perfect travel companion since it is not a liquid and could be used to wash all your clothing in a pinch.  I am glad that I gave it a try and I will stock up on some more!  I wrapped a rubber band around the middle since the bar is very slippery, but you could probably also cut the bar in smaller pieces. Happy Washing!</li>
            <li> too hard to work with.  I used this product for homemade laundry detergent. I will try the other recipes next time without Zote.</li>
            <li> Never having used this soap before, I was pleasantly surprises by the pretty scent.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> 3 bars promised, 1 bar arrived.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the latest craze of making my own laundry detergent.  Wish me luck!  Zote was recommended for this.  FYI: the &amp;#34;recipe&amp;#34; can be found on Pinterest.</li>
            <li> I purchase it to quickly handwash some baby items.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s great when there is a leak/spill and you don&#x27;t want to add bib/onsie to a pile of laundry to get stinkier and crustier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great! A lot easier to use for hand-washing than detergent. It foams really well, has pleasant smell, and gets the dirt out. Have not experimented with really heavy/older stains though. Seems to be ok for baby skin, although my kid never had sensitive skin issues.</li>
            <li> Best for making my laundry soap.  Fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;Gentle an excettlent when washing more delicate clothes.  Also easier to shred and blend.</li>
            <li> I recently made my own laundry detergent and I like the zote soap much better than fels naphtha.  Very satisfied</li>
            <li> I have a seven month old baby who go through at least 3-5 bibs everyday.  I hand wash her bibs with the ZOTE soap.  Smells nice but not too strong and removes stains very well.  This soap keeps white very white and also keeps other color bright.  I also love this soap because it does not dry up my hands.</li>
            <li> Mixed with washing soda and borax, this makes a good soap for laundry.  Nice citronella smell, and the clothes come out soft and clean.</li>
            <li> if you are traveling or simply don&#x27;t have a washing machine, you&#x27;ve got to get yourself a laundry bar. zote is great because it cleans very effectively and from what i&#x27;ve read, it&#x27;s gentle on skin. if you&#x27;re in the US and you&#x27;re looking for a laundry bar, you&#x27;ll probably only find Fels-Naptha in your grocery store. this is not the same. it&#x27;s a pre-treater and it recommends keeping it off your skin. yikes! that&#x27;s not appropriate for hand-washing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this bar is BIG. i cut mine in 4s so that it&#x27;s a reasonable size to handle when washing my clothes in a sink. it&#x27;s very soft, so cutting it was easy.</li>
            <li> I use the Zote soap to make my own laundry soap mixture and I love the way it smells.  Scent is very important to my laundry needs.  It also does a pretty good job of cleaning clothes.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding this soap until I realized it was made in Mexico. Then the light went on in my head! Try an international market. Sure enough, there it was in the laundry aisle and I paid 1.19 a bar :) Using this to make DIY laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> supposed to be &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;, terrible toxic odor, threw them out vs. paying for return postage.</li>
            <li> The soap is great. It cleans and gentle. I make my own laundry soap and this does the job better than felsa naptha, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller, CV Trading Corp, is poor. The ad says (3 Bars) for the price. I ordered twice, each time I received ONE bar. I think it&#x27;s far too expensive for one bar. Amazon agreed with me and returned payment on both orders. I did notify after the first incorrect order and was instructed to order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the person who packages the box or the seller itself. However, I would make sure you receive what you pay for. You can by  6 bars of the same size (14 oz) for the same price at the popular online auction site. I love Amazon and will continue to buy from here, but not from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I found all the reviews here very helpful, so......thanks ladies and possibly any gentlemen too!! I have my badly stained and smelly sheets in the washer at this very moment after following some good advice from other users ;0)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different things on my clothing and sheets in the past with semi okay results but not as great as I&#x27;d like so I hope the Zote works as good as everyone says! I rubbed it into the Self Tanner Lotion and body oil stains on my white background floral sheets. I then put them into a washerfull of hot water, Borax and laundry soap as I usually do for regular soiled laundry.  I will come back to post my results and am happy to find Zote available here on Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;I picked my first bar up at my local 99 Cent Store I got the blue and white label which was just uncolored Zote but they also have the Pink so if anyone needs a quick bar of Zote thats a good place to go!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again for all the good advice and reviews!</li>
            <li> Smells good and easy to shred.  Used it to make my own laundry soap.  Worked great and smelled great.  Price is good as well.</li>
            <li> The slight fragrance of the pink Zote works OK for me. I started making my own laundry soap because I can&#x27;t handle the smell of commercial ones, and the fragrance free &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; soaps are either too pricey or still make me itchy. The Zote shreds nicely with a cheese-grater blade on my mandoline. One bar grates up 6 cups, enough for 3  2-gallon batches of laundry soap. And it does an awesome job in our hard rusty well water.</li>
            <li> I grate the soap and mix it with Washing Soda and Borax, which makes a great landry soap, and for just pennies a load</li>
            <li> We love this soap! And we actually paid this price ($10 for 3ea)&lt;br /&gt;BUT we just found this exact bar for 97 cents each at our local Super Center (in the cleaners isle). Great product, but you&#x27;ll pay too much here for it.</li>
            <li> I had to write a follow up on my previous review.  I ordeered this soap&#x3D; zote soap. it is advertized as 3- 14.1 oz bars but when it arrived it was only 1 bar. I contacted the seller and asked why / how this is.  They said it was a mix up w/ the company who posts the product (basically). I am not sure if that is Amazon- I did not ask. But they gave a full refund. Just be careful on this postiing- it is 1 14.1 oz bar of soap - not 3.&lt;br /&gt;FYI.</li>
            <li> I try to make all my home products, as well as personal care products.  With the laundry detergent, I used Fels Naptha first.  My clothes came clean but smelled like my kitchen floor; not satisfactory for us in the fragreance department. Then I tried pink Zote; super cleaning power, fragrance and ease of grinding.  I&#x27;m on my 4th batch since starting to use this soap.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to go into homemade laundry detergent. It smells great and disolves easily. I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have recently becomr very frugal, and Zote soap is one of my household miracles. I do all my laundry by hand, and this soap cleans my clothing well. The fragrance is distinct but not overwhelming. Whitens my washcloths pretty well. I also use Zote sometimes on my dishes and even occasionally bathe with it.</li>
            <li> I make my own clothes soap. I prefer Zote&#x27;s over the other bar soap. It has a nice smell. Will but again</li>
            <li> This smells so good. It reminds me of childhood. I used this Zote for homemade laundry soap and it made it a really fun color (the base was white powder and the shreds of pink made it look super fun)</li>
            <li> Great product to make laundry detergent. It&#x27;s gentle even for little kids. One soap bar will make over one bucket of detergent. Good product</li>
            <li> i purchased this to make home made laundry soap - super easy to grate if the recipe calls for it. Smells good as well. Super fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have been making my own laundry soap for years now and have always loved the smell of zote. it leaves my clothes smelling very fresh.</li>
            <li> works well, strong scent</li>
            <li> Powerful in cleaning and gentle to hands!</li>
            <li> Good soap for everything.  One bar does it all, shower, shave, shampoo and laundry!!</li>
            <li> It works well washing delicate clothes. I like it.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to make my own laundry detergent. The description doesn&#x27;t state that this is the pink kind and now looking back at it, I guess I was given the wrong soap. It smell isn&#x27;t pleasant, but VERY strong. I don&#x27;t like it (the pink kind)</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone looking to make their own laundry soap.  That is what I am using it for currently.  I was great shredded up by the cheese grater and added to the rest of the detergents.  It smells wonderful, and I am very pleased with the smell and cleanliness of my laundry!  The shipping was excellent - packaging and timing, and the experience will be repeated!</li>
            <li> My son has very sensitive skin and was always breaking out in terrible rashes until I started making our laundry detergent using 3 bars of this soap (finely grated), container of washing soda, baking soda, box of borax along with container of oxi-clean (Sun name brand is cheaper). Usually cost me $30 to make but that batch has lasted us 6 months already with some still left (washing for 2).</li>
            <li> I make my own laundry soap.  The zote as an additive works well and smells good too.  I have tried other brands of soap but this one seems to clean really well while smelling great.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to make my own laundry detergent, but I ended up buying it at wal-mart. It was only 97 cents for a bar the same size! So this is clearly overpriced. Shop around unless this is your last resort!</li>
            <li> Very good for hand wash!</li>
            <li> Looks old fashioned but certainly gets out any stain -- even mustard and blood!  Wish I would have bought more.</li>
            <li> it was exactly as advertised and precisly what I needed for my homemade laundry detergent project I did.Thank You for the product</li>
            <li> Used these to make homemade laundry detergent. It is effective, but smells bad and is hard to shred/flake, which is necessary while making detergent. Next time I will buy laundry soap that is already shredded. Check amazon for those varieties and save yourself a lot of time and hassle.</li>
