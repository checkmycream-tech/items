            <li>My ingrown hairs have greatly diminished.</li>
            <li>Works great in conjunction with the Bump Patrol.</li>
            <li>this handle with the Personna carts is a great combo.  </li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>it is probably one of the best TRACII cartridge compatible handles on the market, featuring a nice metal body and a rubberized grip.</li>
            <li>shave delivered by both the included cartridges as well as the dorcos with this handle was great.</li>
            <li>Great handle for Trac II style blades</li>
            <li>Very effective for burn.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice weight, and non-slippery as well.</li>
            <li>Very innovative &amp; a great value.    </li>
            <li>The handle with replaceable cartridges seems to be better than the disposable but disposables are very good too.    </li>
            <li>Love it, great price, great service</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to</li>
            <li>A good razor set, it helped reduce my irritation but I still bump up.</li>
            <li>Good For A Man Trying To Avoid Turned Under Hairs</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say how good it</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Chinese-made Wilkinson \\&quot;Trac II\\&quot; style from Wal-Mart are good.</li>
            <li>Did not give a good shave at all.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the order.</li>
            <li>Nice weight, good texture.  </li>
            <li>MY SKIN IS SMOOTH LIKE A TEENAGER!!  </li>
            <li>For more than just your face!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as close as a straight blade, but it still does a wonderful job without any pain on the healing cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a nice quality handle and has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li>I suggest you get this razor along with Personna Twin Pivot Blades which slides nicely onto the Bump Fighter</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best!</li>
            <li>It is still a great handle with a nice weight and rubber exterior that provides better gripping in the shower where I use it.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for the nice razor.</li>
            <li>Of the modern Trac II razors one can purchase this is probably the best for your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trac</li>
            <li>These shavers look cheap, and feel cheap, but work INCREDIBLY.</li>
            <li>IMO, that&#x27;s a fair trade for smooth, healthy skin.</li>
            <li>and I found OK  .</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purcahse.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you can use this for your skin if you use if as soon as the problem presents itself.</li>
            <li>If you try it, I think you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>and i just cant stop touching my face.....</li>
            <li>This (non-disposable) worked much better.</li>
            <li>Glad I did, nothing, for me, can compare to it~~</li>
            <li>You can find inexpensive equivalents at most drugstores) and included the Bumpfighter blades.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I wished they carried it at more shops</li>
            <li>More food markets and pharmacies should carry it</li>
            <li>Like many others, I am a DE shaver who bought this for travel.</li>
            <li>I have been able to shave forever without getting razor bumps.</li>
            <li>I was able to get this handle and 100 carts.</li>
            <li>however it took nothing off of my face and you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell I shaved after using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to shave in any direction with no irritations at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;One thing to consider:  By design, this razor doesn&#x27;t shave as close as most do.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s okay with me.</li>
            <li>The Bump fighter razor is a great product on two main points.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some had good results at first</li>
            <li>I got it because of all the multiple blade razors ever made, I still like the original Gillette Trac II the best.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for my old Trac II Razor, I was happy with it until I saw it at CVS Pharmacy for 1/2 the price I paid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame this razor isn&#x27;t more widely available.</li>
            <li>Works very well, good close shave and uses affordable tracII blades.</li>
            <li>Ingrown hairs and razor bumps, they hurt and they didn&#x27;t go away easily.  </li>
            <li>These are the best blades I&#x27;ve found so far for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>When I fished shaving my head was so smooth that didn&#x27;t need to rub any alcohol on just wash and done...</li>
            <li>BUT IT WILL BE NOTICEABLY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>Thank God it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>My wife is happy with the shave which is definitely not as close as a mach-x turbo.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the experimentation for sure.</li>
            <li>but fortunately I can buy in bulk from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Cheap product, cheap results</li>
            <li>school, heavy and balanced, perfect match for the \\&quot;Twin Pivot\\&quot; Personna blades they sell here @ $25 for 50 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using Personna Twin Pivot Plus cartridges, which will fit either a Trac II style handle or one of the pivoting head Atra-style handles.</li>
            <li>but they are cheap</li>
            <li>importantly to me-</li>
            <li>I loved my old handle for the 2x track razors.  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says, delivering the most comfortable shave</li>
            <li>recommend this item to anyone who is looking to utlize the economically priced Trac II blades or their alternative razor refills!</li>
            <li>If you are having issues with bumps you should really give these a try! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used an original Gillette Trac II razor for over 30 years; who knew you can still buy the original blades online???</li>
            <li>Now that I have this product, I can shave, have nice smooth skin, and look professional.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m going out I like to clean it up the lines and shave to the skin under my jawline.  </li>
            <li>Clean close shave every time.  </li>
            <li>The only good thing about it is the comfortable handle.</li>
            <li>It did seem to clog a little quicker and require more rinses than the SensorExcel I was using but yielded a very nice shave with the Personna carts.    </li>
            <li>First off the actually handle has a great weight to it and does not feel cheap at all.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these razors.  </li>
            <li>, don&#x27;t let the low price fool you: the blades are good</li>
            <li>rubber handle is very sturdy, comfortable and easy to control; I have had no irritation or bumps since using this product.</li>
            <li>For Trac 2 Blades just a great Balanced Razor Doesn&#x27;t feel like your having your skin peeled off as other Blades and Razors.</li>
            <li>It should last me for many many years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>super cheap)....the girls have noticed too</li>
            <li>the perfect product for African American males that get ingrown hairs from shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li>Dorco, from Korea, also makes blades for this kind of razor; that&#x27;s the sort Dollar General sells for about $1.25 for five.</li>
            <li>then I realized I didn&#x27;t need a clean, close shave, I just needed a bump free shave and BF razor is absolutely the solution.</li>
            <li>MANY TIMES WHEN I TRIED SOMETHING NEW I WOULD BREAK OUT</li>
            <li>I previously purchased the disposable bump fighter and it took many passes to effectively shave.</li>
            <li>It seems that, as said previously, they don&#x27;t give as close a shave, but do protect from bumps, and more from cuts and nicks, and are more comfortable.</li>
            <li>follow it up with Trac 2 blades that fit the handle for a very close shave, or use throw-aways.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re probably harder to get at a good price.</li>
            <li>I like having it because that guard on the blade keeps the blade from touching my skin, so it just cuts the hairs, and doesn&#x27;t come into direct contact with the skin, thereby leaving the wounds alone.  </li>
            <li>The reason it&#x27;s so effective is that the blade doesn&#x27;t actually contact the skin</li>
            <li>But of course Gillette won&#x27;t sell those any more because they can&#x27;t get away with charging five bucks a blade for an old design where the patents have run out.</li>
            <li>The skin around my mouth gets red and irritated and ingrown hairs very easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the closest shave possible, but it is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>, I just use this razor when I&#x27;m in a hurry, so I don&#x27;t hack up my face in the first place.</li>
            <li>but the blades you can find anywhere and many stores have generic blade refills.....</li>
            <li>Added to my cart as an extra and glad I did.</li>
            <li>NOW I SHAVE WITHOUT NEEDING TO TWEEZE FIRST.</li>
            <li>It still leaves a pretty close shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those &#x27;5 blades does not equal a better shave&#x27; guys.</li>
            <li>Bumpfighter does EXACTLY what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>and I really have NO bumps post shaving with this kit!</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>My skin started clearing up within that first month, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found these on pinterest, thanks pinterest!</li>
            <li>I thought I found the right blade for me with the safety razor, but I couldnt shave as fast as I like</li>
            <li>Match it with genuine Gillette Trac II or Wilkinson Twin II blades (the included Bump Fighter blades are rough on the skin) and you have a comfortable and cost efficient shaving system.</li>
            <li>That may sound like extra work, but the benefit of not having razor bumps are worth it to me.</li>
            <li>This product is good to use but not very good</li>
            <li>not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bump Fighter razor single guarded blade won&#x27;t give you the closest shave ever - but that&#x27;s the point of the exercise!</li>
            <li>The Bump Fighter razor is pretty clever.</li>
            <li>But we all have those times when we&#x27;re in a hurry, and when I am hasty with that straight razor, I always end up butchering my face.  </li>
            <li>These did absolutely nothing...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple, but cool design that performs exactly as described: providing a [reasonably] close shave without causing razor bumps.    </li>
            <li>I dont really care for the Bump Fighter blades, but someone else here said it fits Trac II blades, so I went out and bought one</li>
            <li>Not found  much in stores.  </li>
            <li>and it does absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>I threw the whole thing out after one use.  </li>
            <li>Tried a cheap chinese knock off, but it broke in a week!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>He appreciated the interchangeable heads.</li>
            <li>I had been very nervous to use razors as I would always get razor bumps</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave</li>
            <li>that really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I use all summer on my bikini line and it is totally bump free.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t get bumps from maybe once in a while</li>
            <li>Really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>II carts are extremely cheap, especially if you don&#x27;t buy the gillette</li>
            <li>First things first, i have extremely sensitive skin on head and face.</li>
            <li>To top it off, it&#x27;s reducing my ingrown hairs and solving the acne problem I get from the damage from other razors.</li>
            <li>I knew that this wouldn&#x27;t cut as close as most other razors because that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to help prevent irritation and ingrown hairs, but this goes well beyond &amp;#34;not close&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>A female co-worker wanted me to be clean shaven for meetings.</li>
            <li>Lo and behold, 15 years later I find myself in the workforce and needing a clean shaven face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Those blades can be a Godsend for a black guy, as some have written; if you&#x27;re like me, buy it for the handle and don&#x27;t bother with the blades unless you try the ones it comes with and like them a lot better.</li>
            <li>These blades may well stop bumps on black men in fact I&#x27;m sure they do.</li>
            <li>By giving you a really mild shave with a tiny bit of stubble the irritation and ingrown hairs are minimized.</li>
            <li>You will not get a super close shave from this razor, but you will get a decent enough shave without the irritation you may be accustomed to.</li>
            <li>It had good balance, wasn&#x27;t too heavy or slippery, and it&#x27;s been dropped several times without damage.</li>
            <li>For me personally, the Bump Fighter Cartridges ended up not working out so well for me, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they can&#x27;t be great for someone else.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this</li>
            <li>If you are looking to get away from the high cost of brand name cartridges with out going to safety blades</li>
            <li>I agree with other reviews that say the handle is nice, so if you want it to use with a different blade, that would work.</li>
            <li>The handle has a nice, solid feel, and I am keeping it for other cartridges.</li>
            <li>i will not live a summer without them, and they are worth 30 buck each to me!</li>
            <li>The blades are specially formulated to shave the hair without touching or irritating the skin surface.</li>
            <li>shave with an old fashioned straight razor.  </li>
            <li>This razor&#x27;s blades are designed to keep the blade edge from dragging directly against your skin, and it keeps you from getting a very close shave, two of the biggest contributors to razor irritation.</li>
            <li>In fact if you get heaps of razor bumps the closeness of this shave without any nicks and cuts will likely be better in the long run than a razor turning your skin into rocky road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>been using these for 20 years now  - not a total solution, but with a wahl (for your problem areas), and these blades for the rest - its worth the convenience of no bumps.</li>
            <li>specially for black men (which I happen to be) but definitely a must for people who shave frequently and easily get irritated.</li>
            <li>From the Personna website:&lt;br /&gt; \\&quot;Bump Fighter® is the only shaving system specially designed to meet the special skincare needs of African American men.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>\\&quot;MIN NEW YORK SOLUTION2 POST SHAVE</li>
            <li>I can go on and tell you more in detail about my past</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get as close as a regular razor, but it does exactly what I need it to.  </li>
            <li>If you have light skin and dark hair - or dark skin and light hair, for that matter - this razor will leave you with somewhat visible stubble.</li>
            <li>question to any African men,(not sure why Personna said Afican American, perhaps they won&#x27;t ship to Africa,) what special skin care needs are different than other males?</li>
            <li>I was only using an electric trimmer for my beard and only using razors on special occasions.  </li>
            <li>I am a guy that just happens to like the old TracII blades, and needed a new handle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m white, and don&#x27;t need Bump Fighter blades, so I didn&#x27;t give them much of a trial.</li>
            <li>Talk about opening up old wounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only that, this product is very well made for the price.</li>
            <li>Use the Bump Fighter blade on your sensitive parts and the Personna blade on your not so prickly skin for a closer shave there.</li>
            <li>I use these to shave my sensitive bikini area..and underarms....</li>
            <li>As someone who has sensitive skin and gets razor bumps every time I shave, these have changed my life.  </li>
            <li>I am 84 years old ands never, ever cut myself when shaving with Bump Fighter.  </li>
            <li>I have uber sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but so far no razor bumps, no ingrowns,</li>
            <li>I even have sensitive skin, and suck at exfoliating like I should.</li>
            <li>Having only one blade they wear out fast</li>
            <li>Well, a few months ago, I dropped my original Trac II handle and broke it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say from experience because I&#x27;m not black</li>
            <li>As it has been stated in previous reviews, this special blade does not give you a smooth  shave like \\&quot;regular\\&quot; razor cartridges, but it leaves a small stubble that can be cut with a second shave if you desire.</li>
            <li>I get that clean line shaven to the skin look for about a day and a half, and I only need it one day at a time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Prior to this, I naively used many kinds of regular name- and store-brand razors, in hopes of finding something that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my skin and cause ingrown hairs and razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These in turn are caused, often, by shaving too closely, especially if you have very curly facial</li>
            <li>If you are a woman reading this, look at NO other reviews.</li>
            <li>I could never shave my neck more than every 3rd day without fear of serious skin irritation until I tried Bump Fighter.  </li>
            <li>I actually used this to clear up some bumps that were on my head that occurred as a result of me shaving my head bald.</li>
            <li>I finally received this razor and wow does it work.</li>
            <li>Slightly less irritation than a normal blade, but doesn&#x27;t get particularly close either.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in the decade and a half I&#x27;ve been shaving my skin is healing.</li>
            <li>so I can shave up down and across getting a very close shave without burn.</li>
            <li>When I first saw this product I assumed that it was a problem specific blade (bumps)for black men only.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this razor to others suffering from Pseudofolliculitis, or any other skin irritations.</li>
            <li>and so far 6 days in a row I haven&#x27;t had a single ingrown hair.</li>
            <li>He went right back to his previous razors &amp; is shaving less frequently which seems to be working.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great product</li>
            <li> it is probably one of the best TRACII cartridge compatible handles on the market, featuring a nice metal body and a rubberized grip.</li>
            <li> shave delivered by both the included cartridges as well as the dorcos with this handle was great.</li>
            <li> Great handle for Trac II style blades</li>
            <li> Very effective for burn.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice weight, and non-slippery as well.</li>
            <li> Very innovative &amp; a great value.    </li>
            <li> The handle with replaceable cartridges seems to be better than the disposable but disposables are very good too.    </li>
            <li> Love it, great price, great service</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to</li>
            <li> A good razor set, it helped reduce my irritation but I still bump up.</li>
            <li> Good For A Man Trying To Avoid Turned Under Hairs</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say how good it</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Chinese-made Wilkinson \\&quot;Trac II\\&quot; style from Wal-Mart are good.</li>
            <li> Did not give a good shave at all.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the order.</li>
            <li> Nice weight, good texture.  </li>
            <li> MY SKIN IS SMOOTH LIKE A TEENAGER!!  </li>
            <li> For more than just your face!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as close as a straight blade, but it still does a wonderful job without any pain on the healing cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a nice quality handle and has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li> I suggest you get this razor along with Personna Twin Pivot Blades which slides nicely onto the Bump Fighter</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best!</li>
            <li> It is still a great handle with a nice weight and rubber exterior that provides better gripping in the shower where I use it.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for the nice razor.</li>
            <li> Of the modern Trac II razors one can purchase this is probably the best for your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trac</li>
            <li> These shavers look cheap, and feel cheap, but work INCREDIBLY.</li>
            <li> IMO, that&#x27;s a fair trade for smooth, healthy skin.</li>
            <li> and I found OK  .</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purcahse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you can use this for your skin if you use if as soon as the problem presents itself.</li>
            <li> If you try it, I think you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> and i just cant stop touching my face.....</li>
            <li> This (non-disposable) worked much better.</li>
            <li> Glad I did, nothing, for me, can compare to it~~</li>
            <li> You can find inexpensive equivalents at most drugstores) and included the Bumpfighter blades.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I wished they carried it at more shops</li>
            <li> More food markets and pharmacies should carry it</li>
            <li> Like many others, I am a DE shaver who bought this for travel.</li>
            <li> I have been able to shave forever without getting razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I was able to get this handle and 100 carts.</li>
            <li> however it took nothing off of my face and you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell I shaved after using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to shave in any direction with no irritations at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One thing to consider:  By design, this razor doesn&#x27;t shave as close as most do.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s okay with me.</li>
            <li> The Bump fighter razor is a great product on two main points.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some had good results at first</li>
            <li> I got it because of all the multiple blade razors ever made, I still like the original Gillette Trac II the best.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my old Trac II Razor, I was happy with it until I saw it at CVS Pharmacy for 1/2 the price I paid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame this razor isn&#x27;t more widely available.</li>
            <li> Works very well, good close shave and uses affordable tracII blades.</li>
            <li> Ingrown hairs and razor bumps, they hurt and they didn&#x27;t go away easily.  </li>
            <li> These are the best blades I&#x27;ve found so far for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> When I fished shaving my head was so smooth that didn&#x27;t need to rub any alcohol on just wash and done...</li>
            <li> BUT IT WILL BE NOTICEABLY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> Thank God it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> My wife is happy with the shave which is definitely not as close as a mach-x turbo.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the experimentation for sure.</li>
            <li> but fortunately I can buy in bulk from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Cheap product, cheap results</li>
            <li> school, heavy and balanced, perfect match for the \\&quot;Twin Pivot\\&quot; Personna blades they sell here @ $25 for 50 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using Personna Twin Pivot Plus cartridges, which will fit either a Trac II style handle or one of the pivoting head Atra-style handles.</li>
            <li> but they are cheap</li>
            <li> importantly to me-</li>
            <li> I loved my old handle for the 2x track razors.  </li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says, delivering the most comfortable shave</li>
            <li> recommend this item to anyone who is looking to utlize the economically priced Trac II blades or their alternative razor refills!</li>
            <li> If you are having issues with bumps you should really give these a try! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an original Gillette Trac II razor for over 30 years; who knew you can still buy the original blades online???</li>
            <li> Now that I have this product, I can shave, have nice smooth skin, and look professional.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m going out I like to clean it up the lines and shave to the skin under my jawline.  </li>
            <li> Clean close shave every time.  </li>
            <li> The only good thing about it is the comfortable handle.</li>
            <li> It did seem to clog a little quicker and require more rinses than the SensorExcel I was using but yielded a very nice shave with the Personna carts.    </li>
            <li> First off the actually handle has a great weight to it and does not feel cheap at all.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these razors.  </li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t let the low price fool you: the blades are good</li>
            <li> rubber handle is very sturdy, comfortable and easy to control; I have had no irritation or bumps since using this product.</li>
            <li> For Trac 2 Blades just a great Balanced Razor Doesn&#x27;t feel like your having your skin peeled off as other Blades and Razors.</li>
            <li> It should last me for many many years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> super cheap)....the girls have noticed too</li>
            <li> the perfect product for African American males that get ingrown hairs from shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li> Dorco, from Korea, also makes blades for this kind of razor; that&#x27;s the sort Dollar General sells for about $1.25 for five.</li>
            <li> then I realized I didn&#x27;t need a clean, close shave, I just needed a bump free shave and BF razor is absolutely the solution.</li>
            <li> MANY TIMES WHEN I TRIED SOMETHING NEW I WOULD BREAK OUT</li>
            <li> I previously purchased the disposable bump fighter and it took many passes to effectively shave.</li>
            <li> It seems that, as said previously, they don&#x27;t give as close a shave, but do protect from bumps, and more from cuts and nicks, and are more comfortable.</li>
            <li> follow it up with Trac 2 blades that fit the handle for a very close shave, or use throw-aways.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re probably harder to get at a good price.</li>
            <li> I like having it because that guard on the blade keeps the blade from touching my skin, so it just cuts the hairs, and doesn&#x27;t come into direct contact with the skin, thereby leaving the wounds alone.  </li>
            <li> The reason it&#x27;s so effective is that the blade doesn&#x27;t actually contact the skin</li>
            <li> But of course Gillette won&#x27;t sell those any more because they can&#x27;t get away with charging five bucks a blade for an old design where the patents have run out.</li>
            <li> The skin around my mouth gets red and irritated and ingrown hairs very easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the closest shave possible, but it is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> , I just use this razor when I&#x27;m in a hurry, so I don&#x27;t hack up my face in the first place.</li>
            <li> but the blades you can find anywhere and many stores have generic blade refills.....</li>
            <li> Added to my cart as an extra and glad I did.</li>
            <li> NOW I SHAVE WITHOUT NEEDING TO TWEEZE FIRST.</li>
            <li> It still leaves a pretty close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those &#x27;5 blades does not equal a better shave&#x27; guys.</li>
            <li> Bumpfighter does EXACTLY what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> and I really have NO bumps post shaving with this kit!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> My skin started clearing up within that first month, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found these on pinterest, thanks pinterest!</li>
            <li> I thought I found the right blade for me with the safety razor, but I couldnt shave as fast as I like</li>
            <li> Match it with genuine Gillette Trac II or Wilkinson Twin II blades (the included Bump Fighter blades are rough on the skin) and you have a comfortable and cost efficient shaving system.</li>
            <li> That may sound like extra work, but the benefit of not having razor bumps are worth it to me.</li>
            <li> This product is good to use but not very good</li>
            <li> not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bump Fighter razor single guarded blade won&#x27;t give you the closest shave ever - but that&#x27;s the point of the exercise!</li>
            <li> The Bump Fighter razor is pretty clever.</li>
            <li> But we all have those times when we&#x27;re in a hurry, and when I am hasty with that straight razor, I always end up butchering my face.  </li>
            <li> These did absolutely nothing...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple, but cool design that performs exactly as described: providing a [reasonably] close shave without causing razor bumps.    </li>
            <li> I dont really care for the Bump Fighter blades, but someone else here said it fits Trac II blades, so I went out and bought one</li>
            <li> Not found  much in stores.  </li>
            <li> and it does absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> I threw the whole thing out after one use.  </li>
            <li> Tried a cheap chinese knock off, but it broke in a week!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> He appreciated the interchangeable heads.</li>
            <li> I had been very nervous to use razors as I would always get razor bumps</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave</li>
            <li> that really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I use all summer on my bikini line and it is totally bump free.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t get bumps from maybe once in a while</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> II carts are extremely cheap, especially if you don&#x27;t buy the gillette</li>
            <li> First things first, i have extremely sensitive skin on head and face.</li>
            <li> To top it off, it&#x27;s reducing my ingrown hairs and solving the acne problem I get from the damage from other razors.</li>
            <li> I knew that this wouldn&#x27;t cut as close as most other razors because that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to help prevent irritation and ingrown hairs, but this goes well beyond &amp;#34;not close&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> A female co-worker wanted me to be clean shaven for meetings.</li>
            <li> Lo and behold, 15 years later I find myself in the workforce and needing a clean shaven face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Those blades can be a Godsend for a black guy, as some have written; if you&#x27;re like me, buy it for the handle and don&#x27;t bother with the blades unless you try the ones it comes with and like them a lot better.</li>
            <li> These blades may well stop bumps on black men in fact I&#x27;m sure they do.</li>
            <li> By giving you a really mild shave with a tiny bit of stubble the irritation and ingrown hairs are minimized.</li>
            <li> You will not get a super close shave from this razor, but you will get a decent enough shave without the irritation you may be accustomed to.</li>
            <li> It had good balance, wasn&#x27;t too heavy or slippery, and it&#x27;s been dropped several times without damage.</li>
            <li> For me personally, the Bump Fighter Cartridges ended up not working out so well for me, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they can&#x27;t be great for someone else.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this</li>
            <li> If you are looking to get away from the high cost of brand name cartridges with out going to safety blades</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews that say the handle is nice, so if you want it to use with a different blade, that would work.</li>
            <li> The handle has a nice, solid feel, and I am keeping it for other cartridges.</li>
            <li> i will not live a summer without them, and they are worth 30 buck each to me!</li>
            <li> The blades are specially formulated to shave the hair without touching or irritating the skin surface.</li>
            <li> shave with an old fashioned straight razor.  </li>
            <li> This razor&#x27;s blades are designed to keep the blade edge from dragging directly against your skin, and it keeps you from getting a very close shave, two of the biggest contributors to razor irritation.</li>
            <li> In fact if you get heaps of razor bumps the closeness of this shave without any nicks and cuts will likely be better in the long run than a razor turning your skin into rocky road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> been using these for 20 years now  - not a total solution, but with a wahl (for your problem areas), and these blades for the rest - its worth the convenience of no bumps.</li>
            <li> specially for black men (which I happen to be) but definitely a must for people who shave frequently and easily get irritated.</li>
            <li> From the Personna website:&lt;br /&gt; \\&quot;Bump Fighter® is the only shaving system specially designed to meet the special skincare needs of African American men.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> \\&quot;MIN NEW YORK SOLUTION2 POST SHAVE</li>
            <li> I can go on and tell you more in detail about my past</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get as close as a regular razor, but it does exactly what I need it to.  </li>
            <li> If you have light skin and dark hair - or dark skin and light hair, for that matter - this razor will leave you with somewhat visible stubble.</li>
            <li> question to any African men,(not sure why Personna said Afican American, perhaps they won&#x27;t ship to Africa,) what special skin care needs are different than other males?</li>
            <li> I was only using an electric trimmer for my beard and only using razors on special occasions.  </li>
            <li> I am a guy that just happens to like the old TracII blades, and needed a new handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white, and don&#x27;t need Bump Fighter blades, so I didn&#x27;t give them much of a trial.</li>
            <li> Talk about opening up old wounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only that, this product is very well made for the price.</li>
            <li> Use the Bump Fighter blade on your sensitive parts and the Personna blade on your not so prickly skin for a closer shave there.</li>
            <li> I use these to shave my sensitive bikini area..and underarms....</li>
            <li> As someone who has sensitive skin and gets razor bumps every time I shave, these have changed my life.  </li>
            <li> I am 84 years old ands never, ever cut myself when shaving with Bump Fighter.  </li>
            <li> I have uber sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but so far no razor bumps, no ingrowns,</li>
            <li> I even have sensitive skin, and suck at exfoliating like I should.</li>
            <li> Having only one blade they wear out fast</li>
            <li> Well, a few months ago, I dropped my original Trac II handle and broke it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say from experience because I&#x27;m not black</li>
            <li> As it has been stated in previous reviews, this special blade does not give you a smooth  shave like \\&quot;regular\\&quot; razor cartridges, but it leaves a small stubble that can be cut with a second shave if you desire.</li>
            <li> I get that clean line shaven to the skin look for about a day and a half, and I only need it one day at a time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Prior to this, I naively used many kinds of regular name- and store-brand razors, in hopes of finding something that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my skin and cause ingrown hairs and razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These in turn are caused, often, by shaving too closely, especially if you have very curly facial</li>
            <li> If you are a woman reading this, look at NO other reviews.</li>
            <li> I could never shave my neck more than every 3rd day without fear of serious skin irritation until I tried Bump Fighter.  </li>
            <li> I actually used this to clear up some bumps that were on my head that occurred as a result of me shaving my head bald.</li>
            <li> I finally received this razor and wow does it work.</li>
            <li> Slightly less irritation than a normal blade, but doesn&#x27;t get particularly close either.  </li>
            <li> For the first time in the decade and a half I&#x27;ve been shaving my skin is healing.</li>
            <li> so I can shave up down and across getting a very close shave without burn.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this product I assumed that it was a problem specific blade (bumps)for black men only.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor to others suffering from Pseudofolliculitis, or any other skin irritations.</li>
            <li> and so far 6 days in a row I haven&#x27;t had a single ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> He went right back to his previous razors &amp; is shaving less frequently which seems to be working.</li>
            <li> shaves out of each slide-on replacement blade, Move the cartridge half-way off to rinse the blade, the same sliding it half-way off the other - the blade becomes clear for the next use.</li>
            <li> The sliding hook-up between the handle and the blade cartridge is quite stiff and tight, all the better as the edges seem very sharp.  </li>
            <li> a private university (i am a black male, early 20s)...</li>
            <li> I use a trimmer to shave my facial hair, so I&#x27;m never completely shaven to the skin.  </li>
            <li> Should last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Tried everything from the single razor to specific gels and tend skin to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> It really works because its design is inspired by common sense:</li>
            <li> The package said \\&quot;Bump Fighter\\&quot; I wish it had said Bump and Burn Fighter because I&#x27;d have tried it long before I did.     </li>
            <li> And I have to shave every day because of school dress code, so imagine what it&#x27;s like putting the straight blade (or any razor for that matter) back to my still weak face.  </li>
            <li> Like several other reviewers I was looking for a handle for \\&quot;Personna Twin Pivot Plus 100\\&quot;.    </li>
            <li> They seem sharp enough but they are loose on the Bump Fighter handle, so I can&#x27;t recommend their use with this razor.</li>
            <li> These can be minimized by shaving with the grain but only to a certain degree as my hair grows in weird directions next to each other and some of it is curly and some is</li>
            <li> They cut the beard stubble so that there&#x27;s still a little bit left out of the skin.</li>
            <li> Found lots of fancier (and expensive) alternatives available, but read the reviews that said they were slippery and heavy.  </li>
            <li> However, I have hairs that never really leave the skin before they start to curl in</li>
            <li> Even though they aren&#x27;t very expensive to begin with, they last much longer than a regular razor blade would (mine lasts a few months each since I use an electric to shave the areas above my neck.)</li>
            <li> In the past I used over 25 different razors and NONE!!</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers, I bought this handle to use with the Personna Trac-II style blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try it anyways since the other razor is $25.</li>
            <li> I like how it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like the other ones where the blade touches the skin.</li>
            <li> My husband will not shave with any other razor.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this due to ingrown whiskers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never shave with any other razor.</li>
            <li> The handle is plastic with a metal connector for the cartridge, there are two small holes on the back that will allow water to exit when flushing through the front of the blades for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I like the Bump Fighter because I get much less skin irritation with it than with other brands.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that they rust after a week or so.</li>
            <li> so if your black or have sedative skin please try this product cause</li>
            <li> Now I can shave my neck every day and feel a lot less \\&quot;scruffy\\&quot; and unkempt than I did before on my no-shave days.    </li>
            <li> my skin has cleared up in less than 5 days...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any sort of pivot and seems to be at a slightly odd angle for me, however, so you may want to look for something with a pivot-head if you think that might be a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> Less close of a shave and reduce the amount of razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;however</li>
            <li> I also use skin tight morning/night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li> Very heavy and solid in the hand, quality that is hard to find nowadays, with oddly configured blade cartridges (2) as advertised.  </li>
            <li> No more super expensive Mach 3 refills for me, I&#x27;m going old-school with Trac II!</li>
            <li> For those who don&#x27;t know, shaving with one of those requires a little time and concentration.  </li>
            <li> The razor is made with little barriers so the blade doesn&#x27;t touch the skin.</li>
            <li> a little.</li>
            <li> The night or day I shaved was fine with them, but the next week (and sometimes longer) was horrible.  </li>
            <li> It actually made the razor bumps worse.</li>
            <li> The handle slides onto the carts snug but holds them firmly in place while shaving.    </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t shave everyday with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame that this product is not better marketed.  </li>
            <li> i have researched every possible method...depilatories (difficult to remove all of the hair even when using palmer no blade shaver), and gilette proglide, mach3..</li>
            <li> Bikini bumps no more.</li>
            <li> Did not help, and it was rather dull, too.</li>
            <li> Hardly a close shave still had a shadow after using it.</li>
            <li> The handle purchase is a bit of a rip off, but you buy it one time at least.</li>
            <li> thick rubber</li>
            <li> This product is seriously life-changing.</li>
            <li> (too bad it&#x27;s made in the 3rd world.)</li>
            <li> I had to use a regular razor after because the experience was so bad.</li>
            <li> Started using the system, at least, five years ago!</li>
            <li> I have a real tough time with razor bumps - I&#x27;ve tried the Mach3, the Hydro3, and a few of those disposable blades (I think Schick makes them).  </li>
            <li> She used it once and was not happy with the results.</li>
            <li> The blades themselves have a guard to keep the blade from irritating your skin as your shaving, but it still gives a close shave.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a serious curse!), so of course the razor can&#x27;t do anything about those.</li>
            <li> FOR THOSE WHO ARE SKEPTICAL...</li>
            <li> The guard prevents it from cutting any hairs in some places.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate and will do the job without cutting your skin.</li>
            <li> That is what I was afraid of with this razor that it would not give me that close shave that I wanted, but no worries as this thing does the job.</li>
            <li> Crazy cost of blades, etc.  </li>
            <li> SO BAD</li>
            <li> this day of 4 or 5 blade razors crap, you cant beat a Trac II!&lt;br /&gt;Gillette quit making the handles</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very heavy and solid in the hand, quality that is hard to find nowadays, with oddly configured blade cartridges (2) as advertised.  The sliding hook-up between the handle and the blade cartridge is quite stiff and tight, all the better as the edges seem very sharp.  The person I bought it for decided not to change from her Gillette Venus, so I kept this for myself as a spare handle - it just exudes quality.</li>
            <li> First things first, i have extremely sensitive skin on head and face. In the past I used over 25 different razors and NONE!! Worked I repeat NONE...I can go on and tell you more in detail about my past but just last night I showered and rubbed some shaving cream on which I never use and began to shave. When I fished shaving my head was so smooth that didn&#x27;t need to rub any alcohol on just wash and done...so if your black or have sedative skin please try this product cause you&#x27;ll days if razor bumps and ingrown hairs are over.</li>
            <li> This product is as desc in adv . This product is good to use but not very good and I found OK  .</li>
            <li> This razor accepts the Gillette Trac II razor blades which is what I wanted to use it for. It&#x27;s not the same as a Trac II but it comes close. The handle is solidly made. I am satisfied with my purcahse.</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers, I bought this handle to use with the Personna Trac-II style blades. (also purchased on Amazon.) It&#x27;s sturdy and does the job. (too bad it&#x27;s made in the 3rd world.) I&#x27;m white, and don&#x27;t need Bump Fighter blades, so I didn&#x27;t give them much of a trial. It seems that, as said previously, they don&#x27;t give as close a shave, but do protect from bumps, and more from cuts and nicks, and are more comfortable. Those blades can be a Godsend for a black guy, as some have written; if you&#x27;re like me, buy it for the handle and don&#x27;t bother with the blades unless you try the ones it comes with and like them a lot better. They&#x27;re probably harder to get at a good price.</li>
            <li> My review is going to be slightly different than others, but still shows a benefit of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave with an old fashioned straight razor.  For those who don&#x27;t know, shaving with one of those requires a little time and concentration.  But we all have those times when we&#x27;re in a hurry, and when I am hasty with that straight razor, I always end up butchering my face.  And I have to shave every day because of school dress code, so imagine what it&#x27;s like putting the straight blade (or any razor for that matter) back to my still weak face.  Talk about opening up old wounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s where this razor comes in.  I like having it because that guard on the blade keeps the blade from touching my skin, so it just cuts the hairs, and doesn&#x27;t come into direct contact with the skin, thereby leaving the wounds alone.  It&#x27;s not as close as a straight blade, but it still does a wonderful job without any pain on the healing cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I just use this razor when I&#x27;m in a hurry, so I don&#x27;t hack up my face in the first place.</li>
            <li> These did absolutely nothing... The guard prevents it from cutting any hairs in some places. Unless you want to have the appearance of freddy krueger slashing your beard... i suggest straying from this one.</li>
            <li> Its a great product. I actually used this to clear up some bumps that were on my head that occurred as a result of me shaving my head bald. Works wonder. I&#x27;m sure you can use this for your skin if you use if as soon as the problem presents itself.</li>
            <li> I like this razor for myself and I bought one for my son. I am Caucasian, so I don&#x27;t have probs with bumps, but I like the adjusted blade angle. Works very well, good close shave and uses affordable tracII blades.</li>
            <li> Love it, great price, great service</li>
            <li> Comes with 2 blades. Not the closest shave but that&#x27;s why you should buy it. Doesn&#x27;t irritate and will do the job without cutting your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame that this product is not better marketed.  It&#x27;s a simple, but cool design that performs exactly as described: providing a [reasonably] close shave without causing razor bumps.    I could never shave my neck more than every 3rd day without fear of serious skin irritation until I tried Bump Fighter.  Now I can shave my neck every day and feel a lot less \\&quot;scruffy\\&quot; and unkempt than I did before on my no-shave days.    Even though they aren&#x27;t very expensive to begin with, they last much longer than a regular razor blade would (mine lasts a few months each since I use an electric to shave the areas above my neck.) Very innovative &amp; a great value.    This product seems to be aimed at African Americans, but I&#x27;m a Caucasian guy, and definitely a fan.......</li>
            <li> I dont really care for the Bump Fighter blades, but someone else here said it fits Trac II blades, so I went out and bought one and it fits on there perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Good thick rubber handle.&lt;br /&gt;In this day of 4 or 5 blade razors crap, you cant beat a Trac II!&lt;br /&gt;Gillette quit making the handles but the blades you can find anywhere and many stores have generic blade refills.....get this handle if you are looking to shave with Trac II.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this razor handle because it fits Trac II and Personna Twin II Plus blades. This is a nice quality handle and has a nice weight to it. It should last me for many many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this item to anyone who is looking to utlize the economically priced Trac II blades or their alternative razor refills! No more super expensive Mach 3 refills for me, I&#x27;m going old-school with Trac II!</li>
            <li> I loved my old handle for the 2x track razors.  Nice weight, good texture.  Added to my cart as an extra and glad I did.</li>
            <li> FOR 20 YEARS I&#x27;VE BEEN SHAVING WITH ELECTRIC SHAVERS, RAZORS, DEPILATORIES...YOU NAME IT. NOTHING SEEMED TO GET RID OF THE RAZOR BUMPS. MANY TIMES WHEN I TRIED SOMETHING NEW I WOULD BREAK OUT SO BAD I HAD TO STAY INDOORS UNTIL I HEALED. I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS RAZOR FOR TWO WEEKS NOW AND I HAVE TOTALLY ELIMINATED THE BUMPS. MY SKIN IS SMOOTH LIKE A TEENAGER!!  FOR THOSE WHO ARE SKEPTICAL...THIS RAZOR WORKS AND IT WORKS WELL! YOU WON&#x27;T GET A MACH 3 CLOSENESS SHAVE BUT IT WILL BE NOTICEABLY SMOOTH. AFTER I \\&quot;TWEEZE\\&quot; THE EXISTING INGROWN HAIRS I SHAVE WITH THE BUMP FIGHTER RAZOR USING \\&quot;TEND SKIN AIR SHAVE GEL \\&quot; AND FINISH UP WITH \\&quot;MIN NEW YORK SOLUTION2 POST SHAVE TREATMENT.\\&quot; I NOTICED A DIFFERENCE AFTER ABOUT 4 SHAVES TWEEZING BEFORE EACH SHAVE. NOW I SHAVE WITHOUT NEEDING TO TWEEZE FIRST.</li>
            <li> These blades are the ONLY ones I have ever found  that do not cut one&#x27;s shaving face.  Not found  much in stores.  I always order online.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor to use while traveling since I cannot carry on DE or SE razor blades on an airplane. It works well and fits the cheaper Trac II cartridges perfectly. It is nothing fancy, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This product is seriously life-changing. I used to dread shaving, knowing I would be plagued by bumps two or three days later. Now that I have this product, I can shave, have nice smooth skin, and look professional. Not only that, this product is very well made for the price. This is the only razor I will buy from now on.</li>
            <li> The Bump Fighter performs as advertised. The blades are specially formulated to shave the hair without touching or irritating the skin surface. As it has been stated in previous reviews, this special blade does not give you a smooth  shave like \\&quot;regular\\&quot; razor cartridges, but it leaves a small stubble that can be cut with a second shave if you desire. That may sound like extra work, but the benefit of not having razor bumps are worth it to me. I can shave my head in about ten minutes and I&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rubber handle is very sturdy, comfortable and easy to control; I have had no irritation or bumps since using this product. I would recommend this to anyone looking to solve their shaving issues.</li>
            <li> From the Personna website:&lt;br /&gt; \\&quot;Bump Fighter® is the only shaving system specially designed to meet the special skincare needs of African American men.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My question to any African men,(not sure why Personna said Afican American, perhaps they won&#x27;t ship to Africa,) what special skin care needs are different than other males? anyone.&lt;br /&gt; I guess for the price I&#x27;ll try it anyways since the other razor is $25. without a no slip handle.</li>
            <li> I suffer from razor burns and ingrown hairs on my neck. These can be minimized by shaving with the grain but only to a certain degree as my hair grows in weird directions next to each other and some of it is curly and some is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bump Fighter razor single guarded blade won&#x27;t give you the closest shave ever - but that&#x27;s the point of the exercise! By giving you a really mild shave with a tiny bit of stubble the irritation and ingrown hairs are minimized. In fact if you get heaps of razor bumps the closeness of this shave without any nicks and cuts will likely be better in the long run than a razor turning your skin into rocky road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me with combination skin/beard I suggest you get this razor along with Personna Twin Pivot Blades which slides nicely onto the Bump Fighter handle (http://www.amazon.com/Personna-Pivot-replaces-Altra-Razors/dp/B00954O15C/ref&#x3D;sr_1_10?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1422440220&amp;sr&#x3D;8-10&amp;keywords&#x3D;personna+razor+blades). Use the Bump Fighter blade on your sensitive parts and the Personna blade on your not so prickly skin for a closer shave there. (I use the Personna blades to shave my cheeks in 3 directions - (with, across, against grain) chin and upper lip in 2 (with &amp; across grain) and the bump fighter blade in 1 direction with the grain on my neck - get two handles if you don&#x27;t want to fiddle with blades mid shave)</li>
            <li> For more than just your face!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t shave hair at all.  I&#x27;ve tried it every which way and it does absolutely nothing.  I purchased several as gifts, I will be returning them.  I agree with other reviews that say the handle is nice, so if you want it to use with a different blade, that would work.</li>
            <li> I have a real tough time with razor bumps - I&#x27;ve tried the Mach3, the Hydro3, and a few of those disposable blades (I think Schick makes them).  Every one of them has left my face raw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But NEVER have I had burn issues like I did with this razor.  My entire neck is splotchy and red - it looks like I was physically burned.  I was embarrassed to come into work.  I threw the whole thing out after one use.  Thank God it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> The razor is made with little barriers so the blade doesn&#x27;t touch the skin. I like how it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like the other ones where the blade touches the skin. It still leaves a pretty close shave. I like how it has holes in the plastic part, because I can run the blade under the water and it clears out the stubble and soap (I shave in the shower using bar soap as my shaving lotion). The only improvement I coud see is by making the blade pivot like my last razor. If you try it, I think you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I use these to shave my sensitive bikini area..and underarms....they work like a charm..great product! If you are having issues with bumps you should really give these a try! :)</li>
            <li> OMG...im currently a student @ a private university (i am a black male, early 20s)... i have researched every possible method...depilatories (difficult to remove all of the hair even when using palmer no blade shaver), and gilette proglide, mach3..etc..they all gave me razor bumps....but i bough this a week ago and cant stop shaving (i like to shave 2 times a day, its so effortless) its not as close as a proglide, but myy face doesnt have razor bumps at all...i use TEND SKIN air SHAVE (you cant feel the razor while shaving and feels great after) and tend skin after shave solution....my skin has cleared up in less than 5 days...This is the refillable razor so you can keep the handle and just buy cartridges (super cheap)....the girls have noticed too and i just cant stop touching my face.....this is the one stop shave system!!!!thank you amazon</li>
            <li> As someone who has sensitive skin and gets razor bumps every time I shave, these have changed my life.  I use a trimmer to shave my facial hair, so I&#x27;m never completely shaven to the skin.  Basically a 5 o-clock shadow at all time.  When I&#x27;m going out I like to clean it up the lines and shave to the skin under my jawline.  Before I started using this bump fighter razor I used regular razors you&#x27;d buy at the grocery store.  The night or day I shaved was fine with them, but the next week (and sometimes longer) was horrible.  Ingrown hairs and razor bumps, they hurt and they didn&#x27;t go away easily.  Got to the point where I no longer used the razor for lines and under chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all changed with this bump fighter razor though.  It doesn&#x27;t get as close as a regular razor, but it does exactly what I need it to.  I get that clean line shaven to the skin look for about a day and a half, and I only need it one day at a time.  Try this out if you experience anything I mentioned.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased the disposable bump fighter and it took many passes to effectively shave. This (non-disposable) worked much better. My wife is happy with the shave which is definitely not as close as a mach-x turbo. My ingrown hairs have greatly diminished.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this but it just didn&#x27;t work for my son. It actually made the razor bumps worse. He went right back to his previous razors &amp; is shaving less frequently which seems to be working.</li>
            <li> This razor&#x27;s blades are designed to keep the blade edge from dragging directly against your skin, and it keeps you from getting a very close shave, two of the biggest contributors to razor irritation. You will not get a super close shave from this razor, but you will get a decent enough shave without the irritation you may be accustomed to. And as a bonus, the blades are relatively cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t pulled me away from my safety razor, but I like it. If this razor doesn&#x27;t keep the bumps at bay, you may want to start looking at depilatory powders and creams.</li>
            <li> For the first time in the decade and a half I&#x27;ve been shaving my skin is healing. This product does exactly what it says, delivering the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had. To top it off, it&#x27;s reducing my ingrown hairs and solving the acne problem I get from the damage from other razors.</li>
            <li> Close shave without nicks  and cuts.  Clean close shave every time.  My husband will not shave with any other razor.</li>
            <li> Shave in any direction without cuts or scrapes. The way it&#x27;s made keeps the blade a bit off the skin, so it won&#x27;t cut close. follow it up with Trac 2 blades that fit the handle for a very close shave, or use throw-aways. I geet a month of shaves out of each slide-on replacement blade, Move the cartridge half-way off to rinse the blade, the same sliding it half-way off the other - the blade becomes clear for the next use.</li>
            <li> I knew that this wouldn&#x27;t cut as close as most other razors because that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to help prevent irritation and ingrown hairs, but this goes well beyond &amp;#34;not close&amp;#34;. You can&#x27;t even tell you shaved after using it. The only good thing about it is the comfortable handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those &#x27;5 blades does not equal a better shave&#x27; guys. I&#x27;ve used an original Gillette Trac II razor for over 30 years; who knew you can still buy the original blades online??? Well, a few months ago, I dropped my original Trac II handle and broke it. Shopped online for a replacement. Tried a cheap chinese knock off, but it broke in a week! Found lots of fancier (and expensive) alternatives available, but read the reviews that said they were slippery and heavy.  Then I found the Bump Fighter. It had good balance, wasn&#x27;t too heavy or slippery, and it&#x27;s been dropped several times without damage. Match it with genuine Gillette Trac II or Wilkinson Twin II blades (the included Bump Fighter blades are rough on the skin) and you have a comfortable and cost efficient shaving system. A Time-tested solution approved by the women in my life, too! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Works great in conjunction with the Bump Patrol.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor to others suffering from Pseudofolliculitis, or any other skin irritations. It has not fully removed the skin irritation from my face, but it has helped a lot. Definitely worth the experimentation for sure. Will keep continuing to use in my pursuit of getting rid of skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Close but not too close, which I presuming is the premise to prevent razor burn.  He appreciated the interchangeable heads.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the order.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this product I assumed that it was a problem specific blade (bumps)for black men only. But then I came across a pack on clearance for next nothing, you know like $1.50 for 3or4 disposables,and since I was out of blades, why not.  These blades may well stop bumps on black men in fact I&#x27;m sure they do. I can&#x27;t say from experience because I&#x27;m not black and I don&#x27;t get bumps. I&#x27;m white and boy do I ever get BURN!! The package said \\&quot;Bump Fighter\\&quot; I wish it had said Bump and Burn Fighter because I&#x27;d have tried it long before I did.     The reason it&#x27;s so effective is that the blade doesn&#x27;t actually contact the skin so I can shave up down and across getting a very close shave without burn. These are the best blades I have ever used. The handle with replaceable cartridges seems to be better than the disposable but disposables are very good too.    Very effective for burn. I would think it would do just as well for bumps for the same reason. No skin contact by blade.</li>
            <li> A good razor set, it helped reduce my irritation but I still bump up. I do not blame the razor itself, just my genetics.</li>
            <li> Started using the system, at least, five years ago! Glad I did, nothing, for me, can compare to it~~</li>
            <li> Literally the only type of razor that I will use on my face.  Before using these razors I have always gotten razor bumps after shaving but not anymore. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these razors.  Absolutely the best!</li>
            <li> A female co-worker wanted me to be clean shaven for meetings. She bought me The Art of Shaving kit as a gift (The Art of Shaving line all hype by the way. You can find inexpensive equivalents at most drugstores) and included the Bumpfighter blades. I had been very nervous to use razors as I would always get razor bumps so I would use an electric clipper. After an initial period, I got used to shaving and now I would never go back. Bumpfighter does EXACTLY what it says it will do. And for an even closer shave, I take the extra time to shave twice. My beard is prematurely white and against my brown skin you wouldn&#x27;t even see it. I love this product, I wished they carried it at more shops but fortunately I can buy in bulk from Amazon. Why don&#x27;t they do themselves a favor and advertise this stuff? They would see there business double overnight!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t prevent razor bumps, but it is convenient because it won&#x27;t cut your skin.</li>
            <li> It is the best razor system on the market.  I am 84 years old ands never, ever cut myself when shaving with Bump Fighter.  More food markets and pharmacies should carry it</li>
            <li> I am a guy that just happens to like the old TracII blades, and needed a new handle. I didn&#x27;t buy this due to ingrown whiskers. This is a very nice weight, and non-slippery as well. Should last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have uber sensitive skin and I really have NO bumps post shaving with this kit! A miracle!</li>
            <li> Cheap product, cheap results</li>
            <li> These razors don&#x27;t cure ingrown hairs 100%, but they do help prevent them. They cut the beard stubble so that there&#x27;s still a little bit left out of the skin. It&#x27;s not the closest shave, but again, it&#x27;s not supposed to be. However, I have hairs that never really leave the skin before they start to curl in (it&#x27;s a serious curse!), so of course the razor can&#x27;t do anything about those. I will continue to buy these.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I am a DE shaver who bought this for travel. For me personally, the Bump Fighter Cartridges ended up not working out so well for me, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they can&#x27;t be great for someone else. The handle has a nice, solid feel, and I am keeping it for other cartridges. It doesn&#x27;t have any sort of pivot and seems to be at a slightly odd angle for me, however, so you may want to look for something with a pivot-head if you think that might be a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor for my wife to use on her legs at the suggestion of her dermatologist. She used it once and was not happy with the results. She says &amp;#34;It&#x27;s like I didn&#x27;t even shave.&amp;#34; Didn&#x27;t work out for her.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I needed. I have been able to shave forever without getting razor bumps. Then one day boom I began to get them on one side of my face. Tried everything from the single razor to specific gels and tend skin to get rid of them. I finally received this razor and wow does it work. First off the actually handle has a great weight to it and does not feel cheap at all. The blades themselves have a guard to keep the blade from irritating your skin as your shaving, but it still gives a close shave. That is what I was afraid of with this razor that it would not give me that close shave that I wanted, but no worries as this thing does the job. If you have razor bumps this is a must have, and I would recommend using it with a gel and not cream to help it glide across the skin.</li>
            <li> This razor handle is the best!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old school, heavy and balanced, perfect match for the \\&quot;Twin Pivot\\&quot; Personna blades they sell here @ $25 for 50 each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used one of those 5 or 6 blade razors...why would I?  Crazy cost of blades, etc.  This razor, matched to those blades??  The best shave I ever had...and what a great feel in your hand....!!</li>
            <li> Awesome awesome awesome.......the perfect product for African American males that get ingrown hairs from shaving with a razor. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 5 years and it works .....I&#x27;ll never shave with any other razor.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my old Trac II Razor, I was happy with it until I saw it at CVS Pharmacy for 1/2 the price I paid. I will now shop before I buy on line again.</li>
            <li> And yes, that is the point.  Less close of a shave and reduce the amount of razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;however, without using another product, the razor bumps still occur.  I gave it 3 stars becuase it does help,.....a little.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  I was only using an electric trimmer for my beard and only using razors on special occasions.  And then there were bumps.  With this razor I can shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not as close a shave as a regular razor, but its a heck of a lot closer than the electric trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had found it years ago.</li>
            <li> After watching my father struggle with razor bumps and ingrown hairs for years, I decided I&#x27;d never put a razor on my face. Lo and behold, 15 years later I find myself in the workforce and needing a clean shaven face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had this razor for about a week but so far no razor bumps, no ingrowns, no complaints! It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Like several other reviewers I was looking for a handle for \\&quot;Personna Twin Pivot Plus 100\\&quot;.    [[ASIN:B00954O15C Personna Twin Pivot Plus 100 (replaces Auto Plus) Altra Razors]]    I deducted one star for the miss leading description that stated \\&quot;Pivoting head adjusts to the contours of your skin\\&quot;.  If you are after a ATRA style pivoting handle this isn&#x27;t for you.  It is still a great handle with a nice weight and rubber exterior that provides better gripping in the shower where I use it.  The handle slides onto the carts snug but holds them firmly in place while shaving.    The handle is plastic with a metal connector for the cartridge, there are two small holes on the back that will allow water to exit when flushing through the front of the blades for cleaning.  It did seem to clog a little quicker and require more rinses than the SensorExcel I was using but yielded a very nice shave with the Personna carts.    If you are looking to get away from the high cost of brand name cartridges with out going to safety blades this handle with the Personna carts is a great combo.  For the price of 10 SensorExcel carts I was able to get this handle and 100 carts.</li>
            <li> I like the Bump Fighter because I get much less skin irritation with it than with other brands. It&#x27;s not the closest shave possible, but it is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the nice razor.</li>
            <li> As another user said, it&#x27;s not supposed to cut as close to prevent razor bumps. however it took nothing off of my face and you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell I shaved after using it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave</li>
            <li> Short story:  I&#x27;ve been using these Bump Fighter razors (both the cartridges and the regular disposables) for over 16 years.  Great product that really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0011Z3WXU Bump Fighter Razor]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000GJIQ9M BUMP FIGHTER BLADES 5 each]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0016JGTU4 Bump Fighter Mens Disposable Razors Mens - 12-4packs (48 count)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this, I naively used many kinds of regular name- and store-brand razors, in hopes of finding something that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my skin and cause ingrown hairs and razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I stumbled upon this product in local drug store...took a chance, and don&#x27;t regret it.  My skin started clearing up within that first month, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I can find it in various stores around town, I find it easier to order on-line...saves time and gas.</li>
            <li> Good For A Man Trying To Avoid Turned Under Hairs</li>
            <li> Did not help, and it was rather dull, too. I had to scrape my face over and over again to achieve some clearance...</li>
            <li> Slightly less irritation than a normal blade, but doesn&#x27;t get particularly close either.  Give it a shot if you&#x27;re experiencing shave irritation, but it might not be the miracle you were hoping for.</li>
            <li> been using these for 20 years now  - not a total solution, but with a wahl (for your problem areas), and these blades for the rest - its worth the convenience of no bumps. The handle purchase is a bit of a rip off, but you buy it one time at least.</li>
            <li> If you are a woman reading this, look at NO other reviews. These shavers look cheap, and feel cheap, but work INCREDIBLY. I use all summer on my bikini line and it is totally bump free. i will not live a summer without them, and they are worth 30 buck each to me! I even have sensitive skin, and suck at exfoliating like I should. I found these on pinterest, thanks pinterest! I didn&#x27;t only get one use out of mine, I would use these 3-5 times before tossing. BUY BUY BUY. Bikini bumps no more.</li>
            <li> The Bump Fighter razor is pretty clever. It&#x27;s designed to prevent razor bumps, which are caused by ingrown hairs. These in turn are caused, often, by shaving too closely, especially if you have very curly facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get it for that. I got it because of all the multiple blade razors ever made, I still like the original Gillette Trac II the best. But of course Gillette won&#x27;t sell those any more because they can&#x27;t get away with charging five bucks a blade for an old design where the patents have run out. As it happens the Bump Fighter razor-- the one with the replaceable blade cartridges, mind you, not the disposable razor type-- accepts Trac II blades just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While we&#x27;re ragging on Gillette, I should point out that my \\&quot;Trac II\\&quot; blades aren&#x27;t Trac II either. I&#x27;m using Personna Twin Pivot Plus cartridges, which will fit either a Trac II style handle or one of the pivoting head Atra-style handles. Personna makes the Bump Fighter. They also make a \\&quot;Twin II\\&quot; which is a non pivoting only version. I haven&#x27;t tried that, so I can&#x27;t say how good it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Chinese-made Wilkinson \\&quot;Trac II\\&quot; style from Wal-Mart are good. Dorco, from Korea, also makes blades for this kind of razor; that&#x27;s the sort Dollar General sells for about $1.25 for five. They seem sharp enough but they are loose on the Bump Fighter handle, so I can&#x27;t recommend their use with this razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product to every guy. It actually works. I have not bought or used anything else since I started using this.</li>
            <li> I thought I found the right blade for me with the safety razor, but I couldnt shave as fast as I like and I couldn&#x27;t shave everyday with it. I tried all the gillettes, wahl shaving trimmers, and the Braun series 7 too. Some had good results at first then I realized I didn&#x27;t need a clean, close shave, I just needed a bump free shave and BF razor is absolutely the solution. Been using it now for a couple weeks and so far 6 days in a row I haven&#x27;t had a single ingrown hair. I&#x27;m able to shave in any direction with no irritations at all. I also use skin tight morning/night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made specially for black men (which I happen to be) but definitely a must for people who shave frequently and easily get irritated. I recommend anyone who would rather have no bumps on their face.</li>
            <li> For Trac 2 Blades just a great Balanced Razor Doesn&#x27;t feel like your having your skin peeled off as other Blades and Razors.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since the 70&#x27;s.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this. Did not give a good shave at all. Not even a close shave and its only one blade. I really don&#x27;t get bumps from maybe once in a while so I thought I try it out and see and will not be buying again. I had to use a regular razor after because the experience was so bad. Hardly a close shave still had a shadow after using it. Really don&#x27;t like it. Maybe that&#x27;s why it stops bumps because it doesn&#x27;t give you that close a shave? This razor isn&#x27;t for someone who needs a close shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame this razor isn&#x27;t more widely available. It really works because its design is inspired by common sense: Don&#x27;t shave too close, and you won&#x27;t get irritation or ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t let the low price fool you: the blades are good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to consider:  By design, this razor doesn&#x27;t shave as close as most do. If you have light skin and dark hair - or dark skin and light hair, for that matter - this razor will leave you with somewhat visible stubble. IMO, that&#x27;s a fair trade for smooth, healthy skin.</li>
            <li> I am white male, 34. The skin around my mouth gets red and irritated and ingrown hairs very easily. These are the best blades I&#x27;ve found so far for sensitive skin. Only complaint is that they rust after a week or so. Having only one blade they wear out fast but they are cheap so that&#x27;s okay with me.</li>
            <li> Whether its my skin or the razor or how I am shaving. This product didn&#x27;t get the job done. Sometimes I felt as if it wasn&#x27;t even shaving at all.</li>
            <li> The Bump fighter razor is a great product on two main points.&lt;br /&gt;First, the specialized cartridge does work as advertised, preventing ingrown hairs through an additional guard that limits how closely it will shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly to me- it is probably one of the best TRACII cartridge compatible handles on the market, featuring a nice metal body and a rubberized grip. Of the modern Trac II razors one can purchase this is probably the best for your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trac II carts are extremely cheap, especially if you don&#x27;t buy the gillette brand- I&#x27;m somewhat convinced that Carts are revised simply to maintain patent rights. I think I ended up spending 25 cents a cart by buying dorco brand Trac II carts in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave delivered by both the included cartridges as well as the dorcos with this handle was great.</li>
            <li> Great handle for Trac II style blades which is why I purchased this razor.  Didn&#x27;t care for the blades that came in the package but I don&#x27;t have issues with razor bumps.</li>
