            <li>What more can I ask for?</li>
            <li>Its priced right  and is very elegant.</li>
            <li>Shortly thereafter, my father started suffering some heart symptoms, and we were getting very, VERY exceptional blood pressure readings.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Cheap and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Have to have the cuff &amp; arm positioned as the device shows to get a close to accurate reading.</li>
            <li>Did not give accurate bps when monitored with Dr office.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give an accurate reading.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty accurately if it is put on correctly!  </li>
            <li>I rarely get an off reading!  </li>
            <li>Pretty accurate and easy to use.</li>
            <li>100  off true count of blood pressure.</li>
            <li>This BP cuff is much cheaper than most &amp; has a decent battery life!</li>
            <li>I can start use it right out of box.</li>
            <li>If you put the monitor at your waist level , the reading seems 20mmhg higher.</li>
            <li>Accurate enough.</li>
            <li>Very helpful and will recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it several times and apparently is quite accurate, it has not shown large variations.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more money on a product that actually works.</li>
            <li>This was up to 20 points off for the systolic measurement (upper number) and as much as 15 points off for the diastolic (lower number).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is complete garbage.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s small easy to carry around.</li>
            <li>If a patients BP is too low or too high</li>
            <li>Left it where it was in Philippines for filler in a new foundation</li>
            <li>but apparently it does its job...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Cuff would not inflate, despite following directions.  Returning it today for a different model.</li>
            <li> Both my parents have cardiovascular problems, so I got one of these for each of them. Shortly thereafter, my father started suffering some heart symptoms, and we were getting very, VERY exceptional blood pressure readings.  We called the cardiologist, who asked us to come in AND bring the monitor.  We tested this monitor multiple times, on multiple people, against the blood pressure monitors in his office. This was up to 20 points off for the systolic measurement (upper number) and as much as 15 points off for the diastolic (lower number).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In short, this monitor is a waste of money.  Only buy it for entertainment purposes OR as part of a costume for a fancy-dress party.Do not get it if you or a family member actually NEEDS to monitor your blood pressure.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Very good seller.</li>
            <li> Have to have the cuff &amp; arm positioned as the device shows to get a close to accurate reading. Patient must be sitting up as well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and good price</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!! Per doctor advice. 100  off true count of blood pressure. Could be harmful if reading determined activity .</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
            <li> Works pretty accurately if it is put on correctly!  I use every day at work on a subacute unit!  I rarely get an off reading!  If a patients BP is too low or too high I just check it manually!  This BP cuff is much cheaper than most &amp; has a decent battery life!</li>
            <li> great monitor, good product for its price</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Very helpful and will recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Attracted by the price. It comes with the monitor , carrying case and two AAA battery.  I can start use it right out of box. The testing result varies with different body gesture. If you raise the monitor the at your head level , the reading tends lower . If you put the monitor at your waist level , the reading seems 20mmhg higher. If you keep the monitor at your heart level as per the instruction , the reading seems consistent , pairing with other expensive monitor.  It is a surprise value although it does not come with fancy function like talking , irregular heart rhythm detection.</li>
            <li> Broke out of the box, overseas using it for medical clinics.  Left it where it was in Philippines for filler in a new foundation</li>
            <li> Pretty accurate and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works great!&lt;br /&gt;Very good value!</li>
            <li> great price works well.</li>
            <li> I have to take my blood pressure all the time. This fits in my purse. And it&#x27;s small easy to carry around. Only hope it last.</li>
            <li> Good deal for the money.</li>
            <li> Lo he utilizado en varias oportunidades y aparentemente es bastante preciso, no ha mostrado grandes variaciones. Excelente relación precio calidad, lo recomiendo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it several times and apparently is quite accurate, it has not shown large variations. Excellent value for money, would recommend</li>
            <li> Delivered on time, very nice and  l use all the times. Its priced right  and is very elegant. Wish seller happy thanks givings.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Not sure if the results are reliable...but apparently it does its job...</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give an accurate reading.  It is always low in the 90&#x27;s over 65 area. If it worked right it would be awesome.</li>
            <li> I received the product, I configured the date and time, and still throwing me ER U, error.</li>
            <li> Just received this product and it does NOT work! It is complete garbage. The cuff will not inflate. Spend a little more money on a product that actually works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nurse in a long term care facility. I use it at work. Works great</li>
            <li> Cheap and easy to use. Accurate enough. What more can I ask for? If I lose it, it won&#x27;t be too hard on the pocket to buy another one.</li>
