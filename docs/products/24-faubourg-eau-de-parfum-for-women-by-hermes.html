            <li>According to her butler, this is Princess Diana&#x27;s favorite fragrance.    </li>
            <li>After reading so many glowing reviews of this fragrance, I just had to try it</li>
            <li>While I can appreciate the complexity of this fragrance, from the top note to the drydown, it is well crafted.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my wife, and is a scent we both love.</li>
            <li>Top it off</li>
            <li>My Wife mentioned to me she had enjoyed this fragrance</li>
            <li>Love this scent.</li>
            <li>I have sampled this product in Saphora and it was so much better than the bottle I received through this vendor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My wife fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>At the time, my wife was 31, and told me that 24 Fauburg made her feel sophisticated but not stuffy.    </li>
            <li>I get more compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>Simply the best.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding delivery time.</li>

            <li>I consider pefume in general a kind of environmental generosity, and I absolutely  love this sumptuous, sophisticated, superb classic perfume.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hazardous all right</li>
            <li>I find most fragrances too fruity or too sweet or too</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, flowery and feminine, also has strong oils that linger on anything it comes in contact with.</li>
            <li>so I went to the nearest store that could provide all the perfume selection that is available in the market and after two hours</li>
            <li>It makes you smell like you live a terribly elegant and interesting life.</li>
            <li>24 Faubourg is a very heady fragrance...perfect for an elegant evening.  </li>
            <li>Could it be true?  </li>
            <li>Love this and don&#x27;t really want anyone else to know about it.</li>
            <li>in \\&quot;feel\\&quot;) that is it like mixing an old perfume, like Joy, with a young perfume, like CK1.    </li>
            <li>This has a kind of Right Bank old  money vibe, but I&#x27;m older now and can pull it off.</li>
            <li>So wear it either with the right clothes or preferably with the right brain package..</li>
            <li>At that time, I was told it was only available in Europe, so I thought it would be something unique.  </li>
            <li>since she has used it previously, I  am sure the gift will be a big hit.</li>
            <li>Every time I wear this people comment on what a lovely scent, it&#x27;s become a mainstay on a daily basis and a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>The smell is descent and peaceful.</li>
            <li>If you want something that smells exotic, look no further.</li>
            <li>She said she received compliments from others the first day she wore  it.</li>
            <li>I first bought this scent for my wife while I was on business in London in 2001.  </li>
            <li>She is almost out of that first bottle I bought for her</li>
            <li>I will never forget the first time I caught a scent of this.</li>
            <li>It is very unique and interactive with the individual&#x27;s body chemisty.</li>
            <li>This perfume makes my wife feel classic and sexy, for those days when she is in between the young Shi and the older Chanel No.5.  </li>
            <li>It has been my favorite for a long time now.  </li>
            <li>He would have proposed marriage on the spot instead of searching the kingdom with a glass shoe that countless amount of manky feet tried to fit</li>
            <li>It does stay on forever and is very pleasing.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After using Certain Dri instead of a deodorant, I can put a few drops of this under my arms and I gently smell of lovely perfume all day (look up Certain Dri!).  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last, Just smells fruity and no sparkle like the original AT ALL.</li>
            <li>It is a classic scent, deep and rich with both flowery and spicy undertones...</li>
            <li>It is her favorite perfum She has been using it for a long time and loves it the same now as she did when she first tried it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s complex, opulent, beautiful and long</li>
            <li>highly recommended</li>
            <li>believe this bottle is either old or not the real product.  </li>
            <li>My significant other received this scent as a gift from her employer and has used it eversince.  </li>
            <li>her 8yr old son said she smells like grandma!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice but rather weak for Eau de Parfum..</li>
            <li>Since I was a little girl my mother insisted on wearing YSL Rive Gauche in every important gathering wherever it was held.</li>
            <li>Old or young</li>
            <li>This perfume reminds of an old world evening soiree.</li>
            <li>Was surprised.  </li>
            <li>a grown-up perfume that is still young at heart.  </li>
            <li>I have bought this same item for her before through another vendor and it is exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I think this product may not be the same age as &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; 24 Faubourg because I notice a few drops of it are not as strong.  </li>
            <li>I remember clearly that she prefered the YSL above all others and sometimes she choose Paris instead of the Rive Gauche as well as my Grandmother who I have to admit had a soft spot for L&#x27;air du Temps by Ninna Ricci.     </li>
            <li>Six years later I flitred only with only two new perfumes Tom Ford&#x27;s Black Orchid which I rarely wear and</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not easy to find but worth the effort.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I was content with all of them as well as with the Red Jeans for the casual university classes days</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed but the scent is still one that remains on the body for over 4 hours and is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> My husband hated it and said I \\&quot;smelled like an old lady.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> bought wrong one but kept it.  </li>

            <li> My signature fragrance for years....compliments of my husband on my birthday!</li>
            <li> not something you smell on people everyday. It makes you smell like you live a terribly elegant and interesting life.</li>
            <li> Everything was as described.  Shipping on time.  No problems at all.  Would definitely order from them again.</li>
            <li> I recommend this company.  They do a great job of delivering the geniune product.</li>
            <li> 24 Faubourg is a very heady fragrance...perfect for an elegant evening.  It was Princess Diana&#x27;s favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Since I was a little girl my mother insisted on wearing YSL Rive Gauche in every important gathering wherever it was held. I remember clearly that she prefered the YSL above all others and sometimes she choose Paris instead of the Rive Gauche as well as my Grandmother who I have to admit had a soft spot for L&#x27;air du Temps by Ninna Ricci.     I was content with all of them as well as with the Red Jeans for the casual university classes days but soon I craved for my signuture so I went to the nearest store that could provide all the perfume selection that is available in the market and after two hours or so I found what I was looking. It was an amazing moment for me! A self discovery if you like as cheesy it may sound.     Six years later I flitred only with only two new perfumes Tom Ford&#x27;s Black Orchid which I rarely wear and Givanchy&#x27;s limited summer collection. In my opinion its a great perfume but you can&#x27;t wear it just because you want something following you along for the day. So wear it either with the right clothes or preferably with the right brain package..</li>
            <li> Got this on a cruise 15 years ago and just loved it and it lasts forever. Received my order in  just a few days. highly recommended</li>
            <li> I am extremely picky about fragrance. I find most fragrances too fruity or too sweet or too whatever. Not this! This blend of floral and vanilla scents makes for an intoxicatingly feminine scent.</li>
            <li> bought wrong one but kept it.  My mistake.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but rather weak for Eau de Parfum.. Wondering if it was past it&#x27;s sell date?</li>
            <li> Our daughter loves this scent.  It was purchased for her as a Christmas gift.  It arrived in good order and, since she has used it previously, I  am sure the gift will be a big hit.</li>
            <li> My significant other received this scent as a gift from her employer and has used it eversince.  It is an elegant fragrance which turns heads when she wears it.  Old or young it is an attractive scent.  Beware the picture and ad on the Amazon site. It seems to confuse Eau de Parfume with Eau de Toilette for this brand.</li>
            <li> This perfume reminds of an old world evening soiree. It&#x27;s complex, opulent, beautiful and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if Cinderella was wearing this, Prince Charming would not have hesitated. He would have proposed marriage on the spot instead of searching the kingdom with a glass shoe that countless amount of manky feet tried to fit</li>
            <li> Received the item in 2 days! Excellent  Will not hesitate to order again.  My wife likes it. Was surprised.  Was a &#x27;no special occasion&#x27; gift.</li>
            <li> Every time I wear this people comment on what a lovely scent, it&#x27;s become a mainstay on a daily basis and a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this and could not wait for it. I&#x27;ve had it before. THIS smells like a KNOCK OFF! I want my money back! And am trying to figure out how. Doesn&#x27;t last, Just smells fruity and no sparkle like the original AT ALL.</li>
            <li> The only perfume I wear.</li>
            <li> mmmmm.... I smell so good.....and it lasts</li>
            <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for my wife. Both of us love that. The smell is descent and peaceful.</li>
            <li> This scent has a very strong smell. It is not for the faint of heart. It does stay on forever and is very pleasing. I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;I also read that it was Princess Diana&#x27;s favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> I consider pefume in general a kind of environmental generosity, and I absolutely  love this sumptuous, sophisticated, superb classic perfume.  It has been my favorite for a long time now.  I used to use Tabac Blond until it disappeared, then you could get it but the formula had been changed and not in a good way.  This has a kind of Right Bank old  money vibe, but I&#x27;m older now and can pull it off. (I spray it into my handbag and it lasts forever,  and I get that waft that transports me even when just running errands).</li>
            <li> I think this product may not be the same age as &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; 24 Faubourg because I notice a few drops of it are not as strong.  It is $50 less than getting it direct from Hermes and  I cannot seem to find it at Sephora anymore.  After using Certain Dri instead of a deodorant, I can put a few drops of this under my arms and I gently smell of lovely perfume all day (look up Certain Dri!).  Anyway, the color of this perfume was not the same color as my other bottle, and both are eau de parfum. I use it every day, so the $50 helps a lot, but next time I may realize I get what I pay for....</li>
            <li> It is my standard perfume.</li>
            <li> This is the one.&lt;br /&gt;After searching for years I found this in Paris.&lt;br /&gt;It is not easy to find but worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;To me, it smells heavenly. Not sweet. Awesome!</li>
            <li> According to her butler, this is Princess Diana&#x27;s favorite fragrance.    It&#x27;s light, flowery and feminine, also has strong oils that linger on anything it comes in contact with. (It holds its scent, unlike some others, like White Shoulders.)    My husband hated it and said I \\&quot;smelled like an old lady.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> After reading so many glowing reviews of this fragrance, I just had to try it so I ordered a couple of sample vials.  I was elated when it arrived &amp; was deflated after I spritzed it on!  Could it be true?  I waited a while &amp; yes, that initial reaction was still there.  While I can appreciate the complexity of this fragrance, from the top note to the drydown, it is well crafted. However, what I didn&#x27;t anticipate was that this fragrance would be an \\&quot;instant ticket to OLDLADYVILLE.\\&quot;  Wow....unfortunately, I could never wear this.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife, and is a scent we both love. I have bought this same item for her before through another vendor and it is exactly the same. If you want something that smells exotic, look no further.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Valentine her 8yr old son said she smells like grandma! Top it off I cant return or exchange because its hazardous.  It&#x27;s hazardous all right do not buy this for someone under 70.</li>
            <li> My Wife mentioned to me she had enjoyed this fragrance so I got it as a gift for her. She was very pleased and so was I with the scent. She said she received compliments from others the first day she wore  it.</li>
            <li> this I bought for my wife. It is her favorite perfum She has been using it for a long time and loves it the same now as she did when she first tried it.</li>
            <li> Love this and don&#x27;t really want anyone else to know about it. It is very unique and interactive with the individual&#x27;s body chemisty.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. Have been wearing it for years. My husband smells my neck all the time -- and he loves what he smells. Also get compliments regularly.</li>
            <li> I have sampled this product in Saphora and it was so much better than the bottle I received through this vendor.&lt;br /&gt;I believe this bottle is either old or not the real product.  I am very disappointed but the scent is still one that remains on the body for over 4 hours and is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> I first bought this scent for my wife while I was on business in London in 2001.  At that time, I was told it was only available in Europe, so I thought it would be something unique.  She is almost out of that first bottle I bought for her (she rotates it with Shi and Chanel No.5), so I was so happy when I found it available in the States (I have not had to look for it until now, so it may have here all along, but it made for a good story at the time).    My wife fell in love with it.  It is a classic scent, deep and rich with both flowery and spicy undertones...a grown-up perfume that is still young at heart.  At the time, my wife was 31, and told me that 24 Fauburg made her feel sophisticated but not stuffy.    My best description is (not literally, but in \\&quot;feel\\&quot;) that is it like mixing an old perfume, like Joy, with a young perfume, like CK1.    This perfume makes my wife feel classic and sexy, for those days when she is in between the young Shi and the older Chanel No.5.  It is perfect for her, and comes highly recommended from our household.</li>
            <li> My husband picked this out for me because I can&#x27;t smell.  I get more compliments on it.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Simply the best.  It was Princess Diana&#x27;s signature Perfume or so her personal butler told me.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years!!</li>
            <li> I will never forget the first time I caught a scent of this. I was walking in the shopping area of the Bellagio in Vegas. As I passed Hermes this incredible scent caught my attention. I immediately went in and bought it. I have been wearing it for several years and am quite often complimented on my perfume.</li>
            <li> My wife loved it. Outstanding delivery time.</li>
            <li> This an imitation I had to turn around and  purchase the &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; fragrance from Blomingdales!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this for years, and still love it.</li>
