            <li>I&#x27;m really happy.</li>
            <li>Great value.</li>
            <li>Great experience with this product.  </li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>but once the pimples and the redness is gone, my skin does look very nice and youthful.</li>
            <li>Good packaging.</li>
            <li>works good on the face tho....</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>When I applied the peel to my zits they immediately bleed and stinged more.  </li>
            <li>lovely....</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to follow the instructions to a &amp;#34;t&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This product is great, but if you want something a little more gentle, start out using the 10% in about a month, my skin was flawless...</li>
            <li>Very good peeling really works ,,,tje skin is brand new</li>
            <li>(to be fair she has VERY sensitive skin.)</li>

            <li>Fortunately I did not do her</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>The 10% glycolic acid peel was a bit mild for me, but the 30% is far more effective.</li>
            <li>I would be willing to pay more for it if it had a glass bottle, which is safer for storing acids.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(that area is almost clean, I had a lot of junk accumulated in that area), in between my brows, chin, and jaw bone area.</li>

            <li>Fair warning, also, if you&#x27;ve got any active pimples, or pimples that have not yet come to a head, BEWARE, because in three minutes, your not-zits will be erupted.</li>
            <li>first time I put it on, and it burned so much!</li>
            <li>On his first application, he stuck through the tingle and got to a burning sensation.</li>
            <li>A bit stingy, and definitely make sure you rinse it from the creases on the sides of your nose because I didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Also start with a lower strength first then move up as I did use 10 then jumped to 30.</li>
            <li>I have had many facial peels, both in dr&#x27;s office and at home but to my surprise this peel really did make me break out as it did others.</li>
            <li>100%  pure coconut oil.</li>
            <li>So now she had large brown areas all over the scratched areas.</li>
            <li>This is real; there is no need to concern oneself with free-acid here because it is as it says--pure glycolic</li>

            <li>It provides a mild peel about two days later, then my skin feels softer and lines are diminished.  </li>
            <li>There is some stinging, because of the high grade, so have cleanser nearby to wash off.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it has a relatively low acid percentage and its small size seem good for a trial.  </li>
            <li>My skin is even toned and my acne scars is almost completely faded the cheek I had less frequently outbreaks! :)  </li>
            <li>Again, not all the products fault, my wife does have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>What he did next was possibly the killer: he used hot water first to attempt to wash it</li>
            <li>(If you&#x27;re doing your first at-home peel, I recommend starting with the 10% and working your way up.)</li>
            <li>Next day one of my cheeks was very itchy, I scratched it and white heads came out right away....</li>
            <li>and it was very tender the next day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised by the reviews that said it did nothing.</li>
            <li>You will certainly feel a tingle, and if you leave it on for too long (the duration depends on your skin), it will burn</li>
            <li>After 4 series of peels so far, I finally see an improvement in my acne and the scars.</li>
            <li>(Naturally this makes what happened next all my fault).</li>
            <li>After that, my skin was very soft, and I saw how few pimples came out right away, the skin was broken, but yucky pimples stuff free.</li>

            <li> you are using any other type of exfoliant, especially retinoids, you may need to halve the recommended time.</li>
            <li> but they were limited to brown dots where I had applied the product.</li>

            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a big change, but it softens your skin for a little while.</li>
            <li> I did 3 peels with this one and every time I ended up with a few red pimples on my face!&lt;br</li>
            <li> far as the application: I follow the directions and just use cold water to wash it off; and since I frequently use it, only leave it on my skin for 2 mins and follow it with moisturizer which doesn&#x27;t have any acid in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m AA with moderate acne scarring on my both cheeks and a few spots on my chin.</li>
            <li> Works just like I expected.</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get rid of the dark spots left from my previous breakouts.  </li>
            <li> other concern is that it comes in a plastic bottle.</li>
            <li> I did not experience any flaking other then on my zits.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to see &amp;#34;peeling&amp;#34; but only saw small areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;&#x27;m going to try some of their other peels as well.</li>
            <li> He used this product today with a paste made from baking soda and a few drops of water.</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t speak to line reduction (that is an unrealistic expectation of anything following one use)</li>
            <li> Inexperience is one of the main reasons why people leave bad reviews, it does not necessarily mean the product is bad.</li>
            <li> At least they did for my wife.</li>
            <li> Bought the 30% and it seemed to be working, though a bit slowly.</li>
            <li> After my 1st 2 peels my acne got worse.</li>
            <li> but I am noticing subtle changes!</li>
            <li> , I just rinsed off with water (it was a little bit painful)</li>
            <li> it has an uncomfortable itch when applied...</li>
            <li> it is a WASTE of your money!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is a lot cheaper to mix yourself then pay for expensive KP lotions!</li>
            <li> If you scratch, bad things happen.</li>
            <li> but DON T forget to put the neutralizer after it otherwise you will burn your skin very bad !!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have only used this peel once so this is based on my initial results. While I am a regular home exfoliator, I have never used a chemical peel before. I bought this because it has a relatively low acid percentage and its small size seem good for a trial.  I used the peel last week and followed the online and insert instructions meticulously. My skin this week has looked great. While I can&#x27;t speak to line reduction (that is an unrealistic expectation of anything following one use) I can say my pores look smaller and the surface of my skin appears smoother and clearer. I was concerned about going to work with peeling skin, however I  did not experience any, for which I am grateful. I&#x27;m really happy. My biggest challenge might be when to use it because as spring comes along, I spend a lot of time outdoors and with products of this nature, sun sensitivity is an issue.</li>
            <li> Great value. Cab be tricky to apply to skin, so I would recommend buying a fan brush. There is some stinging, because of the high grade, so have cleanser nearby to wash off.</li>
            <li> Great product! Good packaging. Not everyone has the same skin type or problem, one product will not work for everyone. 1. Do your research. 2. Know your skin type. 3. Inexperience is one of the main reasons why people leave bad reviews, it does not necessarily mean the product is bad.</li>
            <li> I have had many facial peels, both in dr&#x27;s office and at home but to my surprise this peel really did make me break out as it did others. I did 3 peels with this one and every time I ended up with a few red pimples on my face!&lt;br /&gt;My other concern is that it comes in a plastic bottle. I would be willing to pay more for it if it had a glass bottle, which is safer for storing acids.&lt;br /&gt;After the application my skin looks somewhat upset for a 2 day period but once the pimples and the redness is gone, my skin does look very nice and youthful. I try to do it every week to see if my skin would finally just cooperate with me and stop breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the application: I follow the directions and just use cold water to wash it off; and since I frequently use it, only leave it on my skin for 2 mins and follow it with moisturizer which doesn&#x27;t have any acid in it.</li>
            <li> It worth a cost at all. I definetely recommend it. *****</li>
            <li> do not buy this s*** it is a WASTE of your money!!!!!</li>
            <li> USE 1 TO 2 X&#x27;S PER MONTH, TO EXFOLIATE. MUST USE MOISTURIZER AND SUNSCREEN.</li>
            <li> Definitely works! I mix some in lotion to help with my KP. It is a lot cheaper to mix yourself then pay for expensive KP lotions!</li>
            <li> Did nothing on my skin. Feels like water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m AA with moderate acne scarring on my both cheeks and a few spots on my chin. I wanted to get rid of the dark spots left from my previous breakouts.  Pros-After 4 series of peels so far, I finally see an improvement in my acne and the scars. The peel tingles and stinges about a 1 minute upon application, but I had no problems tolerating it. It&#x27;s odorless and feels like water as you are rubbing it on your skin. I did not experience any flaking other then on my zits. My skin is even toned and my acne scars is almost completely faded the cheek I had less frequently outbreaks! :)  Cons- After my 1st 2 peels my acne got worse. When I applied the peel to my zits they immediately bleed and stinged more.  Before applying the peel, I applied neosporin to my eyebrows, under my eyes, to the corners of my nose, and around my lip line.  After I wash the peel off with soap, I applied aloe vera gel then 100%  pure coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I use it once a week on face/neck/décolleté.  It provides a mild peel about two days later, then my skin feels softer and lines are diminished.  Also use it on backs of my hands.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product. This is the third time I used it, and I find it amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;The first time I put it on, and it burned so much! I waited 2 mins, and I put on the buffer mix. After that, my skin was very soft, and I saw how few pimples came out right away, the skin was broken, but yucky pimples stuff free. Next day one of my cheeks was very itchy, I scratched it and white heads came out right away....&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used it only on my nose. This time I left it 3 mins, and I didn&#x27;t use the buffer mix, I just rinsed off with water (it was a little bit painful) I saw blackheads coming out from my nose! My nose is blackheads free!!!&lt;br /&gt;Third time: I used it under my nose (that area is almost clean, I had a lot of junk accumulated in that area), in between my brows, chin, and jaw bone area. Same situation! My skin is clearing out. I&#x27;ll keep giving updates, I just want to tell everybody, this acid works, and yes you are going to breakout because it is trying to get rid off the junk!</li>
            <li> Works just like I expected. I plan on using it every 30 days.  Great experience with this product.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to see &amp;#34;peeling&amp;#34; but only saw small areas. However, my skin did swell and therefore diminished the size of pores and appearance of wrinkles for about 12 hours. I&#x27;ve ordered 70% glycolic acid to see if I get the results I had hoped for. I do not have sensitive skin and maybe that is why the 30% did not work as expected. I received this product well wrapped, packaged and guicl;y delivered. I would give the seller five stars.</li>
            <li> lovely....but doesn&#x27;t work so well on knees and elbows....works good on the face tho....it has an uncomfortable itch when applied...</li>
            <li> This is real; there is no need to concern oneself with free-acid here because it is as it says--pure glycolic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using any other type of exfoliant, especially retinoids, you may need to halve the recommended time. You will certainly feel a tingle, and if you leave it on for too long (the duration depends on your skin), it will burn you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son used this for his acne. On his first application, he stuck through the tingle and got to a burning sensation. What he did next was possibly the killer: he used hot water first to attempt to wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son says that you MUST have a neutralizer available.  He used this product today with a paste made from baking soda and a few drops of water. It worked well this time, and he reported that the &amp;#34;know that it&#x27;s working tingle&amp;#34; is very present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, but you must be attentive to what you feel. If it burns at all, reach for the neutralizer, NOT WATER.</li>
            <li> This product is great, but if you want something a little more gentle, start out using the 10% in about a month, my skin was flawless...</li>
            <li> Loved it. A bit stingy, and definitely make sure you rinse it from the creases on the sides of your nose because I didn&#x27;t and it was very tender the next day. Fair warning, also, if you&#x27;ve got any active pimples, or pimples that have not yet come to a head, BEWARE, because in three minutes, your not-zits will be erupted. Super gross, sorry, but the peel worked for me, and I have been using it weekly and am starting to see results.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a big change, but it softens your skin for a little while.</li>
            <li> My wife has Seborrheic Keratosis which are brown raised scales here and there. They tend to spread and grow if left uncheck...which is of course what she did. Anyway after searching online I found out what it was and saw that this type of peel works as a potential remedy. Bought the 30% and it seemed to be working, though a bit slowly. So upped it to the 50%. Worked much faster.&lt;br /&gt;Now here&#x27;s the problem. Be careful. When it goes on it will itch. If you scratch, bad things happen. At least they did for my wife. (to be fair she has VERY sensitive skin.) We tested it as directed and there was no problem so I applied it to he problem areas, not paying too much attention to limiting it to the scales, so I did hit the surrounding skin. (Naturally this makes what happened next all my fault). After a week I noticed that everywhere she could have scratched, she had done so, and with quite a bit of zest( still not her fault...all mine). So now she had large brown areas all over the scratched areas. They looked like bruises. And on her back when she couldn&#x27;t reach there were also brown areas but they were limited to brown dots where I had applied the product. It appears that the product has caused over pigmentation where applied. Especially where the 50% was used. Fortunately I did not do her face.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it did get rid of the Seborrheic Keratosis patches, and with the help of some whitening mask the spots are fading. Again, not all the products fault, my wife does have VERY sensitive skin. But do try this on a small area for a couple weeks first, you patience may well be rewarded.</li>
            <li> Very good peeling really works ,,,tje skin is brand new but DON T forget to put the neutralizer after it otherwise you will burn your skin very bad !!!!</li>
            <li> I use this weekly and it works well vs. paying a esthetician for the service.  Be careful of &#x27;burn&#x27; if you leave on too long.</li>
            <li> Works great but ai would recommend the 10% for sensitive skin type ot first time users.</li>
            <li> ASDM has a wonderful array of skin care products. The 10% glycolic acid peel was a bit mild for me, but the 30% is far more effective. (If you&#x27;re doing your first at-home peel, I recommend starting with the 10% and working your way up.) Their website has lots of helpful information as well.</li>
            <li> Works very well. I&#x27;m surprised by the reviews that said it did nothing. It tingled and felt like my face was burning. It works. I&#x27;&#x27;m going to try some of their other peels as well.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I want to use it every week!</li>
            <li> Do not buy it! Two weeks after I applied the peel, the skin started peeling, then a week afterwards it started to get darker!! So upset!!</li>
