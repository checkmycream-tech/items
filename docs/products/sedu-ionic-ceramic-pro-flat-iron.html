    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>But sedu is insanely awesome.</li>
            <li>Awesome product!</li>
            <li>This straightener is probably the best straightener I have ever used.</li>
            <li>what that means, but whatever they did is awesome.</li>
            <li>It straightens it perfectly.</li>
            <li>has worked perfectly for 5 years?</li>
            <li>This product is awesome..</li>
            <li>I have relaxed hair and wear clip-in extensions (the ones that are marketed to Caucasians), this flatiron literally changes my hair texture to match the extensions PERFECTLY!</li>
            <li>This iron is the best!</li>
            <li>but I found that the fhi works best.</li>
            <li>in my quest for healthier, longer hair, I decided to try the sedu because of all the wonderful reviews and before and after pics I found on the web.</li>
            <li>and I thought it was the best of the best ....</li>
            <li>Best Flatiron I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>the best I have found,and I&#x27;ve tried them all..</li>
            <li>The Sedu is the best.  </li>
            <li>I was persuaded to spend the money because of the excellent reviews on the Folica website.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome straightener!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>I am still using Biosilk serum and/or finishing spray since these work best on my hair giving silky results.  </li>
            <li>Not the best thing to happen the morning of graduation.  </li>
            <li>PERFECT!</li>
            <li>I thought this was one of the best hair straighteners I had ever purchased.</li>
            <li>AND I am very happy with it stillll.</li>
            <li>Best straightener ever made!</li>
            <li>very happy</li>
            <li>so I will update when this one hits a year to hopefully say it is still working wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy  about this.</li>
            <li>This is the best iron I have EVER used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Chi and even a GHD gold series and this is the best one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>However, for no reason and after perfect care, it stopped heating!</li>
            <li>So I would consider this a good product for relaxed hair!!</li>
            <li>But, when they do work I am told they are awesome.</li>
            <li>And the best part about it is its size.</li>
            <li>It is best for working mothers.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVED my Sedu!!!  </li>
            <li>and I was expecting results like my babyliss titanium pro (best iron).</li>
            <li>This straightener is AWESOME.  </li>
            <li>my roommate also ordered one and is very happy with hers...</li>
            <li>great people to order from!!</li>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>Great buy!</li>
            <li>very good quality product.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product, if you get one that works.  </li>
            <li>, the sedu does not pull your hair it leaves and incredible shine</li>
            <li>The iron was as described- heating, great manageable size, and it gives a perfect finish.</li>
            <li>and he loved it!</li>
            <li>It gives me beautiful results</li>
            <li>and it works great.  </li>
            <li>not so great.</li>
            <li>If it doesn’t, I’ll happily return it.</li>
            <li>and my hair still looks great..</li>
            <li>This hair straightener is great, it looks sheek</li>
            <li>with the chi, while great, you have run the iron over you</li>
            <li>Great iron.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>amazing one of the best i have used</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>bought this for my girlfriend and it worked great for two months</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>The swivel feature is great, but unless they fix the design</li>
            <li>It works great.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I know that this straightener would have been great, had it not been defective.</li>
            <li>I was happy with it</li>
            <li>It Looks great and hope it will work great.</li>
            <li>What a great iron.</li>
            <li>K, I LOVE IT!!  </li>
            <li>I went from getting my hair kind of looking good in about 50-60 minutes, to looking perfect in about 25 min.   </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still working AMAZINGLY well!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>but this is amazing!  </li>
            <li>As people have noted, my 1st Sedu 1.5 was amazing - but eventually (3 years!)</li>
            <li>It smells good and works great with my Sedu.  </li>
            <li>but I was never 100% successful until I got this iron.</li>
            <li>JUST found my perfect heat setting, but I get too many fly-aways from this iron</li>
            <li>Have a nice day!</li>
            <li>Worked awesome for three years, more than what I thought my wife would get out of this.</li>
            <li>This is the best straightener that I have ever used - and believe me - I have tried many.  </li>
            <li>But if I was sure it was an excellent iron, for this reason I ordered it from Folica via Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is for sure the best hair straightener I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>and I loved it, so</li>
            <li>Sedu has been a good choice for me.</li>
            <li>I even use this to curl my hair, it is a 1.5 inch, but it makes gorgeous curls as well.</li>
            <li>The best part, though, is that is glides through your hair so smoothly without any pulling.</li>
            <li>This straightener is just as good as any straightener at target.</li>
            <li>so they still worked fairly well</li>
            <li>An investment in a good iron is intended to LESSEN the product usage.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a good buy, and I have never regretted purchasing it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for 2 years and loved it.</li>
            <li>The reviews are really good</li>
            <li>loved my Solia but after 3 years the plates unattached.</li>
            <li>But I purchased it any way thinking maybe I would purchase a good one.</li>
            <li>; Sedu for over 6 years with no issues and loved it.</li>
            <li>It is so good that I do not need any shine products to make my hair look shiny.</li>
            <li>Bought this iron because of all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>Loved it, heats well but now after 5 months this has quit working.</li>
            <li>I loved this straightener.</li>
            <li>It works good for awhile (maybe a year or so) and then it shorts out.  </li>
            <li>is good</li>
            <li>they are THAT good.</li>
            <li>Great product, easy transaction!</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and adjusts to the heat level that best suits your hair.</li>
            <li>reason I did not give this a better rating, was the cord issue that others had experienced.</li>
            <li>I love this straightener!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so incredibly glad that I did because my hair feels like silk when I use this thing!</li>
            <li>The Babyliss feels amazing - great, sleek design with a good handle and smooth feel.  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Glad my online research paid off!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this guy!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I tested it out immediately and love it!</li>
            <li>Okay I never write product reviews, but this thing is seriously AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Most important is that she has gone from hating her hair to loving it &#x3D; priceless.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>My daughter ordered one, and loved it, it heats up quick and works great...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>The plates are amazing.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair looks so amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing iron.  </li>
            <li>I had that kind of hair myself until about 5th grade.</li>
            <li>and I really really liked it</li>
            <li>It works ok - not as good as the chi and the tool doesn&#x27;t feel as posh as the chi.</li>
            <li>am going to be honest ..</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair really nice.  </li>
            <li>I liked how you turn the dial to set the temperature setting.  </li>
            <li>I really like it leaves my hair perfect.</li>
            <li>Nice feature prevents leaving the iron on.</li>
            <li>now that I got in the state that I was it I could tell how effective</li>
            <li>It is a really good straightener, but I found another that I like better.  </li>
            <li>You would NEVER know I had any kind of kink to my hair at all after I straighten it with the Sedu.</li>
            <li>use it just for my own use.</li>
            <li>the best feature of the Sedu is how fast (35-40 minutes)</li>
            <li>and this is the absolute best.</li>
            <li>My hair even stayed (almost) frizz free in the Houston August humidity - an amazing feet for my hair!</li>
            <li>Hope I helped some people make a good decision - choose something better :)    </li>
            <li>My original iron was amazing!  </li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t believe that there is anything else out there that&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>(even got my sister hooked to it) for years, and honestly I&#x27;ve opened my eyes to better options.</li>
            <li>used it on my all natural hair, and was so happy!!  </li>
            <li>that did ok, but never worked as well as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>I liked this iron concept better than my GK D-600.  </li>
            <li>and I both love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>However, even with mostly straight, fine hair, I get the best results with the temp turned up most of the way.  </li>
            <li>The first one I had was great.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve read some great reviews online about this, and had recommendations from personal friends of how great this product is, I just rate it OK.</li>
            <li>Great product - works exactly as advertised and lasts for a while.</li>
            <li>Worked great at first then started to have issues heating up after a year.  </li>
            <li>This new model has an auto off feature which is very good from a safety perspective (will turn off after 30 minutes of non-use).</li>
            <li>This is great, does not burn my treated hair and is quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I hope to use the Sedu for many years to come and will bust it out on those occasions when I need or want beautiful straight hair.the Sedu for many years to come and will bust it out on those occasions when I need or want beautiful straight hair.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t super blown-away, maybe because a CHI is a good straightener too, but it works well.</li>
            <li>Do it once, do it right and enjoy your beautiful hair.    </li>
            <li>Have yet to try a better one (:</li>
            <li>I love the 1.5&amp;#34; plates.</li>
            <li>Finally, a friend of mine pointed me in the direction of the Sedu, which also had excellent reviews, and lots of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have an hour or more to spend on my hair.</li>
            <li>Just as others have written (SHANTEC gives the best description), the cord will break internally where it connects to the body.  </li>
            <li>The manufacturer should be ashamed of this design which it surely knows about by now.  </li>
            <li>so I wanted to put in my two cents :)</li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to many friends.</li>
            <li>I really LOVE that stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love this straightener.</li>
            <li>and I am really glad I got it.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser even said my hair was in better condition.</li>
            <li>I just love this product.   </li>
            <li>Have found most Ionic products are hype.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>She claims it works better then</li>
            <li>and if that&#x27;s the case, it&#x27;s OK in my book.</li>
            <li>but i love it</li>
            <li>did i mention that i love this product?? &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Magic</li>
            <li>It never took more than one pass to straighten my hair and it took me no time at all.</li>
            <li>I can remember more than one occasion when I forgot to turn it off</li>
            <li>slapped on this cheap iron!</li>
            <li>I give it 3 stars cuz it works for the most part.</li>
            <li>I like to hold my irons closer to the top, and this is a problem for anyone that isn&#x27;t planning to use this iron to curl/wave their hair as well.  </li>
            <li>This is my 2nd Sedu and I am still very happy.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>but the Sedu is a better iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely the best straightener I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything else I have ever used</li>
            <li>It has more than delivered the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I love this straightener and have used this model ever since discovering it a number of years ago.</li>
            <li>telling me that I never used it, so she should be able to take it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a stylist and against my better judgement I ordered this brand I have never heard of on the reviews.  </li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell is 10x&#x27;s better, if I could</li>
            <li>Also, the tourmaline plates do seem to impart much more shine to my hair.  </li>
            <li>Love the Sedu.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Wife loves it better than her Chi</li>
            <li>I also love that it is so light-weight.</li>
            <li>of these irons are way better than any drug store or discount store iron I have tried but over all the Solia is way better for me.</li>
            <li>I love this brand this straightener period.</li>
            <li>After days of reading reviews and searching, I purchased this product and am sooo satisfied....</li>
            <li>So I looked at many reviews and everywhere</li>
            <li>Should have looked into this \\&quot;cord problem\\&quot; more intently, even though its not a swivel cord anymore.</li>
            <li>I also really love the wider end.</li>
            <li>It straightens more of my hair at one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And if something happens to it, just write to the company, and they will replace it for free!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find a better one yet, and I tried them all</li>
            <li>, you name it, from Revlon to Chi, Babyliss, Solia, and all top brands.</li>
            <li>plates to straighten more hair at once&lt;br</li>
            <li>do like how lightweight it is, and it seems to do an okay job straigening the hair.  </li>
            <li>But when I spring the extra cash for a product like this, it&#x27;s gotta multitask and work flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>I do love it</li>
            <li>Does anyone out there have a better recommendation?</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found one that works better than this and lasts longer, so I just keep buying it.  </li>
            <li>I wish they made it more durable.  </li>
            <li>It works ok but not as well as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>I will be sure to get the warranty this time.....</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than what folica.com sells it for.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than what folica.com sells it for.</li>
            <li>, I was just expecting more considering the reviews I had read.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I would like to have more control over the heart settings.</li>
            <li>I hope that customers will be really satisfied by the performance of this hair straightener.</li>
            <li>but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I think it helps do more hair in a shorter time.</li>
            <li>Absoluety my favorite hair straightener on the market.  </li>
            <li>For the price, you get more quality than you pay for.</li>
            <li>I love my Sedu :)</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 2 years now and I am still in love.</li>
            <li>It works great, heats up very fast and is easy to use.  </li>

            <li>This is the best Flat iron I have ever had!!!</li>
            <li>so it does pretty good job.</li>
            <li>This was the best $99 deal I&#x27;ve had in a long time</li>
            <li>It does the job perfectly, I don&#x27;t have to leave on my hair long, just glide it over</li>
            <li>It goes up to very hot levels and makes my hair silky smooth!!  </li>
            <li>This straightener is the best product I have bought in a very long time.</li>
            <li>It straightens perfectly and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>I use it when my hair is fully dry, because it works best for me that way.</li>
            <li>this iron is amazing, even it burns out in a year its worth getting another</li>
            <li>This product worked great on my naturally frizzy and curly hair.  </li>
            <li>the light on it is so cute.. doesn&#x27;t pull or snag your hair.</li>
            <li>I have used way cheap irons at $50 that performed better than this.</li>
            <li>I like the Sedu&#x27;s smooth ceramic surface much better.</li>
            <li>I have always loved straight, sily-smooth hair.</li>
            <li>I tried a cheaper model that had good reviews on Amazon, but I found that my type of hair really needs a heavy-duty product with variable heat.</li>
            <li>Gotta say it lives my hair super straight, and my hair feels great.</li>
            <li>They both get very hot, the Babyliss maybe even more so...but the Sedu just seems to curl the hair better and straighten without heat damage like the Babyliss.  </li>
            <li>My hair is beautifully shiny and not dry, or frizzy</li>
            <li>Its a shame, as it is a great item, works well but a little more life expectancy would make this even better!</li>
            <li>It works best when I blow my hair out first and then go over it with this iron, but I can use it right on my curls and have them go pin straight.   </li>
            <li>but I already am hugely impressed with this product; my hair is straight, shiny, and soft.      </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend sitting it on any surface easily damaged by heat.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly, and yet, the heat does not damage my hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to grip and portable for travel.</li>
            <li>heat settings&lt;br /&gt;straightens easily and quickly&lt;</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong today.</li>
            <li>hair is long, wavy / curly and will not stay straight without a good straightener and good product - this did the trick!</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;ve seriously never had more than 2 or 3 sentences to write in a review, if I even write one!</li>
            <li>The first is that part of the iron gets uncomfortably warm.</li>
            <li>I had really liked using the dryer - fast results!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this iron for 3 years and it still works as good as new.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly which is important when rushing to get to work in the morning.</li>
            <li>The product seems to work fine</li>
            <li>The plates ade perfect size cuts time in half</li>
            <li>This was a fine product while it lasted, but now it&#x27;s a paper weight.</li>
            <li>it is super light weight!</li>
            <li>In short, this is a very good product, just don&#x27;t buy it on line if you expect adequate customer service.</li>
            <li>Great, easy to use, lightweight flat iron.</li>
            <li>Best I have ever used&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair soft and shiny, have used escape real other brands this is by far the best</li>
            <li>The heat output is spectacular, much hotter than any cheap straightener I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>I like how smooth my hair looks using my sedu.  </li>
            <li>This is more an issue with my memory than the product, but worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>It flattens my hair so fast and nicely.  </li>
            <li>Does not leave the hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>So I was straightening my hair this morning in my own apartment, getting ready for my \\&quot;grown-up job\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve been at for about a year now.</li>
            <li>This product is just cheap looking, cheap-made.</li>
            <li>Compared to my FHI, this iron was as light as a feather.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and silky and not frizzy at all.</li>
            <li>There is no indicator light to tell you when it reaches the temperature you have selected and does take a bit longer to get there than the Chi.  </li>
            <li>They make my hair feel really smooth.</li>
            <li>It does seem cheap when you look at it</li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>Perhaps that&#x27;s why it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>It is a great iron, but only plan to have it for a year.  </li>
            <li>The plate edges are straight rather than beveled, and clamp rather than float, so it does not glide through your hair without catching the ends and DOES leave impression marks.  </li>
            <li>Light won&#x27;t go on, no heat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really light in weight</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not comparable to cheap brands from drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li>This was a great iron when it worked, unfortunately it only lasted for 3 - 4 months.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it when I&#x27;ve worn my hair curly with some light</li>
            <li>a free return, as they sent me a defective item and</li>
            <li>When I received the straightener it felt like a cheap piece of plastic and did not straighten my hair at all.  </li>
            <li>It worked perfectly well, and always left my hair silky and straight.</li>
            <li>Good temperature control, nice and wide.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li>Great flat iron.</li>
            <li>This is a great flat iron.</li>
            <li>The Sedu is a great flat iron to purchase.</li>
            <li>My xwife&#x27;s Chi quit after a year, so we tried the Sedu... which works great for her long wavy hair, and she insists the heat output is far superior to any dept. store brands, and the difference is obvious.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is worth it!</li>
            <li>the top of it gets really hot</li>
            <li>totally worth the investment!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the cost!</li>
            <li>I truly believe sedu is an excellent company based on my past experience, but if you would like to buy a sedu iron, do so from elsewhere.</li>
            <li>BEWARE!I ordered this as a replacement to my original purchase (folica.com)</li>
            <li>Its worth every penny!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Trust me, it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li>I contacted them to see if they will except an exchange although I do not have a receipt or the original packaging.  </li>
            <li>I am now about to buy another one of these in the hopes of the longevity that was originally provided.</li>
            <li>she was excited about the results she got with from this tool.</li>
            <li>Love it so much!</li>
            <li>Loved it - it is lightweight, easy to use, has variable heat settings which is important as it does not fry fine hair, but will also tackle thicker hair and it  left my hair smooth, frizz free and straight as could</li>
            <li>It was easy to use, quick - less than 10 minutes and good to go!</li>
            <li>like I said, it gives me excellent results, far better than any other brand.</li>
            <li>My hair looks super smooth and shiny after a Sedu pass...but somewhat fried after a Babyliss</li>
            <li>The Sedu should be able to reach temperatures of 410 degrees but even after 15 minutes was still only warm to the touch and didn&#x27;t seem to have  reached 150 degrees.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light and compact.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how that worked out, but it&#x27;s very nice!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best flat iron we ever had.  </li>
            <li>Man were they right!</li>
            <li>Extremely Love my new straightener!!</li>
            <li>The iron its amazing the first month straight</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to buy this, either make sure you&#x27;re not forgetful, or be sure your renter&#x27;s / home owners&#x27;s insurance policy is up-to-date and covers fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All was good for almost three months when suddenly one morning, the Sedu would not turn on.</li>
            <li>After losing my beloved FHI Iron on a vacation, it was finally time for me to do my research and find another.</li>
            <li>I must say that the products is a dream come true.  </li>
            <li>After four years of good use (straightening every day), it finally stopped working or heating up as well.</li>
            <li>It was returned and a full refund issued by Amazon.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to be spending this much on an iron, might as well just go ahead and spend more on one that doesn&#x27;t have a breakage problem.</li>
            <li>somewhere such a good iron went to Amazon to purchase.</li>
            <li>And another one which brand is good at low price also.</li>
            <li>I am able to wear my hair straight or curly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Why are these \\&quot;professional\\&quot; hair irons only good for ~1 year?</li>
            <li>the best straight iron, hands down.  </li>
            <li>I thought I loved my previous straightener, but this one is tons better.</li>
            <li>It was costing me alot to have my hair professionally straighten at the salon, this is worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li>Fortunately, Amazon is a stand-up company with unmatched customer service and made the situation right.</li>
            <li>My main goal was to keep my length and have it at least LOOK healthy, and this performed wonderfully to help me reach that</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly and works really well!</li>
            <li>Great straightener, wouldn&#x27;t buy any other brand..</li>
            <li>I have used many straightening irons in the past and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because it had good reviews, but the plates are the smallest plates I&#x27;ve ever seen on a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I loved this flat iron until it stopped working.</li>
            <li>I had a Sedu flat iron for 9 years and loved it.</li>
            <li>It is extremely light, the large plate allows for faster straightening, and the edges do not tug at your hair!</li>
            <li>she said her hair was super soft and shiny and was pleased with how light in weight this tool was.</li>
            <li>My daughter has been very happy with this straightener, except that our second one in the last 10 months just broke.  </li>
            <li>but of course when you straighten you cannot keep super still and hope the cord will stay still!!You</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal sedu fan</li>
            <li>It heats quickly and works wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li>The straightener did not heat quickly as the Sedu should when received.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a couple of Chi&#x27;s and a Babyliss and the Sedu outperforms those tremendously.</li>
            <li>Works quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, holds its heat and can flatten hair effortlessly since it&#x27;s so lightweight.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointing for the price taf but worked great when it actually did work</li>
            <li>but it also makes it super shiny.</li>
            <li>it heats up super quickly and gets very hot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many high dollar hair straighteners</li>
            <li>After using typical Revlon and Connair products, it was nice to spend money on a product and actually get good results!</li>
            <li>My first Sedu broke on me after 5 months as well, but I had saved my receipt this time and had a free 1 year warranty from the website I bought it at.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is great for straightening hair but for me it did not keep my hair straight.</li>
            <li>But I had to express my love, yes LOVE, for this flat iron.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t need to be very hot either.</li>
            <li>Great flat iron, really does improve the feel and health of the hair.  </li>
            <li>You will never find yourself smelling a very hot plate, also it does not not ever burn your scalp.  </li>
            <li>I have owned many, many flat irons (</li>
            <li>/&gt;can get very hot to touch</li>
            <li>IMO there are other products out there deserving of the price tag on this one, and they do a lot better job.</li>
            <li>When I turn the iron to medium position or higher, the light blinks.</li>
            <li>I opted for the older version in lieu of the newer one because I liked my 1 inch so much.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Also, when I first bought it I wasn&#x27;t super excited about the price</li>
            <li>Also, when I first bought it I wasn&#x27;t super excited about the price</li>
            <li>to flat iron my hair (shoulder length) as it works incredibly fast and is very effective.</li>
            <li>My thinking is my problem is more a company that may not have sold me  a new product but a used one ;-(.</li>
            <li>new cord is what you are used to seeing on most blow dryers/lamps, etc.  </li>
            <li>small and compact but not as great as everyone says...doesn&#x27;t glide as smooth as T3 irons</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no stylist myself, so I value the fact that it&#x27;s really easy to use and fast, too.</li>
            <li>The sedu flat iron is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The way the cord is attached inside the flat iron is not the greatest and it can become disconnected inside (your flat iron will no longer work).</li>
            <li>It is light weight, with adjustable temperatures and perfect for my long hair, which is very dry and kinda frizzy.</li>
            <li>Ive tried many different flat iron&#x27;s, and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>my $40 hot tools got it straighter than this!</li>
            <li>years later I&#x27;m once again looking for something better!</li>
            <li>Sedu makes great products that live up to their standard!!  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews of how great this flat iron works, I had really high hopes.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair silky smooth and super straight.</li>
            <li>This straightener is great for my tight spiral curls.</li>
            <li>The design is a little boxy though but its a great product</li>
            <li>I called Exceon (maker of Sedu) and talked to a supervisor who told me in not so many words, that it was my tough luck and basically said that their product is great</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get over how smooth and straight it is.  </li>
            <li>It makes the hair really silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>The Sedu leaves it smooth and straight.</li>
            <li>I had a Chi Turbo for years until it finally broke, and decided with all of the amazing reviews on this product I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>and it does such an amazing job.  </li>
            <li>A blow dryer, paddle brush, a bunch of time, and lots of product were not cutting it.</li>
            <li>Then again, it&#x27;s also able to reach really far</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It has - and it is worth every penny.     </li>
            <li>(and there&#x27;ve been a few), this is by far the best!</li>
            <li>Its worth it..</li>
            <li>I love it so far.   </li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>and it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The only one I will ever own.</li>
            <li>Worth buying.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money, and</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that for the cost of this iron, that I got my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>and she didn&#x27;t know why I had so many problems and indicated that many people loved their product and that I must have done something wrong.  </li>
            <li>It snags my hair and really didn&#x27;t leave it as nice as my 5 year old Chi does.</li>
            <li>I feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I am speechless, it is extremely lightweight, ready to use in 20 seconds, easy to operate, results in shiny and healthy straight hair!!!!</li>
            <li>I can only imagine the good reviews are from people who have never owned a nice flat iron and upgraded from a cheap one.&lt;br /&gt;My 9 year old chi started losing its plates</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I was SUPER surprised that an iron could be this light!</li>
            <li>The flat irons worked well to straighten, and I loved how my hair looked, but they have flaws with the cord assembly, so don&#x27;t expect it to last more than a year or two.</li>
            <li>The iron gets super hot and there is no place to hold on to it without burning your hand.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is amazing.</li>
            <li>Major superior to cheap flat irons and worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have never tried another flat iron that provided the amazing heat and softness that this iron generates.</li>
            <li>I own this flat iron for about three years.</li>
            <li>a nice straightener, but someone told me that the Babyliss flat irons can beat the sedu</li>
            <li>I would think that if Folica had been hacked like they claimed, they would want to make the situation right with their customers.</li>
            <li>and I thought this product was going to be right for me.</li>
            <li>and also it is in right price range for me.</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m going to try the Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium iron and see if it doesn&#x27;t break within three months. -____-</li>
            <li>not rough on appliances either, I&#x27;ve had the same $25 Remington hair dryer for 9 years and it works great.</li>
            <li>I returned the first one because it was defective as the light is suppose to flash once the iron is ready to use</li>
            <li>For the price I paid, I would hope to get more than 2 years out of the item, but in my case, I barely got 18 months!</li>
            <li>I have owned this straightener for a little over six months and am still thrilled with it!</li>
            <li>It claims to use negative ions in your hair and make it beautiful or something, who knows.</li>
            <li>It is hands down THE BEST flat iron out there -</li>
            <li>This flat iron will leave your hair super smooth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several flat irons and my Sedu is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>The Sedu Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron Hair Straightener (1.5 inch) had good reviews and seemed like a good option for someone with thick and unruly hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and although I don&#x27;t turn the heat dial to the recommended setting, it has not dried my hair out.</li>
            <li>It works very well and quickly.</li>
            <li>My hair stayed straight, and was soft, manageable and also important - not fried!</li>
            <li>I can straighten my hair super fast and it leaves it shiny.</li>
            <li>I sent it back with the warranty and got another one because it really does do a nice job</li>
            <li>but it warms up super fast and does a fine/average job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She loved it but the iron developed an electrical short where the cord enters the iron.</li>
            <li>use this iron with a tension comb to get my hair super straight.  </li>
            <li>It came in the mail yesterday and today I washed, did a quick blow out and then tried this iron and was really dissapointed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to pay a little bit more for a product that&#x27;s more</li>
            <li>I was happy to see the temp went so high, because my hair won&#x27;t respond to anything less.</li>
            <li>If you are only interested in a short time using a great iron, and then spending the 100+ dollars again, then GET THIS IRON.      </li>
            <li>I was so upset as I wasn&#x27;t sure I would be able to purchase this same flat iron again, but luckily I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>also.. the blinking light and on/off switch and temp dial is located near at the hinge of the tool, rather than on the top side of one of the arms.. making it kind of hard to see at times.</li>
            <li>But the person I spoke with didn&#x27;t seem to know very much about the line she was representing and could give me no answers.</li>
            <li>thank you very much.  </li>
            <li>it sticks to my hair and pulls thank you very much</li>
            <li>I have always bought cheap flat irons and my hair never came out smooth</li>
            <li>my original was 72W and the new one is 45W.  </li>
            <li>It is very reliable, heats fast and stays clean.  </li>
            <li>This purchase is an exact rebuy.  </li>
            <li>Thank You so much!</li>
            <li>This iron was a gift from heaven when I first started using it .</li>
            <li>When I first did research on the sedu there were alot of reviews talking about the cord</li>
            <li>, right now my sedu won&#x27;t even turn on unless I swivel the cord a certain way .</li>
            <li>They are good for some light smoothing, but they do not have the heft to get thick hair truly straight.</li>
            <li>and I am pretty clueless when it comes to the \\&quot;How to...</li>
            <li>Compared to how well it works and the amount of time it can last, it is easily a better choice than a cheaper one in the stores.</li>
            <li>straightens, curls, leaves your hair soft and shines in the light.</li>
            <li>My first Sedu lasted almost five years</li>
            <li>My hair comes out smooth and soft in a fraction of the time it used to.  </li>
            <li>There was no temperature setting on the model I bought, and although results were similar, I would have to say the Sedu performed better.</li>
            <li>I was AMAZED the first day I got it..</li>
            <li>And even if it broke on me now, I would be willing to buy it again in a heartbeat.  </li>
            <li>My hair is incredibly soft and smooth after using the Sedu.  </li>
            <li>It takes me about 20 minutes because I have so much hair!</li>
            <li>Also, the plastic over the plates gets really hot</li>
            <li>the shipping was fast also!     </li>
            <li>First, I want to say to those who read this ..  </li>
            <li>I told her to try this first.</li>
            <li>Someone recommended this one...told me to make sure I buy the \\&quot;SEDU\\&quot; Brand only.</li>
            <li>Love the larger plate and how silky it leaves your hair!</li>
            <li>I had this straightener from ninth grade till the first year of college.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first 1 inch Sedu a couple of years ago and it shorted out after maybe 2 years of use.  </li>
            <li>Another reviewer said he took it apart to find the problem and he thinks it was the cord assembly inside, which showed him exactly why the iron wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li>The 30 second warmup is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Authentic SEDU products are only sold through authorized distributors, listed under Where To Buy.</li>
            <li>The only way to guarantee a SEDU product is authentic is to buy from an authorized distributor.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t get nearly as hot (though turned up all the way)..  </li>
            <li>Chi &amp; Solia were my last ones) and this one is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>By twisting my hand back and forth throughout the length, I am able to get a wavy / pseudo-curly look, though nowhere as controlled or intentional looking as with the CHI (the curls seem to fall where they wish).  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted over a year then conked out on me and wouldn&#x27;t turn on (don&#x27;t know why??)</li>
            <li>I got my first sedu about four years ago (the first one, that is).</li>
            <li>this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I would spend the extra money to get a better product that won&#x27;t die within the year of purchasing it.</li>
            <li>My daughter only uses it a couple times a week so its more like a couple months of usage.</li>
            <li>but I wish I looked at it in the store first.</li>
            <li>Anyway, when I saw the cord assembly inside it showed me exactly why the iron wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li>If I was to start out again, I would find a reputable local dealer with an acceptable return policy and buy it there.  </li>
            <li>my first two broke within two years.  </li>
            <li>It does get hot fast and cool fast when you turn it off</li>
            <li>I had the first one for about 3 years and used it almost every day.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted 2 years and would of made it longer</li>
            <li>So the bottom line is this: it&#x27;s a great hair straightener for a little while, until it breaks, and you have to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also heating up quickly - so would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>When you first look at the price it is kind of expensive but for as muh use as I have gotten out of it it is for sure worth it!</li>
            <li>Amazingly quick to heat, silky smooth to use and simple to store.</li>
            <li>Love, the product.. wide plates and quick straightening.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research before buying this flat iron since the price tag was higher than the ones you find at retail stores, but I have to admit I&#x27;m glad I purchased this item.   </li>
            <li>I am an African American woman and I have never been able to get my hair as straight as I am able to do now, not even when going to the salon.  </li>
            <li>; on it - it still heats up quickly, stays at the right temperature (though you do sometimes need to wait 10-20 seconds for it to get back to your desired heat after a few chunks of hair have been straightened), and it straightens my hair very nicely.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say anything about the longevity of the product since I only got my iron about a month ago, but I certainly hope it lasts more than a year...</li>
            <li>First of all, it snagged my hair like cheap flat irons do whereas my old sedu ran through my hair so smoothly and rarely ever ripped a hair out.</li>
            <li>I guess this flat iron is ok.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this flat iron</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I just love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>and I was no longer able to use this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Sedu is suppose to be a top brand of flat irons and this does not seem to match up.  </li>
            <li>PROUD BLACK!!!</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>Lesson learned: if you have REALLY thick/wavy hair, steer clear of cheap flat-irons.</li>
            <li>I love straight hair on a female.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine was using a different brand, which was good, but she had been thinking about buying a wider one of the same brand.</li>
            <li>Another great thing about this flat iron, is it keeps my hair straight all day long.  </li>
            <li>One of the plates has been held in place by 3 edges for a year now, but it still works just fine other than making a light rattle noise.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I purchased a second one because the first one got a short in the wire after I had it for a while.  </li>
            <li>If it was humind, or raining, my hair frizzed right up, and it never stayed straight for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>I have super fine and very long hair</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it doesn&#x27;t have an auto off feature, but other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>For this price you buy a better and long life iron.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair (not ringlets but very curly) and because of this straightner everyone thinks I have straight hair!</li>
            <li>They get hot- fast.</li>
            <li>Far superior to Chi or any other brand I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The slight curve in the handle makes it easy and comfortable to hold.     </li>
            <li>Really, after using several brands of flat irons, including Solano and CHI, I can say with certainty that the Sedu gave me superior results and was also easier and quicker to use.</li>
            <li>I was able to shower, blow dry, and straighten my hair all in under one hour.      </li>
            <li>Feels cheaply made and you can&#x27;t hold onto the outside of the ironing area to do curls because it gets to hot.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so straight and smooth and it stays that way all day, which is a miracle since my hair is thick and frizzes very easily.</li>
            <li>AM 100%, PURE, UNTOUCH, GRADE A, PUREBREED, CERTIFIED, PANTENT-PENDED</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, my advice would be to buy it if you are looking for something new, something that will help straighten and maintain your hair until the next wash, and help it to feel silkier, softer and keep it fairly healthy, I would insist you try the Sedu.</li>
            <li>I ordered a new one right away.  </li>
            <li>Does an ok Job but not as good as other sedu flat irons which i also purchased at the same time which I give a 5 star.</li>
            <li>The main reason I love this flat iron so much is because it causes minimal breakage/damage and leaves your hair looking really healthy.</li>
            <li>However, after plugging it in for first time use it would not heat up to high temperatures.</li>
            <li>Most important to me was if it was hard on my hair</li>
            <li>Although this has been the best flat iron I have ever used, I will not purchase another and suggest that you do not waste your money on this as it doesn&#x27;t last long!</li>
            <li>Even at the salon it took the stylist over an hour to blow my hair out, and the finished product was not as straight as I wanted it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to go over my hair a million times to get it straight.</li>
            <li>I like the iron so much because I really need to find another brand.  </li>
            <li>, I just feel it doesn&#x27;t take away the frizz as much as I think it should.</li>
            <li>but I thought that if it really works as well as everyone is saying, then it would pay itself off in no time.</li>
            <li>, It gets my hair straight and it somewhat tames frizz.</li>
            <li>The CHI does get my hair poker straight, but it leaves my ends fried, so I don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li>straight-</li>
            <li>It heats up much faster and leaves my hair shiny and sleek.</li>
            <li>With the Sedu, my hair is still straight when I go to bed.</li>
            <li>Did not work, I&#x27;ve used a real sedu and this is not it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it several times, it didn&#x27;t hurt my hair at all, but the thing with the light makes me worry.</li>
            <li>I do recommend being careful not to drop it too many times since the edge that holds the plate can break and loosen it a bit.</li>
            <li>The hair came out bone straight, just the way I like it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>In this case you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I am really scared to buy another one..</li>
            <li>it heats fast but doesn&#x27;t straighten in one stroke.  </li>
            <li>My hair stayed straight for days in the Florida humidity, with the Sedu</li>
            <li>This warning comes straight from the Sedu official site, I would be very weary of purchasing this item from an unauthorized vendor.....</li>
            <li>Because it is so lightweight it makes straightening my hair much easier.  </li>
            <li>It is made really lightweight...</li>
            <li>straight.</li>
            <li>It saves so much time to straighten your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely getting another one.</li>
            <li>and it takes me about 20 minutes to do my whole head.</li>
            <li>I get compliments all the time on how straight and shiny my hair is.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>and this works much faster.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>Within five minutes, I have a glossy straight finish.  </li>
            <li>This iron worked very well for about 4 months.</li>
            <li>I really want the Sedu to work for me --</li>
            <li>Heats up fast.</li>
            <li>The light flickered on and off and it did not heat up properly.</li>
            <li>I then used epoxy to carefully secure the wires into the assembly and the rest of the unit back together.</li>
            <li>I felt that this was wasteful, however, I am readily buying another one.</li>
            <li>for 80 you really can&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
            <li>PIN STRAIGHT</li>
            <li>After using this her hair is sleek and straight.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li>I am very dissatisfied with this whole process.</li>
            <li>She is a beautician and wants this for her work.</li>
            <li>VERY DISSAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li>I also love the wide plates.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>You have to be gentle with the cord though - no yanking at all.</li>
            <li>IMO, this works far better than Chi (which I used prior to purchasing Sedu).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and does an amazing job in closing the hair cuticle on my damaged, chemically treated, thin hair.</li>
            <li>; Remington flat iron for nearly eight years before it shorted out (pretty good for a $25 flat iron).  </li>
            <li>After letting a few of my friends use it they have purchased their own.</li>
            <li>At first I was using it at the highest setting, but my hair was getting a little dry, so I lowered the temp and got great results</li>
            <li>With all these great reviews, I have to wonder what I’m missing with this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I had one of these flat irons for a few years and it worked great.</li>
            <li>I love the results, straight, sleek, shiny hair that I always admired on models and movie stars, in minutes without chemicals or other unnatural things.</li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s more of a me issue than a Sedu issue, if I went to any other brand it would still take forever just because of how much hair I have).</li>
            <li>It glides over the hair so nicely without tugging, has very minimal damage, and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair super smooth and in less time.</li>
            <li>I also use \\&quot;Loreal Hot Straight\\&quot; too to give it a little bit more protection from the heat</li>
            <li>So, after many failed hair straighteners in the past, I decided to give it another try and go for what the critics (in the Inet and hair salons) all called \\&quot;the best of the best\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews on this product and other products similiar to it before deciding on the Sedu.  </li>
            <li>But one day, after about 14 months of normal usage, IT CAUGHT ON FIRE IN MY HAND!</li>
            <li>The only reason I am on my second one is because I let my first Sedu fall off the dresser too many times and the hinge eventually broke and</li>
            <li>The first day this iron was like wow!</li>
            <li>My original Sedu lasted over 2.5 years and finally just crapped out.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, I was very happy the first time I used a modern ceramic flat iron and acquired one as soon as I could afford</li>
            <li>This is the second time in the past 3 years that we have ordered this product and it is great every time.</li>
            <li>I had always used cheap ones in the past and I can tell a huge difference with the Sedu.</li>
            <li>Hai, I m gethu sakthi wife, This is first time ,I have trouble to choose which one good for my hair for straighter or flat iron Or anything else ?.</li>
            <li>Usually it takes about 3 times going over my own strands of hair with a flat iron just to get it straight, and it&#x27;s not even shiny or silky smooth, but with the Sedu, I have been able to finish doing my hair in half the time I used to because all it takes it one run through each piece.</li>
            <li>There’s nothing special here, especially for the $100 price tag.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really feel that it works any better than the $30 straightener I previously had bought from Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>I noticed if you part every small section and take your time your results will be amazing all in all this iron</li>
            <li>I tried everything to starighten my hair, even the old fashion \\&quot;hot comb on the stove\\&quot; routine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely lazy at that kind of stuff, returning within the X day window, etc</li>
            <li>iron also seems to direct heat towards the scalp first.  </li>
            <li>i end up buying a new one every year or two - but that&#x27;s more due to my clumsiness rather than the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>And after 3-4 years of use, it still works as if it&#x27;s new!</li>
            <li>She said I went a whole year trying to grow my relaxer out, just to get a new relaxer.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who would love to have soft, shiny and very straight hair in so little time.</li>
            <li>The iron is lightweight and easy to manage -- I don&#x27;t have to use both hands on the iron to hold it to keep it closed or to support the weight.     </li>
            <li>Bought 2nd one because I love this iron but for the money does not last.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m frustrated because otherwise, I love this iron - but if it won&#x27;t heat, it doesn&#x27;t do you a lot of good.</li>
            <li>In order to make this work, I have to hold it in just one particular way</li>
            <li>Use a good brush to blow dry, just to get completely dry and soft.</li>
            <li>and I get a phone call from my older sister</li>
            <li>the older</li>
            <li>-- maybe it was the particular one I&#x27;ve been using (both times I&#x27;ve purchased the Pro).</li>
            <li>I have super kinky coarse hair and have tried all kinds of straightening methods and products.</li>
            <li>I was a happy spokesperson, and after three form me, three from friends and family that followed suit, I can say SEDU SUCKS!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and she says, \\&quot;Well, you got that  when you were a sophomore in high school</li>
            <li>highly recommend this for anyone looking for a high end hair straightner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>love this flat iron i cant believe i didnt know about it earlier</li>
            <li>Today I phoned Sedu directly to see if the company&#x27;s other models are more durable</li>
            <li>I missed my beautiful flat ironed hair, but was wary to spend that kind of money for a product with such a short lifespan.</li>
            <li>Heats yup super fast and you can straighten your hair much faster then a lot of other brands</li>
            <li>Seven years of silky, soft, beautifully straight hair.</li>
            <li>Naturally, my hair is very frizzy and poofy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Easier to clean, Sedu just a wipe with a dry cloth, Solia needed a cleaning iron solution</li>
            <li>/&gt;Exceon does not tolerate counterfeit sales of its products and shall seek legal action against those involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sedu products are held to the highest industry standards for quality and safety.</li>
            <li>I have read that many customers have had trouble getting their straighteners replaced by Farouk (makers of Chi)</li>
            <li>To top it all off, I only bought it in June and it completely stopped working mid March.</li>
            <li>The Sedu is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>I would say this product is only worth  </li>
            <li>With my Remington, it took approximately 30 minutes to straighten from start to finish and with the Sedu, it takes a good hour (no exaggeration).  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and with this iron I get smooth straight hair in less than 30 minutes!</li>
            <li>This is my fourth flat iron -- one was good, two were bad, and this one seems great so far.  </li>
            <li>My 15 year old daughter wanted a really good flat iron since she irons her hair everyday....</li>
            <li>Again, Folica paid for the shipping there and back, but I didn&#x27;t send it in right away again</li>
            <li>I live in a high humidity area and this straightener combined with the right styling products leaves my hair looking good for a few days with only minimal touch ups and damage.</li>
            <li>It worked fine at first, but no better than a Chi you could buy at Ulta with a coupon.</li>
            <li>I was using the highest setting since my old iron never got hot enough no matter how much I tried.  </li>
            <li>It glides through the hair like none other and feels fantastic.</li>
            <li>Lesson learned; just because something is more expensive, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s better quality or does a better job.</li>
            <li>leaves my hair ultra smooth and extremely shiny.</li>
            <li>My other irons didn&#x27;t seem to mind too much, but this iron seems to direct heat downwards first, so you do feel that burn and really can&#x27;t get very close to your scalp if it&#x27;s at all damp.  </li>
            <li>The new Sedu&#x27;s cord does not swivel.</li>
            <li>But they sent me a new one</li>
            <li>I live in Florida</li>
            <li>I would of got Paul Mitchell which I had been using for 10 years but decided to try something new.</li>
            <li>I got a new one and it lasted a year and ended up not turning on again for no reason what so ever one day.</li>
            <li>Would recommend for someone who doesn&#x27;t mind buying a brand new one every year.</li>
            <li>I wish it had an automatic shut off, but I will live with it.</li>
            <li>Now i HAVE A NEW ONE</li>
            <li>I needed a new iron after my</li>
            <li>(plus I used to find that my hair would get caught on the edge), so I decided to try a new brand.</li>
            <li>I immediately bought a new one.</li>
            <li>New cord, new plug, new hope.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>So when I began my search for a new iron, I decided to go &amp;#34;all-out&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>have continued to use the iron, thinking that styling time would reduce as I got acclimated to my new iron; but to no avail.  </li>
            <li>and I got a new one.  </li>
            <li>Well I got the new one and this one passed the 3 month mark and made it to 4 months.  </li>
            <li>the new iron looks</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t imagine and contemplating returning and getting a new chi</li>
            <li>When I went back to work from the weekend, my coworkers all commented on how much longer my hair looked (because it was truly straight).  </li>
            <li>Chi and Solia flat irons both died on me right after their year anniversaries</li>
            <li>This flat iron got amazing reviews, so I was excited to try this on my thick, coarse and wavy hair (not even curly)</li>
            <li>The plates are soft and the iron is high quality.</li>
            <li>It does get hot and I haven&#x27;t had any technical problems with it</li>
            <li>I had this same exact model before, three years ago.</li>
            <li>I heats up in minutes and it gets plenty HOT at only the halfway setting!  </li>
            <li>This flat iron seemd to great for those with thin hair or finer hair.</li>
            <li>Well, until this morning, of course, but that&#x27;s completely unrelated!</li>
            <li>I tried to love it, but honestly it&#x27;s not better than a $60 iron-</li>
            <li>- her natural hair is frizzy hot-roller-curls from the 80&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>It did not get nearly hot enough</li>
            <li>and this one did the same exact thing.  </li>
            <li>I was in the middle of doing my hair and noticed it wasn&#x27;t hot anymore and realized even though it was supposed to be on it</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just very simple looking and not flashy</li>
            <li>The hot iron element didn&#x27;t heat up properly.</li>
            <li>Just not the same as my first one.</li>
            <li>I have purchased sooooo many flat irons for the past few years, and this one by far is my favorite!  </li>
            <li>(This happened to me one year into my first Sedu; I&#x27;ve now had this current one for three years).</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>Each time it seemed that a wire shorted out and if you do some research you&#x27;ll find that others had the exact same problem.  </li>
            <li>guess it&#x27;s my fault for not researching that prior to buying, but the business selling these are well aware of that.  </li>
            <li>I actually never heard of the brand of  sedu until I asked a co-work how she gets her hair so perfectly straight!</li>
            <li>I have used so many other iron such as chi, hsi, con air, Remington, baby bliss,  etc</li>
            <li>it gets HOT, it does do nice curls and waves that last a little longer than usual, but it&#x27;s not intended to stay super</li>
            <li>So, this was my first high end flat iron, and I can&#x27;t believe three years ago I threw away a 1.5 \\&quot; sedu because of a cord problem!!</li>
            <li>no other straighteners would do it justice and even if was able to straighten my hair with any other straightening iron, it wont last for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>My previous good iron (a different brand) eventually had the electrical problem that others are referring to in their reviews (a problem in the swivel connection) and I hope that for this price, that this one lasts just as long as that one did.</li>
            <li>over all makes my very curly hair very straight with minimal effort.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind buying a new one frequently, then you should get this one.  </li>
            <li>It works fine now, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>Good for thick and long hair.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron, it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing....</li>
            <li>I bought this flat iron because I had always had extremely positive results with sedu in the past (much better than chi and others).</li>
            <li>(it is a huge, puffy mess when done).</li>
            <li>first flat iron I had was great--while it lasted, which was for about a year.</li>
            <li>I live in the very humid deep South, which doesn&#x27;t help the situation.</li>
            <li>It lasted a long time, after much use, and we were able to get the same one again for the same low price.</li>
            <li>I can straighten large sections with only two to three repeats per section.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>All I do is add a little chi silk infusion and my hair is silky, smooth, and bouncy.</li>
            <li>so it really does not flat iron hair</li>
            <li>so if you use your other hand to help push them or roll it thru the hair, it can be hot - not a big deal but worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>It was working fine for few days,  but then after it stopped working completely.</li>
            <li>Did not make my hair as straight and smooth as flat iron I have for less money.</li>
            <li>I want to make it clear that I&#x27;ve purchased 3 of these from Folica.com, who is an authorized dealer of Sedu.</li>
            <li>It was used as a back-up to my old faithful 1-inch ceramic flatiron that I&#x27;ve had for about five years</li>
            <li>My hair feels silky soft after each use.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try the Chi just for kicks, and after owning it for 1 week it has completely stopped working.</li>
            <li>, I was like wow all this hair is suppose to straighten out with this..</li>
            <li>and my hair is soo bounce and soft..</li>
            <li>Never had any complaints until they start getting old, the plates start to come undone and pull the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not so much curly, but wavy and as if every hair is going in a different direction.  </li>
            <li>Flattens, straightens and smooths hair leaving it shiny and soft..</li>
            <li>I use mine heavily, nearly every day.</li>
            <li>went natural about a year ago.</li>
            <li>I have hair up to my butt and it took only about 20 minutes to get my hair perfectly straight.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been reliable thus far.</li>
            <li>I do miss the swivel cord from my Chi, but it was simply causing too much breakage compared to this Sedu.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t get near the number of split ends I did before either.</li>
            <li>Within  3 weeks of receipt of the item it quit working completely, there are lots of reports of counterfeit items out there which makes me think this could have been one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to damage our hair so far (had it a couple months).</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind it so much if I didn&#x27;t have to keep straightening my hair (sometimes 3 extra times a day).</li>
            <li>It has worked wonders on my naturally curly hair, even during the summer</li>
            <li>But that is far from the truth.  </li>
            <li>so I guess it should not have surprised me.</li>
            <li>I should get another one just because its so old and</li>
            <li>I have very unruly mixed chick hair and it gets my hair silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair looks soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;nothing else so far.....</li>
            <li>and this makes my hair so shinny and soft..</li>
            <li>our old one did pay for itself saving us money on professional styling.</li>
            <li>Also, like the fact the company offers a 1 year warranty on it.</li>
            <li>I probably should have gotten the smaller size for now, but this one does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and thanks to Lashauna D. Willis&#x27; review as it helped me in my decision..</li>
            <li>While I did have to go over each piece 3 or 4 times, my hair did turn out shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>Unexpectedly the cord stopped working</li>
            <li>The sedu has multiple settings, heats up fast and makes my hair feel silky.</li>
            <li>My hair seem to be soft and shiny after I use it to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>Tonight I bought an updated version of my old Remington (S-9620) with 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and this is the only straightener that makes my hair sleek and stick straight.  </li>
            <li>But Completely my fault not the products.</li>
            <li>worth every penny I spent.</li>
            <li>Wait an extra month or two if you must, to save the extra cash because it is WORTH the wait.     </li>
            <li>I think it is important that you use some type of heat protectant for your hair, and as many other reviewers stated, the body of the iron does get hot, but as long as you are a little careful it shouldn&#x27;t cause any issues.</li>
            <li>First of all, there seemed to be a slight gap in between the plates, so I felt like it didnt have the ability to press my hair straight.</li>
            <li>really miss the absence of a spring, because how I used to curl hair with the CHI</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay hot for very long.</li>
            <li>So I would definitely recommend this straightener to anyone who&#x27;s serious about just having nice hair, not having a hassle every time they need to get ready in the morning, and who wants a flat iron that will last them for a while.&lt;br /&gt;oh</li>
            <li>With my old flat irons, my hair would be straight when I was finished, but within an hour</li>
            <li>after 9 months of every other day use of the Sedu, she tells me the green light is intermittent, and has to move it just right to get it to stay on.</li>
            <li>It has a high heat setting which allows me to straighten my thick, curly, color-treated hair in only 10 minutes as opposed to 20 or more.      </li>
            <li>I have had it for a few months and it has not disappointed.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no coating on the plates that starts to flake off like you find on other irons, and I suspect it&#x27;s the sleek plates themselves that contribute to this product&#x27;s success.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too much for an iron, think about it as an investment in a iron that will last, not pull your hair, only requires a few passes (my hair is dry as well so for other textures it probably works even better!!)  </li>
            <li>This one is the same, older version as that one but a 1.5 inch.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to retouch it the next day as I did with my older iron.</li>
            <li>Not sure why this didn&#x27;t get a better overall review</li>
            <li>ordered the EXACT same item on Amazon, and it was shipped via a 3rd party -  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have tight curly hair, more of a loose S formation.</li>
            <li>For $150 flat iron it feels very lightweight, small, and cheap.  </li>
            <li>as I said, look at other reviews, they all say pretty much the same thing....</li>
            <li>I bought this back in high school, circa 2006.</li>
            <li>The only difference between the new Sedu and the old Sedu was the cord.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and moveable, but dry and gives me dents and creases very often.</li>
            <li>However, when I do opt for straight hair this thing never fails to tame my unruly mane.</li>
            <li>I only have to iron each strand once or twice (very slowly) to get it pin straight, and I&#x27;m able to do a good-sized chunk of hair at a time.</li>
            <li>The plates are so smooth, I&#x27;m really not sure how they did it.</li>
            <li>About 2 years ago the cord started to come apart because I&#x27;m pretty rough with it</li>
            <li>This straightner can take my full head of fluffy hair and straighten it within 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>This and the chi are the same, but I can&#x27;t get pin straight locks on MY hair- other people&#x27;s hair will come out poker straight (</li>
            <li>so when it finally died, I immediately set out to get a new one.</li>
            <li>Used it maybe ten times this year, bought brand stinking new.  </li>
            <li>I pay alot at the hair salon just to blow dry it straight, not to mention all that pulling hair they do.</li>
            <li>The green power light flickers, and the iron won&#x27;t stay on, therefore there&#x27;s not enough heat to straighten.  </li>
            <li>It only takes one swipe to get my hair bone straight, Solia it took around 3&lt;br /&gt;- Short time to straighten hair, Solia took about 10 min.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and smooth without leaving that icky brunt smell, it smells like the shampoo that you used after your done.</li>
            <li>finally they sent me another one that does the same thing, the light&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t flash when it is ready to use.</li>
            <li>I barely use it 2x a month!</li>
            <li>This is also WAY more work than I&#x27;m willing to do after buying such an expensive product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>Well I take good care of my stuff in general and especially for something expensive.  </li>
            <li>This is the 2nd Sedu I&#x27;ve purchased - the first was for myself, and the second for my younger sister.</li>
            <li>My friend has the same flat iron and it makes your hair shiny, stays styled all day, and heats up fast.</li>
            <li>One thing that I don&#x27;t particularly like is how long the cord is, it&#x27;s just always getting tangled.</li>
            <li>By the way my hair is right above my waist, very thick, and mildly wavy.</li>
            <li>I have a busy lifestyle and only use the Sedu occasionally, but its slim design makes it really easy to store and keep on hand, even in my really small house.</li>
            <li>Just for the fact that I&#x27;ve had two of the same exact product just stop working in the same way, makes these flat irons too unreliable.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is that the cord doesn&#x27;t swivel, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for this outstanding flat iron.</li>
            <li>I felt lost, but i had a new sedu flat iron that I never had used before, and I used it&lt;</li>
            <li>I bought a new flat iron and this one said it was at 400 degrees</li>
            <li>Slide the Sedu at a slow and steady pace on small sections of hair and you will see amazing results.</li>
            <li>Other units priced 50% or more less do the same thing, save money and consider a cheaper brand.</li>
            <li>and it definitely holds up (even to a two year old getting it out of the drawer and dropping it).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to go ahead and buy another Solia even though my Sedu is only a couple months old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the only review that says this by far.  </li>
            <li>This morning, the plates finally gave way completely, the handle</li>
            <li>I fixed the one purchased from ulta since it was outside of the two year warranty.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it with my eyes closed.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and this gets hot enough to straighten my hair thoroughly the first time.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so sure it&#x27;s the thin layer of ceramic</li>
            <li>Pricey, yes, but saving time and trouble is worth it.</li>
            <li>The box looked vaguely repackaged and there was no paperwork/instructions of any kind -- not in the product box, not in the wrapping box (not even a packing slip).</li>
            <li>My old cheap HerStyler would rarely work because it wouldn&#x27;t heat up all the way and when it did, it constantly shut off or cooled down so that my hair was only slightly less curly and not straight at all.</li>
            <li>After paying $10 to ship it to them and $10 to get it back and the 2 weeks that it took to get to them and back, I got a new one.  </li>
            <li>Works fast, heats up in seconds and has temperature control since I have sensitive hair and need less heat.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quickly less breakage and hair stays soft and straight all day.  </li>
            <li>We both have strong, coarse, thick hair and mine is frizzy, too.</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t really push down, you have to push down right under the plates</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t snag in the Sedu as in my old flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Flat irons I have used before have damaged the natural texture of my hair, this does not</li>
            <li>The high setting works amazingly on my long coarse hair without any burning.  </li>
            <li>my first one died after around 5 years, had to order another one right away, there is NO substitute.i have really thick, rough and frizzy hair ( if untreated)..</li>
            <li>It feels less expensive, maybe even &#x27;cheap&#x27;, because it is really light and doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of electronic controls.  </li>
            <li>my only complaint is it was supposed to come with a mounting device for free, and I called the company twice and never received it.     </li>
            <li>To describe my hair, it is pretty curly, somewhat coarse and dry, long and frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have also tried it on my natural African American hair, and again, the Sedu did not disappoint me.  </li>
            <li>Im AA with relaxed thin hair that was dead and damaged and it took me a year after buying this staightner to get it in good health,</li>
            <li>I love the wide plates for my long thick hair, the incredibly fast heat-up time, and the long cord!</li>
            <li>hair is very very shiny, a single pass, maybe 2 at the most and your done, I am a female of color I have long thick hair, in other words ETHNIC hair and</li>
            <li>My wife has been bugging me for a new flat iron because the one she had was crapping out (xxxxx beauty shop flat iron).</li>
            <li>Soft, shiny, straight hair that last until you wash it again is what you get when you use this little beauty.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly long hair -</li>
            <li>This is why you have to have the cord in a certain position, because that thin metal strip is being eaten away and it will only make contact when the rod is moved against it just right.</li>
            <li>This is why you have to have the cord in a certain position, because that thin metal strip is being eaten away and it will only make contact when the rod is moved against it just right.</li>
            <li>This really annoys me when I try to set it down.</li>
            <li>My hair type...long, very thick, wavy, very frizzy, and a lot of it (like Julia Roberts when she first came on the scene)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My previous flat irons were a Hot Tools one and a Bed Head.  </li>
            <li>It is not bad for your hair and causes less breakage then a lot of other irons out there.  </li>
            <li>It took me less than 5 minutes and my hair is straight and shiny.</li>
            <li>As someone cursed with extremely curly frizzy (caucasian) hair, I am very familar with flat irons.</li>
            <li>I naturally have thick wavy hair and this straightener does the job pretty well.  </li>
            <li>The flat iron is exceptional when it works but the problem is it that it is really expensive and it doesn&#x27;t last long enough to pay what they are asking for it.  </li>
            <li>It does claim to cut time straightening in half, which is not so much true for me other than the fact that I don&#x27;t have to continue straightening the same sections over and over.</li>
            <li>I was disappointed at how small it was at first, but what a joy to my shoulder.</li>
            <li>I soooo recommend this flat iron, NO OTHER WORKS THE SAME.</li>
            <li>No one can tell that I&#x27;m wearing extensions (I&#x27;ve had girls, both black and white comment on how long my  hair is and are surprised when I tell them that I&#x27;m wearing extensions) because of how perfectly straight this flat iron makes my hair.</li>
            <li>The green light would just turn off, and I would have to hold it in the most impossible angles just to have it start to heat up again.</li>
            <li>I decided enough is enough and took it apart which was no easy task, they are pretty well sealed up, but for the price and such short time of use I wasn&#x27;t going to throw it in the trash without trying.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> But sedu is insanely awesome.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!</li>
            <li> This straightener is probably the best straightener I have ever used.</li>
            <li> what that means, but whatever they did is awesome.</li>
            <li> It straightens it perfectly.</li>
            <li> has worked perfectly for 5 years?</li>
            <li> This product is awesome..</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and wear clip-in extensions (the ones that are marketed to Caucasians), this flatiron literally changes my hair texture to match the extensions PERFECTLY!</li>
            <li> This iron is the best!</li>
            <li> but I found that the fhi works best.</li>
            <li> in my quest for healthier, longer hair, I decided to try the sedu because of all the wonderful reviews and before and after pics I found on the web.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was the best of the best ....</li>
            <li> Best Flatiron I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> the best I have found,and I&#x27;ve tried them all..</li>
            <li> The Sedu is the best.  </li>
            <li> I was persuaded to spend the money because of the excellent reviews on the Folica website.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome straightener!</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> I am still using Biosilk serum and/or finishing spray since these work best on my hair giving silky results.  </li>
            <li> Not the best thing to happen the morning of graduation.  </li>
            <li> PERFECT!</li>
            <li> I thought this was one of the best hair straighteners I had ever purchased.</li>
            <li> AND I am very happy with it stillll.</li>
            <li> Best straightener ever made!</li>
            <li> very happy</li>
            <li> so I will update when this one hits a year to hopefully say it is still working wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that good!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy  about this.</li>
            <li> This is the best iron I have EVER used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Chi and even a GHD gold series and this is the best one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> However, for no reason and after perfect care, it stopped heating!</li>
            <li> So I would consider this a good product for relaxed hair!!</li>
            <li> But, when they do work I am told they are awesome.</li>
            <li> And the best part about it is its size.</li>
            <li> It is best for working mothers.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVED my Sedu!!!  </li>
            <li> and I was expecting results like my babyliss titanium pro (best iron).</li>
            <li> This straightener is AWESOME.  </li>
            <li> my roommate also ordered one and is very happy with hers...</li>
            <li> great people to order from!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  </li>
            <li> Great buy!</li>
            <li> very good quality product.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, if you get one that works.  </li>
            <li> , the sedu does not pull your hair it leaves and incredible shine</li>
            <li> The iron was as described- heating, great manageable size, and it gives a perfect finish.</li>
            <li> and he loved it!</li>
            <li> It gives me beautiful results</li>
            <li> and it works great.  </li>
            <li> not so great.</li>
            <li> If it doesn’t, I’ll happily return it.</li>
            <li> and my hair still looks great..</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is great, it looks sheek</li>
            <li> with the chi, while great, you have run the iron over you</li>
            <li> Great iron.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> amazing one of the best i have used</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> bought this for my girlfriend and it worked great for two months</li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> The swivel feature is great, but unless they fix the design</li>
            <li> It works great.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I know that this straightener would have been great, had it not been defective.</li>
            <li> I was happy with it</li>
            <li> It Looks great and hope it will work great.</li>
            <li> What a great iron.</li>
            <li> K, I LOVE IT!!  </li>
            <li> I went from getting my hair kind of looking good in about 50-60 minutes, to looking perfect in about 25 min.   </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still working AMAZINGLY well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> but this is amazing!  </li>
            <li> As people have noted, my 1st Sedu 1.5 was amazing - but eventually (3 years!)</li>
            <li> It smells good and works great with my Sedu.  </li>
            <li> but I was never 100% successful until I got this iron.</li>
            <li> JUST found my perfect heat setting, but I get too many fly-aways from this iron</li>
            <li> Have a nice day!</li>
            <li> Worked awesome for three years, more than what I thought my wife would get out of this.</li>
            <li> This is the best straightener that I have ever used - and believe me - I have tried many.  </li>
            <li> But if I was sure it was an excellent iron, for this reason I ordered it from Folica via Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is for sure the best hair straightener I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> and I loved it, so</li>
            <li> Sedu has been a good choice for me.</li>
            <li> I even use this to curl my hair, it is a 1.5 inch, but it makes gorgeous curls as well.</li>
            <li> The best part, though, is that is glides through your hair so smoothly without any pulling.</li>
            <li> This straightener is just as good as any straightener at target.</li>
            <li> so they still worked fairly well</li>
            <li> An investment in a good iron is intended to LESSEN the product usage.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a good buy, and I have never regretted purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 2 years and loved it.</li>
            <li> The reviews are really good</li>
            <li> loved my Solia but after 3 years the plates unattached.</li>
            <li> But I purchased it any way thinking maybe I would purchase a good one.</li>
            <li> ; Sedu for over 6 years with no issues and loved it.</li>
            <li> It is so good that I do not need any shine products to make my hair look shiny.</li>
            <li> Bought this iron because of all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> Loved it, heats well but now after 5 months this has quit working.</li>
            <li> I loved this straightener.</li>
            <li> It works good for awhile (maybe a year or so) and then it shorts out.  </li>
            <li> is good</li>
            <li> they are THAT good.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy transaction!</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and adjusts to the heat level that best suits your hair.</li>
            <li> reason I did not give this a better rating, was the cord issue that others had experienced.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so incredibly glad that I did because my hair feels like silk when I use this thing!</li>
            <li> The Babyliss feels amazing - great, sleek design with a good handle and smooth feel.  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Glad my online research paid off!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> I love this guy!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I tested it out immediately and love it!</li>
            <li> Okay I never write product reviews, but this thing is seriously AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Most important is that she has gone from hating her hair to loving it &#x3D; priceless.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> My daughter ordered one, and loved it, it heats up quick and works great...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> The plates are amazing.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair looks so amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing iron.  </li>
            <li> I had that kind of hair myself until about 5th grade.</li>
            <li> and I really really liked it</li>
            <li> It works ok - not as good as the chi and the tool doesn&#x27;t feel as posh as the chi.</li>
            <li> am going to be honest ..</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair really nice.  </li>
            <li> I liked how you turn the dial to set the temperature setting.  </li>
            <li> I really like it leaves my hair perfect.</li>
            <li> Nice feature prevents leaving the iron on.</li>
            <li> now that I got in the state that I was it I could tell how effective</li>
            <li> It is a really good straightener, but I found another that I like better.  </li>
            <li> You would NEVER know I had any kind of kink to my hair at all after I straighten it with the Sedu.</li>
            <li> use it just for my own use.</li>
            <li> the best feature of the Sedu is how fast (35-40 minutes)</li>
            <li> and this is the absolute best.</li>
            <li> My hair even stayed (almost) frizz free in the Houston August humidity - an amazing feet for my hair!</li>
            <li> Hope I helped some people make a good decision - choose something better :)    </li>
            <li> My original iron was amazing!  </li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t believe that there is anything else out there that&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> (even got my sister hooked to it) for years, and honestly I&#x27;ve opened my eyes to better options.</li>
            <li> used it on my all natural hair, and was so happy!!  </li>
            <li> that did ok, but never worked as well as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li> I liked this iron concept better than my GK D-600.  </li>
            <li> and I both love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> However, even with mostly straight, fine hair, I get the best results with the temp turned up most of the way.  </li>
            <li> The first one I had was great.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve read some great reviews online about this, and had recommendations from personal friends of how great this product is, I just rate it OK.</li>
            <li> Great product - works exactly as advertised and lasts for a while.</li>
            <li> Worked great at first then started to have issues heating up after a year.  </li>
            <li> This new model has an auto off feature which is very good from a safety perspective (will turn off after 30 minutes of non-use).</li>
            <li> This is great, does not burn my treated hair and is quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I hope to use the Sedu for many years to come and will bust it out on those occasions when I need or want beautiful straight hair.the Sedu for many years to come and will bust it out on those occasions when I need or want beautiful straight hair.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t super blown-away, maybe because a CHI is a good straightener too, but it works well.</li>
            <li> Do it once, do it right and enjoy your beautiful hair.    </li>
            <li> Have yet to try a better one (:</li>
            <li> I love the 1.5&amp;#34; plates.</li>
            <li> Finally, a friend of mine pointed me in the direction of the Sedu, which also had excellent reviews, and lots of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an hour or more to spend on my hair.</li>
            <li> Just as others have written (SHANTEC gives the best description), the cord will break internally where it connects to the body.  </li>
            <li> The manufacturer should be ashamed of this design which it surely knows about by now.  </li>
            <li> so I wanted to put in my two cents :)</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to many friends.</li>
            <li> I really LOVE that stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love this straightener.</li>
            <li> and I am really glad I got it.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser even said my hair was in better condition.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.   </li>
            <li> Have found most Ionic products are hype.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> She claims it works better then</li>
            <li> and if that&#x27;s the case, it&#x27;s OK in my book.</li>
            <li> but i love it</li>
            <li> did i mention that i love this product?? &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Magic</li>
            <li> It never took more than one pass to straighten my hair and it took me no time at all.</li>
            <li> I can remember more than one occasion when I forgot to turn it off</li>
            <li> slapped on this cheap iron!</li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars cuz it works for the most part.</li>
            <li> I like to hold my irons closer to the top, and this is a problem for anyone that isn&#x27;t planning to use this iron to curl/wave their hair as well.  </li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Sedu and I am still very happy.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> but the Sedu is a better iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely the best straightener I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything else I have ever used</li>
            <li> It has more than delivered the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener and have used this model ever since discovering it a number of years ago.</li>
            <li> telling me that I never used it, so she should be able to take it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a stylist and against my better judgement I ordered this brand I have never heard of on the reviews.  </li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell is 10x&#x27;s better, if I could</li>
            <li> Also, the tourmaline plates do seem to impart much more shine to my hair.  </li>
            <li> Love the Sedu.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it better than her Chi</li>
            <li> I also love that it is so light-weight.</li>
            <li> of these irons are way better than any drug store or discount store iron I have tried but over all the Solia is way better for me.</li>
            <li> I love this brand this straightener period.</li>
            <li> After days of reading reviews and searching, I purchased this product and am sooo satisfied....</li>
            <li> So I looked at many reviews and everywhere</li>
            <li> Should have looked into this \\&quot;cord problem\\&quot; more intently, even though its not a swivel cord anymore.</li>
            <li> I also really love the wider end.</li>
            <li> It straightens more of my hair at one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And if something happens to it, just write to the company, and they will replace it for free!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a better one yet, and I tried them all</li>
            <li> , you name it, from Revlon to Chi, Babyliss, Solia, and all top brands.</li>
            <li> plates to straighten more hair at once&lt;br</li>
            <li> do like how lightweight it is, and it seems to do an okay job straigening the hair.  </li>
            <li> But when I spring the extra cash for a product like this, it&#x27;s gotta multitask and work flawlessly.  </li>
            <li> I do love it</li>
            <li> Does anyone out there have a better recommendation?</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found one that works better than this and lasts longer, so I just keep buying it.  </li>
            <li> I wish they made it more durable.  </li>
            <li> It works ok but not as well as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I will be sure to get the warranty this time.....</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better than what folica.com sells it for.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better than what folica.com sells it for.</li>
            <li> , I was just expecting more considering the reviews I had read.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I would like to have more control over the heart settings.</li>
            <li> I hope that customers will be really satisfied by the performance of this hair straightener.</li>
            <li> but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I think it helps do more hair in a shorter time.</li>
            <li> Absoluety my favorite hair straightener on the market.  </li>
            <li> For the price, you get more quality than you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love my Sedu :)</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 years now and I am still in love.</li>
            <li> It works great, heats up very fast and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The day I discovered the ceramic flat iron was a happy day for me, indeed!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is the best.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best flat iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It was the best flat iron ever</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> this is the best flat iron my family</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a liscenced cosmetologist and this is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned period.</li>
            <li> and she thinks it is one of the best flat irons</li>
            <li> Excellent flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest flat iron you could ever ask for.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother looking for another/better flat iron - this one is the best!</li>
            <li> Best flat iron i have ever used!  </li>
            <li> Even when they were new and working great, the Chi and Solia straightners didn&#x27;t leave my hair as healthy looking as the Sedu has.</li>
            <li> This is the best Flat iron I have ever had!!!</li>
            <li> so it does pretty good job.</li>
            <li> This was the best $99 deal I&#x27;ve had in a long time</li>
            <li> It does the job perfectly, I don&#x27;t have to leave on my hair long, just glide it over</li>
            <li> It goes up to very hot levels and makes my hair silky smooth!!  </li>
            <li> This straightener is the best product I have bought in a very long time.</li>
            <li> It straightens perfectly and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it when my hair is fully dry, because it works best for me that way.</li>
            <li> this iron is amazing, even it burns out in a year its worth getting another</li>
            <li> This product worked great on my naturally frizzy and curly hair.  </li>
            <li> the light on it is so cute.. doesn&#x27;t pull or snag your hair.</li>
            <li> I have used way cheap irons at $50 that performed better than this.</li>
            <li> I like the Sedu&#x27;s smooth ceramic surface much better.</li>
            <li> I have always loved straight, sily-smooth hair.</li>
            <li> I tried a cheaper model that had good reviews on Amazon, but I found that my type of hair really needs a heavy-duty product with variable heat.</li>
            <li> Gotta say it lives my hair super straight, and my hair feels great.</li>
            <li> They both get very hot, the Babyliss maybe even more so...but the Sedu just seems to curl the hair better and straighten without heat damage like the Babyliss.  </li>
            <li> My hair is beautifully shiny and not dry, or frizzy</li>
            <li> Its a shame, as it is a great item, works well but a little more life expectancy would make this even better!</li>
            <li> It works best when I blow my hair out first and then go over it with this iron, but I can use it right on my curls and have them go pin straight.   </li>
            <li> but I already am hugely impressed with this product; my hair is straight, shiny, and soft.      </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend sitting it on any surface easily damaged by heat.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly, and yet, the heat does not damage my hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to grip and portable for travel.</li>
            <li> heat settings&lt;br /&gt;straightens easily and quickly&lt;</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong today.</li>
            <li> hair is long, wavy / curly and will not stay straight without a good straightener and good product - this did the trick!</li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;ve seriously never had more than 2 or 3 sentences to write in a review, if I even write one!</li>
            <li> The first is that part of the iron gets uncomfortably warm.</li>
            <li> I had really liked using the dryer - fast results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this iron for 3 years and it still works as good as new.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly which is important when rushing to get to work in the morning.</li>
            <li> The product seems to work fine</li>
            <li> The plates ade perfect size cuts time in half</li>
            <li> This was a fine product while it lasted, but now it&#x27;s a paper weight.</li>
            <li> it is super light weight!</li>
            <li> In short, this is a very good product, just don&#x27;t buy it on line if you expect adequate customer service.</li>
            <li> Great, easy to use, lightweight flat iron.</li>
            <li> Best I have ever used&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair soft and shiny, have used escape real other brands this is by far the best</li>
            <li> The heat output is spectacular, much hotter than any cheap straightener I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> I like how smooth my hair looks using my sedu.  </li>
            <li> This is more an issue with my memory than the product, but worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> It flattens my hair so fast and nicely.  </li>
            <li> Does not leave the hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> So I was straightening my hair this morning in my own apartment, getting ready for my \\&quot;grown-up job\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve been at for about a year now.</li>
            <li> This product is just cheap looking, cheap-made.</li>
            <li> Compared to my FHI, this iron was as light as a feather.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and silky and not frizzy at all.</li>
            <li> There is no indicator light to tell you when it reaches the temperature you have selected and does take a bit longer to get there than the Chi.  </li>
            <li> They make my hair feel really smooth.</li>
            <li> It does seem cheap when you look at it</li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> Perhaps that&#x27;s why it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> It is a great iron, but only plan to have it for a year.  </li>
            <li> The plate edges are straight rather than beveled, and clamp rather than float, so it does not glide through your hair without catching the ends and DOES leave impression marks.  </li>
            <li> Light won&#x27;t go on, no heat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really light in weight</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not comparable to cheap brands from drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li> This was a great iron when it worked, unfortunately it only lasted for 3 - 4 months.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it when I&#x27;ve worn my hair curly with some light</li>
            <li> a free return, as they sent me a defective item and</li>
            <li> When I received the straightener it felt like a cheap piece of plastic and did not straighten my hair at all.  </li>
            <li> It worked perfectly well, and always left my hair silky and straight.</li>
            <li> Good temperature control, nice and wide.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Great flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron.</li>
            <li> The Sedu is a great flat iron to purchase.</li>
            <li> My xwife&#x27;s Chi quit after a year, so we tried the Sedu... which works great for her long wavy hair, and she insists the heat output is far superior to any dept. store brands, and the difference is obvious.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> the top of it gets really hot</li>
            <li> totally worth the investment!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the cost!</li>
            <li> I truly believe sedu is an excellent company based on my past experience, but if you would like to buy a sedu iron, do so from elsewhere.</li>
            <li> BEWARE!I ordered this as a replacement to my original purchase (folica.com)</li>
            <li> Its worth every penny!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Trust me, it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> I contacted them to see if they will except an exchange although I do not have a receipt or the original packaging.  </li>
            <li> I am now about to buy another one of these in the hopes of the longevity that was originally provided.</li>
            <li> she was excited about the results she got with from this tool.</li>
            <li> Love it so much!</li>
            <li> Loved it - it is lightweight, easy to use, has variable heat settings which is important as it does not fry fine hair, but will also tackle thicker hair and it  left my hair smooth, frizz free and straight as could</li>
            <li> It was easy to use, quick - less than 10 minutes and good to go!</li>
            <li> like I said, it gives me excellent results, far better than any other brand.</li>
            <li> My hair looks super smooth and shiny after a Sedu pass...but somewhat fried after a Babyliss</li>
            <li> The Sedu should be able to reach temperatures of 410 degrees but even after 15 minutes was still only warm to the touch and didn&#x27;t seem to have  reached 150 degrees.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super light and compact.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how that worked out, but it&#x27;s very nice!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best flat iron we ever had.  </li>
            <li> Man were they right!</li>
            <li> Extremely Love my new straightener!!</li>
            <li> The iron its amazing the first month straight</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to buy this, either make sure you&#x27;re not forgetful, or be sure your renter&#x27;s / home owners&#x27;s insurance policy is up-to-date and covers fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All was good for almost three months when suddenly one morning, the Sedu would not turn on.</li>
            <li> After losing my beloved FHI Iron on a vacation, it was finally time for me to do my research and find another.</li>
            <li> I must say that the products is a dream come true.  </li>
            <li> After four years of good use (straightening every day), it finally stopped working or heating up as well.</li>
            <li> It was returned and a full refund issued by Amazon.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to be spending this much on an iron, might as well just go ahead and spend more on one that doesn&#x27;t have a breakage problem.</li>
            <li> somewhere such a good iron went to Amazon to purchase.</li>
            <li> And another one which brand is good at low price also.</li>
            <li> I am able to wear my hair straight or curly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Why are these \\&quot;professional\\&quot; hair irons only good for ~1 year?</li>
            <li> the best straight iron, hands down.  </li>
            <li> I thought I loved my previous straightener, but this one is tons better.</li>
            <li> It was costing me alot to have my hair professionally straighten at the salon, this is worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> Fortunately, Amazon is a stand-up company with unmatched customer service and made the situation right.</li>
            <li> My main goal was to keep my length and have it at least LOOK healthy, and this performed wonderfully to help me reach that</li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly and works really well!</li>
            <li> Great straightener, wouldn&#x27;t buy any other brand..</li>
            <li> I have used many straightening irons in the past and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because it had good reviews, but the plates are the smallest plates I&#x27;ve ever seen on a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I loved this flat iron until it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I had a Sedu flat iron for 9 years and loved it.</li>
            <li> It is extremely light, the large plate allows for faster straightening, and the edges do not tug at your hair!</li>
            <li> she said her hair was super soft and shiny and was pleased with how light in weight this tool was.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been very happy with this straightener, except that our second one in the last 10 months just broke.  </li>
            <li> but of course when you straighten you cannot keep super still and hope the cord will stay still!!You</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal sedu fan</li>
            <li> It heats quickly and works wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li> The straightener did not heat quickly as the Sedu should when received.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a couple of Chi&#x27;s and a Babyliss and the Sedu outperforms those tremendously.</li>
            <li> Works quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, holds its heat and can flatten hair effortlessly since it&#x27;s so lightweight.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointing for the price taf but worked great when it actually did work</li>
            <li> but it also makes it super shiny.</li>
            <li> it heats up super quickly and gets very hot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many high dollar hair straighteners</li>
            <li> After using typical Revlon and Connair products, it was nice to spend money on a product and actually get good results!</li>
            <li> My first Sedu broke on me after 5 months as well, but I had saved my receipt this time and had a free 1 year warranty from the website I bought it at.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is great for straightening hair but for me it did not keep my hair straight.</li>
            <li> But I had to express my love, yes LOVE, for this flat iron.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t need to be very hot either.</li>
            <li> Great flat iron, really does improve the feel and health of the hair.  </li>
            <li> You will never find yourself smelling a very hot plate, also it does not not ever burn your scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have owned many, many flat irons (</li>
            <li> /&gt;can get very hot to touch</li>
            <li> IMO there are other products out there deserving of the price tag on this one, and they do a lot better job.</li>
            <li> When I turn the iron to medium position or higher, the light blinks.</li>
            <li> I opted for the older version in lieu of the newer one because I liked my 1 inch so much.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Also, when I first bought it I wasn&#x27;t super excited about the price</li>
            <li> Also, when I first bought it I wasn&#x27;t super excited about the price</li>
            <li> to flat iron my hair (shoulder length) as it works incredibly fast and is very effective.</li>
            <li> My thinking is my problem is more a company that may not have sold me  a new product but a used one ;-(.</li>
            <li> new cord is what you are used to seeing on most blow dryers/lamps, etc.  </li>
            <li> small and compact but not as great as everyone says...doesn&#x27;t glide as smooth as T3 irons</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no stylist myself, so I value the fact that it&#x27;s really easy to use and fast, too.</li>
            <li> The sedu flat iron is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The way the cord is attached inside the flat iron is not the greatest and it can become disconnected inside (your flat iron will no longer work).</li>
            <li> It is light weight, with adjustable temperatures and perfect for my long hair, which is very dry and kinda frizzy.</li>
            <li> Ive tried many different flat iron&#x27;s, and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> my $40 hot tools got it straighter than this!</li>
            <li> years later I&#x27;m once again looking for something better!</li>
            <li> Sedu makes great products that live up to their standard!!  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews of how great this flat iron works, I had really high hopes.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair silky smooth and super straight.</li>
            <li> This straightener is great for my tight spiral curls.</li>
            <li> The design is a little boxy though but its a great product</li>
            <li> I called Exceon (maker of Sedu) and talked to a supervisor who told me in not so many words, that it was my tough luck and basically said that their product is great</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over how smooth and straight it is.  </li>
            <li> It makes the hair really silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> The Sedu leaves it smooth and straight.</li>
            <li> I had a Chi Turbo for years until it finally broke, and decided with all of the amazing reviews on this product I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> and it does such an amazing job.  </li>
            <li> A blow dryer, paddle brush, a bunch of time, and lots of product were not cutting it.</li>
            <li> Then again, it&#x27;s also able to reach really far</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It has - and it is worth every penny.     </li>
            <li> (and there&#x27;ve been a few), this is by far the best!</li>
            <li> Its worth it..</li>
            <li> I love it so far.   </li>
            <li> It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> and it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The only one I will ever own.</li>
            <li> Worth buying.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money, and</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that for the cost of this iron, that I got my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> and she didn&#x27;t know why I had so many problems and indicated that many people loved their product and that I must have done something wrong.  </li>
            <li> It snags my hair and really didn&#x27;t leave it as nice as my 5 year old Chi does.</li>
            <li> I feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I am speechless, it is extremely lightweight, ready to use in 20 seconds, easy to operate, results in shiny and healthy straight hair!!!!</li>
            <li> I can only imagine the good reviews are from people who have never owned a nice flat iron and upgraded from a cheap one.&lt;br /&gt;My 9 year old chi started losing its plates</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I was SUPER surprised that an iron could be this light!</li>
            <li> The flat irons worked well to straighten, and I loved how my hair looked, but they have flaws with the cord assembly, so don&#x27;t expect it to last more than a year or two.</li>
            <li> The iron gets super hot and there is no place to hold on to it without burning your hand.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is amazing.</li>
            <li> Major superior to cheap flat irons and worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have never tried another flat iron that provided the amazing heat and softness that this iron generates.</li>
            <li> I own this flat iron for about three years.</li>
            <li> a nice straightener, but someone told me that the Babyliss flat irons can beat the sedu</li>
            <li> I would think that if Folica had been hacked like they claimed, they would want to make the situation right with their customers.</li>
            <li> and I thought this product was going to be right for me.</li>
            <li> and also it is in right price range for me.</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m going to try the Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium iron and see if it doesn&#x27;t break within three months. -____-</li>
            <li> not rough on appliances either, I&#x27;ve had the same $25 Remington hair dryer for 9 years and it works great.</li>
            <li> I returned the first one because it was defective as the light is suppose to flash once the iron is ready to use</li>
            <li> For the price I paid, I would hope to get more than 2 years out of the item, but in my case, I barely got 18 months!</li>
            <li> I have owned this straightener for a little over six months and am still thrilled with it!</li>
            <li> It claims to use negative ions in your hair and make it beautiful or something, who knows.</li>
            <li> It is hands down THE BEST flat iron out there -</li>
            <li> This flat iron will leave your hair super smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several flat irons and my Sedu is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> The Sedu Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron Hair Straightener (1.5 inch) had good reviews and seemed like a good option for someone with thick and unruly hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and although I don&#x27;t turn the heat dial to the recommended setting, it has not dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> It works very well and quickly.</li>
            <li> My hair stayed straight, and was soft, manageable and also important - not fried!</li>
            <li> I can straighten my hair super fast and it leaves it shiny.</li>
            <li> I sent it back with the warranty and got another one because it really does do a nice job</li>
            <li> but it warms up super fast and does a fine/average job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She loved it but the iron developed an electrical short where the cord enters the iron.</li>
            <li> use this iron with a tension comb to get my hair super straight.  </li>
            <li> It came in the mail yesterday and today I washed, did a quick blow out and then tried this iron and was really dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to pay a little bit more for a product that&#x27;s more</li>
            <li> I was happy to see the temp went so high, because my hair won&#x27;t respond to anything less.</li>
            <li> If you are only interested in a short time using a great iron, and then spending the 100+ dollars again, then GET THIS IRON.      </li>
            <li> I was so upset as I wasn&#x27;t sure I would be able to purchase this same flat iron again, but luckily I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> also.. the blinking light and on/off switch and temp dial is located near at the hinge of the tool, rather than on the top side of one of the arms.. making it kind of hard to see at times.</li>
            <li> But the person I spoke with didn&#x27;t seem to know very much about the line she was representing and could give me no answers.</li>
            <li> thank you very much.  </li>
            <li> it sticks to my hair and pulls thank you very much</li>
            <li> I have always bought cheap flat irons and my hair never came out smooth</li>
            <li> my original was 72W and the new one is 45W.  </li>
            <li> It is very reliable, heats fast and stays clean.  </li>
            <li> This purchase is an exact rebuy.  </li>
            <li> Thank You so much!</li>
            <li> This iron was a gift from heaven when I first started using it .</li>
            <li> When I first did research on the sedu there were alot of reviews talking about the cord</li>
            <li> , right now my sedu won&#x27;t even turn on unless I swivel the cord a certain way .</li>
            <li> They are good for some light smoothing, but they do not have the heft to get thick hair truly straight.</li>
            <li> and I am pretty clueless when it comes to the \\&quot;How to...</li>
            <li> Compared to how well it works and the amount of time it can last, it is easily a better choice than a cheaper one in the stores.</li>
            <li> straightens, curls, leaves your hair soft and shines in the light.</li>
            <li> My first Sedu lasted almost five years</li>
            <li> My hair comes out smooth and soft in a fraction of the time it used to.  </li>
            <li> There was no temperature setting on the model I bought, and although results were similar, I would have to say the Sedu performed better.</li>
            <li> I was AMAZED the first day I got it..</li>
            <li> And even if it broke on me now, I would be willing to buy it again in a heartbeat.  </li>
            <li> My hair is incredibly soft and smooth after using the Sedu.  </li>
            <li> It takes me about 20 minutes because I have so much hair!</li>
            <li> Also, the plastic over the plates gets really hot</li>
            <li> the shipping was fast also!     </li>
            <li> First, I want to say to those who read this ..  </li>
            <li> I told her to try this first.</li>
            <li> Someone recommended this one...told me to make sure I buy the \\&quot;SEDU\\&quot; Brand only.</li>
            <li> Love the larger plate and how silky it leaves your hair!</li>
            <li> I had this straightener from ninth grade till the first year of college.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first 1 inch Sedu a couple of years ago and it shorted out after maybe 2 years of use.  </li>
            <li> Another reviewer said he took it apart to find the problem and he thinks it was the cord assembly inside, which showed him exactly why the iron wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> The 30 second warmup is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Authentic SEDU products are only sold through authorized distributors, listed under Where To Buy.</li>
            <li> The only way to guarantee a SEDU product is authentic is to buy from an authorized distributor.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t get nearly as hot (though turned up all the way)..  </li>
            <li> Chi &amp; Solia were my last ones) and this one is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li> By twisting my hand back and forth throughout the length, I am able to get a wavy / pseudo-curly look, though nowhere as controlled or intentional looking as with the CHI (the curls seem to fall where they wish).  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted over a year then conked out on me and wouldn&#x27;t turn on (don&#x27;t know why??)</li>
            <li> I got my first sedu about four years ago (the first one, that is).</li>
            <li> this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I would spend the extra money to get a better product that won&#x27;t die within the year of purchasing it.</li>
            <li> My daughter only uses it a couple times a week so its more like a couple months of usage.</li>
            <li> but I wish I looked at it in the store first.</li>
            <li> Anyway, when I saw the cord assembly inside it showed me exactly why the iron wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> If I was to start out again, I would find a reputable local dealer with an acceptable return policy and buy it there.  </li>
            <li> my first two broke within two years.  </li>
            <li> It does get hot fast and cool fast when you turn it off</li>
            <li> I had the first one for about 3 years and used it almost every day.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted 2 years and would of made it longer</li>
            <li> So the bottom line is this: it&#x27;s a great hair straightener for a little while, until it breaks, and you have to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also heating up quickly - so would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> When you first look at the price it is kind of expensive but for as muh use as I have gotten out of it it is for sure worth it!</li>
            <li> Amazingly quick to heat, silky smooth to use and simple to store.</li>
            <li> Love, the product.. wide plates and quick straightening.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before buying this flat iron since the price tag was higher than the ones you find at retail stores, but I have to admit I&#x27;m glad I purchased this item.   </li>
            <li> I am an African American woman and I have never been able to get my hair as straight as I am able to do now, not even when going to the salon.  </li>
            <li> ; on it - it still heats up quickly, stays at the right temperature (though you do sometimes need to wait 10-20 seconds for it to get back to your desired heat after a few chunks of hair have been straightened), and it straightens my hair very nicely.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything about the longevity of the product since I only got my iron about a month ago, but I certainly hope it lasts more than a year...</li>
            <li> First of all, it snagged my hair like cheap flat irons do whereas my old sedu ran through my hair so smoothly and rarely ever ripped a hair out.</li>
            <li> I guess this flat iron is ok.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this flat iron</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I just love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> and I was no longer able to use this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Sedu is suppose to be a top brand of flat irons and this does not seem to match up.  </li>
            <li> PROUD BLACK!!!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> Lesson learned: if you have REALLY thick/wavy hair, steer clear of cheap flat-irons.</li>
            <li> I love straight hair on a female.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine was using a different brand, which was good, but she had been thinking about buying a wider one of the same brand.</li>
            <li> Another great thing about this flat iron, is it keeps my hair straight all day long.  </li>
            <li> One of the plates has been held in place by 3 edges for a year now, but it still works just fine other than making a light rattle noise.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I purchased a second one because the first one got a short in the wire after I had it for a while.  </li>
            <li> If it was humind, or raining, my hair frizzed right up, and it never stayed straight for the whole day.  </li>
            <li> I have super fine and very long hair</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it doesn&#x27;t have an auto off feature, but other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> For this price you buy a better and long life iron.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair (not ringlets but very curly) and because of this straightner everyone thinks I have straight hair!</li>
            <li> They get hot- fast.</li>
            <li> Far superior to Chi or any other brand I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The slight curve in the handle makes it easy and comfortable to hold.     </li>
            <li> Really, after using several brands of flat irons, including Solano and CHI, I can say with certainty that the Sedu gave me superior results and was also easier and quicker to use.</li>
            <li> I was able to shower, blow dry, and straighten my hair all in under one hour.      </li>
            <li> Feels cheaply made and you can&#x27;t hold onto the outside of the ironing area to do curls because it gets to hot.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so straight and smooth and it stays that way all day, which is a miracle since my hair is thick and frizzes very easily.</li>
            <li> AM 100%, PURE, UNTOUCH, GRADE A, PUREBREED, CERTIFIED, PANTENT-PENDED</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, my advice would be to buy it if you are looking for something new, something that will help straighten and maintain your hair until the next wash, and help it to feel silkier, softer and keep it fairly healthy, I would insist you try the Sedu.</li>
            <li> I ordered a new one right away.  </li>
            <li> Does an ok Job but not as good as other sedu flat irons which i also purchased at the same time which I give a 5 star.</li>
            <li> The main reason I love this flat iron so much is because it causes minimal breakage/damage and leaves your hair looking really healthy.</li>
            <li> However, after plugging it in for first time use it would not heat up to high temperatures.</li>
            <li> Most important to me was if it was hard on my hair</li>
            <li> Although this has been the best flat iron I have ever used, I will not purchase another and suggest that you do not waste your money on this as it doesn&#x27;t last long!</li>
            <li> Even at the salon it took the stylist over an hour to blow my hair out, and the finished product was not as straight as I wanted it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to go over my hair a million times to get it straight.</li>
            <li> I like the iron so much because I really need to find another brand.  </li>
            <li> , I just feel it doesn&#x27;t take away the frizz as much as I think it should.</li>
            <li> but I thought that if it really works as well as everyone is saying, then it would pay itself off in no time.</li>
            <li> , It gets my hair straight and it somewhat tames frizz.</li>
            <li> The CHI does get my hair poker straight, but it leaves my ends fried, so I don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> straight-</li>
            <li> It heats up much faster and leaves my hair shiny and sleek.</li>
            <li> With the Sedu, my hair is still straight when I go to bed.</li>
            <li> Did not work, I&#x27;ve used a real sedu and this is not it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times, it didn&#x27;t hurt my hair at all, but the thing with the light makes me worry.</li>
            <li> I do recommend being careful not to drop it too many times since the edge that holds the plate can break and loosen it a bit.</li>
            <li> The hair came out bone straight, just the way I like it.  </li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> In this case you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I am really scared to buy another one..</li>
            <li> it heats fast but doesn&#x27;t straighten in one stroke.  </li>
            <li> My hair stayed straight for days in the Florida humidity, with the Sedu</li>
            <li> This warning comes straight from the Sedu official site, I would be very weary of purchasing this item from an unauthorized vendor.....</li>
            <li> Because it is so lightweight it makes straightening my hair much easier.  </li>
            <li> It is made really lightweight...</li>
            <li> straight.</li>
            <li> It saves so much time to straighten your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely getting another one.</li>
            <li> and it takes me about 20 minutes to do my whole head.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time on how straight and shiny my hair is.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> and this works much faster.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> Within five minutes, I have a glossy straight finish.  </li>
            <li> This iron worked very well for about 4 months.</li>
            <li> I really want the Sedu to work for me --</li>
            <li> Heats up fast.</li>
            <li> The light flickered on and off and it did not heat up properly.</li>
            <li> I then used epoxy to carefully secure the wires into the assembly and the rest of the unit back together.</li>
            <li> I felt that this was wasteful, however, I am readily buying another one.</li>
            <li> for 80 you really can&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
            <li> PIN STRAIGHT</li>
            <li> After using this her hair is sleek and straight.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li> I am very dissatisfied with this whole process.</li>
            <li> She is a beautician and wants this for her work.</li>
            <li> VERY DISSAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> I also love the wide plates.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> You have to be gentle with the cord though - no yanking at all.</li>
            <li> IMO, this works far better than Chi (which I used prior to purchasing Sedu).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and does an amazing job in closing the hair cuticle on my damaged, chemically treated, thin hair.</li>
            <li> ; Remington flat iron for nearly eight years before it shorted out (pretty good for a $25 flat iron).  </li>
            <li> After letting a few of my friends use it they have purchased their own.</li>
            <li> At first I was using it at the highest setting, but my hair was getting a little dry, so I lowered the temp and got great results</li>
            <li> With all these great reviews, I have to wonder what I’m missing with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I had one of these flat irons for a few years and it worked great.</li>
            <li> I love the results, straight, sleek, shiny hair that I always admired on models and movie stars, in minutes without chemicals or other unnatural things.</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s more of a me issue than a Sedu issue, if I went to any other brand it would still take forever just because of how much hair I have).</li>
            <li> It glides over the hair so nicely without tugging, has very minimal damage, and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair super smooth and in less time.</li>
            <li> I also use \\&quot;Loreal Hot Straight\\&quot; too to give it a little bit more protection from the heat</li>
            <li> So, after many failed hair straighteners in the past, I decided to give it another try and go for what the critics (in the Inet and hair salons) all called \\&quot;the best of the best\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews on this product and other products similiar to it before deciding on the Sedu.  </li>
            <li> But one day, after about 14 months of normal usage, IT CAUGHT ON FIRE IN MY HAND!</li>
            <li> The only reason I am on my second one is because I let my first Sedu fall off the dresser too many times and the hinge eventually broke and</li>
            <li> The first day this iron was like wow!</li>
            <li> My original Sedu lasted over 2.5 years and finally just crapped out.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was very happy the first time I used a modern ceramic flat iron and acquired one as soon as I could afford</li>
            <li> This is the second time in the past 3 years that we have ordered this product and it is great every time.</li>
            <li> I had always used cheap ones in the past and I can tell a huge difference with the Sedu.</li>
            <li> Hai, I m gethu sakthi wife, This is first time ,I have trouble to choose which one good for my hair for straighter or flat iron Or anything else ?.</li>
            <li> Usually it takes about 3 times going over my own strands of hair with a flat iron just to get it straight, and it&#x27;s not even shiny or silky smooth, but with the Sedu, I have been able to finish doing my hair in half the time I used to because all it takes it one run through each piece.</li>
            <li> There’s nothing special here, especially for the $100 price tag.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really feel that it works any better than the $30 straightener I previously had bought from Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> I noticed if you part every small section and take your time your results will be amazing all in all this iron</li>
            <li> I tried everything to starighten my hair, even the old fashion \\&quot;hot comb on the stove\\&quot; routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely lazy at that kind of stuff, returning within the X day window, etc</li>
            <li> iron also seems to direct heat towards the scalp first.  </li>
            <li> i end up buying a new one every year or two - but that&#x27;s more due to my clumsiness rather than the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> And after 3-4 years of use, it still works as if it&#x27;s new!</li>
            <li> She said I went a whole year trying to grow my relaxer out, just to get a new relaxer.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who would love to have soft, shiny and very straight hair in so little time.</li>
            <li> The iron is lightweight and easy to manage -- I don&#x27;t have to use both hands on the iron to hold it to keep it closed or to support the weight.     </li>
            <li> Bought 2nd one because I love this iron but for the money does not last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m frustrated because otherwise, I love this iron - but if it won&#x27;t heat, it doesn&#x27;t do you a lot of good.</li>
            <li> In order to make this work, I have to hold it in just one particular way</li>
            <li> Use a good brush to blow dry, just to get completely dry and soft.</li>
            <li> and I get a phone call from my older sister</li>
            <li> the older</li>
            <li> -- maybe it was the particular one I&#x27;ve been using (both times I&#x27;ve purchased the Pro).</li>
            <li> I have super kinky coarse hair and have tried all kinds of straightening methods and products.</li>
            <li> I was a happy spokesperson, and after three form me, three from friends and family that followed suit, I can say SEDU SUCKS!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and she says, \\&quot;Well, you got that  when you were a sophomore in high school</li>
            <li> highly recommend this for anyone looking for a high end hair straightner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> love this flat iron i cant believe i didnt know about it earlier</li>
            <li> Today I phoned Sedu directly to see if the company&#x27;s other models are more durable</li>
            <li> I missed my beautiful flat ironed hair, but was wary to spend that kind of money for a product with such a short lifespan.</li>
            <li> Heats yup super fast and you can straighten your hair much faster then a lot of other brands</li>
            <li> Seven years of silky, soft, beautifully straight hair.</li>
            <li> Naturally, my hair is very frizzy and poofy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Easier to clean, Sedu just a wipe with a dry cloth, Solia needed a cleaning iron solution</li>
            <li> /&gt;Exceon does not tolerate counterfeit sales of its products and shall seek legal action against those involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sedu products are held to the highest industry standards for quality and safety.</li>
            <li> I have read that many customers have had trouble getting their straighteners replaced by Farouk (makers of Chi)</li>
            <li> To top it all off, I only bought it in June and it completely stopped working mid March.</li>
            <li> The Sedu is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I would say this product is only worth  </li>
            <li> With my Remington, it took approximately 30 minutes to straighten from start to finish and with the Sedu, it takes a good hour (no exaggeration).  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and with this iron I get smooth straight hair in less than 30 minutes!</li>
            <li> This is my fourth flat iron -- one was good, two were bad, and this one seems great so far.  </li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter wanted a really good flat iron since she irons her hair everyday....</li>
            <li> Again, Folica paid for the shipping there and back, but I didn&#x27;t send it in right away again</li>
            <li> I live in a high humidity area and this straightener combined with the right styling products leaves my hair looking good for a few days with only minimal touch ups and damage.</li>
            <li> It worked fine at first, but no better than a Chi you could buy at Ulta with a coupon.</li>
            <li> I was using the highest setting since my old iron never got hot enough no matter how much I tried.  </li>
            <li> It glides through the hair like none other and feels fantastic.</li>
            <li> Lesson learned; just because something is more expensive, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s better quality or does a better job.</li>
            <li> leaves my hair ultra smooth and extremely shiny.</li>
            <li> My other irons didn&#x27;t seem to mind too much, but this iron seems to direct heat downwards first, so you do feel that burn and really can&#x27;t get very close to your scalp if it&#x27;s at all damp.  </li>
            <li> The new Sedu&#x27;s cord does not swivel.</li>
            <li> But they sent me a new one</li>
            <li> I live in Florida</li>
            <li> I would of got Paul Mitchell which I had been using for 10 years but decided to try something new.</li>
            <li> I got a new one and it lasted a year and ended up not turning on again for no reason what so ever one day.</li>
            <li> Would recommend for someone who doesn&#x27;t mind buying a brand new one every year.</li>
            <li> I wish it had an automatic shut off, but I will live with it.</li>
            <li> Now i HAVE A NEW ONE</li>
            <li> I needed a new iron after my</li>
            <li> (plus I used to find that my hair would get caught on the edge), so I decided to try a new brand.</li>
            <li> I immediately bought a new one.</li>
            <li> New cord, new plug, new hope.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> So when I began my search for a new iron, I decided to go &amp;#34;all-out&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> have continued to use the iron, thinking that styling time would reduce as I got acclimated to my new iron; but to no avail.  </li>
            <li> and I got a new one.  </li>
            <li> Well I got the new one and this one passed the 3 month mark and made it to 4 months.  </li>
            <li> the new iron looks</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t imagine and contemplating returning and getting a new chi</li>
            <li> When I went back to work from the weekend, my coworkers all commented on how much longer my hair looked (because it was truly straight).  </li>
            <li> Chi and Solia flat irons both died on me right after their year anniversaries</li>
            <li> This flat iron got amazing reviews, so I was excited to try this on my thick, coarse and wavy hair (not even curly)</li>
            <li> The plates are soft and the iron is high quality.</li>
            <li> It does get hot and I haven&#x27;t had any technical problems with it</li>
            <li> I had this same exact model before, three years ago.</li>
            <li> I heats up in minutes and it gets plenty HOT at only the halfway setting!  </li>
            <li> This flat iron seemd to great for those with thin hair or finer hair.</li>
            <li> Well, until this morning, of course, but that&#x27;s completely unrelated!</li>
            <li> I tried to love it, but honestly it&#x27;s not better than a $60 iron-</li>
            <li> - her natural hair is frizzy hot-roller-curls from the 80&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> It did not get nearly hot enough</li>
            <li> and this one did the same exact thing.  </li>
            <li> I was in the middle of doing my hair and noticed it wasn&#x27;t hot anymore and realized even though it was supposed to be on it</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just very simple looking and not flashy</li>
            <li> The hot iron element didn&#x27;t heat up properly.</li>
            <li> Just not the same as my first one.</li>
            <li> I have purchased sooooo many flat irons for the past few years, and this one by far is my favorite!  </li>
            <li> (This happened to me one year into my first Sedu; I&#x27;ve now had this current one for three years).</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> Each time it seemed that a wire shorted out and if you do some research you&#x27;ll find that others had the exact same problem.  </li>
            <li> guess it&#x27;s my fault for not researching that prior to buying, but the business selling these are well aware of that.  </li>
            <li> I actually never heard of the brand of  sedu until I asked a co-work how she gets her hair so perfectly straight!</li>
            <li> I have used so many other iron such as chi, hsi, con air, Remington, baby bliss,  etc</li>
            <li> it gets HOT, it does do nice curls and waves that last a little longer than usual, but it&#x27;s not intended to stay super</li>
            <li> So, this was my first high end flat iron, and I can&#x27;t believe three years ago I threw away a 1.5 \\&quot; sedu because of a cord problem!!</li>
            <li> no other straighteners would do it justice and even if was able to straighten my hair with any other straightening iron, it wont last for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> My previous good iron (a different brand) eventually had the electrical problem that others are referring to in their reviews (a problem in the swivel connection) and I hope that for this price, that this one lasts just as long as that one did.</li>
            <li> over all makes my very curly hair very straight with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind buying a new one frequently, then you should get this one.  </li>
            <li> It works fine now, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Good for thick and long hair.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron, it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing....</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron because I had always had extremely positive results with sedu in the past (much better than chi and others).</li>
            <li> (it is a huge, puffy mess when done).</li>
            <li> first flat iron I had was great--while it lasted, which was for about a year.</li>
            <li> I live in the very humid deep South, which doesn&#x27;t help the situation.</li>
            <li> It lasted a long time, after much use, and we were able to get the same one again for the same low price.</li>
            <li> I can straighten large sections with only two to three repeats per section.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> All I do is add a little chi silk infusion and my hair is silky, smooth, and bouncy.</li>
            <li> so it really does not flat iron hair</li>
            <li> so if you use your other hand to help push them or roll it thru the hair, it can be hot - not a big deal but worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> It was working fine for few days,  but then after it stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> Did not make my hair as straight and smooth as flat iron I have for less money.</li>
            <li> I want to make it clear that I&#x27;ve purchased 3 of these from Folica.com, who is an authorized dealer of Sedu.</li>
            <li> It was used as a back-up to my old faithful 1-inch ceramic flatiron that I&#x27;ve had for about five years</li>
            <li> My hair feels silky soft after each use.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try the Chi just for kicks, and after owning it for 1 week it has completely stopped working.</li>
            <li> , I was like wow all this hair is suppose to straighten out with this..</li>
            <li> and my hair is soo bounce and soft..</li>
            <li> Never had any complaints until they start getting old, the plates start to come undone and pull the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not so much curly, but wavy and as if every hair is going in a different direction.  </li>
            <li> Flattens, straightens and smooths hair leaving it shiny and soft..</li>
            <li> I use mine heavily, nearly every day.</li>
            <li> went natural about a year ago.</li>
            <li> I have hair up to my butt and it took only about 20 minutes to get my hair perfectly straight.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been reliable thus far.</li>
            <li> I do miss the swivel cord from my Chi, but it was simply causing too much breakage compared to this Sedu.  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t get near the number of split ends I did before either.</li>
            <li> Within  3 weeks of receipt of the item it quit working completely, there are lots of reports of counterfeit items out there which makes me think this could have been one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to damage our hair so far (had it a couple months).</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind it so much if I didn&#x27;t have to keep straightening my hair (sometimes 3 extra times a day).</li>
            <li> It has worked wonders on my naturally curly hair, even during the summer</li>
            <li> But that is far from the truth.  </li>
            <li> so I guess it should not have surprised me.</li>
            <li> I should get another one just because its so old and</li>
            <li> I have very unruly mixed chick hair and it gets my hair silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair looks soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;nothing else so far.....</li>
            <li> and this makes my hair so shinny and soft..</li>
            <li> our old one did pay for itself saving us money on professional styling.</li>
            <li> Also, like the fact the company offers a 1 year warranty on it.</li>
            <li> I probably should have gotten the smaller size for now, but this one does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and thanks to Lashauna D. Willis&#x27; review as it helped me in my decision..</li>
            <li> While I did have to go over each piece 3 or 4 times, my hair did turn out shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> Unexpectedly the cord stopped working</li>
            <li> The sedu has multiple settings, heats up fast and makes my hair feel silky.</li>
            <li> My hair seem to be soft and shiny after I use it to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> Tonight I bought an updated version of my old Remington (S-9620) with 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and this is the only straightener that makes my hair sleek and stick straight.  </li>
            <li> But Completely my fault not the products.</li>
            <li> worth every penny I spent.</li>
            <li> Wait an extra month or two if you must, to save the extra cash because it is WORTH the wait.     </li>
            <li> I think it is important that you use some type of heat protectant for your hair, and as many other reviewers stated, the body of the iron does get hot, but as long as you are a little careful it shouldn&#x27;t cause any issues.</li>
            <li> First of all, there seemed to be a slight gap in between the plates, so I felt like it didnt have the ability to press my hair straight.</li>
            <li> really miss the absence of a spring, because how I used to curl hair with the CHI</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay hot for very long.</li>
            <li> So I would definitely recommend this straightener to anyone who&#x27;s serious about just having nice hair, not having a hassle every time they need to get ready in the morning, and who wants a flat iron that will last them for a while.&lt;br /&gt;oh</li>
            <li> With my old flat irons, my hair would be straight when I was finished, but within an hour</li>
            <li> after 9 months of every other day use of the Sedu, she tells me the green light is intermittent, and has to move it just right to get it to stay on.</li>
            <li> It has a high heat setting which allows me to straighten my thick, curly, color-treated hair in only 10 minutes as opposed to 20 or more.      </li>
            <li> I have had it for a few months and it has not disappointed.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no coating on the plates that starts to flake off like you find on other irons, and I suspect it&#x27;s the sleek plates themselves that contribute to this product&#x27;s success.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too much for an iron, think about it as an investment in a iron that will last, not pull your hair, only requires a few passes (my hair is dry as well so for other textures it probably works even better!!)  </li>
            <li> This one is the same, older version as that one but a 1.5 inch.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to retouch it the next day as I did with my older iron.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this didn&#x27;t get a better overall review</li>
            <li> ordered the EXACT same item on Amazon, and it was shipped via a 3rd party -  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have tight curly hair, more of a loose S formation.</li>
            <li> For $150 flat iron it feels very lightweight, small, and cheap.  </li>
            <li> as I said, look at other reviews, they all say pretty much the same thing....</li>
            <li> I bought this back in high school, circa 2006.</li>
            <li> The only difference between the new Sedu and the old Sedu was the cord.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and moveable, but dry and gives me dents and creases very often.</li>
            <li> However, when I do opt for straight hair this thing never fails to tame my unruly mane.</li>
            <li> I only have to iron each strand once or twice (very slowly) to get it pin straight, and I&#x27;m able to do a good-sized chunk of hair at a time.</li>
            <li> The plates are so smooth, I&#x27;m really not sure how they did it.</li>
            <li> About 2 years ago the cord started to come apart because I&#x27;m pretty rough with it</li>
            <li> This straightner can take my full head of fluffy hair and straighten it within 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> This and the chi are the same, but I can&#x27;t get pin straight locks on MY hair- other people&#x27;s hair will come out poker straight (</li>
            <li> so when it finally died, I immediately set out to get a new one.</li>
            <li> Used it maybe ten times this year, bought brand stinking new.  </li>
            <li> I pay alot at the hair salon just to blow dry it straight, not to mention all that pulling hair they do.</li>
            <li> The green power light flickers, and the iron won&#x27;t stay on, therefore there&#x27;s not enough heat to straighten.  </li>
            <li> It only takes one swipe to get my hair bone straight, Solia it took around 3&lt;br /&gt;- Short time to straighten hair, Solia took about 10 min.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and smooth without leaving that icky brunt smell, it smells like the shampoo that you used after your done.</li>
            <li> finally they sent me another one that does the same thing, the light&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t flash when it is ready to use.</li>
            <li> I barely use it 2x a month!</li>
            <li> This is also WAY more work than I&#x27;m willing to do after buying such an expensive product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> Well I take good care of my stuff in general and especially for something expensive.  </li>
            <li> This is the 2nd Sedu I&#x27;ve purchased - the first was for myself, and the second for my younger sister.</li>
            <li> My friend has the same flat iron and it makes your hair shiny, stays styled all day, and heats up fast.</li>
            <li> One thing that I don&#x27;t particularly like is how long the cord is, it&#x27;s just always getting tangled.</li>
            <li> By the way my hair is right above my waist, very thick, and mildly wavy.</li>
            <li> I have a busy lifestyle and only use the Sedu occasionally, but its slim design makes it really easy to store and keep on hand, even in my really small house.</li>
            <li> Just for the fact that I&#x27;ve had two of the same exact product just stop working in the same way, makes these flat irons too unreliable.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is that the cord doesn&#x27;t swivel, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for this outstanding flat iron.</li>
            <li> I felt lost, but i had a new sedu flat iron that I never had used before, and I used it&lt;</li>
            <li> I bought a new flat iron and this one said it was at 400 degrees</li>
            <li> Slide the Sedu at a slow and steady pace on small sections of hair and you will see amazing results.</li>
            <li> Other units priced 50% or more less do the same thing, save money and consider a cheaper brand.</li>
            <li> and it definitely holds up (even to a two year old getting it out of the drawer and dropping it).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to go ahead and buy another Solia even though my Sedu is only a couple months old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the only review that says this by far.  </li>
            <li> This morning, the plates finally gave way completely, the handle</li>
            <li> I fixed the one purchased from ulta since it was outside of the two year warranty.</li>
            <li> I really recommend it with my eyes closed.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this gets hot enough to straighten my hair thoroughly the first time.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so sure it&#x27;s the thin layer of ceramic</li>
            <li> Pricey, yes, but saving time and trouble is worth it.</li>
            <li> The box looked vaguely repackaged and there was no paperwork/instructions of any kind -- not in the product box, not in the wrapping box (not even a packing slip).</li>
            <li> My old cheap HerStyler would rarely work because it wouldn&#x27;t heat up all the way and when it did, it constantly shut off or cooled down so that my hair was only slightly less curly and not straight at all.</li>
            <li> After paying $10 to ship it to them and $10 to get it back and the 2 weeks that it took to get to them and back, I got a new one.  </li>
            <li> Works fast, heats up in seconds and has temperature control since I have sensitive hair and need less heat.  </li>
            <li> Heats up quickly less breakage and hair stays soft and straight all day.  </li>
            <li> We both have strong, coarse, thick hair and mine is frizzy, too.</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t really push down, you have to push down right under the plates</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t snag in the Sedu as in my old flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Flat irons I have used before have damaged the natural texture of my hair, this does not</li>
            <li> The high setting works amazingly on my long coarse hair without any burning.  </li>
            <li> my first one died after around 5 years, had to order another one right away, there is NO substitute.i have really thick, rough and frizzy hair ( if untreated)..</li>
            <li> It feels less expensive, maybe even &#x27;cheap&#x27;, because it is really light and doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of electronic controls.  </li>
            <li> my only complaint is it was supposed to come with a mounting device for free, and I called the company twice and never received it.     </li>
            <li> To describe my hair, it is pretty curly, somewhat coarse and dry, long and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have also tried it on my natural African American hair, and again, the Sedu did not disappoint me.  </li>
            <li> Im AA with relaxed thin hair that was dead and damaged and it took me a year after buying this staightner to get it in good health,</li>
            <li> I love the wide plates for my long thick hair, the incredibly fast heat-up time, and the long cord!</li>
            <li> hair is very very shiny, a single pass, maybe 2 at the most and your done, I am a female of color I have long thick hair, in other words ETHNIC hair and</li>
            <li> My wife has been bugging me for a new flat iron because the one she had was crapping out (xxxxx beauty shop flat iron).</li>
            <li> Soft, shiny, straight hair that last until you wash it again is what you get when you use this little beauty.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly long hair -</li>
            <li> This is why you have to have the cord in a certain position, because that thin metal strip is being eaten away and it will only make contact when the rod is moved against it just right.</li>
            <li> This is why you have to have the cord in a certain position, because that thin metal strip is being eaten away and it will only make contact when the rod is moved against it just right.</li>
            <li> This really annoys me when I try to set it down.</li>
            <li> My hair type...long, very thick, wavy, very frizzy, and a lot of it (like Julia Roberts when she first came on the scene)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My previous flat irons were a Hot Tools one and a Bed Head.  </li>
            <li> It is not bad for your hair and causes less breakage then a lot of other irons out there.  </li>
            <li> It took me less than 5 minutes and my hair is straight and shiny.</li>
            <li> As someone cursed with extremely curly frizzy (caucasian) hair, I am very familar with flat irons.</li>
            <li> I naturally have thick wavy hair and this straightener does the job pretty well.  </li>
            <li> The flat iron is exceptional when it works but the problem is it that it is really expensive and it doesn&#x27;t last long enough to pay what they are asking for it.  </li>
            <li> It does claim to cut time straightening in half, which is not so much true for me other than the fact that I don&#x27;t have to continue straightening the same sections over and over.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed at how small it was at first, but what a joy to my shoulder.</li>
            <li> I soooo recommend this flat iron, NO OTHER WORKS THE SAME.</li>
            <li> No one can tell that I&#x27;m wearing extensions (I&#x27;ve had girls, both black and white comment on how long my  hair is and are surprised when I tell them that I&#x27;m wearing extensions) because of how perfectly straight this flat iron makes my hair.</li>
            <li> The green light would just turn off, and I would have to hold it in the most impossible angles just to have it start to heat up again.</li>
            <li> I decided enough is enough and took it apart which was no easy task, they are pretty well sealed up, but for the price and such short time of use I wasn&#x27;t going to throw it in the trash without trying.</li>
            <li> and my hair is naturally straight with just a slight wave to it!</li>
            <li> I am switching brands, buying anything worth over $100 that breaks in less then two months is not worth another try.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally super wavy, thick, and long.</li>
            <li> she has thick super wavy, long hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about paying this much for a flat iron, but once I tried it I realized it was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I flat ironed my african american kinky hair and it did a sub par job.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd flat iron I have bought in the last year - the wiring in the cord keeps breaking.  </li>
            <li> My original cord was a heavy duty round type (which might account for why it lasted</li>
            <li> THIS ONE far exceeds the other two.......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used sedu flat irons for the last 5 years.</li>
            <li> I got the 1\\&quot; flat iron for my short hair.</li>
            <li> This is my third Sedu Flat Iron.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;d expect after paying over $100 for a flat iron, that it would last longer than 1 year.  </li>
            <li> Just another curly-haired girl, writing to say that of all the flat irons I&#x27;ve tried over the last 20 years</li>
            <li> I purchased a human hair wig and I used the Sedu flat iron on it.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> We had the same Sedu flat iron for 5 years.</li>
            <li> I have tons of shine and it actually lays flat.</li>
            <li> This flat iron does not last!  </li>
            <li> Well in the future I will see if the babyliss flat irons can beat the sedu.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron back in 2009 while I was still in college.</li>
            <li> I only flat iron my hair a couple of times a week -</li>
            <li> The Sedu is well made and long lasting - I had to replace the one I had for more than 6 years when it was broken by some rough airline baggage handlers (I don&#x27;t know what they did to my bag)!</li>
            <li> Which is disappointing because this was such a good flat iron , it left my hair shiny and cut the time I used to do hair in half .</li>
            <li> I have used several flat irons, maxiglide, fhi, chi and this one has beat them all!</li>
            <li> It was the wider flat iron, because I had longer hair, when I got my hair cut short, I gave that flat iron to my friend, who still uses it.</li>
            <li> My hair is very wavy, dry, and a little course.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an iron that is reasonable priced look NO MORE, because this one is the BOMB.</li>
            <li> My friend had this flat iron</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t flat iron every day, maybe just 1-2 times a week.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had the chi, fhi, ghd, solia and this flat iron</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m done, I go to turn on my flat iron</li>
            <li> even if I flat iron their hair myself)</li>
            <li> But I swear, with this flat iron, I no longer have to check the weather before I leave the house.</li>
            <li> bought this flat iron, but didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> My bestfriend came over with her daughter and tell me that she was going to get her hair flat iron at some girls house for $25.</li>
            <li> I have never owned a flat iron that works as well as this one.</li>
            <li> and I can straighten it with this flat iron</li>
            <li> and it takes me 20 minutes to flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> it lasts as long as something that should be priced 10 dollars should last.</li>
            <li> Before I ordered another flat iron, I decided to do some research.</li>
            <li> Save me a lot of time to flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> Received the flat iron within 2 days using Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> I had this Sedu Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron Hair Straightener for 2 years I bought it from folica.com.</li>
            <li> For now I will continue to use my sedu flat iron.</li>
            <li> This too died after 3 months and Folica again paid for the shipping, but again, this is with time taken out of the warranty for shipping and the inconvenience of not having a a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not under warranty anymore, so I&#x27;m stuck with a pricey, not working flat</li>
            <li> I like this flat iron hair straightener</li>
            <li> This flat iron has destroyed my hair and it takes forever to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> On the flat iron it stated that it was at 400 degrees</li>
            <li> I would not trust this flat iron</li>
            <li> Purchased Sedu Flat Iron from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> She told me about this flat iron</li>
            <li> I go the gym everyday at noon and go right back to work afterwards, and this iron has proven to not burn my hair with everyday use.</li>
            <li> I am African American with very dry hair</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m not supposed to flat iron damp hair, but I do sometimes because I don&#x27;t spend enough time getting my hair completely dry.  </li>
            <li> For it to do miracles(on hard to straighten hair, besides my mom), you gotta use tons of product (just read some people&#x27;s comments on the folica website- the AA&#x27;s use at least 5 products (mostly)).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this flat iron to anybody!</li>
            <li> I cant pay $100 every year for a flat iron!</li>
            <li> My only issue with it, was it doesn&#x27;t open wide, it took a while to get used to</li>
            <li> After washing I let my hair dry naturally as long as possible and finish drying with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> The straightener heats up quickly but as soon as I pick it up, it loses power and the heat dies down.</li>
            <li> Tried follow other users&#x27; comment on how short it last &amp; the way to fix it, but in vain.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair in the morning and then use the flat iron in the evening when my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> so it is somewhat hard to get straight but not with the Sedu</li>
            <li> If you want to buy a mediocre straightener for $119 that you can buy at target for $30, then this is a fantastic investment.</li>
            <li> Takes just as long to shtraighten your hair as a $40 or$50 one.</li>
            <li> long hair -</li>
            <li> It has a one-year warranty, so let’s see if it holds up hat long.</li>
            <li> our hair stays for about 4 days without having to redo or touchup, as long as we put it up in a bun at night.    </li>
            <li> she was doing her hair, I just stood there with my mouth wide open!</li>
            <li> The plates on the Babyliss are long compared to the shorter Sedu.  </li>
            <li> I have long, this, corse, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have long frizzy hair</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve heard that is a long life for a straightener.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My long, wavy hair takes about 10 minutes to straighten.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always straighten my hair because it takes so long</li>
            <li> My last Sedu had a thick cord that was about 10feet long and left my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that it lacks a locking mechanism to keep it closed during storage and travel and the cord is ridiculously long which requires lots of wrapping around the iron to store.</li>
            <li> The green light will flicker, then it will only work if you hold it in a certain position--making it impossible to use -- and</li>
            <li> Bad hair days are in the past thanks to this flat iron :)</li>
            <li> I did over 7 hours of research because I have very frizzy hair and wanted to tame my frizz, and this is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure the iron they gave me was new.</li>
            <li> It takes very little time to straighten hair and it makes my hair very soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It doesn’t straighten my hair an better than the $18 flat iron I bought from Wal-Mart; it’s ugly (flat black, no style); the operating light is a dim green, and flashes weirdly, like it’s about to short out; the heat settings are primitive (a tiny, tiny wheel that I can hardly read, near the handle); just nothing here that warrants the $100 cost.</li>
            <li> Just let your hair air dry after washing it, for about 30 minutes, then you won&#x27;t have to blow dry for too long.</li>
            <li> There are several other retailers that are Sedu authorized sellers.</li>
            <li> I actually had to grab hold of my other iron to finish off the job.</li>
            <li> After further investigation,&lt;br /&gt;I found one other difference - the Wattage -</li>
            <li> My routine includes blow dry and then flat iron to get results remotely close to what I get at the salon...</li>
            <li> If I straighten it after letting it air dry curly, it&#x27;s about 10-12 minutes.</li>
            <li> so now I can plug it in with my hairdryer instead of having to dry my hair then straighten</li>
            <li> My hair is damaged, dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s keeping hair dry and fizzy 😖</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money on purchasing cheap and expensive straighteners.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps it&#x27;s just my hair type (coarse, thick, and wavy), but the time it takes to straighten my hair nearly doubled.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second Sedu now (1.5 years), and what seems to be happening with this iron is that the handle gets loose and the plates won&#x27;t align with each other.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint that I had with the old flat iron was how long it took for it to heat up/finish her hair (1-1.25 hours) and</li>
            <li> This flat iron works as well as any other flat iron, except that it CAUGHT ON FIRE IN MY HAND!!!!</li>
            <li> Ok, so I actually got this straightener a little over a year ago and thought I wasn&#x27;t crazy about it, why?</li>
            <li> Since straightening your hair like that is extremely bad for your hair if you do it more than that with a flat iron..</li>
            <li> The 1&amp;#34; ceramic pieces on this flat iron did not touch each other uniformly.  </li>
            <li> It will not burn it or pull it like other flat irons we bought used to do.  </li>
            <li> Works so much better than the very expensive one we bought at a mall kiosk.  </li>
            <li> This was questionable as well because my old sedu always left my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Until I receive the refund and shipping promised, I&#x27;m feeling like a victim of bait and switch.</li>
            <li> I was on Amazon looking for a new one and saw some negative comments</li>
            <li> and it always worked for me, but decided to try something new because my HAI electrical connection would die after about 12-18 months of use, however at least it worked well.</li>
            <li> I have tried the HAI (black and blue plates)  </li>
            <li> This conductive rod actually turns with the cord as it swivels, and over time this rod will arc (short) against the metal strip and slowly destroy it!</li>
            <li> This conductive rod actually turns with the cord as it swivels, and over time this rod will arc (short) against the metal strip and slowly destroy it!</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair and although I had an expensive flat iron previous to this one, this one works much better!</li>
            <li> I have used countless drugstore and high-end flat irons over the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lazy) and this flat iron not only makes my hair</li>
            <li> the 1.5 inch makes it harder in tight areas like short bangs or closer to the face area</li>
            <li> It is quicker and lasts longer the any of my previous flat irons</li>
            <li> I have previously bought flat irons at Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, frizzy, and wavy, and so I was skeptical that a tiny little iron would be able to straighten it.</li>
            <li> No real issues with this straightener.  </li>
            <li> I am not a very \\&quot;Girly-Girl\\&quot; kinda woman</li>
            <li> Performance of straightener is not what was expected.</li>
            <li> I have used this only a few times</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a lock to keep the iron closed when not in use, but I&#x27;m getting used to it.</li>
            <li> I call my sister back to blame her for my dead straightener</li>
            <li> (how can you be rough with a straightener?</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> For me, it is expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> The wide iron makes the time shorter.</li>
            <li> Second of all, it dried my hair out</li>
            <li> I had to drag out my ancient chi to go over my hair and give it some shine.</li>
            <li> and I was really curious if it were better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Exceon. is doing its part to combat this industry wide problem.</li>
            <li> But the construction of the device leaves a lot to be desired, and I really do not want to dish out another $100 + for an item that won&#x27;t even reach the year mark.</li>
            <li> I would have spent 200 on it no problem so</li>
            <li> And my wife is not even a heavy user, only using it 3 times a week!</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, naturally curly brown hair</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron hoping it would cut down on my styling time, which is considerable because I have long very thick hair ( 2 hours from wash to styled )</li>
            <li> I can get out the shower and let it air dry or, blow dry without putting effort (not using a round brush bc</li>
            <li> I round brush it, and then flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to be flat ironless for a few days, at least&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, midway down my back, and rather curly (not tight ringlets but lots of wavy curls)</li>
            <li> I have really thick coarse long hair</li>
            <li> I hope to have my new one for at least 10 years!</li>
            <li> So a big thumbs down from me!!</li>
            <li> I use one hand to hold the piece of hair and the other on the handle of the sedu.</li>
            <li> Other irons have straightened my hair but this one leaves it straighter and silkier.</li>
            <li> and I have ever used, and we have tried three other brands, plus our salon we go to uses it</li>
            <li> other than that don&#x27;t get any other flatiron.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a replacement to my other Sedu hair straighter...</li>
            <li> However, after about 9 months of using it about every other day it just didn&#x27;t turn on one day.  </li>
            <li> There seems to be a problem with the cord, as other people who have given reviews have stated.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was pretty shaken up and thankful that my hair didn&#x27;t catch on fire</li>
            <li> BOHO WEST REFUSING TO EXCHANGE DUE TO POLICY.  </li>
            <li> - it isn&#x27;t the 3 prong plug I am used to with other straightners</li>
            <li> I bought this after buying into the many rave reviews and was rightfully disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped it countless times and have a small nick on the side, but it functions like it did on day 1.</li>
            <li> In addition, the blades are so small (1.5 inch-but very short in length)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately without a warranty they were not able to fix it when it FINALLY died.</li>
            <li> Unlike other straighteners I&#x27;ve used, this one does not catch and pull your hair.</li>
            <li> Smoother result than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell glaze or other gel in it</li>
            <li> Overall, I was not satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This flat iron has a cheap short cord and has been brutal on my hair.</li>
            <li> I can straighten my hair in about 10-15 min (and I am very clumsy and new at this) - so this should be a piece of cake for everyone.</li>
            <li> In summary, if you buy this iron, SECURE the cord at the base somehow to prevent the inevitable loss of connection.</li>
            <li> The plates glide over your hair and the fact that it is so wide takes less time.  </li>
            <li> just can&#x27;t imagine what the other reviewers were using before they bought this over-priced, average, hair appliance.</li>
            <li> Now to find a small flat iron to get the baby hairs around the front of my head..</li>
            <li> Even tho&#x27; I&#x27;d only used the Sedu a half dozen times, it was past the warranty period</li>
            <li> I have mixed hair, and it is EXTREMELY curly and hard to straighten.</li>
            <li> so something was not right there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate because it works so well but just very unreliable.</li>
            <li> Thirdly, it took an incredibly long time to get my hair &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; and my hair is thin</li>
            <li> On average, I was buying one every year.</li>
            <li> It is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth it, and you&#x27;d rather have an iron that works well</li>
            <li> Am I greedy if I expect it to last at least five years?</li>
            <li> hair iron is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I just hate spending more money so soon.  </li>
            <li> and I thought it would either burn the house down or never work again.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected!!</li>
            <li> I usually use a blowdryer to dry my hair but not to straighten it</li>
            <li> Not a great flat iron, takes long to get results on curly hair.</li>
            <li> I can only straighten very small sections at a time.</li>
            <li> Since I have long hair this iron seemed a little small for the task</li>
            <li> was to straighten a small length of the section, then twirl the loose hair once around the iron, and pull it through.  </li>
            <li> However, this purchase was so incredibly disappointing that it is hard for me to believe this is a genuine product.</li>
            <li> It straightens my hair in less than a minute</li>
            <li> As noted by others, the switch starts to flicker after a year or year and a half</li>
            <li> It takes me less than 5 min.</li>
            <li> And it lasted me two and a half years, it worked so well that I invested in another.</li>
            <li> It would always heat up in less than 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Amazon did not have a problem refunding my money &amp; they didn&#x27;t even require that I return the product which was odd.  </li>
            <li> I have curly medium course hair and this took half the time of my previous straightener.</li>
            <li> The plates touch, with the Sedu there is a slight gap</li>
            <li> I typically ALWAYS do, but for some reason I can&#x27;t find this one.</li>
            <li> this product worked for me less than a year until one day</li>
            <li> I had a previous version of this straightener that lasted over two years before it died.  </li>
            <li> It takes this thing less that 60 seconds (depending on the setting)  to heat up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent iron, but it can&#x27;t even straighten my mom&#x27;s weird hair texture(at</li>
            <li> but I would take that any day over the mess the humidity used to turn my hair into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am Hispanic and I have thick, wavy and long hair.</li>
            <li> I post this review in an effort to allow other consumers to choose another product and not have a similar or worse experience with this company.</li>
            <li> I have Dominican long, curly, and thick hair and</li>
            <li> I purchased this Sedu to replace my last Sedu (which finally tired out after approximately 2 years, using it nearly every day).</li>
            <li> but it catches the ends of your hair too tightly</li>
            <li> maybe because the blades close in on it so tight..</li>
            <li> These issues arose despite my care for the straightner and never wrapping the word up tight.</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t whined it up tightly.</li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair and this iron works so well on it.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick, slightly wavy hair, and straightening it can take forever if I have to go over it a few times but with this iron I can be done in under 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Instead of getting frizzy in the humidity my hair would get a little wavy</li>
            <li> It is unfortunate one shoddy design in the unit ruins the whole thing.</li>
            <li> and i noticed a little bit of smoke.</li>
            <li> a little bit of steam was coming off the plates.</li>
            <li> If your have curly hair, you might need to retouch your hair when you wake up in the morning, but just a little bit, a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the flat iron would not heat up past the third setting.</li>
            <li> Well, it never burned the house down and it never died!</li>
            <li> then it will fail completely.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, consider it a waste of money and buy something else.</li>
            <li> I have had this straightener for over 8 years, the only reason I am replacing it is because it was broken in my luggage when traveling.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t fully accepted that he&#x27;s dead</li>
            <li> my hair waves at the ends after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Therefore, this design will never last once the thin metal strip starts to be zapped away.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few years ago</li>
            <li> i had the chi for awhile - and switched to sedu a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I wasted my hard-earned money on this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> There are a few reasons why I haven&#x27;t returned this product yet:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This iron doesn&#x27;t straighten your correctly, it pulls your hair out cause of its plates and uneven surface.</li>
            <li> only a couple of strips of thin plastic keep the handle</li>
            <li> Therefore, this design will never last once the thin metal strip starts to be zapped away.</li>
            <li> and now my warranty runs out in just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that tends to be &amp;#34;fuzzy&amp;#34; without blow drying or flat ironing.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair and this cuts my flat ironing time in half and gives unbelievable results.</li>
            <li> After using this for about a week, I found that it was no better than a cheaper brand I was previously using.  </li>
            <li> It just leaves it stiff, no matter what anyone(including hairstylists) uses(like biosilk, or chi products).</li>
            <li> My hair is frizzy, however I put product in to tame the frizz, and still no change.   </li>
            <li> I try to use that little reset button thing, it&#x27;s done this once or twice before but the reset button usually does the trick.</li>
            <li> I have long very thick hair</li>
            <li> It is the bad designs of my previous ones that make me appreciate this one so much.      </li>
            <li> One minor thing, the plates are thin</li>
            <li> I used this after my shower (when my hair is at it&#x27;s worst) and was surprised it got my hair as straight as it did.</li>
            <li> it gets her hair done (thick black curly/wavey hair).</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has extremelyh thick hair with tight kinky curls.</li>
            <li> In fact the other weekend I was staying in a hotel for a few days and the blow dryer was broken in my room.</li>
            <li> It got straight, but I got burned really bad, not to mention burning out my hair.</li>
            <li> Ever since then, I&#x27;ve had weird waves and a big struggle on my hands.</li>
            <li> and I have tried quite a few!</li>
            <li> and they straightend my (past the shoulder blades)</li>
            <li> any she has purchased in the past</li>
            <li> I bought it a couple weeks ago and saw how small the iron was</li>
            <li> This was just what I was looking for and as a past Chi owner, found it comparable, if not better!&lt;br</li>
            <li> For under $20, you can pick up an identical if not better one at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> but DAMAGE in six month!!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> In the past seven years, my sister has gone through 1 GHD, 1 Paul Mitchell, and 2 CHIs.</li>
            <li> and I anxiously tried it as soon as it arrived.  </li>
            <li> I might purchase again, not sure.</li>
            <li> (and we all know how difficult it is to satisfy a teen girl)</li>
            <li> No frizz and humidity gets past.</li>
            <li> like I have dealt with in the past.</li>
            <li> All of a sudden it shorts so ill</li>
            <li> I repeat, these are no better than walmart or target specials.</li>
            <li> In not more than 15 minutes I get the look I want.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if these are counterfeits being sold online, or legit, but any online retailer is NOT an authorized</li>
            <li> This expensive thing only works for a couple of months!</li>
            <li> I was always skeptical about these flat irons, purchased a couple in the past years, didnt work.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was a bit expensive, but then discovered that you get what you pay for!!  </li>
            <li> and I had to squeeze the handle very hard to have it close down on the hair.</li>
            <li> She was shocked when I told her I bought it in high</li>
            <li> Compared to other flatirons in the same price category, I was so shocked that this is what people have been hyping.</li>
            <li> - I don&#x27;t feel that it is hard on my hair</li>
            <li> so for those who have a hard time making a curl this with flatiron I would suggest purchasing the 1 inch.</li>
            <li> My daughter and myself have wavy frizzy hair that is hard to manage.  </li>
            <li> it takes a few strokes before it straightens unless you go very slowly.  </li>
            <li> I may return it anyway, just from the sheer disappointment, if I can motivate myself to wrap it for shipping ad get to the post office.</li>
            <li> And if it was humid or muggy outside...</li>
            <li> it loses connection and heat.  </li>
            <li> In Quantum physics, when you send negative ions around the space you are in they can often cause there to be overpopulation of these negative ions compared to the positives in your body, this can cause a unbalance in how your body and mind functions.</li>
            <li> You cannot touch the outside of the blades because of the heat, which is disappointing to me because I like to press the outsides</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended using a protective conditioning spray before straightening and this seems to avoid some of the burning or frying issues others have complained about.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair .</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, curly, and frizzy and</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, ornery hair, and this straightener makes it sleek and board</li>
            <li> It worked so well on my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy curly hair</li>
            <li> 42W may be sufficient for a lot of hair types, but I have&lt;br /&gt;long, thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and in all my years I have NEVER found a product that works so well on my hair.</li>
            <li> I miss my old Sedu:(</li>
            <li> This flat iron is seriously overpriced!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptic because i have never indulged into expensive brands before.</li>
            <li> This Sedu did prove me wrong, although it does have a few issues.</li>
            <li> It only broke because I used it in Europe and didn&#x27;t use the correct power adapter, who knows how long it would have lasted if I wasn&#x27;t an idiot!</li>
            <li> Ughh, let me just say how shocked I was on the body of this flat iron.</li>
            <li> sadly only lasted me a year :-(</li>
            <li> Maybe it was a different model than the one I had before because that one worked like a dream:(</li>
            <li> can* complain about is the shoddy construction of the rest of it!</li>
            <li> a MUST have for thick and curly hair!</li>
            <li> This is too expensive of a flat iron to be made that poorly!!</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron three months ago and have been extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and wavy- frizzy.</li>
            <li> Stuck with the less expensive brands!</li>
            <li> Product quality poor.</li>
            <li> I had to pay shipping to send the broken one in</li>
            <li> , there is a conductive rod type connector that fits into a stationary thin circular strip of metal.</li>
            <li> and it is already broken</li>
            <li> It would take me 20 minutes for a poor style.</li>
            <li> Counterfeit products may be poorly made, damage your hair, and electrically short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Authentic</li>
            <li> Sparks shot out of the base of the dryer, melted the wire, and it short circuited.</li>
            <li> In order to allow the cord to swivel, there is a conductive rod type connector that fits into a stationary thin circular strip of metal.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not my idea of standing behind your product.  </li>
            <li> I returned it today and felt a bit annoyed at having to pay for the return postal charge.</li>
            <li> Seriously buy this!</li>
            <li> One word of advice watch the connection at the straightener point, if you bend it, or wrap the cord sloppy, your connection will go in and out at the end of the straightener&#x27;s life.  </li>
            <li> While annoying, I find my hair laying everywhere from breakage after using my Chi more annoying!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually do reviews, but feel inclined to do so based on a very scary experience with Sedu&#x27;s 6000 hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Does not make hair look dull or lifeless!!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, and LOTS OF IT!</li>
            <li> not impressed.</li>
            <li> For the price, I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Folica had no record of my purchase and claims that someone is fraudulently selling items on Amazon using their storefront.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they did not.</li>
            <li> but for some weird reason, I can&#x27;t achieve that</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the way it straightened.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I will be returning this item.  </li>
            <li> This was a fake.</li>
            <li> The Sedu brand is expensive and they need to fix the flaws with their irons.  </li>
            <li> Is this a fake?</li>
            <li> Not impressed!</li>
            <li> You can not go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> it is difficult to use there</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the quality of this item and returned it.</li>
            <li> am sorry I ever bought the Sedu.  </li>
            <li> which gets to be difficult when trying to straighten hair.  </li>
            <li> The reason I am writing this review is because yesterday, sadly, my baby stopped working.</li>
            <li> I feel like this is a fake and should not represent the brand.  </li>
            <li> My wife has very thick, curly hair and this bad boy</li>
            <li> Not happy at all :-(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible made if it burns out less than a year from buying it.</li>
            <li> Also, folica makes sedu(sorta), so they advertise like crazy-</li>
            <li> SEDU IS JUST DANGEROUS OVER</li>
            <li> It looks ugly and very outdated.</li>
            <li> and she was mad.</li>
            <li> I have used Sedu in the past but this model was terrible, unless I just got a lemon.</li>
            <li> Does the job but seems very expensive.</li>
            <li> I am very sad about this.</li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> While it worked, it DID straighten well, too bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that bad, I guess</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed</li>
            <li> After that one bit the dust, I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I used it, I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Beyond disappointing!</li>

            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!!</li>
            <li> I was so stupid.</li>
            <li> and i used to hate it when they looked like i slept on them.</li>
            <li> It was so annoying if I ever had to go somewhere in a hurry after work because I literally needed about 2 to 3 hours to do my hair (with washing and drying it)..  </li>
            <li> I hated how Chi irons at the time always broke</li>
            <li> Very frustrated paying over $100 for an item that has shorted out in 8 months.</li>
            <li> and I was so disappointed!</li>

            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was VERY disappointed when it broke, as I thought I&#x27;d get 2-3 years out of it.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Stupid, crappy engineering!</li>
            <li> The overpriced CHI iron was one of the worst investments i ever made.</li>

            <li> THIS IS A FAKE!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> and it just looked terrible after I finished &amp;#34;straightening&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been horrible.</li>
            <li> VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best flat iron i have ever used!  This purchase is an exact rebuy.  I like how smooth my hair looks using my sedu.  It gives me beautiful results and i dont feel like im abusing or frying my blonde hair.  The overpriced CHI iron was one of the worst investments i ever made. It does fry the hair.  Thank you SEDU FOR DELIVERING THE PRODUCT TO YOUR CUSTOMERS THAT YOU SAY YOU DO.</li>
            <li> My hair ia wavy and i used to hate it when they looked like i slept on them. I saw this product and knew Sedu is a brand,so gave it a shot. I was a little skeptic because i have never indulged into expensive brands before. But sedu is insanely awesome. It straightens my hair in less than a minute and i have shoulder length so it does pretty good job. I would definitely recommend the product</li>
            <li> Does what it says on the tin.  This new model has an auto off feature which is very good from a safety perspective (will turn off after 30 minutes of non-use).</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. It died after about six uses. It was used as a back-up to my old faithful 1-inch ceramic flatiron that I&#x27;ve had for about five years and that gets used 4-5 times a week. Even tho&#x27; I&#x27;d only used the Sedu a half dozen times, it was past the warranty period so I&#x27;m out 130 bucks for the piece of junk.</li>
            <li> She loves the iron! I would recommend this to any one looking for a straightner. Awesome product! Thank You so much!</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair . This iron was a gift from heaven when I first started using it . I went form a chi to this and it did wonders .BUT don&#x27;t expect it to last you along time . When I first did research on the sedu there were alot of reviews talking about the cord but I bought it anyways . , right now my sedu won&#x27;t even turn on unless I swivel the cord a certain way . Which is disappointing because this was such a good flat iron , it left my hair shiny and cut the time I used to do hair in half . I just wish it was still working .it sadly only lasted me a year :-(</li>
            <li> I have been using this straightener for 3 years now and refuse to switch! It is extremely light, the large plate allows for faster straightening, and the edges do not tug at your hair! Have yet to try a better one (:</li>
            <li> I use this almost daily. I would recommend this to others. It helps fly-aways and makes my hair look polished.</li>
            <li> I love the 1.5&amp;#34; plates. Use this every day for straightening my hair. The Sedu is well made and long lasting - I had to replace the one I had for more than 6 years when it was broken by some rough airline baggage handlers (I don&#x27;t know what they did to my bag)! I have this in the 110 as well as the 220v for when I travel to Asia. You wont be disappointed</li>
            <li> My friend had this flat iron and I loved it, so I got online and found it. I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money but it is worth it! I have always bought cheap flat irons and my hair never came out smooth, now I see why girls spend the extra dollar. This flat iron will leave your hair super smooth!</li>
            <li> This is the second time in the past 3 years that we have ordered this product and it is great every time. It lasted a long time, after much use, and we were able to get the same one again for the same low price. Thank you Amazon!!</li>
            <li> The day I discovered the ceramic flat iron was a happy day for me, indeed! I have always loved straight, sily-smooth hair. I had that kind of hair myself until about 5th grade. Ever since then, I&#x27;ve had weird waves and a big struggle on my hands. A blow dryer, paddle brush, a bunch of time, and lots of product were not cutting it. Even at the salon it took the stylist over an hour to blow my hair out, and the finished product was not as straight as I wanted it. I live in the very humid deep South, which doesn&#x27;t help the situation. Needless to say, I was very happy the first time I used a modern ceramic flat iron and acquired one as soon as I could afford it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first flat iron I had was great--while it lasted, which was for about a year. After that one bit the dust, I was so disappointed. I missed my beautiful flat ironed hair, but was wary to spend that kind of money for a product with such a short lifespan. I tried a cheaper model that had good reviews on Amazon, but I found that my type of hair really needs a heavy-duty product with variable heat. Lesson learned: if you have REALLY thick/wavy hair, steer clear of cheap flat-irons. They are good for some light smoothing, but they do not have the heft to get thick hair truly straight. Finally, a friend of mine pointed me in the direction of the Sedu, which also had excellent reviews, and lots of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sedu has been a good choice for me. I have had it for over four years now and it still works as well as it did on day one, so it has longevity, which is essential. I&#x27;m no stylist myself, so I value the fact that it&#x27;s really easy to use and fast, too. I only have to iron each strand once or twice (very slowly) to get it pin straight, and I&#x27;m able to do a good-sized chunk of hair at a time. I don&#x27;t have an hour or more to spend on my hair. I have a busy lifestyle and only use the Sedu occasionally, but its slim design makes it really easy to store and keep on hand, even in my really small house. I hope to use the Sedu for many years to come and will bust it out on those occasions when I need or want beautiful straight hair.the Sedu for many years to come and will bust it out on those occasions when I need or want beautiful straight hair.</li>
            <li> Bought 2nd one because I love this iron but for the money does not last.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been very happy with this straightener, except that our second one in the last 10 months just broke.  Just as others have written (SHANTEC gives the best description), the cord will break internally where it connects to the body.  The green light will flicker, then it will only work if you hold it in a certain position--making it impossible to use -- and then it will fail completely.  The manufacturer should be ashamed of this design which it surely knows about by now.  So the bottom line is this: it&#x27;s a great hair straightener for a little while, until it breaks, and you have to buy a new one.  If you don&#x27;t mind buying a new one frequently, then you should get this one.  Otherwise, consider it a waste of money and buy something else.</li>
            <li> This product worked great on my naturally frizzy and curly hair.  It is quicker and lasts longer the any of my previous flat irons and I have tried quite a few! The only thing I would mention is that it does not have an auto shut off feature.  This is more an issue with my memory than the product, but worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> This straightener is probably the best straightener I have ever used. It claims to use negative ions in your hair and make it beautiful or something, who knows. I have no Idea what that means, but whatever they did is awesome. Usually it takes about 3 times going over my own strands of hair with a flat iron just to get it straight, and it&#x27;s not even shiny or silky smooth, but with the Sedu, I have been able to finish doing my hair in half the time I used to because all it takes it one run through each piece. I even use this to curl my hair, it is a 1.5 inch, but it makes gorgeous curls as well. One thing that I don&#x27;t particularly like is how long the cord is, it&#x27;s just always getting tangled. Then again, it&#x27;s also able to reach really far so I guess it just depends on how you use it. So I would definitely recommend this straightener to anyone who&#x27;s serious about just having nice hair, not having a hassle every time they need to get ready in the morning, and who wants a flat iron that will last them for a while.&lt;br /&gt;oh p.s. the top of it gets really hot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several flat irons and my Sedu is by far the best.  It heats up very quickly and although I don&#x27;t turn the heat dial to the recommended setting, it has not dried my hair out. This was the best $99 deal I&#x27;ve had in a long time and I wld buy another Sedu in a heart beat!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used sedu flat irons for the last 5 years. The first one I had was great. It was the wider flat iron, because I had longer hair, when I got my hair cut short, I gave that flat iron to my friend, who still uses it. I got the 1\\&quot; flat iron for my short hair. Great flat iron. Lasted 3 years before it finally gave out. I was on Amazon looking for a new one and saw some negative comments so I wanted to put in my two cents :) The sedu flat iron is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used. I have curly hair, and when I use it, you can&#x27;t tell. It doesn&#x27;t fry the ends of my hair. I don&#x27;t have to go over my hair a million times to get it straight. It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about paying this much for a flat iron, but once I tried it I realized it was worth every penny. It works very well and quickly. The best part, though, is that is glides through your hair so smoothly without any pulling. I have recommended this product to many friends. I have owned mine for over a year now, but have purchased others for gifts.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is the best.  It flattens my hair so fast and nicely.  My hair feels silky soft after each use.  I do find that the type of product you use increases that silky softness plus it protects your hair from heat damage.  I personally was recommened biosilk.  I really LOVE that stuff.  It smells good and works great with my Sedu.  I also use \\&quot;Loreal Hot Straight\\&quot; too to give it a little bit more protection from the heat and it works great.  My hair looks like I step out of a salon everytime.  I can&#x27;t get over how smooth and straight it is.  Bad hair days are in the past thanks to this flat iron :)</li>
            <li> Love this straightener. I have thick hair and this gets hot enough to straighten my hair thoroughly the first time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this iron for 3 years and it still works as good as new. It&#x27;s the best flat iron I have ever used. Period.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews about how the cord has issues and that it just stops working. I thought.... I&#x27;ll never bend the cord and wrap it around iron. So I didn&#x27;t, and 9 months later it just stopped working. L save your money, go to Sally&#x27;s and buy their two year replacement warranty if you want this one.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener! I had always used cheap ones in the past and I can tell a huge difference with the Sedu. My hair has never looked straighter or healthier! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it doesn&#x27;t have an auto off feature, but other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I have gone through three of these in five years.  Too bad I like the iron so much because I really need to find another brand.  As noted by others, the switch starts to flicker after a year or year and a half and then it won&#x27;t heat up properly.  At $100+ I would hope to have an iron that lasts longer than that.  I&#x27;m frustrated because otherwise, I love this iron - but if it won&#x27;t heat, it doesn&#x27;t do you a lot of good.</li>
            <li> I have used several flat irons, maxiglide, fhi, chi and this one has beat them all!</li>
            <li> I have owned mine for about a year now and I am really glad I got it.  It works great, heats up very fast and is easy to use.  Most important to me was if it was hard on my hair - I don&#x27;t feel that it is hard on my hair and it lasts all day even in humidity.  I don&#x27;t flat iron every day, maybe just 1-2 times a week.  I have naturally curly long hair - It straightens it perfectly.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve read some great reviews online about this, and had recommendations from personal friends of how great this product is, I just rate it OK. I don&#x27;t really feel that it works any better than the $30 straightener I previously had bought from Wal-Mart. It does get hot and I haven&#x27;t had any technical problems with it, I just feel it doesn&#x27;t take away the frizz as much as I think it should. My hair is frizzy, however I put product in to tame the frizz, and still no change.   My suggestion would be to save your $100 and purchase something cheaper at your local store. Or, substantially increase your investment in a straightner and speak with your stylist about what they use.</li>
            <li> No real issues with this straightener.  I have super fine and very long hair and I can adust the temperature to suit my needs.  I live in a high humidity area and this straightener combined with the right styling products leaves my hair looking good for a few days with only minimal touch ups and damage.</li>
            <li> not so great. not impressed. Takes just as long to shtraighten your hair as a $40 or$50 one. not recommended</li>
            <li> After using this for about a week, I found that it was no better than a cheaper brand I was previously using.  The iron gets super hot and there is no place to hold on to it without burning your hand.  I don&#x27;t know if they are all like this or if mine was defective.  For the price, I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Sparked and died after 4 months of use</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair and although I had an expensive flat iron previous to this one, this one works much better! It takes me less than 5 min. to flat iron my hair (shoulder length) as it works incredibly fast and is very effective. My hairdresser even said my hair was in better condition. It also makes my hair shinier...worth every penny I spent.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.   I am not a very \\&quot;Girly-Girl\\&quot; kinda woman and I am pretty clueless when it comes to the \\&quot;How to...&#x27;s\\&quot; of the beauty-world. But a friend of mine took me to a beauty salon and they straightend my (past the shoulder blades) long hair - and I really really liked it (so did my husband). So, after many failed hair straighteners in the past, I decided to give it another try and go for what the critics (in the Inet and hair salons) all called \\&quot;the best of the best\\&quot;. The price tag was a bit shocking but I thought that if it really works as well as everyone is saying, then it would pay itself off in no time. It has - and it is worth every penny.     I can straighten my hair in about 10-15 min (and I am very clumsy and new at this) - so this should be a piece of cake for everyone. I love the results, straight, sleek, shiny hair that I always admired on models and movie stars, in minutes without chemicals or other unnatural things.</li>
            <li> This is my third Sedu Flat Iron.  The 2 inch quit working at about 1 year, so I bought the 1.5 inch which lasted a year as well.  The power switch keeps going out.  You&#x27;d expect after paying over $100 for a flat iron, that it would last longer than 1 year.  My 1 inch iron seems to be the only model that has quality construction.</li>
            <li> I had this same exact model before, three years ago. And it lasted me two and a half years, it worked so well that I invested in another. Compared to how well it works and the amount of time it can last, it is easily a better choice than a cheaper one in the stores.</li>
            <li> Not all it&#x27;s stated to be.  Product quality poor. Performance of straightener is not what was expected. Have found most Ionic products are hype.  I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> literally does it all. straightens, curls, leaves your hair soft and shines in the light. the light on it is so cute.. doesn&#x27;t pull or snag your hair. i&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this device. She claims it works better then any she has purchased in the past and if that&#x27;s the case, it&#x27;s OK in my book.</li>
            <li> My first Sedu lasted almost five years so when it finally died, I immediately set out to get a new one. The only difference between the new Sedu and the old Sedu was the cord. The new Sedu&#x27;s cord does not swivel. All was good for almost three months when suddenly one morning, the Sedu would not turn on. Because I had purchased the Sedu through Folica&#x27;s store on Amazon, I decided to call Folica to initiate the return process since Amazon&#x27;s 30 day return period had ended. Unfortunately, Folica had no record of my purchase and claims that someone is fraudulently selling items on Amazon using their storefront. I tend to  think the problem lies with Folica and their incompetence. I would think that if Folica had been hacked like they claimed, they would want to make the situation right with their customers. Unfortunately, they did not. They offered no help and referred me back to Amazon. Fortunately, Amazon is a stand-up company with unmatched customer service and made the situation right. If you must buy this defective product, I would not purchase it from Folica. There are several other retailers that are Sedu authorized sellers.</li>
            <li> Just another curly-haired girl, writing to say that of all the flat irons I&#x27;ve tried over the last 20 years (and there&#x27;ve been a few), this is by far the best! I heats up in minutes and it gets plenty HOT at only the halfway setting!  My hair comes out smooth and soft in a fraction of the time it used to.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought a Sedu straightening iron 5 years ago, and only had to replace it a month ago when my boyfriend dropped it and it broke at the hinge. I decided to try the Chi just for kicks, and after owning it for 1 week it has completely stopped working. There was no temperature setting on the model I bought, and although results were similar, I would have to say the Sedu performed better. I have read that many customers have had trouble getting their straighteners replaced by Farouk (makers of Chi) so why not go with a product that I can testify has worked perfectly for 5 years?</li>
            <li> Does an ok Job but not as good as other sedu flat irons which i also purchased at the same time which I give a 5 star. Does not leave the hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.. I bought it a couple weeks ago and saw how small the iron was, I was like wow all this hair is suppose to straighten out with this..but i love it, the sedu does not pull your hair it leaves and incredible shine and my hair is soo bounce and soft..I 100% say BUY IT!!!! Its worth it..</li>
            <li> I purchased this January 2010! Loved it - it is lightweight, easy to use, has variable heat settings which is important as it does not fry fine hair, but will also tackle thicker hair and it  left my hair smooth, frizz free and straight as could be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long, wavy / curly and will not stay straight without a good straightener and good product - this did the trick! It was easy to use, quick - less than 10 minutes and good to go! My hair stayed straight, and was soft, manageable and also important - not fried! This was just what I was looking for and as a past Chi owner, found it comparable, if not better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I did not give this a better rating, was the cord issue that others had experienced. For the price I paid, I would hope to get more than 2 years out of the item, but in my case, I barely got 18 months! The straightener heats up quickly but as soon as I pick it up, it loses power and the heat dies down. In order to make this work, I have to hold it in just one particular way but of course when you straighten you cannot keep super still and hope the cord will stay still!!You have to jiggle the cord just to get some power back to the straightener!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Its a shame, as it is a great item, works well but a little more life expectancy would make this even better!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace another ceramic iron that I had that broke after 4+ years of almost daily use.  This is my fourth flat iron -- one was good, two were bad, and this one seems great so far.  I have used this only a few times but I already am hugely impressed with this product; my hair is straight, shiny, and soft.      It is the bad designs of my previous ones that make me appreciate this one so much.      1.  It has a high heat setting which allows me to straighten my thick, curly, color-treated hair in only 10 minutes as opposed to 20 or more.      2.  The controls are in a location that I won&#x27;t accidentally touch and change.      3.  The iron is lightweight and easy to manage -- I don&#x27;t have to use both hands on the iron to hold it to keep it closed or to support the weight.     4.  The slight curve in the handle makes it easy and comfortable to hold.     My previous good iron (a different brand) eventually had the electrical problem that others are referring to in their reviews (a problem in the swivel connection) and I hope that for this price, that this one lasts just as long as that one did.</li>
            <li> I have had my Sedu flatiron for 3 years now and it&#x27;s still working AMAZINGLY well! I have relaxed hair and wear clip-in extensions (the ones that are marketed to Caucasians), this flatiron literally changes my hair texture to match the extensions PERFECTLY! No one can tell that I&#x27;m wearing extensions (I&#x27;ve had girls, both black and white comment on how long my  hair is and are surprised when I tell them that I&#x27;m wearing extensions) because of how perfectly straight this flat iron makes my hair. It literally straightens out the texture a relaxer couldn&#x27;t straighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t plan on purchasing another brand. I honestly don&#x27;t believe that there is anything else out there that&#x27;s better. I find that the 1\\&quot; is easier to manipulate and handle than the 1.5\\&quot;, so for those who have a hard time making a curl this with flatiron I would suggest purchasing the 1 inch.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener (the 1 inch) after my CHI turbo broke on me after 5 months. The sedu works just as well on my hair as the chi did, and it feels a lot smoother on my hair than the CHI. My first Sedu broke on me after 5 months as well, but I had saved my receipt this time and had a free 1 year warranty from the website I bought it at. I had to pay shipping to send the broken one in and I believe a 10 dollar check. That&#x27;s the only reason i put 4 stars instead of 5. But they sent me a new one and I have had it for almost a year with no problems! I don&#x27;t see why you would need to touch the outside of the plates. I use one hand to hold the piece of hair and the other on the handle of the sedu. Oh and i forgot..it is super light weight! did i mention that i love this product?? &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron in 2004 and just ordered its replacement! It only broke because I used it in Europe and didn&#x27;t use the correct power adapter, who knows how long it would have lasted if I wasn&#x27;t an idiot! This iron is the best! I hope to have my new one for at least 10 years!</li>
            <li> With all these great reviews, I have to wonder what I’m missing with this flat iron. There’s nothing special here, especially for the $100 price tag. It doesn’t straighten my hair an better than the $18 flat iron I bought from Wal-Mart; it’s ugly (flat black, no style); the operating light is a dim green, and flashes weirdly, like it’s about to short out; the heat settings are primitive (a tiny, tiny wheel that I can hardly read, near the handle); just nothing here that warrants the $100 cost. It has a one-year warranty, so let’s see if it holds up hat long. If it doesn’t, I’ll happily return it. I may return it anyway, just from the sheer disappointment, if I can motivate myself to wrap it for shipping ad get to the post office. I definitely do not recommend this item at its price. For under $20, you can pick up an identical if not better one at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before buying this flat iron since the price tag was higher than the ones you find at retail stores, but I have to admit I&#x27;m glad I purchased this item.   I am Hispanic and I have thick, wavy and long hair. My routine includes blow dry and then flat iron to get results remotely close to what I get at the salon...but I was never 100% successful until I got this iron. I went from getting my hair kind of looking good in about 50-60 minutes, to looking perfect in about 25 min.   I can&#x27;t say anything about the longevity of the product since I only got my iron about a month ago, but I certainly hope it lasts more than a year...I love it so far.   At first I was using it at the highest setting, but my hair was getting a little dry, so I lowered the temp and got great results and my hair still looks great..I only use it once or twice a week. I was using the highest setting since my old iron never got hot enough no matter how much I tried.  I think it is important that you use some type of heat protectant for your hair, and as many other reviewers stated, the body of the iron does get hot, but as long as you are a little careful it shouldn&#x27;t cause any issues. It doesn&#x27;t have a lock to keep the iron closed when not in use, but I&#x27;m getting used to it.</li>
            <li> The iron its amazing the first month straight my hair and look shine. but DAMAGE in six month!!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money! For this price you buy a better and long life iron. DONT LOSE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron. It makes the hair really silky and smooth. My hair is some what between a 3A and 3C and I&#x27;ve had the chi, fhi, ghd, solia and this flat iron but I found that the fhi works best. This flat iron seemd to great for those with thin hair or finer hair. This flat iron is great for straightening hair but for me it did not keep my hair straight.</li>
            <li> I have had this straightener for over 8 years, the only reason I am replacing it is because it was broken in my luggage when traveling. I was so upset as I wasn&#x27;t sure I would be able to purchase this same flat iron again, but luckily I found it on Amazon. Great straightener, wouldn&#x27;t buy any other brand.. totally worth the investment!</li>
            <li> I guess this flat iron is ok. I bought it because it had good reviews, but the plates are the smallest plates I&#x27;ve ever seen on a flat iron.  I would not have bought it if I had realized this.</li>
            <li> I call the Sedu \\&quot;My Magic Wand\\&quot;. I highly recommend this product. It is worth the money. Wait an extra month or two if you must, to save the extra cash because it is WORTH the wait.     Just let your hair air dry after washing it, for about 30 minutes, then you won&#x27;t have to blow dry for too long. Use a good brush to blow dry, just to get completely dry and soft. No need for pulling hair, because the Sedu will do the work for you. Slide the Sedu at a slow and steady pace on small sections of hair and you will see amazing results. Simply take your time doign it, and you might just finish faster than if you try to rush through it. Do it once, do it right and enjoy your beautiful hair.    If your have curly hair, you might need to retouch your hair when you wake up in the morning, but just a little bit, a few minutes. I hope this was helpful.</li>
            <li> This is what I don&#x27;t get about some Amazon reviews. This flat iron got amazing reviews, so I was excited to try this on my thick, coarse and wavy hair (not even curly) and I was so disappointed! First of all, there seemed to be a slight gap in between the plates, so I felt like it didnt have the ability to press my hair straight. I had to go over the sections multiple times.. and the heat was at 350. I have used way cheap irons at $50 that performed better than this. I have tried the HAI (black and blue plates)  which is $60-$80 for years and it always worked for me, but decided to try something new because my HAI electrical connection would die after about 12-18 months of use, however at least it worked well. Back to HAI I go... I would not recommend this item at all.</li>
            <li> Bought one of these for my daughter a year ago, but couldn&#x27;t keep my wife from stealing it from her all the time, so bought her one for Xmas. My wife has very thick, curly hair and this bad boy does the job.</li>
            <li> Pay attention because I&#x27;m about to save you a lot of money. This hair straightener is great, it looks sheek, It gets my hair straight and it somewhat tames frizz. But heres the thing that no one can figure out! This straightener is just as good as any straightener at target. Trust me. I did over 7 hours of research because I have very frizzy hair and wanted to tame my frizz, and this is not worth the money. If you want to buy a mediocre straightener for $119 that you can buy at target for $30, then this is a fantastic investment. Save your money.</li>
            <li> So I was straightening my hair this morning in my own apartment, getting ready for my \\&quot;grown-up job\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve been at for about a year now. I&#x27;m half-way finished and I get a phone call from my older sister so I turn off my straightener and talk to her. NBD! When I&#x27;m done, I go to turn on my flat iron and it WON&#x27;T TURN ON!! I&#x27;m pissed. I try to use that little reset button thing, it&#x27;s done this once or twice before but the reset button usually does the trick. The reset button did not work!!! I call my sister back to blame her for my dead straightener and she says, \\&quot;Well, you got that  when you were a sophomore in high school...\\&quot; I say, \\&quot;So???\\&quot; And she tells me, \\&quot;YOU&#x27;RE 23!!\\&quot; Then it hit me, I&#x27;ve had  this straightener for SEVEN YEARS. Seven years of silky, soft, beautifully straight hair. In the past seven years, my sister has gone through 1 GHD, 1 Paul Mitchell, and 2 CHIs. I have had this for 7 years! It&#x27;s amazing. Over the years, my friends have borrowed my Sedu, I&#x27;ve used it on my younger sister and nieces, it&#x27;s been on countless vacations, and 2 of my graduations, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever gone a week without using it. By the way my hair is right above my waist, very thick, and mildly wavy. It never took more than one pass to straighten my hair and it took me no time at all. About 2 years ago the cord started to come apart because I&#x27;m pretty rough with it (how can you be rough with a straightener? oh, just trust me.) but I just wrapped it with a mix of duct and electrical tape. It would always heat up in less than 30 seconds. I can remember more than one occasion when I forgot to turn it off and I thought it would either burn the house down or never work again. Well, it never burned the house down and it never died! Well, until this morning, of course, but that&#x27;s completely unrelated! :) I&#x27;ve seriously never had more than 2 or 3 sentences to write in a review, if I even write one! But I had to express my love, yes LOVE, for this flat iron. It was the best flat iron ever and I haven&#x27;t fully accepted that he&#x27;s dead but once I do, I will be purchasing one again!</li>
            <li> To describe my hair, it is pretty curly, somewhat coarse and dry, long and frizzy. I ordered this from another website but wanted to add a review here also for anyone thinking about buying this iron. I have been dedicated to the chi for years now, since I was about 13. I&#x27;ve only had 2 CHIs and they lasted about 4-5 years a piece... so they still worked fairly well, I had no reason to replace them. Never had any complaints until they start getting old, the plates start to come undone and pull the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in my quest for healthier, longer hair, I decided to try the sedu because of all the wonderful reviews and before and after pics I found on the web. I&#x27;m so incredibly glad that I did because my hair feels like silk when I use this thing! The one thing I noticed that is significantly different from the CHI is the plates. The plates are so smooth, I&#x27;m really not sure how they did it. It glides through the hair like none other and feels fantastic. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m frying and damaging my hair as I did with the CHI. I no longer get the ridge marks from it getting stuck and crimping, so that&#x27;s a plus also. It does claim to cut time straightening in half, which is not so much true for me other than the fact that I don&#x27;t have to continue straightening the same sections over and over. Once over is all I need. The ends, which are still somewhat damaged, don&#x27;t feel like straw anymore. I&#x27;m not sure how that worked out, but it&#x27;s very nice! My main goal was to keep my length and have it at least LOOK healthy, and this performed wonderfully to help me reach that goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, my advice would be to buy it if you are looking for something new, something that will help straighten and maintain your hair until the next wash, and help it to feel silkier, softer and keep it fairly healthy, I would insist you try the Sedu. You won&#x27;t be sorry!!</li>
            <li> So, this was my first high end flat iron, and I can&#x27;t believe three years ago I threw away a 1.5 \\&quot; sedu because of a cord problem!! I was so stupid. Anyways, I bought the 1\\&quot; afterward and I thought it was the best of the best .... but since trying ghd, I&#x27;ll never go back. I&#x27;ve been a loyal sedu fan (even got my sister hooked to it) for years, and honestly I&#x27;ve opened my eyes to better options. This and the chi are the same, but I can&#x27;t get pin straight locks on MY hair- other people&#x27;s hair will come out poker straight (even if I flat iron their hair myself) but for some weird reason, I can&#x27;t achieve that look- and my hair is naturally straight with just a slight wave to it! The CHI does get my hair poker straight, but it leaves my ends fried, so I don&#x27;t like it.  My sister has a 1.5\\&quot; sedu and I can tell you 2.5 years since she bought her sedu, it has acquired a mysterious \\&quot;burnt hair\\&quot; smell when it&#x27;s turned on and I&#x27;m so sure it&#x27;s the thin layer of ceramic slapped on this cheap iron! I tried to love it, but honestly it&#x27;s not better than a $60 iron- my $40 hot tools got it straighter than this! People look at it and think it&#x27;s $40- soo not the case!I JUST found my perfect heat setting, but I get too many fly-aways from this iron the older it gets- I barely use it 2x a month! My iron isn&#x27;t defective- it gets HOT, it does do nice curls and waves that last a little longer than usual, but it&#x27;s not intended to stay super straight- my hair waves at the ends after a few minutes. It leaves my hair soft and moveable, but dry and gives me dents and creases very often. It&#x27;s a decent iron, but it can&#x27;t even straighten my mom&#x27;s weird hair texture(at any temp.) - her natural hair is frizzy hot-roller-curls from the 80&#x27;s! It just leaves it stiff, no matter what anyone(including hairstylists) uses(like biosilk, or chi products). For it to do miracles(on hard to straighten hair, besides my mom), you gotta use tons of product (just read some people&#x27;s comments on the folica website- the AA&#x27;s use at least 5 products (mostly)). An investment in a good iron is intended to LESSEN the product usage. This product is just cheap looking, cheap-made. Don&#x27;t believe the hype. I did and years later I&#x27;m once again looking for something better! I give it 3 stars cuz it works for the most part. Hope I helped some people make a good decision - choose something better :)    Also, folica makes sedu(sorta), so they advertise like crazy- folica recommends sedu above all! And horrible customer service experiences - they didn&#x27;t approve some of my comment reviews as well! Have a nice day!</li>
            <li> After losing my beloved FHI Iron on a vacation, it was finally time for me to do my research and find another. After finding this one, I did see some mixed reviews. The first time I used it, I was SUPER surprised that an iron could be this light! Compared to my FHI, this iron was as light as a feather. It heats up much faster and leaves my hair shiny and sleek. My hair is thick, frizzy, and wavy, and so I was skeptical that a tiny little iron would be able to straighten it. This Sedu did prove me wrong, although it does have a few issues. The first is that part of the iron gets uncomfortably warm. I like to hold my irons closer to the top, and this is a problem for anyone that isn&#x27;t planning to use this iron to curl/wave their hair as well.  The iron will also not sit flat;it always tips to one side. This really annoys me when I try to set it down. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend sitting it on any surface easily damaged by heat. All in all, this is a good buy, and I have never regretted purchasing it.</li>
            <li> My hair is very wavy, dry, and a little course. I read the reviews and I thought this product was going to be right for me. It worked fine at first, but no better than a Chi you could buy at Ulta with a coupon. I was not impressed with the way it straightened. To top it all off, I only bought it in June and it completely stopped working mid March. Save your money and buy a Chi.</li>
            <li> I am African American with very dry hair I got this as a gift and it is worth every penny. Other irons have straightened my hair but this one leaves it straighter and silkier. Its just like going to the salon. All I do is add a little chi silk infusion and my hair is silky, smooth, and bouncy. I recommend this iron to everyone.</li>
            <li> Soft, shiny, straight hair that last until you wash it again is what you get when you use this little beauty.  still want the chi?  think about this for a minute.  with the chi, while great, you have run the iron over you hair a few timess to get it straight.  with the Sedu--nope.  twice max and maybe not even that.</li>
            <li> Naturally, my hair is very frizzy and poofy.  Not so much curly, but wavy and as if every hair is going in a different direction.  My previous flat irons were a Hot Tools one and a Bed Head.  Using those it took me about an hour to straighten my hair.  It was so annoying if I ever had to go somewhere in a hurry after work because I literally needed about 2 to 3 hours to do my hair (with washing and drying it)..  so I bought this Sedu.  I was AMAZED the first day I got it.. I was able to shower, blow dry, and straighten my hair all in under one hour.      Another great thing about this flat iron, is it keeps my hair straight all day long.  With my old flat irons, my hair would be straight when I was finished, but within an hour or so it started to get poofy again.  And if it was humid or muggy outside... my hair was DONE for. But I swear, with this flat iron, I no longer have to check the weather before I leave the house.</li>
            <li> Best Flatiron I&#x27;ve found.  Have used Chi, T3 Tourmaline, and recently tried Babyliss Pro and sent it back.  This is my 2nd Sedu and I am still very happy. I have very thick hair that tends to be &amp;#34;fuzzy&amp;#34; without blow drying or flat ironing.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned. The only one I will ever own.</li>
            <li> For $150 flat iron it feels very lightweight, small, and cheap.  The temperature does not seem to reach the 450 degrees either.  Unfortunately, I will be returning this item.  Bought a GHD ECLIPSE and I love it.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews on this product and other products similiar to it before deciding on the Sedu.  It took me a week to get the product and I anxiously tried it as soon as it arrived.  I must say that the products is a dream come true.  I am an African American woman and I have never been able to get my hair as straight as I am able to do now, not even when going to the salon.  When I went back to work from the weekend, my coworkers all commented on how much longer my hair looked (because it was truly straight).  I would recommend this to any woman.  I have not been back to the salon in the last 2 months.</li>
            <li> This straightener is great for my tight spiral curls. It works best when I blow my hair out first and then go over it with this iron, but I can use it right on my curls and have them go pin straight.   It is not bad for your hair and causes less breakage then a lot of other irons out there.  I have friends with the Chi but the Sedu is a better iron. I have owned it for four years, it still works the same as when I bought it. And even if it broke on me now, I would be willing to buy it again in a heartbeat.  Amazing product.</li>
            <li> Great iron. Just what I expected. I have very long and thick hair and this iron works so well on it.</li>
            <li> Flattens, straightens and smooths hair leaving it shiny and soft..the best I have found,and I&#x27;ve tried them all..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of straighteners with varying results.  The Sedu is the best.  It heats up very quickly, and yet, the heat does not damage my hair. My hair is incredibly soft and smooth after using the Sedu.  One big frustration with the CHI was that the results were so short-lived.  If it was humind, or raining, my hair frizzed right up, and it never stayed straight for the whole day.  With the Sedu, my hair is still straight when I go to bed. It&#x27;s definitely the best straightener I have ever owned. For me, it is expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> my first one died after around 5 years, had to order another one right away, there is NO substitute.i have really thick, rough and frizzy hair ( if untreated).. no other straighteners would do it justice and even if was able to straighten my hair with any other straightening iron, it wont last for more than a few hours. Sedu has shaved my straightening time into about a quarter, and once straightened, hair stays like that till the next wash</li>
            <li> Great product, easy transaction! I would buy it again in a heart beat. Works better than anything else I have ever used</li>
            <li> This was a fake. Did not work, I&#x27;ve used a real sedu and this is not it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flatiron in 2004, one for me and one for my daughter. We both have strong, coarse, thick hair and mine is frizzy, too. I was persuaded to spend the money because of the excellent reviews on the Folica website. I have not been disappointed. I use mine heavily, nearly every day. It heats quickly and works wonders on my hair. After washing I let my hair dry naturally as long as possible and finish drying with a blow dryer. Then I go to work with the Sedu on a section at a time starting with the bottom layers. It takes me about 20 minutes because I have so much hair! Subsequent days in between washings only take about 5 minutes to touch up. My hair is smooth and silky and not frizzy at all. I live in Florida so I have to deal with the humidity, too. I would recommend this for anyone. It has more than delivered the results I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener and have used this model ever since discovering it a number of years ago. The only drawback is that I have to replace it every couple of years because the wiring starts to split from the physical straightener.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times, it didn&#x27;t hurt my hair at all, but the thing with the light makes me worry.</li>
            <li> I am speechless, it is extremely lightweight, ready to use in 20 seconds, easy to operate, results in shiny and healthy straight hair!!!! Also, try the Garnier Leave-in Conditioner to put on before the straightening process. It helps from preventing the heat damage to the hair.</li>
            <li> I replaced my one inch chi w/ this iron because my chi quit working after only 6 months (and I use the th ing maybe once a week...) So, after reading the reviews, I purchased the Sedu. It works ok - not as good as the chi and the tool doesn&#x27;t feel as posh as the chi. Also, the plastic over the plates gets really hot so you can&#x27;t really push down, you have to push down right under the plates and I feel that it would be easier to push on the plate area... I might purchase again, not sure.</li>
            <li> this is the best flat iron my family and I have ever used, and we have tried three other brands, plus our salon we go to uses it, they just happended to be out of them at the time I ordered. it doesn&#x27;t need to be very hot either. I like the fact that it has an adjustable heat setting. our hair stays for about 4 days without having to redo or touchup, as long as we put it up in a bun at night.    the shipping was fast also!     my only complaint is it was supposed to come with a mounting device for free, and I called the company twice and never received it.     other than that don&#x27;t get any other flatiron. my sister-in-law even changed to the sedu and she has about four others. she likes how it leaves hair shining and silky also.</li>
            <li> Works so much better than the very expensive one we bought at a mall kiosk.  Heats up very quickly and works really well!</li>
            <li> First, I want to say to those who read this ..  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I AM 100%, PURE, UNTOUCH, GRADE A, PUREBREED, CERTIFIED, PANTENT-PENDED PROUD BLACK!!! ( I know this because I have a stamp on my butt .. HA!!) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am going to be honest .. I have the nappiest hair on the planet, and can&#x27;t nobody tell me otherwise. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I went natural about a year ago. I tried everything to starighten my hair, even the old fashion \\&quot;hot comb on the stove\\&quot; routine. It got straight, but I got burned really bad, not to mention burning out my hair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I bought this flat iron, but didn&#x27;t use it. I put it in the drawer and forgot about it. My bestfriend came over with her daughter and tell me that she was going to get her hair flat iron at some girls house for $25. That&#x27;s when I remember I had it. I told her to try this first. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As she was doing her hair, I just stood there with my mouth wide open! It looked like silk (no joke). Renee (bestfriend) started aguing with me. telling me that I never used it, so she should be able to take it. NOT!!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I used it on my all natural hair, and was so happy!!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I went over to my mothers house and she was mad. She said I went a whole year trying to grow my relaxer out, just to get a new relaxer. When I told her about my Sedu, She couldn&#x27;t believe it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thank you Thank you Thank you!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was always skeptical about these flat irons, purchased a couple in the past years, didnt work. Someone recommended this one...told me to make sure I buy the \\&quot;SEDU\\&quot; Brand only. My hair is naturally super wavy, thick, and long. I pay alot at the hair salon just to blow dry it straight, not to mention all that pulling hair they do. After trying this...WOW!!! I love it. I can straighten my hair super fast and it leaves it shiny. I get compliments all the time. This doesn&#x27;t burn my hair, leaves it healhty looking. I soooo recommend this flat iron, NO OTHER WORKS THE SAME. It was costing me alot to have my hair professionally straighten at the salon, this is worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a replacement to my other Sedu hair straighter...that lasted 7 years! Love the larger plate and how silky it leaves your hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener in August of 2013 and it&#x27;s still going strong today. I use it anywhere from 4-7 times a week and I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any &amp;#34;wear and tear&amp;#34; on it - it still heats up quickly, stays at the right temperature (though you do sometimes need to wait 10-20 seconds for it to get back to your desired heat after a few chunks of hair have been straightened), and it straightens my hair very nicely. My hair is very thick, midway down my back, and rather curly (not tight ringlets but lots of wavy curls) and I can straighten all of it in about 7-11 minutes (if I have also blowdried it beforehand to help with the straightening process). If I straighten it after letting it air dry curly, it&#x27;s about 10-12 minutes. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome straightener! I had this straightener from ninth grade till the first year of college. It worked perfectly well, and always left my hair silky and straight. I have hair up to my butt and it took only about 20 minutes to get my hair perfectly straight. After using typical Revlon and Connair products, it was nice to spend money on a product and actually get good results! I recommend this product to everyone! My hair is thick, curly, and frizzy and this product tamed my hair so well. After four years of good use (straightening every day), it finally stopped working or heating up as well. Great product!</li>
            <li> I returned this item. I&#x27;m a stylist and against my better judgement I ordered this brand I have never heard of on the reviews.  It did not get nearly hot enough and I had to squeeze the handle very hard to have it close down on the hair. Very disappointing.  Amazon did not have a problem refunding my money &amp; they didn&#x27;t even require that I return the product which was odd.  So I donated it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really lightweight and easy to use. The bigger plates make it a faster process for my wavy hair. It doesn&#x27;t fry my hair either. I have been using Sedu for about 8 years now and it&#x27;s been reliable thus far. I do recommend being careful not to drop it too many times since the edge that holds the plate can break and loosen it a bit. One of the plates has been held in place by 3 edges for a year now, but it still works just fine other than making a light rattle noise. IMO, this works far better than Chi (which I used prior to purchasing Sedu).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a liscenced cosmetologist and this is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned period. The design is a little boxy though but its a great product</li>
            <li> Great product. As advertised.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly less breakage and hair stays soft and straight all day.  Does not make hair look dull or lifeless!!</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell is 10x&#x27;s better, if I could I would of got Paul Mitchell which I had been using for 10 years but decided to try something new.</li>
            <li> It works well, and the ceramic plates make the hair smoother. The wide iron makes the time shorter. Worth buying.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at the recommendation of my daughter to replace using my Chi iron.  I do like the wider plates and the variable temperature control.  However, even with mostly straight, fine hair, I get the best results with the temp turned up most of the way.  I do miss the swivel cord from my Chi, but it was simply causing too much breakage compared to this Sedu.  Also, the tourmaline plates do seem to impart much more shine to my hair.  I am still using Biosilk serum and/or finishing spray since these work best on my hair giving silky results.  There is no indicator light to tell you when it reaches the temperature you have selected and does take a bit longer to get there than the Chi.  While annoying, I find my hair laying everywhere from breakage after using my Chi more annoying!</li>
            <li> Love the Sedu.  I purchased my first 1 inch Sedu a couple of years ago and it shorted out after maybe 2 years of use.  This one is the same, older version as that one but a 1.5 inch.  I opted for the older version in lieu of the newer one because I liked my 1 inch so much.  I wish they still carried this version in the 1 inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this Sedu and the Babyliss Pro at the same time.  The Babyliss feels amazing - great, sleek design with a good handle and smooth feel.  The plates on the Babyliss are long compared to the shorter Sedu.  The Sedu doesn&#x27;t have the sleek design or ease of handle BUT it straightens like a dream.  They both get very hot, the Babyliss maybe even more so...but the Sedu just seems to curl the hair better and straighten without heat damage like the Babyliss.  My hair looks super smooth and shiny after a Sedu pass...but somewhat fried after a Babyliss pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this one.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is amazing. It has a knob where you can control the temperature. It has has an on off switch so that you can turn it off manually instead of just unplugging it. The plates are amazing. They make my hair feel really smooth. I have never owned a flat iron that works as well as this one.</li>
            <li> If you go to the Sedu website they have a counterfeit warning.  I&#x27;m not saying these are counterfeit but there is a 2 year warranty only valid if you buy from an authorized dealer and amazon is not.  I will be buying mine from Ulta.  Go on the website for authorized dealers.</li>
            <li> Does the job but seems very expensive. Other units priced 50% or more less do the same thing, save money and consider a cheaper brand.</li>
            <li> The 1&amp;#34; ceramic pieces on this flat iron did not touch each other uniformly.  Sent it back and bought a Chi that my daughter loves.</li>
            <li> I want to make it clear that I&#x27;ve purchased 3 of these from Folica.com, who is an authorized dealer of Sedu. The flat irons worked well to straighten, and I loved how my hair looked, but they have flaws with the cord assembly, so don&#x27;t expect it to last more than a year or two. The green power light flickers, and the iron won&#x27;t stay on, therefore there&#x27;s not enough heat to straighten.  The Sedu brand is expensive and they need to fix the flaws with their irons.  All of my irons had the same problem, and Folica who is an authorized dealer refused to replace it, because they said it was out of warranty.  There is a ton of feedback from others on Folica website stating their irons stopped working after 6 months to a year!   Another reviewer said he took it apart to find the problem and he thinks it was the cord assembly inside, which showed him exactly why the iron wasn&#x27;t working. See below for what he found.  &amp;#34;In order to allow the cord to swivel, there is a conductive rod type connector that fits into a stationary thin circular strip of metal. This conductive rod actually turns with the cord as it swivels, and over time this rod will arc (short) against the metal strip and slowly destroy it! This is why you have to have the cord in a certain position, because that thin metal strip is being eaten away and it will only make contact when the rod is moved against it just right. Therefore, this design will never last once the thin metal strip starts to be zapped away.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay hot for very long. I keep having to stop doing my hair and let it heat up again after every layer. I miss my old Sedu:(</li>
            <li> I naturally have thick wavy hair and this straightener does the job pretty well.  However, after about 9 months of using it about every other day it just didn&#x27;t turn on one day.  I sent it back with the warranty and got another one because it really does do a nice job and here I am just about 12 months later and this one did the same exact thing.  I was in the middle of doing my hair and noticed it wasn&#x27;t hot anymore and realized even though it was supposed to be on it just died on me.....again.  Not the best thing to happen the morning of graduation.  It&#x27;s unfortunate because it works so well but just very unreliable.</li>
            <li> It died after a while....</li>
            <li> Not happy at all :-( and it is already broken and I had not even had it for a week. I am very sad about this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter and she thinks it is one of the best flat irons she as ever used.</li>
            <li> I had one of these flat irons for a few years and it worked great. After about 3 years, it just stopped turning on for no reason. I got a new one and it lasted a year and ended up not turning on again for no reason what so ever one day. Just for the fact that I&#x27;ve had two of the same exact product just stop working in the same way, makes these flat irons too unreliable. Would recommend for someone who doesn&#x27;t mind buying a brand new one every year.</li>
            <li> I am unable to understand why this product is so cheaply made when it costs 110$?! the heat adjustment is button is so wierd. Is this a fake? How do I find out?</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron! I have had mine for 5 years and I would never go to another type after this. I have curly medium course hair and this took half the time of my previous straightener. I need lots of heat and this does the job at med heat. It does seem cheap when you look at it but it&#x27;s just very simple looking and not flashy and it definitely holds up (even to a two year old getting it out of the drawer and dropping it).  My only issue with it, was it doesn&#x27;t open wide, it took a while to get used to but it doesn&#x27;t even bother me now. The 30 second warmup is fantastic! I also don&#x27;t get near the number of split ends I did before either. Love this product! Definitely worth the cost!</li>
            <li> I purchased a human hair wig and I used the Sedu flat iron on it.  The hair came out bone straight, just the way I like it.  I have also tried it on my natural African American hair, and again, the Sedu did not disappoint me.  The Sedu is a great flat iron to purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like this. I have very thick hair, and LOTS OF IT! Gotta say it lives my hair super straight, and my hair feels great. It does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> The straightener did not heat quickly as the Sedu should when received.  Within  3 weeks of receipt of the item it quit working completely, there are lots of reports of counterfeit items out there which makes me think this could have been one.  It was returned and a full refund issued by Amazon.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this flat iron but I jumped in based on the reviews I read. I&#x27;m glad I did. My daughter (14) and I both love, love, love it! It does a fantastic job straightening my hair. I have very fine, naturally curly hair and I can straighten it with this flat iron and you would never guess that my hair was so curly. In fact the other weekend I was staying in a hotel for a few days and the blow dryer was broken in my room. I showered one evening and went to bed with wet hair, I got up the next morning with my wild, slept on hair and straightened it, you would never know that I woke up looking like Medusa! I love this flat iron, it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing....I wish it had an automatic shut off, but I will live with it.</li>
            <li> Best I have ever used&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair soft and shiny, have used escape real other brands this is by far the best</li>
            <li> THIS IS A FAKE!!!!!!!! AMAZON IS NOT AN AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTOR!!! DO NOT BUY!!! I bought this flat iron because I had always had extremely positive results with sedu in the past (much better than chi and others). However, this purchase was so incredibly disappointing that it is hard for me to believe this is a genuine product. First of all, it snagged my hair like cheap flat irons do whereas my old sedu ran through my hair so smoothly and rarely ever ripped a hair out. Second of all, it dried my hair out and it just looked terrible after I finished &amp;#34;straightening&amp;#34; it. I had to drag out my ancient chi to go over my hair and give it some shine. This was questionable as well because my old sedu always left my hair shiny and soft. Thirdly, it took an incredibly long time to get my hair &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; and my hair is thin so something was not right there. I URGE YOU NOT TO BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM AMAZON. I truly believe sedu is an excellent company based on my past experience, but if you would like to buy a sedu iron, do so from elsewhere. GET YOUR SEDU FROM FOLICA or another AUTHORIZED DISTRIBUTOR.</li>
            <li> Worked awesome for three years, more than what I thought my wife would get out of this. I love straight hair on a female.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it better than her Chi</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 2 years and loved it. When it broke, I bought the same product from a retailer who offered a discounted price. When the product arrived, just looking at it seemed different somehow. When I used it, I was so disappointed. The hot iron element didn&#x27;t heat up properly. I&#x27;m guessing what I may have unknowingly bought was a refurbished product. Perhaps that&#x27;s why it was so cheap. Even when I returned the product 8 weeks ago, I still haven&#x27;t received my refund. My thinking is my problem is more a company that may not have sold me  a new product but a used one ;-(. Until I receive the refund and shipping promised, I&#x27;m feeling like a victim of bait and switch.</li>
            <li> I have used many straightening irons in the past and this is by far the best.  I have wavy hair so it is somewhat hard to get straight but not with the Sedu it works like a charm.  If you are looking for an iron that is reasonable priced look NO MORE, because this one is the BOMB.</li>
            <li> Extremely Love my new straightener!! I use it almost everyday. It does the job perfectly, I don&#x27;t have to leave on my hair long, just glide it over and it does not have to be on the highest temperature setting.</li>
            <li> My old cheap HerStyler would rarely work because it wouldn&#x27;t heat up all the way and when it did, it constantly shut off or cooled down so that my hair was only slightly less curly and not straight at all. It would take me 20 minutes for a poor style. I almost cut my hair in frustration that I was trying to grow out.    This Sedu straightener heat up immediately and stayed on temperature. It took me less than 5 minutes and my hair is straight and shiny. PERFECT! The Sedu is worth the extra money. In this case you really do get what you pay for. I don&#x27;t buy CHI or anything from Farouk. If you don&#x27;t know why. look him up.</li>
            <li> Great flat iron, really does improve the feel and health of the hair.  Works fast, heats up in seconds and has temperature control since I have sensitive hair and need less heat.  One minor thing, the plates are thin so if you use your other hand to help push them or roll it thru the hair, it can be hot - not a big deal but worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> Glad my online research paid off! Works better than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve had. Amazingly quick to heat, silky smooth to use and simple to store. Pricey, yes, but saving time and trouble is worth it.</li>
            <li> amazing one of the best i have used</li>
            <li> The reviews are really good and also it is in right price range for me. It was working fine for few days,  but then after it stopped working completely. Looks like the internal circuit is mal functioning... I dont undersatnd..Is it the problem with the seller or the brand itself. I had the same experience with the CHI brand in year 2012, which made me buy this one in yera 2013. Overall, I lost aruound 220$ dollars for these straighteners.  I am really scared to buy another one..</li>
            <li> The plates did not close there is a gap between the plates so it really does not flat iron hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a couple of Chi&#x27;s and a Babyliss and the Sedu outperforms those tremendously. It makes my hair so straight and smooth and it stays that way all day, which is a miracle since my hair is thick and frizzes very easily. I also love that it is so light-weight. The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is that the cord doesn&#x27;t swivel, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for this outstanding flat iron.</li>
            <li> it heats fast but doesn&#x27;t straighten in one stroke.  it takes a few strokes before it straightens unless you go very slowly.  the 1.5 inch makes it harder in tight areas like short bangs or closer to the face area</li>
            <li> It will never do all that your stylist do with a straightening iron but it warms up super fast and does a fine/average job.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to damage our hair so far (had it a couple months).</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.  Good temperature control, nice and wide.  Leaves my hair really nice.  Would definitely recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> My hair type...long, very thick, wavy, very frizzy, and a lot of it (like Julia Roberts when she first came on the scene)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved my Solia but after 3 years the plates unattached. It scared me because it happened while straightening my hair. I decided to try the Sedu because I thought it would last longer and I was really curious if it were better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOLIA PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Swivel cord never got tangled, I have to battle the Sedu every use&lt;br /&gt;- It got hotter&lt;br /&gt;- My hair stayed straight for days in the Florida humidity, with the Sedu I have to keep straightening though the day.&lt;br /&gt;- It was easier for me to maneuver&lt;br /&gt;- The plates touch, with the Sedu there is a slight gap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SEDU PROS&lt;br /&gt;- It only takes one swipe to get my hair bone straight, Solia it took around 3&lt;br /&gt;- Short time to straighten hair, Solia took about 10 min. more&lt;br /&gt;- Easier to clean, Sedu just a wipe with a dry cloth, Solia needed a cleaning iron solution&lt;br /&gt;- Lighter&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, my hair did get caught in the Solia once in a while&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of these irons are way better than any drug store or discount store iron I have tried but over all the Solia is way better for me. I&#x27;m going to go ahead and buy another Solia even though my Sedu is only a couple months old. I wouldn&#x27;t mind it so much if I didn&#x27;t have to keep straightening my hair (sometimes 3 extra times a day). If I don&#x27;t have time to keep straightening, I have to keep rubber bands in my purse to put my hair up. That&#x27;s a big problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I learned...IF IT&#x27;S NOT BROKE DON&#x27;T FIX IT.</li>
            <li> I thought this was one of the best hair straighteners I had ever purchased. It has worked wonders on my naturally curly hair, even during the summer BUT I&#x27;ve only had it maybe a year and it is already on the blink!! There seems to be a problem with the cord, as other people who have given reviews have stated. But I purchased it any way thinking maybe I would purchase a good one. Ha!! No such luck! I would not recommend purchasing this product because I consider it a jip! Considering the price of this straightener, it should last well over a year, even two...much longer. So a big thumbs down from me!!</li>

            <li> The iron was as described- heating, great manageable size, and it gives a perfect finish. It is worth the price and I expect to be using it for a while. Love it!</li>
            <li> I wash my hair in the morning and then use the flat iron in the evening when my hair is dry. I have really thick coarse long hair and it takes me 20 minutes to flat iron my hair. No frizz!</li>
            <li> I love this brand this straightener period. I have been using this for three years. Now i HAVE A NEW ONE AND I am very happy with it stillll.</li>
            <li> It feels less expensive, maybe even &#x27;cheap&#x27;, because it is really light and doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of electronic controls.  But that is far from the truth.  Because it is so lightweight it makes straightening my hair much easier.  The high setting works amazingly on my long coarse hair without any burning.  I thought I loved my previous straightener, but this one is tons better.</li>
            <li> Excellent flat iron. Works quickly and efficiently. Easy to grip and portable for travel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually do reviews, but feel inclined to do so based on a very scary experience with Sedu&#x27;s 6000 hair dryer. I had really liked using the dryer - fast results! But one day, after about 14 months of normal usage, IT CAUGHT ON FIRE IN MY HAND! Sparks shot out of the base of the dryer, melted the wire, and it short circuited. Needless to say, I was pretty shaken up and thankful that my hair didn&#x27;t catch on fire (it did burn my hand a bit). Furthermore, even though I had a 2-yr warranty, the company refused to issue me a refund. It&#x27;s been horrible. I post this review in an effort to allow other consumers to choose another product and not have a similar or worse experience with this company.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few years ago &amp; I now see it in my history and I have to say. I got it because of all the rave reviews, however mine did not impress me. It stopped heating up within one month of use. Don&#x27;t bother, stick to irons you have always used.</li>
            <li> Best straightener ever made!</li>
            <li> Ive tried many different flat iron&#x27;s, and this one is by far the best. I had my 1&amp;#34; Sedu for over 6 years with no issues and loved it. I gave it to my sister and got myself the 1.5. The main reason I love this flat iron so much is because it causes minimal breakage/damage and leaves your hair looking really healthy.</li>
            <li> Purchased Aug 7, 2013 AND IT ALREADY BROKE!  BOHO WEST REFUSING TO EXCHANGE DUE TO POLICY.  VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED!  WILL NEVER PURCHASE HERE AGAIN!  SEDU.COM CLAIMS THIS TO BE A COUNTERFEIT!  BUYER BEWARE!I ordered this as a replacement to my original purchase (folica.com) My original iron was amazing!  the best straight iron, hands down.  This one doesn&#x27;t get nearly as hot (though turned up all the way)..  Just not the same as my first one.</li>
            <li> I had submitted a review in February after owning this iron for about 10 months.  Now that I have owned it a year and no longer have a warranty it has quit working.  It is a great iron, but only plan to have it for a year.  If you are only interested in a short time using a great iron, and then spending the 100+ dollars again, then GET THIS IRON.      I was VERY disappointed when it broke, as I thought I&#x27;d get 2-3 years out of it.  It is made really lightweight...so I guess it should not have surprised me. I just hate spending more money so soon.  I am going to send it to the company and see if they will help me. SAVE your receipt. I typically ALWAYS do, but for some reason I can&#x27;t find this one. ugh</li>
            <li> I have purchased sooooo many flat irons for the past few years, and this one by far is my favorite!  Sedu makes great products that live up to their standard!!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> i had the chi for awhile - and switched to sedu a few years ago. i end up buying a new one every year or two - but that&#x27;s more due to my clumsiness rather than the quality of the product. it heats up super quickly and gets very hot. over all makes my very curly hair very straight with minimal effort. very happy</li>
            <li> Love, the product.. wide plates and quick straightening.  You will never find yourself smelling a very hot plate, also it does not not ever burn your scalp.  this product worked for me less than a year until one day it just stopped working.</li>
            <li> The only straightener my curly head daughter will use!</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter wanted a really good flat iron since she irons her hair everyday....After days of reading reviews and searching, I purchased this product and am sooo satisfied....My teenager LOVES the way it makes her hair so silky...(and we all know how difficult it is to satisfy a teen girl)</li>
            <li> I needed a new iron after my (I guess looking back at it---VERY DEPENDABLE) CHI of a couple of years died. So I looked at many reviews and everywhere pointed to this iron as the freaking god of all irons. It lasted only THREE months before it just stopped working. The green light would just turn off, and I would have to hold it in the most impossible angles just to have it start to heat up again. Then finally, two days ago, it just stopped working all together. After relentlessly waving it around in different angles for 10 minutes, I just gave up. Should have looked into this \\&quot;cord problem\\&quot; more intently, even though its not a swivel cord anymore. Stupid, crappy engineering! While it worked, it DID straighten well, too bad it lasts as long as something that should be priced 10 dollars should last. I&#x27;m literally never buying a Sedu again unless they figure out how to produce non-crappy irons. I cannot believe I wasted my hard-earned money on this piece of junk. If you&#x27;re going to be spending this much on an iron, might as well just go ahead and spend more on one that doesn&#x27;t have a breakage problem. Right now I&#x27;m going to try the Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium iron and see if it doesn&#x27;t break within three months. -____-</li>
            <li> I bought mine 6 years ago and its still goin! I should get another one just because its so old and I don&#x27;t know when it might give out. It has never given me a problem. I have very unruly mixed chick hair and it gets my hair silky and shiny. No frizz and humidity gets past. I round brush it, and then flat iron. If your hesitant to spend the money just go for it! Its worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have had this straightener for three years and have zero complaints! I have extremely thick, ornery hair, and this straightener makes it sleek and board straight. The heat output is spectacular, much hotter than any cheap straightener I&#x27;ve owned. I also really love the wider end. It straightens more of my hair at one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, it&#x27;s worth the price! And if something happens to it, just write to the company, and they will replace it for free! (This happened to me one year into my first Sedu; I&#x27;ve now had this current one for three years).</li>
            <li> I have the Infiniti which I paid $100 when it came out, I have the Joico Vapor Iron another $100 and this.......THIS ONE far exceeds the other two.......hair is very very shiny, a single pass, maybe 2 at the most and your done, I am a female of color I have long thick hair, in other words ETHNIC hair and this iron is amazing, even it burns out in a year its worth getting another</li>
            <li> Great, easy to use, lightweight flat iron. I have one for home and one for travel now. Heats up quickly, holds its heat and can flatten hair effortlessly since it&#x27;s so lightweight. I have long very thick hair and this makes straightening it a bit easier.</li>
            <li> I just love this flat iron. It&#x27;s light and does an amazing job in closing the hair cuticle on my damaged, chemically treated, thin hair. My hair looks soft and shiny. I couldn&#x27;t find a better one yet, and I tried them all, you name it, from Revlon to Chi, Babyliss, Solia, and all top brands.</li>
            <li> I bought this iron for my wife in July 2009. She loved it but the iron developed an electrical short where the cord enters the iron. After doing some research my wife told me that 3 years is about the maximum life expectancy for a straightening iron. On June 18, reluctantly, I ordered this same straightening iron as a replacement. This one has shorted out in the same place but after only 4 months! Not impressed! Save your money--buy something else.</li>
            <li> pulled on my hair, even using a heat protection spray.  Had one for several years then accidentally stepped on it (no it wasn&#x27;t on)&amp; broke it.  Maybe it was a different model than the one I had before because that one worked like a dream:(</li>
            <li> I have owned many, many flat irons (Chi &amp; Solia were my last ones) and this one is definitely my favorite. I have had it for a few months and it has not disappointed. I have curly hair (not ringlets but very curly) and because of this straightner everyone thinks I have straight hair! I usually use a blowdryer to dry my hair but not to straighten it (it is a huge, puffy mess when done). This straightner can take my full head of fluffy hair and straighten it within 10 minutes. My hair is beautifully shiny and not dry, or frizzy like I have dealt with in the past.My hair even stayed (almost) frizz free in the Houston August humidity - an amazing feet for my hair! Instead of getting frizzy in the humidity my hair would get a little wavy but I would take that any day over the mess the humidity used to turn my hair into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;controsl frizz&lt;br /&gt;shiny hair (some people see this as a con but my hair looks healthy)&lt;br /&gt;many heat settings&lt;br /&gt;straightens easily and quickly&lt;br /&gt;does not burn hair&lt;br /&gt;heats up quickly&lt;br /&gt;wide plates to straighten more hair at once&lt;br /&gt;plug - it isn&#x27;t the 3 prong plug I am used to with other straightners so now I can plug it in with my hairdryer instead of having to dry my hair then straighten after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;can get very hot to touch&lt;br /&gt;nothing else so far.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a high end hair straightner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Chi and Solia flat irons both died on me right after their year anniversaries so I will update when this one hits a year to hopefully say it is still working wonderfully. Even when they were new and working great, the Chi and Solia straightners didn&#x27;t leave my hair as healthy looking as the Sedu has.</li>
            <li> I bought this after buying into the many rave reviews and was rightfully disappointed.  My hair was not &amp;#34;softer, silkier, or smoother than ever!&amp;#34;.  The plate edges are straight rather than beveled, and clamp rather than float, so it does not glide through your hair without catching the ends and DOES leave impression marks.  The swivel cord is so rigid that my iron will only lay on it&#x27;s side.&lt;br /&gt;I just can&#x27;t imagine what the other reviewers were using before they bought this over-priced, average, hair appliance.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest flat iron you could ever ask for. It saves so much time to straighten your hair. If you can spend the extra dollars go for this iron, you wont regret it.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> There are a few reasons why I haven&#x27;t returned this product yet:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I&#x27;m absolutely lazy at that kind of stuff, returning within the X day window, etc&lt;br /&gt;2) I&#x27;d have to be flat ironless for a few days, at least&lt;br /&gt;3) It&#x27;s not that bad, I guess&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really miss the absence of a spring, because how I used to curl hair with the CHI was to straighten a small length of the section, then twirl the loose hair once around the iron, and pull it through.  When I did that, the entire length came out curly.  Try doing that with the Sedu.  Because of the lack of spring / glide, you&#x27;d just get jerk marks all over your hair.  By twisting my hand back and forth throughout the length, I am able to get a wavy / pseudo-curly look, though nowhere as controlled or intentional looking as with the CHI (the curls seem to fall where they wish).  This is also WAY more work than I&#x27;m willing to do after buying such an expensive product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now would you believe it, this iron doesn&#x27;t have an auto off feature.  I went on a day trip and shortly after I left realized that I may not have turned off the iron.  I just figured it would be off when I came back, like my CHI seemed to do.  I got back several hours later and it was still on.  If you&#x27;re going to buy this, either make sure you&#x27;re not forgetful, or be sure your renter&#x27;s / home owners&#x27;s insurance policy is up-to-date and covers fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron also seems to direct heat towards the scalp first.  I know I&#x27;m not supposed to flat iron damp hair, but I do sometimes because I don&#x27;t spend enough time getting my hair completely dry.  My other irons didn&#x27;t seem to mind too much, but this iron seems to direct heat downwards first, so you do feel that burn and really can&#x27;t get very close to your scalp if it&#x27;s at all damp.  Especially in your ear area, ouch! (Thankfully not speaking from experience on the ear stuff, just my guess).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like how lightweight it is, and it seems to do an okay job straigening the hair.  But when I spring the extra cash for a product like this, it&#x27;s gotta multitask and work flawlessly.  IMO there are other products out there deserving of the price tag on this one, and they do a lot better job.</li>
            <li> love this flat iron i cant believe i didnt know about it earlier and i have curly nappy hair.l. and this makes my hair so shinny and soft..a must buy!!</li>
            <li> We had the same Sedu flat iron for 5 years. It just broke and we ordered this one.  This is by far the best flat iron we ever had.  My daughter and myself have wavy frizzy hair that is hard to manage.  With this tool styling your hair in the morning is a breeze.  It will not burn it or pull it like other flat irons we bought used to do.  It is very reliable, heats fast and stays clean.  Totally worth the money, and our old one did pay for itself saving us money on professional styling.</li>
            <li> This is great, does not burn my treated hair and is quick and easy to use. Major superior to cheap flat irons and worth the price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone. It&#x27;s that good!!!! Also, like the fact the company offers a 1 year warranty on it. This makes my hair looks so amazing. I&#x27;m very happy  about this.</li>
            <li> I literally bought this iron almost a decade ago and still use it today. I bought this back in high school, circa 2006. I hated how Chi irons at the time always broke (plus I used to find that my hair would get caught on the edge), so I decided to try a new brand. It straightens perfectly and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. I have very long, thick, slightly wavy hair, and straightening it can take forever if I have to go over it a few times but with this iron I can be done in under 10 minutes. I took this to college with me and my friends all started switching over once they tried it. Now living in NYC, my roommate borrowed my iron recently and immediately went and bought the same one. She was shocked when I told her I bought it in high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this iron probably 3x a week on almost the highest temperature. I&#x27;ve dropped it countless times and have a small nick on the side, but it functions like it did on day 1. I recommend it to all, and when it finally does kick the bucket I&#x27;m absolutely getting another one.</li>
            <li> This is the best iron I have EVER used. I&#x27;ve used Chi and even a GHD gold series and this is the best one. I have long, this, corse, curly hair. The chi damaged my hair. The GHD left it puffy with some kinks. The Sedu leaves it smooth and straight. I have tons of shine and it actually lays flat. And my bangs and layers do not stick out anymore. I would recommend this to anyone. I can&#x27;t imagine doing my hair without it.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sedu- The first one lasted over a year then conked out on me and wouldn&#x27;t turn on (don&#x27;t know why??) I immediately bought a new one. I have extremely thick, naturally curly brown hair and it takes me about 20 minutes to do my whole head. I get compliments all the time on how straight and shiny my hair is. I thought about the Chi but decided on the Sedu to be different and it has definately paid off. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I got my first sedu about four years ago (the first one, that is). I praised it and suggeted to my family members that oooohed and ahhhed to get one as well. After almost 6 months I plugged it in and sparks shot out of it. I know what you&#x27;re thinking: lower the heat! It was on its lowest level.  I sent it back, as it was under warranty, where I had to pay a fee for shipping.  Second one recieved! By this time my aunt and bestie baught the product, and their cords burned through!! They plugged it in and smoke! They did not return for a replacement as I told them how similar their experiences were.  A year into my second one, you&#x27;ll never guess! My cord began to smoke and I could see that it was burning throught the rubber cording to show severed wire! It too had burned through. Faulty manufacturing, I assumed. Sent in, same fee. Third one sent out. New cord, new plug, new hope. Plugged it in a while back....I do not exaggerate--dead as a doornail. Light won&#x27;t go on, no heat. Thankfully, no smoke, spark or shock at this point. I was a happy spokesperson, and after three form me, three from friends and family that followed suit, I can say SEDU SUCKS!! On average, I was buying one every year. Save you money to invest in a functional, lasting ceramic iron.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on my hair all the time. I have owned a chi and I have to say SEDU this is exactly what I was looking for. It is so good that I do not need any shine products to make my hair look shiny. You can not go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Ughh, let me just say how shocked I was on the body of this flat iron. It is very cheaply made. Compared to other flatirons in the same price category, I was so shocked that this is what people have been hyping. What is the hype about?! I flat ironed my african american kinky hair and it did a sub par job. It wasn&#x27;t anything to run home about. I actually had to grab hold of my other iron to finish off the job. This flat iron is seriously overpriced!!! I&#x27;d soo prefer a solia!</li>
            <li> I have a combination type 4a, b, c  curly coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this iron with a tension comb to get my hair super straight.  I probably should have gotten the smaller size for now, but this one does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and thanks to Lashauna D. Willis&#x27; review as it helped me in my decision.. lol</li>
            <li> I have used countless drugstore and high-end flat irons over the past 10 years. This is by far my favorite. I love the wide plates for my long thick hair, the incredibly fast heat-up time, and the long cord! The only reason I am on my second one is because I let my first Sedu fall off the dresser too many times and the hinge eventually broke and the plates didn&#x27;t line up anymore (still worked though!)</li>
            <li> Bought this iron because of all the good reviews. It&#x27;s really light in weight but it catches the ends of your hair too tightly I feel..maybe because the blades close in on it so tight.. also.. the blinking light and on/off switch and temp dial is located near at the hinge of the tool, rather than on the top side of one of the arms.. making it kind of hard to see at times. small and compact but not as great as everyone says...doesn&#x27;t glide as smooth as T3 irons</li>
            <li> Does the job but the problem isn&#x27;t the quality of straightening it&#x27;s the quality of the product itself.  Used it maybe ten times this year, bought brand stinking new.  All of a sudden it shorts so ill be straightening n it loses connection and heat.  I&#x27;m not the only review that says this by far.  For spending $150 on this I thought it was the socket.  Nope.  I personally wouldn&#x27;t buy one had ever again.</li>
            <li> My hair is damaged, dry and frizzy.  I have previously bought flat irons at Sally&#x27;s that did ok, but never worked as well as I would have liked.  While I did have to go over each piece 3 or 4 times, my hair did turn out shiny and soft.  I used this after my shower (when my hair is at it&#x27;s worst) and was surprised it got my hair as straight as it did. I was happy to see the temp went so high, because my hair won&#x27;t respond to anything less. I will have to see what my hair looks like tomorrow to form my final opinion.</li>
            <li> Works really well. I have long frizzy hair and this works much faster.&lt;br /&gt;Your hair doesnt get stuck in it, or around it. Heats yup super fast and you can straighten your hair much faster then a lot of other brands</li>
            <li> This is the best straightener that I have ever used - and believe me - I have tried many.  At first, I thought it was a bit expensive, but then discovered that you get what you pay for!!  It heats up very quickly which is important when rushing to get to work in the morning. My hair is very thick and wavy- frizzy. Within five minutes, I have a glossy straight finish.  I have owned this straightener for a little over six months and am still thrilled with it!</li>
            <li> Love it!  My hair doesn&#x27;t snag in the Sedu as in my old flat iron.  Also I can straighten it in 5 minutes vs the 20 minutes it use to take me.</li>
            <li> My daughter had bought one of these somewhere such a good iron went to Amazon to purchase. Loved it, heats well but now after 5 months this has quit working. I do love it so hope to exchange it.</li>
            <li> I loved this straightener. It worked so well on my thick curly hair. But, I haven&#x27;t even had this product for a year when all of a sudden it died on me. It will not work. And there is no reason why it stopped working. It&#x27;s horrible made if it burns out less than a year from buying it. And I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times. I would spend the extra money to get a better product that won&#x27;t die within the year of purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I have mixed hair, and it is EXTREMELY curly and hard to straighten. I purchased this product about 3-4 years ago because the CHI had died (after a year). I will admit that I only use it about once, maybe twice a month.. Since straightening your hair like that is extremely bad for your hair if you do it more than that with a flat iron.. I love this guy! It&#x27;s perfect. And after 3-4 years of use, it still works as if it&#x27;s new! I&#x27;d purchase another one once this one dies. Now to find a small flat iron to get the baby hairs around the front of my head.. That&#x27;s the trick. I&#x27;d recommend this flat iron to anybody!</li>
            <li> Hai, I m gethu sakthi wife, This is first time ,I have trouble to choose which one good for my hair for straighter or flat iron Or anything else ?. And another one which brand is good at low price also. Bez when I go to home town it is difficult to use there so ly plz help me. I m waiting for ur reply</li>
            <li> I have one of these and just orderd one for my daughter and I am going to order one for my niece.  Flat irons I have used before have damaged the natural texture of my hair, this does not and my curls are returning.  I am able to wear my hair straight or curly.</li>
            <li> Great product - works exactly as advertised and lasts for a while. It&#x27;s also heating up quickly - so would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The product seems to work fine but I&#x27;m not sure the iron they gave me was new. The box looked vaguely repackaged and there was no paperwork/instructions of any kind -- not in the product box, not in the wrapping box (not even a packing slip). When I turn the iron to medium position or higher, the light blinks. I reported this to &amp;#34;packaging&amp;#34; but no one ever replied. Anyway... It works fine now, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Very frustrated paying over $100 for an item that has shorted out in 8 months. My daughter only uses it a couple times a week so its more like a couple months of usage. She had one before and it lasted 2 years....I cant pay $100 every year for a flat iron!</li>
            <li> This iron worked very well for about 4 months. Unexpectedly the cord stopped working and I was no longer able to use this flat iron. I have used Sedu in the past but this model was terrible, unless I just got a lemon.</li>
            <li> Does not burn my hair. I use it when my hair is fully dry, because it works best for me that way. Leaves my hair silky smooth and super straight. I&#x27;ve used for about 2 months now and no complaints.</li>
            <li> I bought this in Jan, 2012 for my daughter and it already stopped working. It is not worth it. I will not recommend anyone to buy it.</li>
            <li> I liked this iron concept better than my GK D-600.  I liked how you turn the dial to set the temperature setting.  I wish the handles didn&#x27;t get slippery.</li>
            <li> This flat iron does not last!  It works good for awhile (maybe a year or so) and then it shorts out.  Not worth the price and I will be buying a different brand this time!</li>
            <li> I really like it leaves my hair perfect. I thought it would be a lil bigger than it actually is if not i would give it a 5</li>
            <li> Not what I expected!! This iron doesn&#x27;t straighten your correctly, it pulls your hair out cause of its plates and uneven surface.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain about the results that the Sedu Pro gave me -- that&#x27;s what the stars are for. Really, after using several brands of flat irons, including Solano and CHI, I can say with certainty that the Sedu gave me superior results and was also easier and quicker to use. There&#x27;s no coating on the plates that starts to flake off like you find on other irons, and I suspect it&#x27;s the sleek plates themselves that contribute to this product&#x27;s success. BUT ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I *can* complain about is the shoddy construction of the rest of it! I&#x27;m on my second Sedu now (1.5 years), and what seems to be happening with this iron is that the handle gets loose and the plates won&#x27;t align with each other. This morning, the plates finally gave way completely, the handle \\&quot;dismantled,\\&quot; and the iron is toast. Looking at the pieces I have left after the Sedu practically crumbled in my hand, I can see why this happened -- only a couple of strips of thin plastic keep the handle attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I only flat-iron my hair a couple of times a week, so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m giving the iron a workout. I really want the Sedu to work for me -- like I said, it gives me excellent results, far better than any other brand. But the construction of the device leaves a lot to be desired, and I really do not want to dish out another $100 + for an item that won&#x27;t even reach the year mark. Does anyone out there have a better recommendation? I&#x27;m willing to pay a little bit more for a product that&#x27;s more durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED TO ADD: Before I ordered another flat iron, I decided to do some research. Today I phoned Sedu directly to see if the company&#x27;s other models are more durable -- maybe it was the particular one I&#x27;ve been using (both times I&#x27;ve purchased the Pro). But the person I spoke with didn&#x27;t seem to know very much about the line she was representing and could give me no answers. Yikes!</li>
            <li> The sedu has multiple settings, heats up fast and makes my hair feel silky. I love it! This my second one and it was because I broke it after 8 years when I dropped it.</li>
            <li> I had an Enzo milano for 3 years . Found here $100 cheaper. My hair super smooth and in less time. Totally worth it. Looks: not fashionable but who cares?! Results is what matters. The plates ade perfect size cuts time in half</li>
            <li> Heats up fast. Nice feature prevents leaving the iron on.</li>
            <li> very good quality product. loves it. Good for thick and long hair. I love it. Save me a lot of time to flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> bought this for my girlfriend and it worked great for two months then it started giving her problems and eventually just stopped working! Very dissapointing for the price taf but worked great when it actually did work</li>
            <li> Received the flat iron within 2 days using Amazon Prime. However, after plugging it in for first time use it would not heat up to high temperatures. The Sedu should be able to reach temperatures of 410 degrees but even after 15 minutes was still only warm to the touch and didn&#x27;t seem to have  reached 150 degrees.</li>
            <li> Did not make my hair as straight and smooth as flat iron I have for less money. I was not impressed with the quality of this item and returned it.</li>
            <li> I own this flat iron for about three years. It works great. My hair seem to be soft and shiny after I use it to straighten my hair. I don&#x27;t need to retouch it the next day as I did with my older iron. However the only complain I have is about the design. I bought it online but I wish I looked at it in the store first. It looks ugly and very outdated.</li>
            <li> Worked great at first then started to have issues heating up after a year.  The light flickered on and off and it did not heat up properly. These issues arose despite my care for the straightner and never wrapping the word up tight. I would say this product is only worth  $40 max given its lack of longevity.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s keeping hair dry and fizzy 😖</li>
            <li> In Quantum physics, when you send negative ions around the space you are in they can often cause there to be overpopulation of these negative ions compared to the positives in your body, this can cause a unbalance in how your body and mind functions. This device will eventually do just that.</li>
            <li> My xwife&#x27;s Chi quit after a year, so we tried the Sedu... which works great for her long wavy hair, and she insists the heat output is far superior to any dept. store brands, and the difference is obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after 9 months of every other day use of the Sedu, she tells me the green light is intermittent, and has to move it just right to get it to stay on. I decided enough is enough and took it apart which was no easy task, they are pretty well sealed up, but for the price and such short time of use I wasn&#x27;t going to throw it in the trash without trying. Anyway, when I saw the cord assembly inside it showed me exactly why the iron wasn&#x27;t working. In order to allow the cord to swivel, there is a conductive rod type connector that fits into a stationary thin circular strip of metal. This conductive rod actually turns with the cord as it swivels, and over time this rod will arc (short) against the metal strip and slowly destroy it! This is why you have to have the cord in a certain position, because that thin metal strip is being eaten away and it will only make contact when the rod is moved against it just right. Therefore, this design will never last once the thin metal strip starts to be zapped away. What I decided to do was remove the rod and plate assembly, and I soldered the incoming power wires directly to the circuit board, carefully marking the + and - side as they were not labeled. I then used epoxy to carefully secure the wires into the assembly and the rest of the unit back together. Now with the cord secured and power always reaching the circuits, she&#x27;s been using the iron again with no issues. In summary, if you buy this iron, SECURE the cord at the base somehow to prevent the inevitable loss of connection. The swivel feature is great, but unless they fix the design it&#x27;s not worth it, and you&#x27;d rather have an iron that works well but doesn&#x27;t swivel than an iron that swivels but doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why are these \\&quot;professional\\&quot; hair irons only good for ~1 year? It is unfortunate one shoddy design in the unit ruins the whole thing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on recommendation. However, for no reason and after perfect care, it stopped heating! Stuck with the less expensive brands!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, if you get one that works.  And therein is my problem.  I got one that stop working in short order.  Well, the company does not replace or repair this product under warranty.  What they expect is that you ship it to them at your expense, pay them a hefty processing fee, and accept a refurbished (used) product as a replacement.  That&#x27;s not the way I expect to be treated as a customer.  That&#x27;s not my idea of standing behind your product.  If I was to start out again, I would find a reputable local dealer with an acceptable return policy and buy it there.  In short, this is a very good product, just don&#x27;t buy it on line if you expect adequate customer service.</li>
            <li> I had this Sedu Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron Hair Straightener for 2 years I bought it from folica.com. I bought this flat iron hoping it would cut down on my styling time, which is considerable because I have long very thick hair ( 2 hours from wash to styled ) This flat iron works as well as any other flat iron, except that it CAUGHT ON FIRE IN MY HAND!!!! I was ironing my hair after I had blown it out and i noticed a little bit of smoke. I thought I had just hit a damp patch in my hair and a little bit of steam was coming off the plates. Then I heard a POP and saw a spark, then a FLAME shot out of the joint while it was still in my hand next to my head! I didn&#x27;t get burnt or anything but it startled me and I threw the iron. I haven&#x27;t used it since, obviously. What if I had a bunch of hairspray in my hair?! My hair could have caught fire!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not rough on appliances either, I&#x27;ve had the same $25 Remington hair dryer for 9 years and it works great. SEDU IS JUST DANGEROUS OVER PRICED GARBAGE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to call them and see if I can have my warranty honored, I will update.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using the third one.  It works great.  It&#x27;s not comparable to cheap brands from drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;BUT my first two broke within two years.  I haven&#x27;t found one that works better than this and lasts longer, so I just keep buying it.  I use it every day.  I can&#x27;t live without it.  I wish they made it more durable.  Am I greedy if I expect it to last at least five years?</li>
            <li> Ok, so I actually got this straightener a little over a year ago and thought I wasn&#x27;t crazy about it, why? Because it was my hair that was the problem not the straighter. Im AA with relaxed thin hair that was dead and damaged and it took me a year after buying this staightner to get it in good health, now that I got in the state that I was it I could tell how effective this straighter is. K, I LOVE IT!!  It makes my hair so soft and smooth without leaving that icky brunt smell, it smells like the shampoo that you used after your done. So I would consider this a good product for relaxed hair!!</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron three months ago and have been extremely disappointed.  I had a 2&amp;#34; Remington flat iron for nearly eight years before it shorted out (pretty good for a $25 flat iron).  During the time I had my Remington, I finished college and have established a semi-successful career.  So when I began my search for a new iron, I decided to go &amp;#34;all-out&amp;#34;.  I read all the reviews and researched as much as possible.  The Sedu Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline Flat Iron Hair Straightener (1.5 inch) had good reviews and seemed like a good option for someone with thick and unruly hair.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it&#x27;s just my hair type (coarse, thick, and wavy), but the time it takes to straighten my hair nearly doubled.  With my Remington, it took approximately 30 minutes to straighten from start to finish and with the Sedu, it takes a good hour (no exaggeration).  I have to repeat my sections five to six times before my hair straightens. In addition, the blades are so small (1.5 inch-but very short in length) I can only straighten very small sections at a time. You cannot touch the outside of the blades because of the heat, which is disappointing to me because I like to press the outsides while styling.&lt;br /&gt;I have continued to use the iron, thinking that styling time would reduce as I got acclimated to my new iron; but to no avail.  Tonight I bought an updated version of my old Remington (S-9620) with 2&amp;#34; plates.  I tested it out immediately and love it! I can straighten large sections with only two to three repeats per section.&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry I ever bought the Sedu.  Lesson learned; just because something is more expensive, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s better quality or does a better job.</li>
            <li> It works ok but not as well as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> It is a really good straightener, but I found another that I like better.  Hence, the stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> I had this straightener for about 5 years. (I&#x27;ve heard that is a long life for a straightener.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately without a warranty they were not able to fix it when it FINALLY died. I felt that this was wasteful, however, I am readily buying another one. I will be sure to get the warranty this time..... SEDU FO LYFE</li>
            <li> COUNTERFEIT ACCORDING TO SEDU THAT IS.&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased two of these in the last two years- one for my wife and one for my daughter. One from an ulta store, one from amazon. Both have had the same problem- the wires inside the cord fray the protective coating off and short out making the iron not work or work intermittently. I fixed the one purchased from ulta since it was outside of the two year warranty. The one purchased from amazon quit after 11 months. Sedu does NOT recognize amazon as an \\&quot;authorized retailer\\&quot; of its products, will tell you that you bought a counterfeit version and then hang up on you when you ask if they will replace it under warranty. I have taken them apart and they are NOT built well inside. The wires are tiny and not shielded well at all.&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is- read the reviews here, and buy from an \\&quot;authorized retailer\\&quot;. Amazon will not take this back after 30 days. I repeat, these are no better than walmart or target specials. This coming from a person who knows electrical components. But, when they do work I am told they are awesome. They heat up instantly, this I know after fixing one and testing it myself. They get hot- fast.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd flat iron I have bought in the last year - the wiring in the cord keeps breaking.  This is too expensive of a flat iron to be made that poorly!!</li>
            <li> My Sedu just died after about 4 years. I&#x27;m re-buying it now. Far superior to Chi or any other brand I&#x27;ve tried. Unlike other straighteners I&#x27;ve used, this one does not catch and pull your hair. My long, wavy hair takes about 10 minutes to straighten. Smoother result than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Okay I never write product reviews, but this thing is seriously AMAZING! I have super kinky coarse hair and have tried all kinds of straightening methods and products. I had a Chi Turbo for years until it finally broke, and decided with all of the amazing reviews on this product I&#x27;d give it a try. Man were they right! You would NEVER know I had any kind of kink to my hair at all after I straighten it with the Sedu. It&#x27;s so silky and shiny too! And the best part about it is its size. I was disappointed at how small it was at first, but what a joy to my shoulder. It&#x27;s super light and compact. Seriously buy this! I would have spent 200 on it no problem so for 80 you really can&#x27;t pass it up. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I was using Maxiglide for about two years, and the steam from the maxiglide was reverting my 4B&amp;4C hair back to its supercurly state while I was trying to straighten my hair with it. Also the so-called detangling pins on my maxiglide was getting tangled in my hair, and causing some breakage. So, when my maxiglide started to leak, and I knew it was time to throw it in the&lt;br /&gt; garbage. I felt lost, but i had a new sedu flat iron that I never had used before, and I used it&lt;br /&gt;this morning and I straighted my hair on the&lt;br /&gt;360 heat temperature dial, and wow! this sedu&lt;br /&gt;is a nice straightener, but someone told me that the Babyliss flat irons can beat the sedu&lt;br /&gt;flat irons. Well in the future I will see if the babyliss flat irons can beat the sedu. For now I will continue to use my sedu flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money on purchasing cheap and expensive straighteners. Nothing worked to my satisfaction. This straightener is the best product I have bought in a very long time. It is best for working mothers. In not more than 15 minutes I get the look I want. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This was a great iron when it worked, unfortunately it only lasted for 3 - 4 months.  I bought it from Folica in July 2011.  It died in October of 2011.  I didn&#x27;t send it back until September 2011.  After paying $10 to ship it to them and $10 to get it back and the 2 weeks that it took to get to them and back, I got a new one.  This one worked about 3 months and after talking to Folica they paid the shipping there and back and I got a new one.  This too died after 3 months and Folica again paid for the shipping, but again, this is with time taken out of the warranty for shipping and the inconvenience of not having a a flat iron.  Well I got the new one and this one passed the 3 month mark and made it to 4 months.  Again, Folica paid for the shipping there and back, but I didn&#x27;t send it in right away again and now my warranty runs out in just a few weeks.  I don&#x27;t think that for the cost of this iron, that I got my money&#x27;s worth.  I called Exceon (maker of Sedu) and talked to a supervisor who told me in not so many words, that it was my tough luck and basically said that their product is great and she didn&#x27;t know why I had so many problems and indicated that many people loved their product and that I must have done something wrong.  Well I take good care of my stuff in general and especially for something expensive.  Each time it seemed that a wire shorted out and if you do some research you&#x27;ll find that others had the exact same problem.  The flat iron is exceptional when it works but the problem is it that it is really expensive and it doesn&#x27;t last long enough to pay what they are asking for it.  Hope this helps - as I said, look at other reviews, they all say pretty much the same thing....</li>
            <li> Not sure why this didn&#x27;t get a better overall review but this is amazing!  I don&#x27;t have tight curly hair, more of a loose S formation. I can get out the shower and let it air dry or, blow dry without putting effort (not using a round brush bc I&#x27;m lazy) and this flat iron not only makes my hair PIN STRAIGHT but it also makes it super shiny. I&#x27;ve had it for over 5 years and use it 3x a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it when I&#x27;ve worn my hair curly with some light Paul Mitchell glaze or other gel in it and i still get the same results and no residue sticks to the plates.</li>
            <li> I LOVED my Sedu!!!  I loved it so much that I purchased a second one because the first one got a short in the wire after I had it for a while.  I bought my second one off of an auction site and within 2 months, the same thing happened!  There is a short in the wire and it won&#x27;t stay on.  I contacted them to see if they will except an exchange although I do not have a receipt or the original packaging.  I have yet to hear back.  Although this has been the best flat iron I have ever used, I will not purchase another and suggest that you do not waste your money on this as it doesn&#x27;t last long!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews of how great this flat iron works, I had really high hopes. It came in the mail yesterday and today I washed, did a quick blow out and then tried this iron and was really dissapointed. It snags my hair and really didn&#x27;t leave it as nice as my 5 year old Chi does. The only thing I did like is that it has heat settings but that doesn&#x27;t stop the snagging and breaking of my hair. I am returning this product.</li>
            <li> So the straightener I bought came defective. The plates did not entirely close and the handle was a bit cracked. Also, when I first bought it I wasn&#x27;t super excited about the price but it&#x27;s better than what folica.com sells it for. My friend has the same flat iron and it makes your hair shiny, stays styled all day, and heats up fast. That&#x27;s why I know that this straightener would have been great, had it not been defective. Also, when I first bought it I wasn&#x27;t super excited about the price but it&#x27;s better than what folica.com sells it for.</li>
            <li> The first day this iron was like wow! After that I noticed my hair getting frizzy faster etc. It does get hot fast and cool fast when you turn it off that&#x27;s a plus for me. Since I have long hair this iron seemed a little small for the task and I was expecting results like my babyliss titanium pro (best iron). I still use it but not when I&#x27;m in a rush. I noticed if you part every small section and take your time your results will be amazing all in all this iron is good, I was just expecting more considering the reviews I had read.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as my CHI...I wasn&#x27;t super blown-away, maybe because a CHI is a good straightener too, but it works well.</li>
            <li> This straightener is AWESOME.  I bought this for my daughter who has extremelyh thick hair with tight kinky curls. After using this her hair is sleek and straight.  Most important is that she has gone from hating her hair to loving it &#x3D; priceless.</li>
            <li> I loved this flat iron until it stopped working. I returned it after having it for 6 months. They sent me a replacement. 6 months later, I&#x27;m having the same problem again. it&#x27;s not under warranty anymore, so I&#x27;m stuck with a pricey, not working flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;I use it just for my own use. So it&#x27;s not on a lot. Just for 15 minutes each day when I do my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd Sedu I&#x27;ve purchased - the first was for myself, and the second for my younger sister. It is hands down THE BEST flat iron out there - I have very thick wavy hair and this cuts my flat ironing time in half and gives unbelievable results. Don&#x27;t even bother looking for another/better flat iron - this one is the best!</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I&#x27;ve purchased. I had the first one for about 3 years and used it almost every day. I dropped it in a tile floor and it stopped working. I feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth. The plates glide over your hair and the fact that it is so wide takes less time.  Love it. I did buy again!</li>
            <li> I had a previous version of this straightener that lasted over two years before it died.  I was happy with it so I bought another one, not even two months in the second one died.  It will only work if you hold the clamp together which gets to be difficult when trying to straighten hair.  I am switching brands, buying anything worth over $100 that breaks in less then two months is not worth another try.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sedu straighhtener for about 3 months now and recommend it. Heats up quickly and adjusts to the heat level that best suits your hair. My stylist recommended using a protective conditioning spray before straightening and this seems to avoid some of the burning or frying issues others have complained about. My partner has one with a sort of textured surface on the iron and I have used both for comparison. I like the Sedu&#x27;s smooth ceramic surface much better. My only criticism is that it lacks a locking mechanism to keep it closed during storage and travel and the cord is ridiculously long which requires lots of wrapping around the iron to store.</li>
            <li> I had hoped that the iron&#x27;s surface would be longer. I would like to have more control over the heart settings.</li>
            <li> ITEM DID NOT HAVE A SWIVEL CORD.  MY LAST ONE DID AND THE PICTURE LED ME TO BELIEVE IT HAD ONE ALSO.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron back in 2009 while I was still in college. I have Dominican long, curly, and thick hair and I have never tried another flat iron that provided the amazing heat and softness that this iron generates. The reason I am writing this review is because yesterday, sadly, my baby stopped working. I brought her with me while backpacking in Brazil for six months. Squeezed and twisted her in my bags across my many trips. Not once did this iron not perform well on my hair. I am now about to buy another one of these in the hopes of the longevity that was originally provided. Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too much for an iron, think about it as an investment in a iron that will last, not pull your hair, only requires a few passes (my hair is dry as well so for other textures it probably works even better!!)  and leaves your hair shiny. Highly recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li> It looked used and had pieces of hair and makeup stuck between the iron plates. Overall, I was not satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> My wife has been bugging me for a new flat iron because the one she had was crapping out (xxxxx beauty shop flat iron). So I did my home work and this is the one that we picked. My biggest complaint that I had with the old flat iron was how long it took for it to heat up/finish her hair (1-1.25 hours) and the best feature of the Sedu is how fast (35-40 minutes) it gets her hair done (thick black curly/wavey hair). It takes this thing less that 60 seconds (depending on the setting)  to heat up and it&#x27;s ready to go. My wife would definitely recomment this product.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of ordering it on ebay, it broke after 3 months, and because ebay was not one of the authorized resellers therefore had no warranty. But if I was sure it was an excellent iron, for this reason I ordered it from Folica via Amazon. I love it! leaves my hair ultra smooth and extremely shiny. I go the gym everyday at noon and go right back to work afterwards, and this iron has proven to not burn my hair with everyday use. It is light weight, with adjustable temperatures and perfect for my long hair, which is very dry and kinda frizzy. A friend of mine was using a different brand, which was good, but she had been thinking about buying a wider one of the same brand. I let her try mine and he loved it! she order it the next day. I really recommend it with my eyes closed.</li>
            <li> ordered this for my mom. she has thick super wavy, long hair. she was excited about the results she got with from this tool. she said her hair was super soft and shiny and was pleased with how light in weight this tool was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Sedu since I was 16. I&#x27;m 27 now. Never any problems. I keep my hair long. Over the last decade it has varied from mid-back to hip length. It is out of control wavy/curly with insane thickness. I don&#x27;t always straighten my hair because it takes so long (that&#x27;s more of a me issue than a Sedu issue, if I went to any other brand it would still take forever just because of how much hair I have). However, when I do opt for straight hair this thing never fails to tame my unruly mane. If this product ever does break - I&#x27;m getting another one.</li>
            <li> I Purchased this in August of 2013 and the product has already died on me.  I only flat iron my hair a couple of times a week - at this price the product should have a life span longer than 10 months!  With no one to contact for a replacement I will never buy another Sedu again.</li>
            <li> My wife is ecstatic about it.....nothing heats up faster and straightens her hair quicker.</li>
            <li> I like this flat iron hair straightener but it still seems not to be working properly again. I returned the first one because it was defective as the light is suppose to flash once the iron is ready to use but it did not do this. It cost me $12.95 to return it, which should have&lt;br /&gt;been a free return, as they sent me a defective item and finally they sent me another one that does the same thing, the light&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t flash when it is ready to use. I am very dissatisfied with this whole process.</li>
            <li> It Looks great and hope it will work great. Actually I have bought this for my sister. She is a beautician and wants this for her work. I hope that customers will be really satisfied by the performance of this hair straightener.</li>
            <li> Not a great flat iron, takes long to get results on curly hair.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. I had a Sedu flat iron for 9 years and loved it. I ordered this expecting the same quality. This flat iron has a cheap short cord and has been brutal on my hair. My last Sedu had a thick cord that was about 10feet long and left my hair soft and shiny. This flat iron has destroyed my hair and it takes forever to straighten my hair. VERY DISSAPPOINTED. 😕</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the quality of this product!  Sedu is suppose to be a top brand of flat irons and this does not seem to match up.  I feel like this is a fake and should not represent the brand.  When I received the straightener it felt like a cheap piece of plastic and did not straighten my hair at all.  On the flat iron it stated that it was at 400 degrees but it would not straighten my hair, makes no sense.  I bought a new flat iron and this one said it was at 400 degrees and it does such an amazing job.  I would not trust this flat iron and I immediately sent it back to the seller.  Beyond disappointing!</li>
            <li> This is for sure the best hair straightener I have ever owned. I&#x27;ve used many high dollar hair straighteners but this one is my favorite. I also love the wide plates. I think it helps do more hair in a shorter time. The plates are soft and the iron is high quality. My mom turned me on to this one after I used hers while visiting. After her&#x27;s had stopped working (years later) she ordered another one... they are THAT good.</li>
            <li> hair iron is not worth the price. thank you very much.  it sticks to my hair and pulls thank you very much</li>
            <li> My daughter ordered one, and loved it, it heats up quick and works great... my roommate also ordered one and is very happy with hers... Amazon had the cheapest through Boho West... great people to order from!!</li>
            <li> Absoluety my favorite hair straightener on the market.  I have thick, wavy curly hair and this is the only straightener that makes my hair sleek and stick straight.  It goes up to very hot levels and makes my hair silky smooth!!  My original Sedu lasted over 2.5 years and finally just crapped out.  I ordered a new one right away.  One word of advice watch the connection at the straightener point, if you bend it, or wrap the cord sloppy, your connection will go in and out at the end of the straightener&#x27;s life.  a MUST have for thick and curly hair!</li>
            <li> Purchased Sedu Flat Iron from Amazon.  Fast delivery.  Excellent product.  It takes very little time to straighten hair and it makes my hair very soft and shiny.  It has different temperature setting.  I used the lowest temperature. I would recommend this product to anyone who would love to have soft, shiny and very straight hair in so little time.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife in November, 2012.  Now it&#x27;s June 2013, 7 months later, and this is straightner is no longer working.  Power will not come back on.  I&#x27;m not sure if these are counterfeits being sold online, or legit, but any online retailer is NOT an authorized retailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This means THE MANUFACTURER WILL NOT HONOR THE WARRANTY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it&#x27;s my fault for not researching that prior to buying, but the business selling these are well aware of that.  This was a fine product while it lasted, but now it&#x27;s a paper weight.</li>
            <li> As people have noted, my 1st Sedu 1.5 was amazing - but eventually (3 years!) it needed to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the EXACT same item on Amazon, and it was shipped via a 3rd party -  the new iron looks&lt;br /&gt;exactly the same except the cord.  My original cord was a heavy duty round type (which might account for why it lasted so long,&lt;br /&gt;the new cord is what you are used to seeing on most blow dryers/lamps, etc.  After further investigation,&lt;br /&gt;I found one other difference - the Wattage - my original was 72W and the new one is 45W.  This might account for the fact that it&lt;br /&gt;does not produce the same heat.  This is not in the product description, so I am reluctant to order&lt;br /&gt;another one, not knowing what I will get.  42W may be sufficient for a lot of hair types, but I have&lt;br /&gt;long, thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the flat iron would not heat up past the third setting. I returned it today and felt a bit annoyed at having to pay for the return postal charge. I still have to wait and see if they refund my money soon.</li>
            <li> Amazing iron.  Love it so much!</li>
            <li> This expensive thing only works for a couple of months! And my wife is not even a heavy user, only using it 3 times a week! Tried follow other users&#x27; comment on how short it last &amp; the way to fix it, but in vain.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Sedu to replace my last Sedu (which finally tired out after approximately 2 years, using it nearly every day). I have thick wavy hair and in all my years I have NEVER found a product that works so well on my hair. After letting a few of my friends use it they have purchased their own. For the price, you get more quality than you pay for. Great buy!</li>
            <li> This is the best Flat iron I have ever had!!! Its actually my second one of these.. My first one lasted 2 years and would of made it longer but unfortunatly I dropped it about 1000 times and the clamp broke beyond repair. But Completely my fault not the products. When you first look at the price it is kind of expensive but for as muh use as I have gotten out of it it is for sure worth it!</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and with this iron I get smooth straight hair in less than 30 minutes! I love my Sedu :)</li>
            <li> As someone cursed with extremely curly frizzy (caucasian) hair, I am very familar with flat irons. This one surpasses all of them, even salon ones. I will never ever ever use anything different. It glides over the hair so nicely without tugging, has very minimal damage, and leaves my hair soft and shiny. Unlike others it doesnt leave a burnt-hair smell either. You have to be gentle with the cord though - no yanking at all. And don&#x27;t whined it up tightly. The way the cord is attached inside the flat iron is not the greatest and it can become disconnected inside (your flat iron will no longer work). This has happened to me 5 times over the years and every time I&#x27;ve purchased the same one. Nothing else compares so I&#x27;d shell out the $120 bucks for it any day.</li>
            <li> I actually never heard of the brand of  sedu until I asked a co-work how she gets her hair so perfectly straight! She told me about this flat iron and I knew I had to have it!! What a great iron. I have used so many other iron such as chi, hsi, con air, Remington, baby bliss,  etc and this is the absolute best. You can add flips or curls also. I have been using it for 2 years now and I am still in love.</li>
            <li> Feels cheaply made and you can&#x27;t hold onto the outside of the ironing area to do curls because it gets to hot. I can only imagine the good reviews are from people who have never owned a nice flat iron and upgraded from a cheap one.&lt;br /&gt;My 9 year old chi started losing its plates so I read up and heard this was the best&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine and contemplating returning and getting a new chi</li>
