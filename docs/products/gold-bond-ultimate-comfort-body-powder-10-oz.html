            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>Another great buy from Amazon!</li>
            <li>this is the perfect powder for me!</li>
            <li>Very pleasant, but, un-perfumy scent.</li>
            <li>Needed a body powder for men ,very satisfied with product!</li>
            <li>Great for using all over in pesky sweaty stinky areas.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>This powder is great.</li>
            <li>Works and smells great.</li>
            <li>The powder itself is great.</li>
            <li>I purchased this powder, because the one I used to use had talc, and I have learned that talc isn&#x27;t good for you.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good for armpits, deodorants/antiperspirants can&#x27;t hold a candle to a good body powder.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good until I get home.</li>
            <li>Good stuff</li>
            <li>The texture ofvthis powder is like silk and does smell good.</li>
            <li>Great product that has a nice scent that isn&#x27;t over powering.  </li>
            <li>Good for both sexes.</li>
            <li>Love that powder!</li>
            <li>My husband liked this powder; I think it&#x27;s helpful for feet.  </li>
            <li>Still, nice in shoes.</li>
            <li>way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rash has been healing nicely.</li>
            <li>Simply a great power right out the shower,  no clumping.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and helps with perspiration.</li>
            <li>very comfortable, nice scent, smooth.</li>
            <li>Fat people, we sweat and chafe a lot more than skinny people.</li>
            <li>Its a shame the shops wont carry this product, target and walmart stock so many of gold bond&#x27;s products except for this.</li>
            <li>This is way better than the medicated gold bond powder.</li>
            <li>I this bought because it was cornstarch based, and it&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li>The powder comes out very easily, sometimes too easily.</li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling like a soft piece of silk and smells great</li>
            <li>Pleasant and very soft smell, works ell!</li>
            <li>But you will definitely smell great.</li>
            <li>But this Gold Bond Ultimate Comfort Body Powder stays on longer than that, and great for masking the pheromones (BO from the pit)</li>
            <li>I have purchased this twice, and on both occasions the dispenser broke causing a great deal of powder residue everywhere and finally making the bottle unusable.</li>
            <li>Works perfect for keeping the skin dry during those hot summer months.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, decent size</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised that it works just fine and has a nice clean scent</li>
            <li>It just smells clean.</li>
            <li>Now that the days are turning warm and cranking up those old sweat glands, I needed something that will help the heat rash</li>
            <li>This is the ultimate feel good powder.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll put a little more on when I get home, mainly because our A/C isn&#x27;t the best so it gets hot at home.</li>
            <li>Will not irritate scent-haters, but, will feel and smell clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Putting this in those areas makes me smell fresh all through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>actually loved the product but be careful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite sweaty and it&#x27;s hot right now in Utah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Regular Gold Bond has talc, which works better, but has been linked to cancer.</li>
            <li>Powder good, still has a slightly medicinal smell, too much for me.</li>
            <li>Keeps you dry all day long great smell.</li>
            <li>It is soft, very fine, definitely powdery, and stays put.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job.  </li>
            <li>This stuff alleviates those problems very well.</li>
            <li>I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s helping really well.</li>
            <li>really</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very absorbent</li>
            <li>We could have become much sicker</li>
            <li>originally got this for myself but found out later that my wife has been using it as well.</li>
            <li>Smells nice too, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I had the furnace fixed as it needed to be properly adjusted and it has worked fine for 5 years now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>was fortunate because I had an Ionic Breeze air cleaner and when I went to clean it, I discovered it was completely covered with this dry, white dust.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clump up and keeps me smooth &amp; dry!</li>
            <li>then what wasn&#x27;t absorbed by the furnace filter was being blown back into the air inside the house so we were breathing microscopic particles of drying dust.</li>
            <li>I live in the tropics, and a  powder</li>
            <li>You can hold this one upside down and it falls out freely.</li>
            <li>this fine and comforting is as refreshing as a cold drink in this heat and humidity.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather buy a little pricier and actually get the most out of the produce.</li>
            <li>And my skin feels so silky and soft (and I&#x27;m and old woman).</li>
            <li>and I developed a severe cough that took months to get rid of and required inhalation</li>
            <li>Applying a thin layer around your nether regions and your butt will keep you feeling nice all day.</li>
            <li>but as you get older there are some places, after one showers, when this is necessary.</li>

            <li> Be careful to use sparingly &amp; in well ventilated room.</li>

            <li> you do get a little powdery, so if your significant other plays around in those areas a little, she might get a little dusty, so impromptu oral play may be out of the question.  </li>

            <li> Not too harsh but very subtle.  </li>
            <li> I am addicted.</li>
            <li> The fact that I had never discovered this until this summer is sad.</li>
            <li> Inside of about a month my dog started going blind from the excess drying of her eyes</li>

            <li> This Gold Bond powder smells awesome.  Not too harsh but very subtle.  Great for using all over in pesky sweaty stinky areas.

But you will definitely smell great.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, decent size</li>
            <li> Works well, but I wish it were unscented.  I don&#x27;t understand why everything has to have an annoying fragrance.</li>
            <li> Simply a great power right out the shower,  no clumping. Leaves you feeling like a soft piece of silk and smells great</li>
            <li> My husband liked this powder; I think it&#x27;s helpful for feet.  He has died, and it&#x27;s not very feminine, so I seldom use it.  Still, nice in shoes.</li>

            <li> Use this daily to keep man stuff dry.  Does the job.  No noticeable scent.  Doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job.  Have had for almost 2 months now and about 1/3 of bottle is left.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fat. I&#x27;ll admit this. Fat people, we sweat and chafe a lot more than skinny people. This stuff alleviates those problems very well. Applying a thin layer around your nether regions and your butt will keep you feeling nice all day. It&#x27;s also good for armpits, deodorants/antiperspirants can&#x27;t hold a candle to a good body powder. This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> Love that powder! Now that the days are turning warm and cranking up those old sweat glands, I needed something that will help the heat rash I get every summer under the elastic on my underwear.  It works. And my skin feels so silky and soft (and I&#x27;m and old woman). A friend was telling me about the powder and I couldn&#x27;t find it at the local stores, so I decided to search Amazon and there it was. Smells nice too, not overwhelming. It just smells clean.</li>
            <li> very comfortable, nice scent, smooth. I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David</li>
            <li> Its a shame the shops wont carry this product, target and walmart stock so many of gold bond&#x27;s products except for this. This is way better than the medicated gold bond powder. The smell wears off in 4 hrs. But this Gold Bond Ultimate Comfort Body Powder stays on longer than that, and great for masking the pheromones (BO from the pit)</li>
            <li> Great product!  Pleasant and very soft smell, works ell!</li>
            <li> works as it should.  Very smooth and helps with perspiration.</li>
            <li> Needed a body powder for men ,very satisfied with product!</li>
            <li> Got this to help with a rash I&#x27;ve had for a while now. Had been using some other powder but it didn&#x27;t really help. Started to use this and it&#x27;s helping really well. I&#x27;m quite sweaty and it&#x27;s hot right now in Utah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally got this for myself but found out later that my wife has been using it as well. She works outdoors and gets quite sweaty. The powder comes out very easily, sometimes too easily. I&#x27;m used to having to shake the bottle to get the powder out from the bottle of the other stuff I was using. You can hold this one upside down and it falls out freely. I usually pour some out into my hand and then just wipe it on, back and forth until it is all stuck/absorbed onto my skin. It doesn&#x27;t take much to go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rash has been healing nicely. I usually put this stuff on in the morning and it&#x27;s good until I get home. I&#x27;ll put a little more on when I get home, mainly because our A/C isn&#x27;t the best so it gets hot at home. I will keep buying it though. Good stuff really and I can&#x27;t get it locally for some reason. Amazon it is!</li>
            <li> Keeps you dry all day long great smell.</li>
            <li> The texture ofvthis powder is like silk and does smell good. Great product</li>
            <li> Great product that has a nice scent that isn&#x27;t over powering.  Works perfect for keeping the skin dry during those hot summer months.</li>
            <li> I this bought because it was cornstarch based, and it&#x27;s just OK. Regular Gold Bond has talc, which works better, but has been linked to cancer.</li>
            <li> The fact that I had never discovered this until this summer is sad. This powder is great. It isn&#x27;t too &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34;, so it doesn&#x27;t get everywhere, and it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is the ultimate feel good powder. I live in the tropics, and a  powder this fine and comforting is as refreshing as a cold drink in this heat and humidity. I am addicted. Very pleasant, but, un-perfumy scent. Will not irritate scent-haters, but, will feel and smell clean and fresh. Good for both sexes.</li>
            <li> I never liked using powder but as you get older there are some places, after one showers, when this is necessary. I&#x27;ve bought this three times now. It is soft, very fine, definitely powdery, and stays put. I use a giant powder puff I bought here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Another great buy from Amazon!</li>
            <li> Works and smells great.</li>
            <li> Powder good, still has a slightly medicinal smell, too much for me.</li>
            <li> The powder itself is great. The dispenser is terrible. I have purchased this twice, and on both occasions the dispenser broke causing a great deal of powder residue everywhere and finally making the bottle unusable. I&#x27;d rather buy a little pricier and actually get the most out of the produce.</li>
            <li> Be careful to use sparingly &amp; in well ventilated room. This powder contains SILCA which is essentiall chalk dust. It&#x27;s very absorbent but you can breathe it into your lungs and it&#x27;s really dangerous. I learned the hard way when I was using it one winter and my new forced air furnace ductwork wasn&#x27;t properly balanced. What was happening was the intake was sucking in the excess powder from the bathroom then what wasn&#x27;t absorbed by the furnace filter was being blown back into the air inside the house so we were breathing microscopic particles of drying dust. Inside of about a month my dog started going blind from the excess drying of her eyes and I developed a severe cough that took months to get rid of and required inhalation therapy.&lt;br /&gt;I was fortunate because I had an Ionic Breeze air cleaner and when I went to clean it, I discovered it was completely covered with this dry, white dust. It was SILCA from the Gold Bond Body powder. We could have become much sicker if I had t noticed this. I had the furnace fixed as it needed to be properly adjusted and it has worked fine for 5 years now.&lt;br /&gt;I actually loved the product but be careful. Do NOT use this on BABIES or on your bedding as they suggest.</li>
            <li> this is the perfect powder for me! Doesn&#x27;t clump up and keeps me smooth &amp; dry!</li>
