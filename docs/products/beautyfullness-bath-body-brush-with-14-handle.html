    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent addition to any shower!</li>
            <li>Not the greatest quality.</li>
            <li>Best to get a plastic one that&#x27;s is ergonomically bent, with no detachable brush end, longer brisles, and where the brisles are inbedded into the brush itself, like a hairbrush is.</li>
            <li>so it is the perfect firmness for me.</li>
            <li>this body brush is great.  </li>
            <li>Would make a great gift.</li>
            <li>I bought this to start body brushing and love it!</li>
            <li>Love this brush!</li>
            <li>The bristles are great, the wood is smooth, and I love how you can detach the brush from the handle.</li>
            <li>Love this brush and handle.</li>
            <li>and now I love it.</li>
            <li>It feels wonderful on my back.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the best back scratcher ever.</li>
            <li>and i love the size of the brush.</li>
            <li>I love it and can get to all of the places that I couldn&#x27;t reach before</li>
            <li>Love that the top is detachable.</li>
            <li>love the handle be able to come off easily</li>
            <li>On top of that, the plastic to which the bristles are attached to is becoming increasingly separated from the wood.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful to use with body wash or on dry skin too.</li>
            <li>The strap on the brush head makes it easy to hold on to and brush the backs of the legs.</li>
            <li>I am also able to take the handle off and use the brush in hand for a gentler clean.</li>
            <li>It functions fine</li>
            <li>It is extremely light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t reach but also separable to use wiyh my hand to get detailed cleaning.</li>
            <li>It works great as a back brush.</li>
            <li>Bristels too soft for a good cleaning.</li>
            <li>Great for dry brushing.  </li>
            <li>So far, feels nice.</li>
            <li>Very nice brush for dry brushing before taking a sauna!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and appears as stated</li>
            <li>Otherwise a good brush for dry brushing.</li>
            <li>Amazing to use on areas of my back</li>
            <li>but as for exfoliation and stuff, it&#x27;s well made and worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love using one of these and like the all natural wood and bristles.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying a top quality brush made in Germany for a little bit more than this.</li>
            <li>Great brush to use for those hard-to-reach areas, especially your whole back!</li>
            <li>Reviews you see are probably within the first month of purchase.  </li>
            <li>Bristles were stiff at first and fell of,but after washing in warm sopy water it softened up and stopped shedding&lt;br /&gt;Great product,handle do come apart while using</li>
            <li>The handle comes free easily and the strap keeps the brush firmly planted on my hand while I&#x27;m scrubbing.</li>
            <li>The long handle works well to reach your back, the bristles are nice and soft but firm at the same time, and the detaching head makes it wonderful.</li>
            <li>and I love it just as I expected.</li>
            <li>Got very possitive feedback.</li>
            <li>I do like that the head is removable but it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; on the handle very well when you need to use the handle.</li>
            <li>Very well made and functional as well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to hold up very well in the shower.</li>
            <li>I mainly just use on legs/thighs and can leave it right outside the bath tub.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so much smoother and clean after just a few days of use, I would highly recommend this product for everyone.</li>
            <li>I put a touch of clear silicone on handle</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if I used it with too much force or the combination of using it in the shower and being wet was too much for it.</li>
            <li>Very misleading picture only one brush...</li>
            <li>The head comes off for upper body washing so the brush can be used for the whole body.</li>
            <li>The way that it attaches to the long handle is pretty ineffective though—there&#x27;s only a groove in the brush where the handle inserts.</li>
            <li>Not too stiff... nice and soft to stimulate the lymph system and removing dead skin cells!</li>
            <li>I love the bristles, they are firm enough for dry brushing</li>
            <li>I am new in dry skin brushing and this is my 1st brush.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that the brush and handle might come loose since they are designed to separate, but so far I haven&#x27;t had any problem.</li>

            <li> The handle is long enough to reach anywhere on your back.</li>
            <li> The bristles flattened with a week&#x27;s use and are now about as effective as an old toothbrush. :(</li>
            <li> long handle brush only.</li>
            <li> How long it lasts will be the kicker.</li>
            <li> The bristles are uneven and missing, making a whole area empty of them.  </li>
            <li> Handle a little short for a tall person (over 6ft )</li>
            <li> It is hard to get it back on and use it for my back.  </li>
            <li> The long handle allows me to scrub the hard to reach spots on my back.</li>
            <li> Well I bought this brush to do the dry brush thing that was supposed to make my skin tight.</li>
            <li> bristle are a lot softer than other brushes I have tried.</li>
            <li> The wood gets black mold as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too hard and is not soft</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT A GOOD BRUSH ESPECIALLY FOR MEN.  </li>
            <li> Only sorry I didn&#x27;t get one of these before.</li>
            <li> This back brush is very poorly made.  </li>
            <li> Complete crap.  </li>
            <li> But alas, it didn&#x27;t do that</li>
            <li> (A little annoying)</li>
            <li> UPDATE: the building is so shady that they fix the plastic base to the wood with staples that get rusted with the water.  </li>

            <li> Bristles were stiff at first and fell of,but after washing in warm sopy water it softened up and stopped shedding&lt;br /&gt;Great product,handle do come apart while using</li>
            <li> Love this brush and handle. Even though the brush does separate from the handle sometimes. (A little annoying) I put a touch of clear silicone on handle and now I love it.</li>
            <li> Great brush to use for those hard-to-reach areas, especially your whole back! I use it daily!</li>
            <li> I bought this to start body brushing and love it! It&#x27;s wonderful to use with body wash or on dry skin too. The long handle works well to reach your back, the bristles are nice and soft but firm at the same time, and the detaching head makes it wonderful. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very misleading picture only one brush...deceptive advertising..long handle brush only. For that reason rating low.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. How long it lasts will be the kicker. So far, feels nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for one of these for awhile. I had something similar when I was younger and started looking to find one recently. I haven&#x27;t been looking diligently, just passively as I walk through the store. I got this one and I love it just as I expected. The handle comes free easily and the strap keeps the brush firmly planted on my hand while I&#x27;m scrubbing. It&#x27;s an excellent addition to any shower!</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift. Got very possitive feedback.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! It feels wonderful on my back. I was concerned that the brush and handle might come loose since they are designed to separate, but so far I haven&#x27;t had any problem.</li>
            <li> No directions on the use and benefits of its use.</li>
            <li> Amazing to use on areas of my back I can&#x27;t reach but also separable to use wiyh my hand to get detailed cleaning.</li>
            <li> The bristles are great, the wood is smooth, and I love how you can detach the brush from the handle.</li>

            <li> Bristels too soft for a good cleaning.</li>
            <li> Great for dry brushing.  I purchased this because the handle can be removed.  I mainly just use on legs/thighs and can leave it right outside the bath tub.  The strap on the brush head makes it easy to hold on to and brush the backs of the legs.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the shower but now I just use it as a back scratcher and it&#x27;s the best back scratcher ever.</li>
            <li> Not the greatest quality. It functions fine but after a couple of months the bristles started falling out.&lt;br /&gt;The bristle are a lot softer than other brushes I have tried. The handle is long enough to reach anywhere on your back. It works great as a back brush.</li>
            <li> I am new in dry skin brushing and this is my 1st brush. I gave it a 4 star because the brush head does fall off the handle while brushing. I do like that the head is removable but it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; on the handle very well when you need to use the handle.</li>
            <li> Well I bought this brush to do the dry brush thing that was supposed to make my skin tight. But alas, it didn&#x27;t do that but as for exfoliation and stuff, it&#x27;s well made and worth the money.</li>

            <li> Very nice brush for dry brushing before taking a sauna! Not too stiff... nice and soft to stimulate the lymph system and removing dead skin cells!</li>
            <li> The bristles flattened with a week&#x27;s use and are now about as effective as an old toothbrush. :(</li>

            <li> This body scrub brush works just as advertised. The long handle allows me to scrub the hard to reach spots on my back. It is extremely light weight and easy to use. I am also able to take the handle off and use the brush in hand for a gentler clean. My skin feels so much smoother and clean after just a few days of use, I would highly recommend this product for everyone.</li>
            <li> this body brush is great.  I love it and can get to all of the places that I couldn&#x27;t reach before</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my husband he loves it!</li>
            <li> My wife and I use this brush on a daily basis. I like to use to scrub my back and my wife will use it on her legs as well. Love that the top is detachable. Very well made and functional as well. Would make a great gift.</li>
            <li> I love using one of these and like the all natural wood and bristles.</li>
            <li> I like this brush, but I didn&#x27;t realize the handle was detachable.  It is hard to get it back on and use it for my back.  Otherwise a good brush for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to hold up very well in the shower. Some of the bristles have folder over. Don&#x27;t know if I used it with too much force or the combination of using it in the shower and being wet was too much for it.</li>
            <li> love the handle be able to come off easily</li>
            <li> This back brush is very poorly made.  Reviews you see are probably within the first month of purchase.  The brisles are not attached into the wood, ther are on a canvas that, after a couple months, comes off. I glued mine back twice.  The end of the back brush is made to come off to use my hand. It comes off in the shower constantly as your trying to brush with it attached.  I put a screw through mine to hold it on the stick. The straps are cloth and get moldy. The wood gets black mold as well.  The bristles are too short.  THIS IS NOT A GOOD BRUSH ESPECIALLY FOR MEN.  Best to get a plastic one that&#x27;s is ergonomically bent, with no detachable brush end, longer brisles, and where the brisles are inbedded into the brush itself, like a hairbrush is.</li>
            <li> Only sorry I didn&#x27;t get one of these before. I use it every day. It&#x27;s not too hard and is not soft so it is the perfect firmness for me. The head comes off for upper body washing so the brush can be used for the whole body.</li>
