            <li>I need more, really like!!!</li>
            <li>Easy to pickup and place.</li>
            <li>quality studs worth picking up more.</li>
            <li>But changing the picture to fit the description would hurt either.</li>
            <li>and they do look ok on the nail even if they are a bit large.</li>
            <li>That was so sweet.</li>
            <li>Other than that, they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m was very happy with my nail mail and surprised it came with a little gift.</li>
            <li>but it would have been nice to know ahead of ordering that they were mixed together.</li>
            <li>You have to use a lot of glue as well as putting a clear coat on top keep them from falling off after just a couple days.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll have fun with these.</li>
            <li>But I like the product other wise.</li>
            <li>these are the right size for embellishing nails.  </li>
            <li>Theres are cute, but I thought they&#x27;d be bigger.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty irritated.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It would have been better if I actually received 300 gold AND silver studs.</li>
            <li>they are tiny and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I thought they would be bright silver and gold but turned out mat silver and unshiny gold that looks a bit dull.</li>
            <li>and i was really hoping for squares</li>
            <li>you get what you pay for which isnt much.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery...</li>
            <li>Thanks fo offering.</li>
            <li>I use them as often as i can and get compliments left and right!</li>
            <li>these are tiny dots which look cool</li>
            <li>just make sure you have the bowl side down before picking up with your dotting tool.</li>
            <li>and i only received very large hearts that do not fit on my nails nicely.</li>
            <li>They look nice but are too thick which makes the sit to high on the nail.</li>
            <li>the size of the studs is good, not too big or small.</li>
            <li>The bags came with few extra larger studs in each color which was nice if yuo want to mix size, but if your nails are not large enough, the big studs wont look nice as it won&#x27;t fit correctly on the surfis.</li>
            <li>you have the right tools to pick them up individually.</li>
            <li>I love the size but the came all mixed together in a little baggie</li>
            <li>The picture and the desc clearly states that its metal studs</li>
            <li>but instead I received clear rhinestones.</li>
            <li>Very Affordable and the shipping was much shorter than I expected.</li>
            <li>I like to get professional manicures</li>
            <li>very tiny, very shiny.</li>
            <li>Received sooner than expected which is always great but a huge disappointed when I opened the package.</li>
            <li>Is super small.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why they show other shapes and thing very cheap and tiny and not gold and silver</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m normally happy with my purchase again I was sent the wrong product I got gold studs in bags that I can even use not happy</li>
            <li> They are silver and gold and not what I expected I thought they would be larger.</li>
            <li> The only thing you need to be careful with is that the gold can come off deending on what you use to pick them up with, they are not solvent resistant.</li>
            <li> came in an envelope, they are tiny, and not worth it!</li>
            <li> This product was not at all what I had expected.</li>
            <li> Quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> but hate that they have to charge me $5 for just a simple little dot that i can do it myself for practically free!</li>
            <li> These nail art pieces has given my nails the look of elegance along with other pieces or just by themselves.</li>
            <li> Not one other shape.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was getting some hearts and stars and other things in the picture</li>
            <li> are everything I expected!</li>
            <li> Although hard to get out of tiny plastic bag.</li>
            <li> Received a very small bag with 125 studs in total not 300 as advertised !</li>
            <li> And 2 shapes round and square.</li>
            <li> They were just dots couldn&#x27;t hardly tell the gold from silver not worth it</li>
            <li> but all I got was small round circles.</li>
            <li> and it says small round studs.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even see them they are so small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about this product is that the gold color studs fade to silver within 72 hours, which is a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> The cover picture confused me</li>
            <li> The colors of these studs were a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> they are useless don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s worst deals out there</li>

            <li> They look nice but are too thick which makes the sit to high on the nail.</li>
            <li> The gold could of been golder but nice. Great item for nail art. Will buy again.  Nicely package thank you</li>
            <li> they aren&#x27;t rhinestones they&#x27;re studs.</li>
            <li> Received sooner than expected which is always great but a huge disappointed when I opened the package. Received a very small bag with 125 studs in total not 300 as advertised !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m was very happy with my nail mail and surprised it came with a little gift. That was so sweet. I would surely order again :)</li>
            <li> These arrived yesterday. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try them out yet, but they are cute, and I can&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li> My clients love these</li>
            <li> these are the right size for embellishing nails.  they are tiny and easy to apply.  just make sure you have the bowl side down before picking up with your dotting tool.</li>
            <li> This are perfect for nail art and they are the prefect size studs 🌟 wish I could post a pic 😊</li>
            <li> I just received these and while I did not take them out and count them, I don&#x27;t think there is 300 pieces in there. Plus it would have been nice if the gold and silver ones were separated. Instead they were all mixed together. I guess I can deal with that for the price I paid but it would have been nice to know ahead of ordering that they were mixed together.</li>
            <li> Theres are cute, but I thought they&#x27;d be bigger. They are still very nice and they look very nice !!</li>
            <li> There was NOT three hundred pieces in the package that I received. This product was not at all what I had expected.</li>
            <li> These are great just like the picture.  But Ebay has them cheeper for a lot more pieces. Will purchase from Ebay in the future</li>
            <li> these are tiny dots which look cool but you dont get very many and i was really hoping for squares oh well for the price you cant complain... you get what you pay for which isnt much.</li>
            <li> I will never purchase from these people again!!!!! Yellow and white extremely tiny circles is what you getting. I&#x27;m not sure why they show other shapes and thing very cheap and tiny and not gold and silver they are useless don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> You have to use a lot of glue as well as putting a clear coat on top keep them from falling off after just a couple days.</li>
            <li> I go through a ton of these. Nice to see a place where I can get more than 40 or 50 of them at a time.</li>
            <li> I just received these after ordering almost three weeks ago. Opened the package and they are yellow and c lear rhinestones. NOT metal studs. I&#x27;m pretty irritated.</li>
            <li> These arrived weeks later.. Is super small. I can&#x27;t even see them they are so small. They are silver and gold and not what I expected I thought they would be larger.</li>
            <li> I used this for my nails. I like it but the only thing is that the gold turns silver within days</li>
            <li> Good arrival time. Quicker than expected. There were about 175 silver and 205 gold. More than what I was expecting. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Jewels aren&#x27;t what is pictured</li>
            <li> Very cute and easy to use provided you have the right tools to pick them up individually. The only complaint I have about this product is that the gold color studs fade to silver within 72 hours, which is a little disappointing. Other than that they are wonderful nail art decorations for a good price.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, wonderful for arts and crafts!!</li>
            <li> I use them as often as i can and get compliments left and right! I like to get professional manicures but hate that they have to charge me $5 for just a simple little dot that i can do it myself for practically free!</li>
            <li> I feel like I just got scammed! The picture and the desc clearly states that its metal studs but instead I received clear rhinestones. If that&#x27;s not what you wanted then do not purchase! I&#x27;m so upset...I already have rhinestones which I purchased for the same price and comes in different variety of colors.</li>
            <li> I love the size but the came all mixed together in a little baggie so I had to go through them and separate them. Other than that, they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> cant wait to use them just got them today ... i wish that they were put in a wheel thought</li>
            <li> I need more, really like!!!</li>
            <li> Great size for my projects. Nice and shiny. Good offer.. Fast delivery... Easy to pickup and place. Thanks fo offering. And 2 shapes round and square.</li>
            <li> i was looking for something similar to a product i bought years and years ago... and this met my expectations wonderfully! very tiny, very shiny. i&#x27;ll have fun with these.</li>
            <li> Great for nail art and crafts. The only thing you need to be careful with is that the gold can come off deending on what you use to pick them up with, they are not solvent resistant.</li>
            <li> I was sent 3mm studs instead of the 2mm studs I wanted. I could have gotten 3mm ones cheaper from a different seller if that was what I had wanted. All that aside, the studs I got were nice metal studs and they do look ok on the nail even if they are a bit large.</li>
            <li> did not recieve 300 pieces, but love what I did recieve.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s worst deals out there</li>
            <li> They were just dots couldn&#x27;t hardly tell the gold from silver not worth it</li>
            <li> These nail art pieces has given my nails the look of elegance along with other pieces or just by themselves.</li>
            <li> The product is not what I have ordered. It is not metal studs, it is just tiny sparkling gold rhinestone</li>
            <li> These are so cute I love them, They came even faster than I thought they would. I cant wait to decorate my nails, phone... everything with them!</li>
            <li> came in an envelope, they are tiny, and not worth it!</li>
            <li> Took a while to get to my home but the product itself is perfect for the intended use. It is the perfect amount of studs for nail art! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Love it. Although hard to get out of tiny plastic bag. I have extra wheels I&#x27;ll probably use that once had rhinestones.</li>
            <li> Product is okay. It would have been better if I actually received 300 gold AND silver studs. but oh well</li>
            <li> I love my products! Such a great value! Exactly what I wanted! I was so happy when I received my package! I&#x27;m a happy customer! Thank you!</li>
            <li> my customers love them and i haven&#x27;t had any issues with the studs sticking/falling off. quality studs worth picking up more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally happy with my purchase again I was sent the wrong product I got gold studs in bags that I can even use not happy</li>
            <li> The only reason a gave one star is because I couldn&#x27;t write a review if I didn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m not sure if I even got 300 pieces, in addition all I got were gold and silver circles. Not one other shape.  Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> The picture actually tricked me. I thought I was getting some hearts and stars and other things in the picture but all I got was small round circles. But then I went back and read the title and it says small round studs. I guess I should pay more attention. But changing the picture to fit the description would hurt either.</li>
            <li> Very Affordable and the shipping was much shorter than I expected.</li>
            <li> It brought quite a lot.  My friends enjoyed them also. It saves me money.  I bring it with me to the nail salaon and they put them on for me with no extra charge.</li>
            <li> Really cute when applied to nails.</li>
            <li> Great addition to my kit</li>
            <li> The colors of these studs were a bit disappointing. I thought they would be bright silver and gold but turned out mat silver and unshiny gold that looks a bit dull. They do however stick nicely to the nails if you ise glue and a good top coat. the size of the studs is good, not too big or small. The bags came with few extra larger studs in each color which was nice if yuo want to mix size, but if your nails are not large enough, the big studs wont look nice as it won&#x27;t fit correctly on the surfis.</li>
            <li> It  worked out great. The only thing. That sucked was I do a lot of nails and I had to separate gold from silver. But I like the product other wise.</li>
            <li> Really good deal!!&lt;br /&gt;They are everything I expected!</li>
            <li> The cover picture confused me and i thought i was receiving a bundle of different kinds and i only received very large hearts that do not fit on my nails nicely.</li>
            <li> Cute accessories for my nails did a great bedazzled nail art and use these studs and it came out wondeful</li>
