            <li>Enjoyed but sent a lot of pumpkin spice would be better if there were 2 of each scent</li>
            <li>Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>and I was so glad to find outthat Amazon offered it instead of driving to the closes Bath and Body works every week</li>
            <li>Hoping for more food scents though (:</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love the scents.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to Island Bamboo, I Love Cake, and Vanilla Cupcake!!</li>
            <li>This is a useful bundle, you get a nice selection of sanitizer gels, and one gel carrier.  </li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>E. coli on their hands is a strong possibility.</li>
            <li>I really love these little hand sanitzers because they come in handy at work and are great to keep in the car, your pocket, or purse.</li>
            <li>These were fine, and I used them, but they were not Bath and Body works brand.</li>
            <li>They all smell fine.</li>
            <li>These little hand sanitizers are perfect for on the go.</li>
            <li>Still, I got 16 really awesome products and a little sanitizer case things</li>
            <li>I love them they make my hands nice and soft.</li>
            <li>and I cannot stand this cheap smell.&lt;br /&gt;Never</li>
            <li>buy this again and not returnable, Never buy this, unless u like cheap perfume smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>how smooth they make my skin feel,</li>
            <li>I feel secure that I can sanitize my hands with this product</li>
            <li>Our 12 year old daughter loved this.</li>
            <li>Delivery was very fast and I love the variety of fragrances and lingering scent of these anti-bacterial hand gels and</li>
            <li>This grab bag was so worth it!</li>
            <li>Would have given higher rating if had more variety in package.</li>
            <li>They came in many flower scents and looked so pretty .</li>
            <li>These are authentic bath and body works products firstly, however they did take some time to arrive.</li>
            <li>so she is going to be so excited to get them.</li>
            <li>i think that that is cool.</li>
            <li>I got no more than three of a kind which still leaves good variety.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, and a great price as long as you don&#x27;t care which scents you get!  </li>
            <li>Although I understand where the seller is coming from considering some of these different scents are geared more towards certain times of the year, it would have been nice to know that piece of information under “product description”.</li>
            <li>and unfortunately is no longer available.</li>
            <li>bath and body works,,these will be great little gifts for Christmas...</li>
            <li>From the time I paid for this product until I received it was a total of 3 days and like always the scents are amazing.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>(all rare pocketbacs)</li>
            <li>in the my pic, i got this right side pocket bac.</li>
            <li>They are just right to put in your purse</li>
            <li>In the order I received a few scents that were geared more towards men, which is great if you have a man in your life that would actually use hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li>I love the array of scents,  but the holder is cheap and loose.  </li>
            <li>Received many scents, some were repeated a few times, but overall really nice!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I ordered</li>
            <li>Beware some of these flavors are pretty manly.</li>
            <li>The items purchased were exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Tons of different smells, I love them all.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Bath and Body works personal hand sanitizers.</li>
            <li>I had a few repeats but they were ALL good scents.</li>
            <li>They only put 1 of the pink chiffon which is a good scent, the Japanese cherry is ok, otherwise the others are just tacky!</li>
            <li>other than those issues, i liked most of the smells and the fact that i could get a bundle of them for a single price.</li>
            <li>They were by no means explicitly rude but neither were they extremely warm!</li>
            <li>and  I did not get a large variety.</li>
            <li>there is a large variety of scents here.</li>
            <li>responsible seller, recommend to all amazon community .</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>REALLY ????</li>
            <li>but I really expected more than 5 scents.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I received some really crappy flavors.</li>
            <li>My wife bought one of these sets for the whole family.</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>I have to put a rubber band around the whole thing to keep the gel bottle from falling out.  </li>
            <li>I received new Christmas scents and some I&#x27;ve never heard of!</li>
            <li>When I placed the order I was skeptical because I thought I&#x27;d get regular scents that weren&#x27;t the greatest like the picture shows.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to get more of a variety of different scents I got a lot of three that were the same scent.</li>
            <li>Can you get rare ones such as I ❤</li>
            <li>Normally at the Bath and Body Works store, you can get 5 hand sanitizers for $5.00, which is a $1.00 a piece, not including tax.</li>
            <li>Well live and learn I will never buy this again..</li>
            <li>My personal favorite scent from Bath and Body Works is called, “Pink Chiffon” and that was included in the shipment as well.</li>
            <li>These make cute little gifts!</li>
            <li>Got them very early</li>
            <li>I always carry hand sanitizer, and being able to carry it in the little rubber carrier that comes with this set has made a genuine difference to my morning commute on the subway, Some of the smells are a little overpowering, but generally I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li>Crisp Apples,2 Raspberry Pink Peony, 1 Pure Paradise, 1 Beautiful Day, 3 Wild Mango Mojito, 1 Hey HoneyBun (Hate it), 1 Pink Chiffon (needed more).</li>
            <li>much cheaper than going to local store.</li>
            <li>I have to use it 15-20 times per shift and using the agency-issued stuff that frequently just destroys your skin and nails.</li>
            <li>the size is small and fits easily into any pocket or purse</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d take it that if as a seller you&#x27;re missing the proposed delivery date then your customers should at least be made aware as well as you try to be as warm as possible.</li>
            <li>With cold and flu season on their way, these are a great prevention, and the various scents are like aromatherapy.  </li>
            <li>So I definitely wish I could be more specific in the scents that I would like to have mailed to me, or at least request that the seller does not send me any manly scents.</li>
            <li>Believe it or not, I actually have a real OCD with constantly putting hand sanitizer on, so these little bottles of heaven are an absolute life saver.</li>
            <li>We find it really useful to have the small containers that can attach to bags/fit in pockets, especially for play dates and trips to the park</li>

            <li> i love smores</li>
            <li> I love bath and body works</li>
            <li> These were perfect for goody bags I gave to female guests attending my sons graduation.  </li>
            <li> She was very happy with the many different fragrances.</li>
            <li> Fast and great gift for grab bag.</li>
            <li> Absoulutly love all the sents</li>
            <li> Enjoyed but sent a lot of pumpkin spice would be better if there were 2 of each scent</li>
            <li> Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> and I was so glad to find outthat Amazon offered it instead of driving to the closes Bath and Body works every week</li>
            <li> Hoping for more food scents though (:</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I love the scents.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to Island Bamboo, I Love Cake, and Vanilla Cupcake!!</li>
            <li> This is a useful bundle, you get a nice selection of sanitizer gels, and one gel carrier.  </li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> E. coli on their hands is a strong possibility.</li>
            <li> I really love these little hand sanitzers because they come in handy at work and are great to keep in the car, your pocket, or purse.</li>
            <li> These were fine, and I used them, but they were not Bath and Body works brand.</li>
            <li> They all smell fine.</li>
            <li> These little hand sanitizers are perfect for on the go.</li>
            <li> Still, I got 16 really awesome products and a little sanitizer case things</li>
            <li> I love them they make my hands nice and soft.</li>
            <li> and I cannot stand this cheap smell.&lt;br /&gt;Never</li>
            <li> buy this again and not returnable, Never buy this, unless u like cheap perfume smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but overall I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> how smooth they make my skin feel,</li>
            <li> I feel secure that I can sanitize my hands with this product</li>
            <li> Our 12 year old daughter loved this.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very fast and I love the variety of fragrances and lingering scent of these anti-bacterial hand gels and</li>
            <li> This grab bag was so worth it!</li>
            <li> Would have given higher rating if had more variety in package.</li>
            <li> They came in many flower scents and looked so pretty .</li>
            <li> These are authentic bath and body works products firstly, however they did take some time to arrive.</li>
            <li> so she is going to be so excited to get them.</li>
            <li> i think that that is cool.</li>
            <li> I got no more than three of a kind which still leaves good variety.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, and a great price as long as you don&#x27;t care which scents you get!  </li>
            <li> Although I understand where the seller is coming from considering some of these different scents are geared more towards certain times of the year, it would have been nice to know that piece of information under “product description”.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately is no longer available.</li>
            <li> bath and body works,,these will be great little gifts for Christmas...</li>
            <li> From the time I paid for this product until I received it was a total of 3 days and like always the scents are amazing.</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> (all rare pocketbacs)</li>
            <li> in the my pic, i got this right side pocket bac.</li>
            <li> They are just right to put in your purse</li>
            <li> In the order I received a few scents that were geared more towards men, which is great if you have a man in your life that would actually use hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> I love the array of scents,  but the holder is cheap and loose.  </li>
            <li> Received many scents, some were repeated a few times, but overall really nice!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I ordered</li>
            <li> Beware some of these flavors are pretty manly.</li>
            <li> The items purchased were exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Tons of different smells, I love them all.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Bath and Body works personal hand sanitizers.</li>
            <li> I had a few repeats but they were ALL good scents.</li>
            <li> They only put 1 of the pink chiffon which is a good scent, the Japanese cherry is ok, otherwise the others are just tacky!</li>
            <li> other than those issues, i liked most of the smells and the fact that i could get a bundle of them for a single price.</li>
            <li> They were by no means explicitly rude but neither were they extremely warm!</li>
            <li> and  I did not get a large variety.</li>
            <li> there is a large variety of scents here.</li>
            <li> responsible seller, recommend to all amazon community .</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> REALLY ????</li>
            <li> but I really expected more than 5 scents.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I received some really crappy flavors.</li>
            <li> My wife bought one of these sets for the whole family.</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> I have to put a rubber band around the whole thing to keep the gel bottle from falling out.  </li>
            <li> I received new Christmas scents and some I&#x27;ve never heard of!</li>
            <li> When I placed the order I was skeptical because I thought I&#x27;d get regular scents that weren&#x27;t the greatest like the picture shows.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get more of a variety of different scents I got a lot of three that were the same scent.</li>
            <li> Can you get rare ones such as I ❤</li>
            <li> Normally at the Bath and Body Works store, you can get 5 hand sanitizers for $5.00, which is a $1.00 a piece, not including tax.</li>
            <li> Well live and learn I will never buy this again..</li>
            <li> My personal favorite scent from Bath and Body Works is called, “Pink Chiffon” and that was included in the shipment as well.</li>
            <li> These make cute little gifts!</li>
            <li> Got them very early</li>
            <li> I always carry hand sanitizer, and being able to carry it in the little rubber carrier that comes with this set has made a genuine difference to my morning commute on the subway, Some of the smells are a little overpowering, but generally I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> Crisp Apples,2 Raspberry Pink Peony, 1 Pure Paradise, 1 Beautiful Day, 3 Wild Mango Mojito, 1 Hey HoneyBun (Hate it), 1 Pink Chiffon (needed more).</li>
            <li> much cheaper than going to local store.</li>
            <li> I have to use it 15-20 times per shift and using the agency-issued stuff that frequently just destroys your skin and nails.</li>
            <li> the size is small and fits easily into any pocket or purse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d take it that if as a seller you&#x27;re missing the proposed delivery date then your customers should at least be made aware as well as you try to be as warm as possible.</li>
            <li> With cold and flu season on their way, these are a great prevention, and the various scents are like aromatherapy.  </li>
            <li> So I definitely wish I could be more specific in the scents that I would like to have mailed to me, or at least request that the seller does not send me any manly scents.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I actually have a real OCD with constantly putting hand sanitizer on, so these little bottles of heaven are an absolute life saver.</li>
            <li> We find it really useful to have the small containers that can attach to bags/fit in pockets, especially for play dates and trips to the park</li>
            <li> 1 Strawberry,2 Japanese Cherry, 2 Endless Weekend, 1 Cupcake Sweetie,2 Limoncello (ewwww smells awful),1</li>
            <li> Two of the bottles leaked during shipment and the loose sanitizer caused the labels on many of the bottles to degrade and flake off, making them impossible to use as gifts.  </li>
            <li> Wish there had been several of all instead of one of a few and a lot of two or three.</li>
            <li> Items arrived before expected.  </li>
            <li> arrived in timely manner as expected and well assorted</li>
            <li> The grab bag is also a plain red with glitters that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> conclusion is that one probably leaked from the place of shipment, and got all over the other bottles.</li>
            <li> They were packaged in a box without any leakage, however, these scents are sorta old and boring, they could&#x27;ve done much better</li>
            <li> The company indicated that it was due to the bad weather, though it was after waiting and waiting that they confirmed this.</li>
            <li> In this package there was at least 4 bottles of each scent and 2 bottles of the last scent.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can really complain about is that all the scents that are pictured, are not the scents I actually received, which was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Also one of the sanitizers was leaking a little, so that sucked.</li>
            <li> I think this is not a original pack.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not a original margarita collor that&#x27;s looks like a lemon or mango margarita pocket bac.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like a few of the scents and wish I could&#x27;ve had the option to choose which ones I would receive as I ended up throwing a few of them away,  </li>
            <li> I got a few doubles and one triple.</li>
            <li> The sanitizers I received were not shown in picture and do not fit the pocketbac holder I have.</li>
            <li> I keep 3 in my purse, 3 in my car, and a few scattered throughout my house at all times.</li>
            <li> Ok very disappointed 18 bottles 5 scents ...</li>
            <li> Not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have no such males in my life which means that the manly scents are sitting in a drawer just collecting dust.</li>
            <li> and I go through them so fast I never get sick of a scent.</li>
            <li> if I can choose negative star I will choose negative rate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They do indeed appear to be legitimate Bath &amp; Body Works products, at least.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed because I received 17 hand sanitizers, and i was planning for each one to go to a specific person as christmas stocking stuffers, so</li>
            <li> small blingbling inside the gel is even worse.</li>
            <li> I work in law enforcement, and coming in contact with the public in often less-than-clean conditions, hand sanitizer is a MUST unless you want to get sick all the time.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed, however, when the scents were not the same as the ones in the picture.</li>
            <li> To sum it up, I absolutely hate being dirty, and I am constantly putting hand sanitizer on.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> The packaging for my order was very poor.  </li>
            <li> have nothing bad to say at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Danielle</li>
            <li> WRONG!!</li>
            <li> Very Bad packaging.</li>
            <li> Very bad service</li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bathrooms are so disgusting and the gym too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell of this is so terrible</li>

            <li> These are great to have around in winter. Throw them in a pocket or purse. Bathrooms are so disgusting and the gym too. I like thespe</li>
            <li> All came in perfect condition. No damage. Great variety</li>
            <li> While there was a variety, there were a LOT of one kind.  Too many.  Wish there had been several of all instead of one of a few and a lot of two or three.</li>

            <li> These little hand sanitizers are perfect for on the go. I love that they came with a strap to hook the bottle onto my purse or hang from my rear view mirror. It keeps the sanitizer handy so you don&#x27;t have to root around looking for it :-) I didn&#x27;t like a few of the scents and wish I could&#x27;ve had the option to choose which ones I would receive as I ended up throwing a few of them away,  but overall I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I really love my hand sanitizers :)</li>
            <li> riquisimos! i love it</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed because I received 17 hand sanitizers, and i was planning for each one to go to a specific person as christmas stocking stuffers, so now I&#x27;m one short. Also one of the sanitizers was leaking a little, so that sucked. Still, I got 16 really awesome products and a little sanitizer case things i think that that is cool.</li>
            <li> many duplicate scents, but it&#x27;s nice</li>

            <li> Girls were all over these!</li>

            <li> responsible seller, recommend to all amazon community .</li>

            <li> Good product at a good price. Thanks</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, exceptional products!</li>
            <li> When I placed the order I was skeptical because I thought I&#x27;d get regular scents that weren&#x27;t the greatest like the picture shows. WRONG!! I received new Christmas scents and some I&#x27;ve never heard of! I was beyond impressed! Id recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Although not the flavored that I&#x27;m expecting, they still smell good, but one of them leaked during shipping.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. I had a few repeats but they were ALL good scents. This package deal is a nurse&#x27;s dream. Can&#x27;t wait to order again (hope it&#x27;ll be more variety too!)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the regular hand sanitizer, these smell great!</li>
            <li> This smells so good and it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I ordered</li>
            <li> Excellent product worth the experience</li>
            <li> Can you get rare ones such as I ❤️ Cookiedough or i love smores</li>
            <li> These were fine, and I used them, but they were not Bath and Body works brand.</li>
            <li> The packaging for my order was very poor.  Two of the bottles leaked during shipment and the loose sanitizer caused the labels on many of the bottles to degrade and flake off, making them impossible to use as gifts.  They do indeed appear to be legitimate Bath &amp; Body Works products, at least.</li>
            <li> Ok very disappointed 18 bottles 5 scents ... REALLY ???? Well live and learn I will never buy this again.. I love bath and body works but I really expected more than 5 scents. In this package there was at least 4 bottles of each scent and 2 bottles of the last scent. Not impressed. Ugh</li>
            <li> Delivery was very fast and I love the variety of fragrances and lingering scent of these anti-bacterial hand gels and how smooth they make my skin feel,</li>
            <li> These make cute little gifts! Happy with the selection</li>
            <li> Very Bad packaging. very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This had a great variety of scents. Too many to pick my favorite one out of all of them! Thanks.</li>
            <li> All of the pocketbacs that I received were in stores and  I did not get a large variety. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I received some really crappy flavors. I was hoping to get better and popular ones.</li>
            <li> My wife bought one of these sets for the whole family. We put them in each car, each room of the house, and we give them to the grandkids as well. Everybody uses them and we&#x27;re all thankful for these nicely scented anti-bacterial cleansers.</li>
            <li> By having a bundle of these items, one can strategically place them all over the places one frequents.  Then one will no longer be without hand sanitization. I have them in my gym bag, car, kitchen and garage.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the product, price, &amp; scent variety. I threw a preemie baby shower and included these as part of the favors.They were perfect with the &amp;#34;Fight like a Preemie&amp;#34; bracelets I had made!  I would definitely order again!</li>
            <li> The bundle set is a great deal! I was disappointed, however, when the scents were not the same as the ones in the picture. I&#x27;m still happy with the scents, but it was deceptive.</li>
            <li> Lots of variety for a good price! I like having these whereever I go- car, work, different rooms. Beware some of these flavors are pretty manly. Haha You may end up smelling like you&#x27;re covered in mens cologne. I got a few doubles and one triple. They all smell fine.</li>
            <li> These were perfect for goody bags I gave to female guests attending my sons graduation.  I put them in nice plastic bags and tied color ribbons around them.  The ladies loved them.  I loved the assortment of colors and scents.  I will definitely order again; much cheaper than going to local store.</li>
            <li> Our 12 year old daughter loved this. She was very happy with the many different fragrances. It was a very nice added gift for CHRISTmas that wasn&#x27;t costly at all.</li>
            <li> The product is good but the smell of some bottles is not so good. Some people will like and others dont.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied at all. Not as pictured. The sanitizers I received were not shown in picture and do not fit the pocketbac holder I have. Also not returnable. Very bad service</li>
            <li> This grab bag was so worth it! I used the bottles as employee give-aways at work. The value could not be beat-- and unfortunately is no longer available. I&#x27;ll keep on the lookout!</li>
            <li> I love all the scents!</li>
            <li> To be honest, I thought there were going to be rare pocketbacs in this bundle judging by the picture!! Instead, I got the scents that are still sold in stores!! I was really looking forward to Island Bamboo, I Love Cake, and Vanilla Cupcake!! (all rare pocketbacs) DO NOT BUY THIS!! WHAT THE PICTURE SHOWS IS NOT WHAT YOU GET!!</li>
            <li> ordered this product before and am happy with the variety of scents</li>
            <li> Shipped perfect. Fast and great gift for grab bag.</li>
            <li> good stocking stuffers for everyone</li>
            <li> there is a large variety of scents here. they are good to give out in gift bags and all the girls mix and trade them to get the ones they like. the size is small and fits easily into any pocket or purse</li>
            <li> The items purchased were exactly what I wanted. My daughter said she wanted hand sanitizer in her stocking and that&#x27;s what she got. Thank you1</li>
            <li> Great variety of travel size anti-bacterial.  Lots of different scents.  I love the &amp;#34;holder&amp;#34; that came with them and kind of wish two had come with them.</li>
            <li> Just received today!!! If you email the seller you won&#x27;t get any sents repeated!!!! Absoulutly love all the sents</li>
            <li> I think this is not a original pack. in the my pic, i got this right side pocket bac. look at that&#x27;s not a original margarita collor that&#x27;s looks like a lemon or mango margarita pocket bac. compare them.</li>
            <li> I liked this package.  Had some duplicate scents.  Would have given higher rating if had more variety in package.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly. Great scents.</li>
            <li> These were great! I ordered them to gift as favors for a baby shower I was hosting. These are a great price and worked out perfectly!</li>
            <li> I bought these as part of a party favor . They are just right to put in your purse so you always have hand sanitizer with you. They came in many flower scents and looked so pretty .</li>
            <li> Okay...wish they didn&#x27;t send ones with glitter in them...</li>
            <li> Enjoyed but sent a lot of pumpkin spice would be better if there were 2 of each scent</li>
            <li> These are perfect! A nice variety of scents and packaged well!</li>
            <li> This was a great buy at a great price. The assortment is amazing and I&#x27;m very happy. Will buy again for sure. Also, I didn&#x27;t receive two of the same scented bottles.</li>
            <li> upon receiving the items and opening the package, it smelled as though one of the containers leaked, but after checking each one, they were not opened. conclusion is that one probably leaked from the place of shipment, and got all over the other bottles. because of this, the labels were peeling, and the paint is coming off. other than those issues, i liked most of the smells and the fact that i could get a bundle of them for a single price.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy. Tons of different smells, I love them all.</li>
            <li> All Bath &amp; Body Works and all good scents!</li>
            <li> I give these out to friends.  They smell great and are easy to carry around on or in my purse.  My daughter attaches them to her backpack.  With cold and flu season on their way, these are a great prevention, and the various scents are like aromatherapy.  LOVE these!!</li>
            <li> I work in law enforcement, and coming in contact with the public in often less-than-clean conditions, hand sanitizer is a MUST unless you want to get sick all the time. I have to use it 15-20 times per shift and using the agency-issued stuff that frequently just destroys your skin and nails. This is as effective, and contains moisturizers so your skin stays nice. The variety of scents is awesome and I go through them so fast I never get sick of a scent. My coworkers constantly hit me up to use these. Great deal!</li>
            <li> grat may bottles  need alittle more variety but good .</li>
            <li> These are authentic bath and body works products firstly, however they did take some time to arrive. The company indicated that it was due to the bad weather, though it was after waiting and waiting that they confirmed this. I&#x27;d take it that if as a seller you&#x27;re missing the proposed delivery date then your customers should at least be made aware as well as you try to be as warm as possible. They were by no means explicitly rude but neither were they extremely warm! It-was-just-the-weather-so-that&#x27;s-that kinda vibe I was getting. Anyways I received all 18 of them and I did indicate via email requesting some good scents and these were the nes I got: 1 Strawberry,2 Japanese Cherry, 2 Endless Weekend, 1 Cupcake Sweetie,2 Limoncello (ewwww smells awful),1 Crisp Apples,2 Raspberry Pink Peony, 1 Pure Paradise, 1 Beautiful Day, 3 Wild Mango Mojito, 1 Hey HoneyBun (Hate it), 1 Pink Chiffon (needed more). The grab bag is also a plain red with glitters that I didn&#x27;t like. They were packaged in a box without any leakage, however, these scents are sorta old and boring, they could&#x27;ve done much better and since I did request some good scents, they should&#x27;ve tried. They only put 1 of the pink chiffon which is a good scent, the Japanese cherry is ok, otherwise the others are just tacky!</li>
            <li> The Bath and Body Works Pocketbacs are the Best, they all smell so good, I use them all the time. I wash my hand and use&lt;br /&gt;the pocketbacs several times a day. Great product.</li>
            <li> I love the array of scents,  but the holder is cheap and loose.  I have to put a rubber band around the whole thing to keep the gel bottle from falling out.  Otherwise it&#x27;s a great buy,  and we attend a lot of events with a lot of people so it&#x27;s nice to have hanging from my bag.</li>
            <li> I really love these little hand sanitzers because they come in handy at work and are great to keep in the car, your pocket, or purse. Though I personally bought this product as a Christmas gift, I wouldn&#x27;t mind ordering some for myself. The scents are amazing, price was great and the time it took to get here was incredible!&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing bad to say at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Danielle</li>
            <li> I luv bath and body works,,these will be great little gifts for Christmas...And with everything going around everyone should be sanitizing their hands all the time!!!</li>
            <li> Since birth I have been mysophobic, which is the technical term for being a germaphobe. To sum it up, I absolutely hate being dirty, and I am constantly putting hand sanitizer on. I absolutely love Bath and Body works personal hand sanitizers. I keep 3 in my purse, 3 in my car, and a few scattered throughout my house at all times. I bought these products and like all Bath and Body Works products, I was beyond impressed. From the time I paid for this product until I received it was a total of 3 days and like always the scents are amazing. My personal favorite scent from Bath and Body Works is called, “Pink Chiffon” and that was included in the shipment as well. Normally at the Bath and Body Works store, you can get 5 hand sanitizers for $5.00, which is a $1.00 a piece, not including tax. This seems to be more expensive to order from considering you are only getting 18 hand sanitizers plus the holder for $21.99. The only negative thing I can really complain about is that all the scents that are pictured, are not the scents I actually received, which was very disappointing. When I emailed the seller regarding this issue he/she responded by saying, “we mail out the products that are currently in season.” Although I understand where the seller is coming from considering some of these different scents are geared more towards certain times of the year, it would have been nice to know that piece of information under “product description”. In the order I received a few scents that were geared more towards men, which is great if you have a man in your life that would actually use hand sanitizer. Unfortunately, I have no such males in my life which means that the manly scents are sitting in a drawer just collecting dust. So I definitely wish I could be more specific in the scents that I would like to have mailed to me, or at least request that the seller does not send me any manly scents. Overall this product is a daily part of my life and I was so glad to find outthat Amazon offered it instead of driving to the closes Bath and Body works every week to re-stock my hand sanitizer hoard. Believe it or not, I actually have a real OCD with constantly putting hand sanitizer on, so these little bottles of heaven are an absolute life saver.</li>
            <li> arrived in timely manner as expected and well assorted</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get more of a variety of different scents I got a lot of three that were the same scent.</li>
            <li> GREAT! Received many scents, some were repeated a few times, but overall really nice! Hoping for more food scents though (:</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT. GREAT GIFT.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I work with preschoolers and often hold their hand when we walk. This age often have issues wiping after going to bathroom. E. coli on their hands is a strong possibility. I feel secure that I can sanitize my hands with this product and I love the scents.</li>
            <li> Very handy for my line of work!</li>
            <li> Love this ! It&#x27;s my favorite. They all smell good, and for the price I couldn&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> This is a useful bundle, you get a nice selection of sanitizer gels, and one gel carrier.  We find it really useful to have the small containers that can attach to bags/fit in pockets, especially for play dates and trips to the park</li>
            <li> AMAZING assortment of mini hand sanitizers! My step daughter collects these so she is going to be so excited to get them. I got two of each kind in the assortment which is great because she like to give them to her friends.</li>
