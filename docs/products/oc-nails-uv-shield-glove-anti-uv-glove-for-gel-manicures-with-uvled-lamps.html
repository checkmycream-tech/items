            <li>I purchased the gloves for my wife, who has medium-to-small sized hands, and the gloves were too baggy to use comfortably for their intended purpose.  </li>
            <li>These gloves fit well and look get - I always get noticed at the nail salon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are fabulous</li>
            <li>THEY FIT</li>
            <li>and I thought they would fit tighter.</li>
            <li>Great concept, however glove tips are slightly long and need to be turned over, depending on finger lengths.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m really trying to prevent age spots on my hands :).</li>
            <li>Not to mention, these gloves keep your hands cool on the steering wheel.</li>
            <li>Great product,  fast shipping,  comfortable and leaves only finger tips out.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend these gloves:)</li>
            <li>Gloves are OK quality, but be aware that they are rather large.  </li>
            <li>well I don&#x27;t really like the fit.  </li>
            <li>Worth the investment for home gel manicures.</li>
            <li>These are super comfortable and the material is soft .</li>
            <li>They are really durable and actually look cute!</li>
            <li>Gloves fit good for my small hands and very fast fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I have small hands and they fit good, I LOVE THE HOT PINK COLOR, SO GIRLY.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s very convienant !</li>
            <li>Love the quality of material of these OC Nails Shield Glove, pretty thick and seams look sturdy, beautiful bright pink-berry like color ( I am not a fan of pink color usually)</li>

            <li>I  love my hot pink UV gloves that I wear during my gel manicure.  </li>

            <li>Plus they are PINK, my favorite color.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love pink ?</li>

            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Good quality not those cheapo thin gloves from Royal Nails (avoid) in which seams separated the moment I wore them, mind you</li>
            <li>With all the bad news out there about cancer, it is nice to be able to do a beauty product and have something protect my hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although, I have read studies that concluded the UV light for doing nails a few minutes does not increase the cancer risk.</li>
            <li>I ordered these gloves because I have an at home gel polish professional system</li>
            <li>SO FAR</li>
            <li>Everyone has different finger lengths, and mine hands are very small and they work just fine.  </li>

            <li> I  love my hot pink UV gloves that I wear during my gel manicure.  Now I can put my hand in the UV nail dryer worry free!! Everyone asks me about the gloves because they are a bright color but I love the fact that they are a conversation piece &amp; safe too!!!</li>
            <li> These gloves are really cool, both in terms of the way they look, and the way they feel. I am using them for driving gloves. I&#x27;m really trying to prevent age spots on my hands :). Not to mention, these gloves keep your hands cool on the steering wheel. Maybe the *only* suggestion I would have for the manufacturers to consider is making them cover a little bit further up the wrist. But on the whole, I am very happy with these gloves. Good price too!</li>
            <li> Received them 2 days ago and I am satisfied!</li>
            <li> Gloves are OK quality, but be aware that they are rather large.  They are advertised as &amp;#34;One size fits most.&amp;#34;  This is true, but not in a particularly good way.  If they are big enough, they will fit most.  I purchased the gloves for my wife, who has medium-to-small sized hands, and the gloves were too baggy to use comfortably for their intended purpose.  For the price, not worth the cost and time of trying to return them.</li>
            <li> many compliments by the manicurists in the salon</li>
            <li> So nice and love it . Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great product,  fast shipping,  comfortable and leaves only finger tips out. My clients love them</li>
            <li> Item was as described and was shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> You get what you see. Nothing special, just a simple purchase. Fits nicely. I wish it came in even more colors.</li>
            <li> These are great!  Every time I get a gel mani people ask me where to find these gloves.  My paranoia over getting premature wrinkles on my hands is over.</li>
            <li> These gloves are awesome!  The color and fit are perfect!</li>
            <li> I am in love with these gloves. The material is amazing and fit perfect. They are made to last and protect the hands. I will defiantly recommend this product to everyone!  Get a pair and protect your skin!</li>
            <li> They work great...just a little to big.</li>
            <li> Gloves fit good for my small hands and very fast fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if these really block the UV. I use them anyway just in case when doing gel nails. Although, I have read studies that concluded the UV light for doing nails a few minutes does not increase the cancer risk. Still I&#x27;d rather be safe than sorry.</li>
            <li> These gloves are amazing! I won&#x27;t have to worry about aging my hands faster with gel manicures anymore! They are super comfortable and well made. Plus they are PINK, my favorite color. Every salon NEEDS these!</li>
            <li> Love these gloves!!!  I own a salon and many of my clients were concerned about the UV rays they were getting from my lamps.  I tried a few different gloves with little success. My clients fell in love with these gloves, they are super comfy and fit all size hands.  A big plus for me is that they don&#x27;t fall apart in the wash....would highly recommend these gloves:)</li>
            <li> I have small hands and they fit good, I LOVE THE HOT PINK COLOR, SO GIRLY.</li>

            <li> These gloves are amazing! They are super comfortable and protect my hands from age spots when I get my gel manicures. They are really durable and actually look cute! A must have if you get gel manicures!</li>
            <li> For me personally it&#x27;s the best before using these i could feel the uv light burning my hands so i decided to try these gloves .well since I start using  them no more burning i would recommend</li>
            <li> These gloves fit well and look get - I always get noticed at the nail salon. I&#x27;m happy that I have reduced my UV ray exposure.</li>
            <li> These gloves are great, I do my own gel nails.  With all the bad news out there about cancer, it is nice to be able to do a beauty product and have something protect my hands.&lt;br /&gt;These are fabulous</li>

            <li> I love the gloves! Fit perfectly, cover all but the fingertips, beautiful color to boot!!!</li>
            <li> I use these every time for my gel manicures and they always get attention at the nail salon by both customers and the nail salon employees/owners.  It&#x27;s so important to protect your skin - would not get another gel manicure without these!  Everyone has different finger lengths, and mine hands are very small and they work just fine.  Maybe not for women whose hands are large.</li>
            <li> I like them to use for my hands protection during my shellac nails painting...like the color</li>
            <li> Good gloves for protection</li>
            <li> Love these! Great color and fit!</li>
            <li> Good quality not those cheapo thin gloves from Royal Nails (avoid) in which seams separated the moment I wore them, mind you my hand size is small and fingers are not thick. Love the quality of material of these OC Nails Shield Glove, pretty thick and seams look sturdy, beautiful bright pink-berry like color ( I am not a fan of pink color usually) yet I love them! Seem to last for a while. Worth the investment for home gel manicures.</li>
            <li> These gloves are perfect for my gel manicure. I&#x27;m a girlie girl so the color is great. Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I ordered these gloves because I have an at home gel polish professional system and I was getting tired of putting on sun screen and forgetting to put it on so I figured I would be safer to buy gloves and they are exactly what the image shows. the fit perfectly I no longer feel the heat some UV gives off and I feel better and have piece of mind knowing that I took the extra step to protect myself</li>
            <li> These are an excellent way to protect your hands from the UV lights in shellac nail machines. I love them!</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY ANTI UV GLOVES. THEY DO THE JOB. I HAVE USED THEM 3 TIMES SO FAR AND AM THRILLED WITH THEM. I MUST STATE THEY ARE BEAUTIFULLY CONSTRUCTED AND THEY FIT BEAUTIFULLY.&lt;br /&gt;SOPHIE GLUHAICH</li>
            <li> Love the Hot Pink color.  Although they appear to be made well I don&#x27;t really like the fit.  Thumb is a little short and I thought they would fit tighter.</li>
            <li> Not for small hands with shorter fingers. The thumbs especially kept gliding up onto my nail defeating the purpose since it smudged my polish.</li>
            <li> I use these gloves while driving. They are nice and also it&#x27;s easy to use your phone if you need too.</li>
            <li> Wonderful experience. Great color. Great price! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I like the idea behind these, however I struggled to keep the ends away from my wet polish. Definitely made for those with bigger hands/longer fingers. I would look at something else if your hands are small.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my clients that worry about the UV lamps and their skin . These are super comfortable and the material is soft . One size fits all and it fits majority of my clients . Not to mention the cute color ! Who doesn&#x27;t love pink ? I recommend this for anyone worried about their skin when getting gel nails. It&#x27;s very convienant !</li>
