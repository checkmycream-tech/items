            <li> Not 6 inches long, actually 11 inches.  </li>
            <li> One was a fuscia color, the other black and white check.</li>
            <li> A little flimsy but the price reflected the quality to be expected.</li>
            <li> Love the umbrella but hate that I received a rainbow one of all colors in the world</li>
            <li> Wanted 2 black for my boys.  </li>
            <li> Received one black and one leopard.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this seller.</li>
            <li> The description is wrong and they won&#x27;t take them back!</li>
            <li> It is small and relatively lightweight and holds up in bad weather.</li>
            <li> When they say assorted colors, that means you get the color they send you and expect the worse.</li>

            <li> When they say assorted colors, that means you get the color they send you and expect the worse. We bought two. One was a fuscia color, the other black and white check. They are very good quality, but I gave them to my wife.</li>
            <li> Not 6 inches long, actually 11 inches.  I bought this to be carried in a purse and it is too big. On the plus side, it has totes quality and is a good umbrella, just the same size as any other totes.</li>

            <li> Works good, not as small as I expected.  I bought this mainly for size so I could drop it in my briefcase when I suspect rain but not looking to carry the big golf umbrella.  For that purpose it works pretty well though I have run into smaller ones since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  It is fitting the briefcase despite the size and for its size works well in the rain.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little small but has good quality. has automatic system to open. it is light and convenient. it is a good choice because cheap and good quality.</li>

            <li> Great to have. I bought it for a trip to Ireland, but it did not rain. However, It fit nicely in my suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;Very well made.</li>
            <li> I went to local stores looking for one of these. I found them at Kohl&#x27;s on sale for over $20! This one is very good-looking, works great and fits in a school bookbag. The fellow I bought it for loves it.</li>
            <li> All three items as described!  good deal!  I bought for several family members and they are very happy with their gifts.</li>
            <li> Wanted 2 black for my boys.  Received one black and one leopard.</li>
            <li> I did not like this at ALL..I bought it for my son and it was like a freakin rainbow!!! He obviously wouldn&#x27;t walk around with it and even I wouldn&#x27;t SOOOOOOO because I have so little free time and haven&#x27;t sent it back/ I guess I will save it for the unwanted guest and hope that it stays with them.</li>
            <li> Good for the price. A little flimsy but the price reflected the quality to be expected. The spring action button works to open it. Make sure you hold it away from face when you open it, it unfurls very well. LOL</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavier than I wanted but it works and feels sturdy for the price.  It was delivered on time and in good condition.  It&#x27;s nice to have a cover for it.</li>
