            <li>DEF TAKES AWAY EYE SWELLING AND SOFTNES LIGHT LINES</li>
            <li>i am so happy i finally have!!!!</li>
            <li>Before you buy anything on Amazon click on \\&quot;more buying choices\\&quot; on the right side of the page.</li>
            <li>Was really excited to get this in the mail.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even want to use them at first because I wasn&#x27;t sure what&#x27;s in them.  </li>
            <li>and I did these for a few days in advance, I was happy to have so many as I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and need all the help I can get.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several products out there and by far this product is the best out there for the fraction of the price...</li>
            <li>But nothing too special</li>
            <li>well, when i took them off, my under eyes were full and glowing.</li>
            <li>best use while laying down.. will definitely order some more...</li>
            <li>But, delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>Really works well on under eye bags or puffy eyes!!</li>
            <li>These are pretty cool.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a shot</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, overall good product.</li>
            <li>I was expecting company so was too busy to lay around while they worked their magic.  </li>
            <li>and I think this one is by far a better purchase</li>
            <li>My packets have the ingredient list and directions right on them.</li>
            <li>after the first few uses i can see a huge difference!!!</li>
            <li>i dont get excited when i am trying something new because i have never had success...</li>
            <li>These are pretty rad.</li>
            <li>You can see result  on the first treatment.</li>
            <li>Used these for the first time today.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>You may not get results after the first use, but it isn&#x27;t surgery either.  </li>
            <li>But the coolness actually feels really refreshing.  </li>
            <li>This would be ok if they listed the product properly</li>
            <li>There were no instructions included, either, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if they were only for nighttime wear.</li>
            <li>You can see exactly differenc.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re white &amp; more jelly material.</li>
            <li>I just tried them for the first time.</li>
            <li>This contains pure chemicals and should be pulled from amazon.</li>
            <li>they are cheap and actually contain collagen.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast too.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The whole BHT for me is beside the point.</li>
            <li>I was hopeful but nothing seems to really help besides plastic surgery.</li>
            <li>i really didnt know if i would find anything that works...</li>
            <li>, very cooling and the moisture go&#x27;s into the skin , without traveling I to your eyes..</li>
            <li>i got  better deal off eBay, they&#x27;re somewhat the same consistency, but more firm, not slimy like these.</li>
            <li>they are very slimy and malible, but did stick to my skin.</li>
            <li>I know this isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;forever\\&quot; fix, but at least they look good temporarily.</li>
            <li>They are completely gone right now.</li>
            <li>The patches have Hyaluronic acid in/on them as well as many other ingredients.</li>
            <li>Maybe my expectations are too high.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money, if even to only wear them before going out for the night.</li>
            <li>I then put them on my forehead to get a few more miles.  </li>
            <li>Will update my post when I&#x27;ve had a few days to see what they do (or don&#x27;t do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 6, 2013:  OK, so this is an update after having used the product for a couple days.  </li>
            <li>Good to use before you go out, when you&#x27;re tired and or when you&#x27;re doing a beauty night.</li>
            <li>In any case, they do feel good on my tired face at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I DON&#x27;T HAVE ANY NEW ONES,</li>
            <li>Make sure to recline when they are on or they slide down!!</li>
            <li>I cannot believe that for the first time in my life I actually have the puffiness under my eyes shrinking!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m logically guessing this effect is only temporary.</li>
            <li>Well, they were certainly shipped and received quickly enough.  </li>
            <li>The friends of mine kept telling me I look young than before.</li>
            <li>This is the first time ever I got a cosmetic product without a single word of description - no ingredients, no country of origin - nothing.  </li>
            <li>It helps dark circle and wrinkle under eye very much.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my Mother, after using for couple of days her skin starts to become clear you can tell the different.</li>
            <li>Since they are wet, they will slide around with much activity.</li>
            <li>barely any around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I used them laying down for the most part, but I did get up to do a few things</li>
            <li>not much to say, they feel cool on the eye but do not do anything really  waste of money</li>
            <li>a boring Sunday lol)  and was really surpised when I took them off.</li>

            <li> not much to say, they feel cool on the eye but do not do anything really  waste of money</li>
            <li> a boring Sunday lol)  and was really surpised when I took them off.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package, however, each individually wrapped eye patch was wet on the outside of the packaging.  </li>
            <li> They are in individual packets in a wet solution.</li>
            <li> It takes a few minutes before they completely stay in place</li>
            <li> anyway, I wore them for 2 hours till they began to dry up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands, some very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I had to loose my money</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this causes permanent damage as the area is so delicate.  </li>
            <li> Plus, there are absolutely no directions on the packaging or within the envelope in which they were shipped.  </li>
            <li> BUT NO DISAPPEARANCE OF DARK CIRCLES, I USE ALL NIGHT LONG</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them a few times and see no obvious results.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t do that with other brands.  </li>
            <li> In the package, except the receipt, you can not find any other words for telling what is is, how to use it, when it was produced.</li>
            <li> The product works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for dark circles but that&#x27;s not a shocker.</li>
            <li> no where does it list 24k gold but instead has BHT a common food preservative that has come under fire recently for</li>
            <li> Was not worth the price......</li>
            <li> I recommend it for removing dark circles around eyes, and you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> Dark circles were cleared and the area was hydrated .</li>
            <li> Dark circle and puffy eye disappear.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering with dark circles and eyebugs for awhile now...</li>
            <li> Down side</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what it comes down to.</li>
            <li> a lot of commenters said they had to lie down.  </li>
            <li> I noticed immediately that I have less crow feet wrinkles around my eyes</li>
            <li> , they slide off of my face, they sting a little, and they didn&#x27;t help my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have to say, though, that I feel like I look a little like \\&quot;Junior Birdman,\\</li>
            <li> if you have dark circles and have tried everything, take a chance on these!</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t dried out.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll probably go to other brands that are pricier but at least you know what you&#x27;re getting</li>
            <li> The package is hard to open, they slide all over the place and don&#x27;t quite settle till they are dry, at which point they are probably useless.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even that wrinkled yet but trying to slow down aging.</li>
            <li> I am not sure they are reducing any wrinkles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I expectioning but with using the product I have not seen a change.</li>
            <li> I look and feel rested, no more puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why some had a hard time keeping these on?  </li>
            <li> I bought from US UNIVERSAL INTERNATIONAL CORP, I wonder if the bad ones are from Thai Advance as they have poor feedback?</li>
            <li> and  they looked less tired...</li>
            <li> and there are some noticeable results at least for a bit.</li>
            <li> They are Thick and Gelly like.</li>
            <li> UNBELIEVABLE!  </li>
            <li> Also, I wonder if some of the bad reviews are ordering from a different company.</li>
            <li> Helps wake up tired eyes and reduces puffiness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m officially addicted and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> , worse than that is</li>
            <li> it is a  irritating produc.  </li>
            <li> but I have circles under my eyes and always look tired.</li>
            <li> and now I am addicted!</li>
            <li> you rly can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I was also itching like crazy.  </li>
            <li> As one poster described, they are cold</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in these -- they were cold and felt like I was wearing slugs on my face.  </li>
            <li> i have terrible dark circles under my eyes, i have tried every product on them and nothing has worked.... until now!!!!</li>
            <li> Awful awful Awful awful, don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> This is the worst experience I buy something on amazon.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are pretty cool. They are Thick and Gelly like. Down side they contain alcohol, which confuses me, because alcohol dries out your skin. I&#x27;ve been using them anyway and it hasn&#x27;t dried out. It tingles and I hope collagen penetrates. Best used after hot shower/bath and in bed/sofa relaxing to work best. It&#x27;s worth a shot they are cheap and actually contain collagen. Good picker-upper for your under eyes. Delivery was fast too.</li>
            <li> Really works well on under eye bags or puffy eyes!!</li>
            <li> These are pretty rad. Slippery, kinda slimy and refreshing. Helps wake up tired eyes and reduces puffiness. Doesn&#x27;t do anything for dark circles but that&#x27;s not a shocker. Good to use before you go out, when you&#x27;re tired and or when you&#x27;re doing a beauty night.</li>
            <li> These are the only thing I&#x27;ve found which reduce my under eye puffiness</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, overall good product. But nothing too special</li>
            <li> This works like a charm. I&#x27;m officially addicted and you can&#x27;t beat the price. x</li>
            <li> Works well to de-puff and smooth out fine lines. Make sure to recline when they are on or they slide down!!</li>
            <li> not much to say, they feel cool on the eye but do not do anything really  waste of money</li>
            <li> You can see result  on the first treatment.</li>
            <li> After 2 nights of using it, I&#x27;ve got peeling on my low eyes!</li>
            <li> Used these for the first time today. I really liked them! They are in individual packets in a wet solution. Upon applying they have a cooling effect. The patches have Hyaluronic acid in/on them as well as many other ingredients. They are not the sticky type like frownies. Since they are wet, they will slide around with much activity. I used them laying down for the most part, but I did get up to do a few things and they didn&#x27;t move. Just don&#x27;t expect them to stick to you like the undereye patches you wear overnight. I left these on for 30 minutes. When I removed them my undereye area was completely smooth. I am in my 40&#x27;s and have a lot of crosshatch type lines under my eyes. They are completely gone right now. I know this isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;forever\\&quot; fix, but at least they look good temporarily. Well worth the money, if even to only wear them before going out for the night. Also, I wonder if some of the bad reviews are ordering from a different company. They are saying theirs came without ingredients listed and without instructions. My packets have the ingredient list and directions right on them. Before you buy anything on Amazon click on \\&quot;more buying choices\\&quot; on the right side of the page. Check seller feedback. I bought from US UNIVERSAL INTERNATIONAL CORP, I wonder if the bad ones are from Thai Advance as they have poor feedback?</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT SEEMS TO KEEP WRIINKLES UNDER THE EYES AT BAY...I DON&#x27;T HAVE ANY NEW ONES, SO I GUESS IT&#x27;S EFFECTIVE</li>
            <li> Good value. I love these eye masks. They are good to use right before events or pictures, etc.</li>
            <li> Please do not buy these &amp;#34;collagen&amp;#34; eye masks.  I used them one night before a big event and woke up with a swollen under eye area as well as red irritation marks. I was also itching like crazy.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this causes permanent damage as the area is so delicate.  This contains pure chemicals and should be pulled from amazon.</li>
            <li> Such a great price! Fast shipping! Great value!  I&#x27;ve been using eye masks for years.  I&#x27;ve tried many brands, some very expensive.  These little gems are awesome.  I&#x27;m not sure why some had a hard time keeping these on?  I was expecting company so was too busy to lay around while they worked their magic.  I cleaned my house and even vacuumed one day while wearing these!  That&#x27;s impressive considering I couldn&#x27;t do that with other brands.  I&#x27;ll admit I did have to adjust once in awhile, but no big deal.  I&#x27;m grateful for the price as we were having a family portrait taken and I did these for a few days in advance, I was happy to have so many as I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and need all the help I can get.  I&#x27;m a cheapo from way back ... when I got done wearing these under my eyes I then put them on my forehead to get a few more miles.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the results considering the price is so great.  These are worth your effort to at least try.  You may not get results after the first use, but it isn&#x27;t surgery either.  These feel great and do just what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> UNBELIEVABLE!  You put this on for 30 minutes and your skin changes drastically.  It looks 20 years younger instantly.  Will use these forever!!!</li>
            <li> wonderful, feels great, nice treat for yourself or others as a basket gift. Cannot beat the good for skin results ingredients.</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning when my eyes are baggy and swollen.&lt;br /&gt;Works great...I love it,love it.... Recommend it</li>
            <li> Coolest feeling eye masks. I love these to nap in because they stay on well. Great for puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do squat for my eyes</li>
            <li> Fell in love with &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; cosmetics. When I received these eye patches, I thought they would never work. They were just gold colored dipped in some sorta liquid. Thought I would try them and now I am addicted! I cannot believe that for the first time in my life I actually have the puffiness under my eyes shrinking!!</li>
            <li> Great product, great seller.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I put these in the refridgerater and put on my eyes for the drive in to work each day.  They took away the bags from my eyes for the day.  I am not sure they are reducing any wrinkles however I like the ease of how they stay on my face and the feel of them under my eyes.</li>
            <li> it is a interesting concept</li>
            <li> Well, they were certainly shipped and received quickly enough.  When I opened the package, however, each individually wrapped eye patch was wet on the outside of the packaging.  Can&#x27;t tell if they were just \\&quot;sweating\\&quot; or if they leaked.  Plus, there are absolutely no directions on the packaging or within the envelope in which they were shipped.  You&#x27;ll have to log back onto to Amazon.com and read the directions on the product page.  Haven&#x27;t used them, yet, as they just arrived today.  Will update my post when I&#x27;ve had a few days to see what they do (or don&#x27;t do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 6, 2013:  OK, so this is an update after having used the product for a couple days.  As one poster described, they are cold and *do* feel a bit like \\&quot;slugs\\&quot; underneath your eyes.  But the coolness actually feels really refreshing.  It takes a few minutes before they completely stay in place (they tend to slide around a bit), but the directions say you&#x27;re supposed to press on them for several minutes, so you end up re-positioning them anyway.  I guess they can&#x27;t hurt, and they might even help.  In any case, they do feel good on my tired face at the end of the day. I have to say, though, that I feel like I look a little like \\&quot;Junior Birdman,\\&quot; if any of you folks over 50 remember that character.</li>
            <li> DEF TAKES AWAY EYE SWELLING AND SOFTNES LIGHT LINES BUT NO DISAPPEARANCE OF DARK CIRCLES, I USE ALL NIGHT LONG AND U CANT USE THESE 2X</li>
            <li> Was really excited to get this in the mail. Received it yesterday and it looks nothing like what is pictured, worse than that is I read the ingredients and no where does it list 24k gold but instead has BHT a common food preservative that has come under fire recently for it&#x27;s toxicity. The whole BHT for me is beside the point. I bought the eye patch because it was listed as 24k Gold NOT GOLD COLORED EYE PATCH. I&#x27;m beyond upset. This would be ok if they listed the product properly then I would have just moved on but they LIED! That&#x27;s what it comes down to. I was misled to believe I was getting something I was not.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in these -- they were cold and felt like I was wearing slugs on my face.  They slide around as well, so I cannot say whether they worked at all.  There were no instructions included, either, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if they were only for nighttime wear.</li>
            <li> I love it, my clients love it and will ordered more, easy and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the intro of the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them a few times and see no obvious results. I was hopeful but nothing seems to really help besides plastic surgery. Maybe my expectations are too high. I&#x27;m not even that wrinkled yet but trying to slow down aging.</li>
            <li> This is the first time ever I got a cosmetic product without a single word of description - no ingredients, no country of origin - nothing.  For all I know it could be rubber soaked in water.  The package is hard to open, they slide all over the place and don&#x27;t quite settle till they are dry, at which point they are probably useless.  I didn&#x27;t even want to use them at first because I wasn&#x27;t sure what&#x27;s in them.  But then I tried them.  They didn&#x27;t hurt, so ultimately I used them up. No change, no improvement, but as I said, they didn&#x27;t hurt me.  So I&#x27;ll probably go to other brands that are pricier but at least you know what you&#x27;re getting and there are some noticeable results at least for a bit.</li>
            <li> It works wonderful. It helps dark circle and wrinkle under eye very much. Let them lay on under eyes over 30 minutes. You can see exactly differenc. I love it. A+++</li>
            <li> Love these! Order was received promptly!</li>
            <li> Awful awful Awful awful, don&#x27;t buy it is a  irritating produc.  I had to loose my money and  besides it damage your skin it won&#x27;t help or solve your puffing problems under eyes area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I expectioning but with using the product I have not seen a change. The patches do not stay in place. Was not worth the price......</li>
            <li> i have terrible dark circles under my eyes, i have tried every product on them and nothing has worked.... until now!!!! i dont get excited when i am trying something new because i have never had success... but i absoutely love this product!!!!!!! after the first few uses i can see a huge difference!!! i will continue to use these!!! you can use them multiple times if you put back in the package and in a ziploc baggie after you use them. if you have dark circles and have tried everything, take a chance on these! i really didnt know if i would find anything that works... i am so happy i finally have!!!!</li>
            <li> I believe I&#x27;ve found another steal of deal. The price was so good and they offered free shipping so how could I not try this product. The product is very nice..  the pads stay on well, very cooling and the moisture go&#x27;s into the skin , without traveling I to your eyes..Glad I tried the eye pads.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this works.  But, delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my Mother, after using for couple of days her skin starts to become clear you can tell the different. I recommend it for removing dark circles around eyes, and you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> pack with Hitece@ together, how do I know?</li>
            <li> Wonderful mask! Dark circles were cleared and the area was hydrated .</li>
            <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;i change my mind. this ar too slippery, they slide off of my face, they sting a little, and they didn&#x27;t help my dark circles. i got  better deal off eBay, they&#x27;re somewhat the same consistency, but more firm, not slimy like these. they&#x27;re white &amp; more jelly material. they also work a ton better. research eBay. dont waste your money</li>
            <li> Best eye mask ever...I have tried the one from Shiseido and I think this one is by far a better purchase</li>
            <li> This product works great I look and feel rested, no more puffy eyes. I highly recommend it, and the price is great.</li>
            <li> This one is in low quality. In the package, except the receipt, you can not find any other words for telling what is is, how to use it, when it was produced. This is the worst experience I buy something on amazon. I think amazon should kick it out.</li>
            <li> I just tried them for the first time. they stuck to my eyes so I was able to walk around. that surpised me bc a lot of commenters said they had to lie down.  they are very slimy and malible, but did stick to my skin. once on, they can easily be moved around if needed, so it&#x27;s not like once you take them off they lose their ability to adhere. very nice.  anyway, I wore them for 2 hours till they began to dry up (just bc.. it was a boring Sunday lol)  and was really surpised when I took them off. I&#x27;m 30, and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles at all. barely any around my eyes. but I have circles under my eyes and always look tired. well, when i took them off, my under eyes were full and glowing. I was very pleased. I&#x27;m logically guessing this effect is only temporary. so I&#x27;ll use these before I go out or something like that. but Ya, for  $.50/pair.. you rly can&#x27;t go wrong. great purchase</li>
            <li> I will order this prduct again meets my needs</li>
            <li> The eye mask made me feel good. I am happy with the result. I already use it for couple of time. The friends of mine kept telling me I look young than before. Dark circle and puffy eye disappear. I recommend my friend to try it. I will buy it more.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering with dark circles and eyebugs for awhile now...not getting enough sleep and working the graveyard shift doesnt help...I have tried several products out there and by far this product is the best out there for the fraction of the price...I just cant believe the miracle that it delivers...after using it for several weeks....I noticed immediately that I have less crow feet wrinkles around my eyes and  they looked less tired...best use while laying down.. will definitely order some more...Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and feels great afterwards. A must buy for sure!!! The product works extremely well.  Item ships very quickly too!</li>
