            <li>Everyone commented on how good I smelled when I was wearing it.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I make my own lotion and wanted to try this.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this stuff, mostly because of how delicious it smells.</li>
            <li>Tried it out and the scent is very strong.  </li>
            <li>The scent is wonderful and for once my hands an skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>This lotion is more greasy than I like and has a very strong, pungent scent.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell of patchouli oil, but realize not everyone shares my affection for it.</li>
            <li>We love everything dr bronners.</li>
            <li>This is our favorite smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever tried a better lotion.</li>
            <li>I noticed that this lotion smelled overwhelmingly like ethyl alcohol, but tried it anyway.</li>
            <li>I love how this treats my skin</li>
            <li>If you love Patchouli then you will love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I use all of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products and love the smell.  </li>
            <li>This used to be my absolute favorite lotion!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to put up with those things just because it smells so good.</li>
            <li>Even as I write this I am becoming overwhelmed with scent.</li>
            <li>but the smell is so extremely strong.</li>
            <li>Upon arrival I was overwhelmed with the extremely strong scent this product had (overpowering almost).</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just statement-making strong.</li>
            <li>, I think it has a nice unique smell though kind of masculine.  </li>
            <li>If you just love the smell of patchouli, this IS for you!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve become more cautious about how much and when I use this lotion after a number of people (including a stranger at the store!)</li>
            <li>If you like a watery lotion this would be fine</li>
            <li>The lotion is silky smooth.</li>
            <li>If you are unsure, just smell this stuff at a store first, its a matter of taste here for sure.  </li>
            <li>Non greasy, soaks right in and the slight scent reminds me of the 60s when I was a hippie very pleasant.</li>
            <li>Mind you, this is long after I&#x27;ve applied it and honestly can no longer detect the smell myself!</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would have a nice strong scent to mask the cooking oil-like smell of my aloe vera oil, and it definitely does.</li>
            <li>They actually mix well together for what I think is the perfect moisturizer, and the heavy patchouli scent is much more understated and wearable when diluted, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I love patchouli, and I even bought the lavender scented lotion, and they are both extremely loud - some of the most highly scented perfumes I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>however, after using it several times, I started to change to loving the scent.</li>
            <li>It leaves a sheen of oil on the skin, which makes me think that the ingredients aren&#x27;t being absorbed.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizer, there are many products which far exceed this one.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The first time I applied it at home, my boyfriend asked if I had sprayed perfume.  </li>
            <li>I like patchouli and lime, felt the lotion was a bit watery and seeing that as the first ingredient I can see why.</li>
            <li>It comes out very runny to the point you may need to wipe some off, but dries very fast, leaving your hands feeling like they did before you applied it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a very moisturizing, emollient lotion, this is not for you.</li>
            <li>people have been able to smell patchouli on me even when I&#x27;m not wearing the lotion, due to the scent transfering onto my sweater or coat.</li>
            <li>Love this product because it doesn&#x27;t have the harmful parabens and chemicals that other lotions have.  </li>
            <li>, I think its better in the winter as its pretty heavy.</li>
            <li>As a Naturopathic Doctor, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewers, it does have a fairly strong patchouli scent and it&#x27;s noticeable and lasts.</li>
            <li>Not cheap, but it&#x27;s organic and ai love the combination if patchouli (my fave) and lime.  </li>
            <li>Our local whole foods used to carry this product, but whole foods is just a bunch of sell outs.</li>
            <li>I gets compliments on it all the time (I sat down in the dentist&#x27;s chair the other day and the hygienist told me I smelled nice, for example).</li>
            <li>I think there is so much fragrance in this, it is actually stinging my skin.</li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;m sensitive to heavy fragrance this product doesn&#x27;t overpower you and leaves after awhile which is good for someone who can&#x27;t stand heavy smells.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth going on, doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky or slick, and soothes the skin.  </li>
            <li>I went back to my old lotion to re-moisturize!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a heavy moisturizer, so might be better in the summer, and it does leave a little residue on your skin.</li>

            <li> I like the smell of Patchouli (in SMALL doses) but actually don&#x27;t think it smells that much like Patchouli with the lime mixed in</li>
            <li> I was seeking a nice, non-oily lotion to soothe my dry hands in this cold winter weather.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty thick but absorbs well</li>

            <li> I want it to be a little on the subtle side and this product is quite strong.</li>

            <li> I use a wide array of bronners products with no issue.</li>

            <li> My hands are usually sandpaper and painfully dry in the winter months.</li>
            <li> It appears to moisturize for about 5 minutes, but I&#x27;ve now come to realize that after those few, spare minutes, I must reapply.  </li>
            <li> Money wasted on this product!</li>
            <li> I hated this lotion the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> Lotion dispenser was broken upon arrival.  </li>
            <li> This is a high quality lotion, but who ever was in charge of adding the fragrance had either little to no sense of smell or had a terrible cold that day!  </li>
            <li> My skin just disagrees sadly.</li>
            <li> I get sick from the synthetic chemicals filling the stores and on peoples&#x27; clothing, so breathing this lotion (sounds strange), helps me to overcome the sickening neurological problems from the synthetic scents.</li>
            <li> The bad part is, I was fooled into thinking this product worked.  </li>
            <li> I am so very disappointed in this product.  </li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a very moisturizing, emollient lotion, this is not for you. If you just love the smell of patchouli, this IS for you!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve become more cautious about how much and when I use this lotion after a number of people (including a stranger at the store!) have commented on my scent. Mind you, this is long after I&#x27;ve applied it and honestly can no longer detect the smell myself! And, as another reviewer mentioned, the scent does pass on to clothing...people have been able to smell patchouli on me even when I&#x27;m not wearing the lotion, due to the scent transfering onto my sweater or coat. I LOVE the smell of patchouli oil, but realize not everyone shares my affection for it. ;)</li>
            <li> I hated this lotion the first time I tried it. however, after using it several times, I started to change to loving the scent. In contrast to toxic petrochemicals, this scented lotion puts me in a great mood. The lotion is silky smooth. At this point, I am totally sold on lime patchouli lotion. I get sick from the synthetic chemicals filling the stores and on peoples&#x27; clothing, so breathing this lotion (sounds strange), helps me to overcome the sickening neurological problems from the synthetic scents. You have to try it.</li>
            <li> I was seeking a nice, non-oily lotion to soothe my dry hands in this cold winter weather.  I actually had the chance to try before buying (at my local co-op).  The bad part is, I was fooled into thinking this product worked.  It appears to moisturize for about 5 minutes, but I&#x27;ve now come to realize that after those few, spare minutes, I must reapply.  It leaves a sheen of oil on the skin, which makes me think that the ingredients aren&#x27;t being absorbed.  My skin still feels very dry.  The fragrance is simply OVERPOWERING.  I love patchouli, and I even bought the lavender scented lotion, and they are both extremely loud - some of the most highly scented perfumes I have ever used.  The first time I applied it at home, my boyfriend asked if I had sprayed perfume.  I am so very disappointed in this product.  Never again will I purchase anything from Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.  I think there is so much fragrance in this, it is actually stinging my skin.</li>
            <li> Lasting hydration and scent</li>
            <li> Our local whole foods used to carry this product, but whole foods is just a bunch of sell outs. We love everything dr bronners. This is our favorite smell. Great product.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend. Tried it out and the scent is very strong.  When I wear patchouli I want it to be a little on the subtle side and this product is quite strong.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever tried a better lotion. Wonderful product that I will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> I noticed that this lotion smelled overwhelmingly like ethyl alcohol, but tried it anyway. It really sucked all the moisture out of my hands and they were very dry within a few minutes. I went back to my old lotion to re-moisturize! Then I looked at the ingredients and the third thing listed was ethanol! Well there you go. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Non greasy, soaks right in and the slight scent reminds me of the 60s when I was a hippie very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Smells so good, calming and happy! Nobody ever seems turned off by the patchouli, the lime balances it well... one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> This lotion is more greasy than I like and has a very strong, pungent scent.</li>
            <li> Not cheap, but it&#x27;s organic and ai love the combination if patchouli (my fave) and lime.  Very emollient and soothing - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I give this lotion five stars because the product is great. My skin just disagrees sadly. I never get irritated skin from products. I must be allergic to an ingredient. I use a wide array of bronners products with no issue. The scent is really good. I got lots of compliments. I bought two bottles from a local shop and used this lotion after shower for a week. One day I started feeling itchy. turned out to be the lotion. I&#x27;ll try with other scents.</li>
            <li> I like patchouli and lime, felt the lotion was a bit watery and seeing that as the first ingredient I can see why. I make my own lotion and wanted to try this. If you like a watery lotion this would be fine, I prefer a thicker, richer lotion. The smell lasts quite a while and passes to clothing.</li>
            <li> I love how this treats my skin but the smell is so extremely strong. I can&#x27;t wear this to work.</li>
            <li> This stuff if heaven sent!!!  Love it!</li>
            <li> If you love Patchouli then you will love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Delivery on this product was perfect.  I got it when promised.  I have the lavender lotion as well.  Love this product because it doesn&#x27;t have the harmful parabens and chemicals that other lotions have.  I use all of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products and love the smell.  Because I&#x27;m sensitive to heavy fragrance this product doesn&#x27;t overpower you and leaves after awhile which is good for someone who can&#x27;t stand heavy smells.</li>
            <li> Lotion smells nothing like lime or patchouli.  Lotion dispenser was broken upon arrival.  The lotion does not absorb well into your skin and leaves a greasy film.  Money wasted on this product!</li>
            <li> This used to be my absolute favorite lotion!!  Everyone commented on how good I smelled when I was wearing it.  Now people say it smells like I have Vicks on.  The formula must have changed?</li>
            <li> My hands are usually sandpaper and painfully dry in the winter months. Not with Dr Bronner&#x27;s. The scent is wonderful and for once my hands an skin feel soft. I would buy again &amp; again.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality lotion, but who ever was in charge of adding the fragrance had either little to no sense of smell or had a terrible cold that day!  If only they cut back on the scent then It would truly be a 5-star product!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this stuff, mostly because of how delicious it smells. I agree with the other reviewers, it does have a fairly strong patchouli scent and it&#x27;s noticeable and lasts. I gets compliments on it all the time (I sat down in the dentist&#x27;s chair the other day and the hygienist told me I smelled nice, for example). It isn&#x27;t a heavy moisturizer, so might be better in the summer, and it does leave a little residue on your skin. I&#x27;m willing to put up with those things just because it smells so good.</li>
            <li> After reading great reviews about the product I decided to try a bottle. Upon arrival I was overwhelmed with the extremely strong scent this product had (overpowering almost). It comes out very runny to the point you may need to wipe some off, but dries very fast, leaving your hands feeling like they did before you applied it. My biggest grievance would be the oily residue it leaves, both my hands and everywhere they&#x27;ve touched has a shine to it now.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizer, there are many products which far exceed this one. Even as I write this I am becoming overwhelmed with scent. Will not buy again!</li>
            <li> I think this stuff is great.  I like the smell of Patchouli (in SMALL doses) but actually don&#x27;t think it smells that much like Patchouli with the lime mixed in, I think it has a nice unique smell though kind of masculine.  If you are unsure, just smell this stuff at a store first, its a matter of taste here for sure.  It is pretty thick but absorbs well, I think its better in the winter as its pretty heavy.</li>
            <li> Smells medicinal and is greasy.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would have a nice strong scent to mask the cooking oil-like smell of my aloe vera oil, and it definitely does. They actually mix well together for what I think is the perfect moisturizer, and the heavy patchouli scent is much more understated and wearable when diluted, in my opinion. The lotion has a great, smooth consistency on its own, and it smells wonderful, it&#x27;s just statement-making strong.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronners products are really wonderful - good for your body and good for the planet. This lotion has the lightest scent of the patchouli and the lime.
