            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My hair has gotten longer, and looks better.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t begin express my love for this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and my hair grows up to an inch more than not using this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love It!!c</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>As beautiful as natural hair people are I loooove my relaxers and refuse to part with them.</li>
            <li>ash content (from roasting the castor beans) does create a strong smokey smell, what I&#x27;d imagine a smoker smells like.</li>
            <li>I have to say, the ash smell does make me cringe a bit as it is seemingly strong, but after a while it wears off.</li>
            <li>This oil is great especially for those with 4C hair.</li>
            <li>Can be used as a hot oil treatment under a steamer a moisture and great for natural hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never timed it to say exactly when the smell is gone, but I&#x27;d say that by the end of the day, at the latest.</li>
            <li>My hairline is beginning to grow in and the receding hairline above the temples are filling in nicely!  </li>
            <li>I am a true believer.</li>
            <li>I apply it to my hair right after I get out of the shower, and my 3b curls stays bouncy, defined, and frizz free for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>there due to chemical burns,and this oil has been a great help when it comes to make the hair come back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product grows the hair and is good for dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>I have NEVER in my life known what it&#x27;s like to have soft, shiny, healthy hair that moves.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a good scalp oil, but my scalp felt flaky and rough after I applied it.</li>
            <li>Just get some in the palm of your hand, gloss it over your hair right after a shower, and rub it in.</li>
            <li>this product made my hair very soft and easy to manage, I also saw some growth in my hair</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is keeping my new growth and scalp super moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>Years ago, after trying all kinds of oils for my mostly 4b hair (and discovering that I&#x27;m allergic to coconutâ€”who knew?), I came across castor oil and never looked back.</li>
            <li>Shea buttered was slightly better, but my hair would still be left feeling a bit brittle.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin soft and smooth all day</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much healthier than it was a month ago!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m back for more...</li>
            <li>Okay so for about a year I have been trying to grow my hair back out!</li>
            <li>As for growth, I massage my scalp with this every two days, and do a hot oil treatment every week.</li>
            <li>I really wanted long hair, but, I said, it&#x27;s clear my hair doesn&#x27;t look good</li>
            <li>Let me note that I also have a very strong sense of smell, so it&#x27;s possible that I&#x27;m smelling it much more than other people would.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing I have used for only 2 weeks and my eyebrows are coming back after years!!</li>
            <li>After I moisturize and I&#x27;m ready to use a sealant, I use this oil because it helps to keep my ends from drying up and it seals the moisture in my hair.</li>
            <li>I did not even know my hair could grow that fast within a month</li>
            <li>My hair goes through so much abuse, but because I put this in my hair, my hair holds up,  </li>
            <li>It really does help keep my root moisturized</li>
            <li>Dont care for the smell too much</li>
            <li>I orderd it with several other natural products that haven&#x27;t arrived , so I have yet to mix it and make some wonderful concoctions for my next hair treatment.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product based on other reviews and I&#x27;ll just say I&#x27;m pleased with this product...</li>
            <li>Overall, i would say that this is a great product, especially for those who have dry hair and what to keep it moisterized.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair grow super fast, conditions better than anything else, gets rid of random break outs on my face, and makes my lashes and eyebrows full.</li>
            <li>I mix it with Sweet Almond oil, which makes it easier to apply, and I work it through my hair, especially the ends, and rub my scalp with it.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair feels when I take it down in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my 4b hair incredibly soft without the overwhelmingly oily feel as with other hair products.</li>
            <li>It smells bad but WORKS wonderfully.</li>
            <li>The instructions assume you will be treating your hair once per week, but because a)I have the free time necessary to really treat my hair, and b)I had a hair appointment not far off and wanted to try to save my hair before going so that the stylist order me to have it cut (which I really didn&#x27;t want to do).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried more than a few oils on my hair but none stack up like this.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product and works on AA hair extremely well.</li>
            <li>but I have seen some new hair growth with this  product (in regards to hair length).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m learning how to make my own hair care products, and I&#x27;ve read over and over how essential black castor oil is to my natural hair regimen.</li>
            <li>I just took it over to her house, and will probably go back today to do the first treatment on her hair.</li>
            <li>had positive results within a month, will definitely buy it again.  </li>
            <li>I have natural hair and was looking for a product that seals in the moisture after my co-wash and this product also left my hair very shiny.</li>
            <li>She used to relax her hair alot, but she&#x27;s been natural now for 7 years.  </li>
            <li>It is making my hair sooo soft</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smelly but it does make hair soft.</li>
            <li>The bottle must have been really old.</li>
            <li>I also made the mistake of using a supposedly natural shampoo on my hair instead of a salon shampoo.</li>
            <li>my hair: my hair is naturally wavy, baby-fine, but I do have a lot of it (it is not thinning in any way).</li>
            <li>Natural hair styles.  </li>
            <li>The product has a smokey smell but it doesn&#x27;t bother me because it usually fades after a day or two...or you can simply add your favorite smelling hair product after applying JBCO to somewhat mask the smell.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it is a highly recommended product for all naturals especially with thinning hair edges.  </li>
            <li>Okay, I bought this oil in August 2012, It is it very thick and it keeps my hair moist, I am completely natural and it does so well for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I started using this product a few month&#x27;s ago primarily to try to grow back over tweeze do eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t fall out as much from constantly combing it back in one.  </li>
            <li>The texture is thinner &amp; light scented not like the other blk Jamaican Castor Oil by Tropic Isle Living, therefore I hope it don&#x27;t mean less potent.  </li>
            <li>I am not a youngster, so any product would need to be a miracle solution to overcome what old age will do, but lines around eyes appear to be finer and skin is definitely softer to the touch.</li>
            <li>Since I just recently purchased this product, it&#x27;s too early to say if I see any growth, but I do like that it keeps my hair moisturized in any style that I put it in.</li>
            <li>I have been coloring my (originally blonde) hair since I was 12 years old, and for the last 7 years have been attempting to grow my hair out.</li>
            <li>(my scalp tends to get a little dry) and within a month I had new growth for days!!!!</li>
            <li>Castor oil fully gets absorbed into my hair, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>a little depending upon how much used.</li>
            <li>The other bottle was new and no problems.</li>

            <li> The texture is thinner &amp; light scented not like the other blk Jamaican Castor Oil by Tropic Isle Living, therefore I hope it don&#x27;t mean less potent.  </li>
            <li> I am not a youngster, so any product would need to be a miracle solution to overcome what old age will do, but lines around eyes appear to be finer and skin is definitely softer to the touch.</li>
            <li> Since I just recently purchased this product, it&#x27;s too early to say if I see any growth, but I do like that it keeps my hair moisturized in any style that I put it in.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my (originally blonde) hair since I was 12 years old, and for the last 7 years have been attempting to grow my hair out.</li>
            <li> (my scalp tends to get a little dry) and within a month I had new growth for days!!!!</li>
            <li> Castor oil fully gets absorbed into my hair, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little depending upon how much used.</li>
            <li> The other bottle was new and no problems.</li>

            <li> To make a long story short I applied this product in my hair once a week</li>
            <li> last a long time.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s really a little self conscious about it, so I want to see if this will work for her.  </li>
            <li> Then I put a plastic shower cap on it and just leave it for as long as I can stand the shower cap (about two to three hours).</li>
            <li> My hairdrying takes long because it&#x27;s thicker and longer</li>
            <li> Works well on dry hair for winter maintenance.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t worry about having dry brittle and crunchy hair after it drys anymore.</li>
            <li> I went all out and got EXTRA dark because my hair needed all the help it could get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Long story short, my hair was a brittle MESS.</li>
            <li> one star is because it supposed to be extra dark</li>
            <li> So, after all the hype about this product, I finally broke down  and bought it.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way so with me using it only 2 times a week</li>
            <li> , So I&#x27;ve been using the Jamaican Black Caster Oil mixed with Mega Tek Rebuilder and my hair</li>
            <li> The oils never penetrated my hair and simply coated it, leaving me an oily mess.</li>
            <li> I read the previous reviews and purchased both the regular and extra dark Jamaican Black Castor Oil.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it isn&#x27;t horrible if you only use a little bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suspect with regular use (once a week with shoulder length locs), this will last me at least a year.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been fooling around with expensive deep conditioners all this time and getting almost nothing for it--this is really all I ever needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helped but it still makes my scalp feel rough.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way when styling with this product.</li>
            <li> Not good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use the mixture every other day after washing and conditioning my hair with</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s due to the product because my hair seems to still be growing at the same rate.</li>
            <li> It does have an unpleasant odor, but I haven&#x27;t soaked my hair in it, so the odor is very mild, and actually imperceptible, when you are using it the way I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> my hair is soft and is growing very thick</li>
            <li> This product is good for edges not on the hair because it leaves a nasty buildup.</li>
            <li> time around, I have been growing it for a year and a half.</li>
            <li> Will do another review after a few months.</li>
            <li> well it usually doesn&#x27;t grow, like the scar on his scalp from when he was nine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to see the results I will find when I remove my twists.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;d also been coloring my hair every two weeks for a while now, but in the last month alone, I&#x27;d colored it THREE times.</li>
            <li> It is very heavy, and will probably not be my go-to oil during the summer.</li>
            <li> It is greasy and hard to put on during the day, and you need to put something on pillow during the night if you apply it before sleep.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Years ago, after trying all kinds of oils for my mostly 4b hair (and discovering that I&#x27;m allergic to coconutâ€”who knew?), I came across castor oil and never looked back. My hair loves castor oil. Others swear by coconut and olive (EVOO), but those would leave my hair feeling oily, crispy/brittle, and definitely not moisturized. The oils never penetrated my hair and simply coated it, leaving me an oily mess. Shea buttered was slightly better, but my hair would still be left feeling a bit brittle. Castor oil fully gets absorbed into my hair, and a little goes a long way. Some users on LHCF recommended black castor oil for the higher ash content, compared to conventional purified oil, to promote hair growth. I went all out and got EXTRA dark because my hair needed all the help it could get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ash content (from roasting the castor beans) does create a strong smokey smell, what I&#x27;d imagine a smoker smells like. A bit annoying, but it fades away over time. I&#x27;ve never timed it to say exactly when the smell is gone, but I&#x27;d say that by the end of the day, at the latest. So, if you&#x27;re worried about smelling like a chimney, wash and castor oil your hair on a weekend when you&#x27;re not going out. Let me note that I also have a very strong sense of smell, so it&#x27;s possible that I&#x27;m smelling it much more than other people would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bottle lasted me over 2 years, albeit it was used inconsistently. I&#x27;d suspect with regular use (once a week with shoulder length locs), this will last me at least a year. Just get some in the palm of your hand, gloss it over your hair right after a shower, and rub it in. Speaking as a recovering product junkie, my hair regime is so simple now.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. This oil is great especially for those with 4C hair. After I moisturize and I&#x27;m ready to use a sealant, I use this oil because it helps to keep my ends from drying up and it seals the moisture in my hair. Many people complain about the smell but it does not bother me at all. It has grown my hair from ear length to shoulder length over the course of two years. Also great for scalp massages---it helps to stimulate the follicles for faster hair growth. This is truly my favorite oil.</li>
            <li> Im just beginning to use it but have heard good things about it. Will do another review after a few months.</li>
            <li> This castor oil is amazing.  I have been using it for several months now and my hair has already grown 5 inches and it&#x27;s so healthy and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!  I just purchases 2 more bottles.  Need to grow my hair 4 more inches this castor oil will do it.</li>
            <li> Not only did it stop my husband&#x27;s hair from falling, it also darken his hair, stop it from itching, and made it growth faster and thicker. He as well had growth on area  well it usually doesn&#x27;t grow, like the scar on his scalp from when he was nine.</li>
            <li> So, after all the hype about this product, I finally broke down  and bought it. I am going to use it on my mother in law&#x27;s hair to see if it will help her. She used to relax her hair alot, but she&#x27;s been natural now for 7 years.  The problem is tha ther hair has thinned really badly in the crown area of her head. She&#x27;s really a little self conscious about it, so I want to see if this will work for her.  What I think I&#x27;ll do is have her use it every other day before bed, and maybe just a tab in the mornings, since it say that the smell is really bad. I didnt even crack the seal on it. I just took it over to her house, and will probably go back today to do the first treatment on her hair. Fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> It is making my hair sooo soft and I have seen growth on my thinning sides from brushing to hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The only downside is the ash smell, what I do is mix it with my oils and favorite styling and leave in cream. Problem solved.</li>
            <li> Love it to seal with! Leaves my hair nice and smooth after each wash, and does wonders on my ends.</li>
            <li> I like to make body Butter with this. It makes it even better. Keeps skin soft and smooth all day</li>
            <li> this product made my hair very soft and easy to manage, I also saw some growth in my hair so I will continue to buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a couple of years now.&lt;br /&gt;It speeds up hair growth and thickens my already thick hair.Also it stimulates hair growth in areas where there isn&#x27;t any,I&#x27;ve had to deal with bald spots here and there due to chemical burns,and this oil has been a great help when it comes to make the hair come back.&lt;br /&gt;A definite must buy.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair grow super fast, conditions better than anything else, gets rid of random break outs on my face, and makes my lashes and eyebrows full. Love it!</li>
            <li> had positive results within a month, will definitely buy it again.  Hair is fuller and healthier looking in short time.  Put it on and used heat cap for minimum 15 minutes and just left it on for a couple of hours</li>
            <li> I started using this product a few month&#x27;s ago primarily to try to grow back over tweeze do eyebrows.  It has taken a while, but I am finally seeing some results. I am not a youngster, so any product would need to be a miracle solution to overcome what old age will do, but lines around eyes appear to be finer and skin is definitely softer to the touch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m learning how to make my own hair care products, and I&#x27;ve read over and over how essential black castor oil is to my natural hair regimen. I orderd it with several other natural products that haven&#x27;t arrived , so I have yet to mix it and make some wonderful concoctions for my next hair treatment. It is very heavy, and will probably not be my go-to oil during the summer. For now, though, I am using it on my scalp as a moisturizer while I have a protective style. I love the fact that it is keeping my new growth and scalp super moisturized and soft. I read that it also promotes thicker, longer hair growth. I&#x27;m anxious to see the results I will find when I remove my twists. It does have an unpleasant odor, but I haven&#x27;t soaked my hair in it, so the odor is very mild, and actually imperceptible, when you are using it the way I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> Have been applying daily for about 5 weeks now. No noticeable hair growth. It&#x27;s smelly but it does make hair soft.</li>
            <li> I just transitioned to all natural and my hair was badly damaged from all the perms and weaves over the years! I had read all of the reviews on Mega Tek and it was recommended to mix it with an oil!, So I&#x27;ve been using the Jamaican Black Caster Oil mixed with Mega Tek Rebuilder and my hair is growing like crazy and it&#x27;s so much healthier than it was a month ago! My hairline is beginning to grow in and the receding hairline above the temples are filling in nicely!  I use the mixture every other day after washing and conditioning my hair with As I Am Coconut CoWash and the leave in conditioner! I also started using the Organic Root Stimulator Fertilizing Serum on the off days in the morning and at night! I am amazed at the results! I am very, very happy and have gotten many compliments on my hair!</li>
            <li> One bottle&#x27;s lid was broken and the label was so worn I could not read info. The bottle must have been really old. The other bottle was new and no problems.</li>
            <li> The product grows the hair and is good for dry scalp.  I will continue to use it for growth and treatment for itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> this product was excellent...i&#x27;m back for more...helped thicken my hair...I used it to seal the ends...I made a hair concoction with it..&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my eyelashes and eyebrows...</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner. Product had great packaging so none of the oil spilled. I use this product about 3 times a week along with coconut oil &amp; my hair loves it:)</li>
            <li> Just received this item, came 2 days prior to delivery date.  The texture is thinner &amp; light scented not like the other blk Jamaican Castor Oil by Tropic Isle Living, therefore I hope it don&#x27;t mean less potent.  I will advise if I see the same results as I have with Tropic Isle.  Otherwise this will be my last time purchasing.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my (originally blonde) hair since I was 12 years old, and for the last 7 years have been attempting to grow my hair out. (I had had it very short for a while.) But with all the coloring, I would end up needing to cut if off again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time around, I have been growing it for a year and a half. I&#x27;d had it in a pixie cut, and it&#x27;s finally made it to my shoulders. Unfortunately, I&#x27;d also been coloring my hair every two weeks for a while now, but in the last month alone, I&#x27;d colored it THREE times. I also made the mistake of using a supposedly natural shampoo on my hair instead of a salon shampoo. Long story short, my hair was a brittle MESS. I didn&#x27;t know what to do besides cut it all off again. I really wanted long hair, but, I said, it&#x27;s clear my hair doesn&#x27;t look good long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I read an article about essential oils for your beauty cabinet, and this was in it. I thought, why not. The instructions assume you will be treating your hair once per week, but because a)I have the free time necessary to really treat my hair, and b)I had a hair appointment not far off and wanted to try to save my hair before going so that the stylist order me to have it cut (which I really didn&#x27;t want to do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So over the last week, I have treated my hair with this stuff three times. I mix it with Sweet Almond oil, which makes it easier to apply, and I work it through my hair, especially the ends, and rub my scalp with it. I spend about 10 minutes doing this. Then I put a plastic shower cap on it and just leave it for as long as I can stand the shower cap (about two to three hours). Then I run my blow dryer over the the cap for 15 minutes (I don&#x27;t have a hood dryer). Then I rinse it out and shampoo and style as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upshot: It works miracles. I have NEVER in my life known what it&#x27;s like to have soft, shiny, healthy hair that moves. But now it does! Almost all of the damage that can be reversed has been. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been fooling around with expensive deep conditioners all this time and getting almost nothing for it--this is really all I ever needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About my hair: my hair is naturally wavy, baby-fine, but I do have a lot of it (it is not thinning in any way). I am also white. I do hope that my hair will grow faster and thicker with this, but won&#x27;t know for a while if it does do that. I plan to use this on my eyebrows as well, since overplucking my once glorious eyebrows has left them anemic.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Natural hair styles.  Helps my hair hold moisture.  I always braid my afro at night and use JBCO.  I love the way my hair feels when I take it down in the morning.  Coils are so cute.  Works well on dry hair for winter maintenance.  I&#x27;ve tried more than a few oils on my hair but none stack up like this.  I don&#x27;t worry about having dry brittle and crunchy hair after it drys anymore.</li>
            <li> It is greasy and hard to put on during the day, and you need to put something on pillow during the night if you apply it before sleep. Not good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome product everything meet my expectations will order again!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have always used Jamaican Castor oil in my hair.  I definitely stands by this product.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this product one star is because it supposed to be extra dark and I order the the regular castor oil and  it is the same , there is no difference between the extra dar and theregular,the color and smell is the same to.I will cÃ²back and write another review when i use it for about a month.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on other reviews and I&#x27;ll just say I&#x27;m pleased with this product...my hair is soft and is growing very thick which is a plus for me!</li>
            <li> Okay so for about a year I have been trying to grow my hair back out! As beautiful as natural hair people are I loooove my relaxers and refuse to part with them. Luckly I found a review on this product on YouTube. To make a long story short I applied this product in my hair once a week (my scalp tends to get a little dry) and within a month I had new growth for days!!!! My hair grew 6 inches! I did not even know my hair could grow that fast within a month AND this product help with the thickness of my hair as well. God bless Sunny Isle for this product!</li>
            <li> I read the previous reviews and purchased both the regular and extra dark Jamaican Black Castor Oil. I have to say, the ash smell does make me cringe a bit as it is seemingly strong, but after a while it wears off. It leaves my 4b hair incredibly soft without the overwhelmingly oily feel as with other hair products. Since I just recently purchased this product, it&#x27;s too early to say if I see any growth, but I do like that it keeps my hair moisturized in any style that I put it in. I think I will buy the lavender oil next time around.</li>
            <li> Have definitely seen a difference in my hair!</li>
            <li> This product lives up to its expectations! I never thought my hair would grow back around the hairline, but I am now starting to see some fuzz.</li>
            <li> I have already bought this several times and I will continue to buy it. Very extra growing power I like to add essential oils to it.</li>
            <li> i just keep ordering this...great product that works well</li>
            <li> Amazing I have used for only 2 weeks and my eyebrows are coming back after years!!</li>
            <li> I love this for my daughters hair...very good conditioning/sealer. Compaines customer support was timely and good to work with. Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I love this product for locking and sealing my hair! It holds in every moisterizer that I use and keeps my hair protected. I have heard that It promotes hair growth and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair growing (since I haven&#x27;t been cutting it anymore) but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s due to the product because my hair seems to still be growing at the same rate. The product has a smokey smell but it doesn&#x27;t bother me because it usually fades after a day or two...or you can simply add your favorite smelling hair product after applying JBCO to somewhat mask the smell. Overall, i would say that this is a great product, especially for those who have dry hair and what to keep it moisterized.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair longer than ever. It smells bad but WORKS wonderfully. My hairdrying takes long because it&#x27;s thicker and longer but I suppose I can deal with that side effect :)</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is great for sealing the  ends of your hair in helping with split ends, as well as assisting with regrowth of your hair line. I also mix this product with coconut oil for oiling my scalp. The smell is not that great, but using coconut oil with it masks the smell. Also, this is a think oil and coconut oil thins it out a little depending upon how much used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a month since I bought this. My hair has noticably, but not drastically grown. It has drastically gotten thicker though. This product is also an amazing moisturizer. I apply it to my hair right after I get out of the shower, and my 3b curls stays bouncy, defined, and frizz free for the rest of the day. The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it isn&#x27;t horrible if you only use a little bit. A little bit goes a long way when styling with this product. As for growth, I massage my scalp with this every two days, and do a hot oil treatment every week. My hair has gotten longer, and looks better. I&#x27;ve been using it on my eyelashes as well, and they have gotten longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t begin express my love for this product.  My hair goes through so much abuse, but because I put this in my hair, my hair holds up,  It strengthens my hair and my edges don&#x27;t fall out as much from constantly combing it back in one.  It makes my hair feels good.  I have thin hair, so it makes it feels a bit thicker.</li>
            <li> This product is good for edges not on the hair because it leaves a nasty buildup. I like it and would recommend only for edges.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It really does help keep my root moisturized and my hair grows up to an inch more than not using this stuff. A little bit goes a long way so with me using it only 2 times a week, I can have it for up to six months. I am a true believer.</li>
            <li> Love It!!c it really is a good supplememt for hair to grow. I have my family members using it too.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a good scalp oil, but my scalp felt flaky and rough after I applied it. I had to mix it with EVOO to thin it out. It helped but it still makes my scalp feel rough. I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Okay, I bought this oil in August 2012, It is it very thick and it keeps my hair moist, I am completely natural and it does so well for my hair.  I use it along with Shea Moisture products. I will buy again. In fact I&#x27;m ordering today!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. love it. Can be used as a hot oil treatment under a steamer a moisture and great for natural hair</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and was looking for a product that seals in the moisture after my co-wash and this product also left my hair very shiny.</li>
            <li> I loved the oil it worked for my needs and will purchase again in the future&lt;br /&gt;Great great great great</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product and works on AA hair extremely well. It&#x27;s also great for joint pain. Thickens hair too!!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it is a highly recommended product for all naturals especially with thinning hair edges.  I don&#x27;t have hair thinning hair edges but I purchased this because it is supposed to be the best quality castor oil on the market for hair and a bottle last a long time.  I have used it to create emulsification with coconut oil, shea butter, almond oil, and what ever left over oils I had laying around my house.  I also use this on scars.</li>
            <li> Dont care for the smell too much but I have seen some new hair growth with this  product (in regards to hair length).</li>
