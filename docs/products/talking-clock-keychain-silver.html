            <li>so she can keep it on her in her pocket or bag, she love it to.</li>
            <li>For the price this device more than met my need.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>I also liked the quick delivery.</li>
            <li>He was no longer able to accurately make out the time on his watch.</li>
            <li>, it also arrived way before it was expected too, very satisfied! !!</li>
            <li>Sounds great, clear voice.</li>
            <li>Easy to understand for the hearing impaired.</li>
            <li>Easy to set up and operate.</li>
            <li>He can easily understand the voice giving the time on this talking clock.&lt;br /&gt;Barbara</li>
            <li>Easy to set time.</li>
            <li>parent has no vision, this little device is perfect.</li>
            <li>Too cheaply made, I think.  </li>
            <li>simple, it works well, a great joy to someone who is visually challenged</li>
            <li>AND THE SOUND OF THE ALARM IS</li>
            <li>if you just want to know the time only nothing else Great for that</li>
            <li>great for on the go in the car on the key chine</li>
            <li>He may have gotten used to pressing the right button after he was more familiar with the unit.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wear a watch at work so this product is super helpful with keeping me on time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big enough to slip over head and everyone who lives at her assisted living thinks its beautiful !  </li>
            <li>This is a great idea for those who have little or no sight</li>
            <li>I think this was definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>When I got this clock in, it worked perfectly but the following day it went dead as a door nail.</li>
            <li>and my Dad doesn&#x27;t have to answer :&amp;#60;)</li>
            <li>With his vision problems, my father wasn&#x27;t able to tell which button was which and pushed the setup button several times.</li>
            <li>Perfect device for my father in law who is blind.</li>
            <li>and wow is this clock made so cheap.</li>
            <li>They never last more than 6 to 8 months not the batteries</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s worked for several weeks using it many times per day on the original battery.</li>
            <li>The internal speaker is good sized so the voice is pretty loud and clear.</li>
            <li>This clock is simple to operate, easy to use, has a durable plastic casing, very audible, and was perfect for my blind daughter to put on her cane instead of always wearing her watch.</li>
            <li>It works fine, but the buttons used to set the time on the back of the unit can be pushed just from use, and then need resetting again.</li>
            <li>In my opinion this talking clock is cheaply made and its a shame this company sells merchandise to people with dead cheap batteries.</li>
            <li>In spite of that one problem, this is a real asset for someone with vision problems.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my mother so that anytime she wants to know what time it all she has to do is push a button and it tells her the time.</li>
            <li>She is 90 and really likes it</li>
            <li>This really makes a difference in her life since she is now in a nursing home and has nobody around all the time to ask what time of day it is.  </li>
            <li>Everyone she shows it to thinks it&#x27;s really neat.</li>
            <li>i got it because with macular degeneration i can no longer see my clock very well on the bedside table</li>
            <li>Early easy to use for visually impaired.</li>
            <li>the only drawback is they don&#x27;t hold up super well.  </li>
            <li>Very dependable and clear.</li>
            <li>Great clock for my blind husband.  </li>
            <li>and I had no negative issues with this item.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally have problems.</li>
            <li>My 98 yr old patient loves it!  </li>
            <li>This was for my 97 year old mother!  </li>
            <li>However, we had to put a piece of cardboard with tape over the back to ensure the user did not erroneously change the settings on the watch, and thereby the correct time setting.  </li>
            <li>but then the price is pretty low too.</li>
            <li>Like all of these gadgets, it helps to have an eight year old, with small fingers, who is more tech-savy than Grandma.</li>
            <li>She only needs to press the one large button.  </li>
            <li>Speech is clear.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 98 year old neighbor/friend.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it as a key chain, but it&#x27;s very compact and can go with me anywhere and everywhere.</li>
            <li>89 year old mother loves it, clipped to her purse.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a talking watch or clock that was small and easy to use.</li>
            <li>while it is nice and easy, it has an annoying chime before the voice speaks that drove me nuts.  </li>
            <li>My 95 year old, legally blind grandmother, who can only see shadows, loved it.  </li>
            <li>She has Macular Degeneration and can barely see.</li>
            <li>It is loud enough for me to hear the time being read over the obnoxious sounds of the machines in the shop.</li>
            <li>Just got it a couple of weeks ago and already the voice to the key chain is so low that you can barely hear it announce the time</li>
            <li>Buttons on back are not easy to set the time &amp; stick out too much!</li>
            <li>NOT SO GOOD NOT TOO BAD.</li>

            <li> My only complaint is that the button to change the settings should be recessed and/or much less accessible.</li>
            <li> It is loud and clear enough to hear although she is also hard of hearing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 91 year old father who has vision trouble.  </li>
            <li> However, I taped a piece of hard plastic over the setup button, making it much more difficult to press it accidently.</li>
            <li> Shipped on the expected date</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s mother was tickled pink when I gave this to her.</li>
            <li> My wife is blind and uses a talking clock for several things during the day and night but the main thing she uses it for is cooking.</li>
            <li> She had no idea what time it was due to her eyesight.</li>
            <li> I chose this clock for her because she wanted one small enough to put in her pocket</li>
            <li> Small enough to keep in a pocket and.</li>
            <li> We saw other reviews and placed a small plastic piece over the back buttons and the problem was stopped.</li>
            <li> The only complaint from my mom is the voice.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that my Dad would be pressing the program buttons on the back and changing the time, but the buttons are very small and not easily pressed (hence the difficulty in programming).  </li>
            <li> Programming is a little touchy</li>
            <li> so I can keep a few on hand, it is too difficult for someone to be without the time while a new one is ordered and</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Since this device was for a blind person, so he could know what time it was, the talking feature was vital.  </li>
            <li> It is small</li>
            <li> I am legally blind, and can keep this in my pocket or next to my bed, and I can know what time it is anytime.</li>
            <li> I would understand if very few people had this problem</li>
            <li> My husband is not only blind but also hard of hearing.  </li>
            <li> it will wake you up at midnight and hard to shut off&#x27;, i used a hammer holding it in a vice</li>
            <li> Hard for her to understand .</li>
            <li> The clock was a little difficult to set up, but I got it up and running.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my grandmother, who is legally blind.</li>
            <li> My Dad is totally blind and loves this item.  </li>
            <li> She cannot do without her &amp;#34;talking clock&amp;#34; because she is partially blind.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this for a blind person.  </li>
            <li> My mom is 93 and almost blind.</li>
            <li> Purchased this clock for my dad who is blind he loves it...</li>
            <li> My legally blind mother loves this clock keychain, I made a beaded necklace and attached the clock to it.  </li>
            <li> My mother is going blind and this has been a godsend for her!  </li>
            <li> Very difficult to program.</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t get it to go into time changing mode.  Too cheaply made, I think.  Will try to find something in a store like Radio Shack where the clerk will help set the time, and we can try it out before buying it.</li>
            <li> I bought this mor my Mom and she loves it.  It came quickly and is a good quality product.  It is making all the difference in her quality of life since now she doesn&#x27;t have to ask what time it is and my Dad doesn&#x27;t have to answer :&amp;#60;)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 91 year old father who has vision trouble.  The clock was a little difficult to set up, but I got it up and running.  I was concerned that my Dad would be pressing the program buttons on the back and changing the time, but the buttons are very small and not easily pressed (hence the difficulty in programming).  So far so good!  Now if he wouldn&#x27;t misplace it!</li>
            <li> Easy to understand for the hearing impaired.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely wonderful.  I keep it in my pocket and push the button whenever I want to know the time.  Shipped on the expected date and I had no negative issues with this item.  I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Talking Clock Keychain for my father, who has severe vision problems. He was no longer able to accurately make out the time on his watch. He is very pleased to be able to tell what time it is now at the touch of a button. My only complaint is that the button to change the settings should be recessed and/or much less accessible. With his vision problems, my father wasn&#x27;t able to tell which button was which and pushed the setup button several times. He may have gotten used to pressing the right button after he was more familiar with the unit. However, I taped a piece of hard plastic over the setup button, making it much more difficult to press it accidently. So, it&#x27;s all good now :). In spite of that one problem, this is a real asset for someone with vision problems.</li>
            <li> do not buy  it will wake you up at midnight and hard to shut off&#x27;, i used a hammer holding it in a vice so bent it over.</li>
            <li> NOT SO GOOD NOT TOO BAD. IT&#x27; S OK TO HAVE THIS AS GIFT ITEM.</li>
            <li> My mother could not hear it</li>
            <li> Got this for my grandmother, who is legally blind. It took a bit for someone to get the alarms set properly for her, but she loves it.</li>
            <li> Perfect device for my father in law who is blind. Easy to set up and operate. It was a bargain.</li>
            <li> simple, it works well, a great joy to someone who is visually challenged</li>
            <li> My Dad is totally blind and loves this item.  He keeps it with him always-night and day.</li>
            <li> My 98 yr old patient loves it!  She had no idea what time it was due to her eyesight. She is thrilled!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s mother was tickled pink when I gave this to her. She has Macular Degeneration and can barely see. She had been waking up in the middle of the night having no idea what time it was. Now all she has to do is reach over and press the button. The internal speaker is good sized so the voice is pretty loud and clear.</li>
            <li> The only complaint from my mom is the voice. Hard for her to understand . Has somewhat of an accent.</li>
            <li> My mother is going blind and this has been a godsend for her!  She loves it.  She always carries it with her. Very dependable and clear.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my mother so that anytime she wants to know what time it all she has to do is push a button and it tells her the time. She is 90 and really likes it</li>
            <li> works great. bought 4. 3 for gifts.</li>
            <li> Wonderful invention and a great help when you can&#x27;t see!  I gave it 5 stars!  This was for my 97 year old mother!  Thank you !</li>
            <li> Great clock for my blind husband.  He loves it!</li>
            <li> Works well!!! My husband is not only blind but also hard of hearing.  He can easily understand the voice giving the time on this talking clock.&lt;br /&gt;Barbara Logan</li>
            <li> Just got it a couple of weeks ago and already the voice to the key chain is so low that you can barely hear it announce the time and it will not keep the time properly. This key chain was bought to help someone who cannot see. It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS GREAT PUSH BUTTON IT TALKS AND TELLS YOU THE TIME.  IT EVEN HAS A ALARM FUNCTION THAT ALLOWS YOU TO SET IT TO WAKE YOU UP IN THE MORNING AND THE SOUND OF THE ALARM IS A ROOSTER CROWING     VERY EXCELLENT PRODUCT BUY IT FOR EVERYONE</li>
            <li> My wife is blind and uses a talking clock for several things during the day and night but the main thing she uses it for is cooking. I chose this clock for her because she wanted one small enough to put in her pocket and this one seemed be what she needed. When I got this clock in, it worked perfectly but the following day it went dead as a door nail. I took the back off this clock off to get the batteries out and wow is this clock made so cheap. In my opinion this talking clock is cheaply made and its a shame this company sells merchandise to people with dead cheap batteries. I would understand if very few people had this problem but I looked through the reviews here and there r several with the same problem.</li>
            <li> I wanted a talking watch or clock that was small and easy to use. Very happy with this one. Small enough to keep in a pocket and. Early easy to use for visually impaired.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 98 year old neighbor/friend.  She cannot do without her &amp;#34;talking clock&amp;#34; because she is partially blind.  This really makes a difference in her life since she is now in a nursing home and has nobody around all the time to ask what time of day it is.  I also liked the quick delivery.</li>
            <li> My mother uses it in a nursing home.  She likes that she can push a button and hear the time without having to see a clock.</li>
            <li> It works fine, but the buttons used to set the time on the back of the unit can be pushed just from use, and then need resetting again. you reall need to tape something over the buttons to keep that from happening</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a blind person.  He doesn&#x27;t like the feel of watches and thought this would be perfect, he loved it but it only worked two days and then it just went out.  I took it to a watch repair place and they couldn&#x27;t fix it and it wasn&#x27;t the battery.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother who can&#x27;t see and she loves it. It is loud and clear enough to hear although she is also hard of hearing. Everyone she shows it to thinks it&#x27;s really neat. So far it&#x27;s worked for several weeks using it many times per day on the original battery. I think this was definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Had to remove screws and re-set batteries to get the unit to work. Speech is clear.</li>
            <li> My mother in law loves it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my sister who has low vision and in a wheel chair. We attached it to the wheelchair, she LOVES it</li>
            <li> Very difficult to program. I don&#x27;t normally have problems.</li>
            <li> This clock is simple to operate, easy to use, has a durable plastic casing, very audible, and was perfect for my blind daughter to put on her cane instead of always wearing her watch. It would be a great gift  for elderly people, or someone who doesn&#x27;t wear a watch.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea for those who have little or no sight the only drawback is they don&#x27;t hold up super well.  The batteries can last 2 - 4 months but then the watch itself totally stops working and I have to replace it.  I am glad they are inexpensive so I can keep a few on hand, it is too difficult for someone to be without the time while a new one is ordered and delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, Great Item and now sure what my mom would do without it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother who is 93 and likes to know what time it is.  I got her 2- one for upstairs and one for downstairs.  Yes, she still climbs stairs, but cannot read clocks too well anymore.  She loves it, I can tell.  She carries one when we go out.  Everyone else has a gadget- she has one too.</li>
            <li> My mom is 93 and almost blind. She was upset because she couldn&#x27;t tell time. I attached this to her walker. She loves it.</li>
            <li> item fulfilled all of our needs, it should have a flip up cover on reverse to hide the setting buttons.</li>
            <li> Purchased this clock for my dad who is blind he loves it... wonderful price, it also arrived way before it was expected too, very satisfied! !!</li>
            <li> I use it in the middle of the night, so I won&#x27;t need to open my eyes.</li>
            <li> if you just want to know the time only nothing else Great for that</li>
            <li> This talking clock keychain is also for my mom so she can keep it on her in her pocket or bag, she love it to.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> Great the kid it was bought for loves it &amp; walks around with it all the time.</li>
            <li> Easy to understand voice with good volume.  The big button makes it simple to use.  The only drawback is setting it.  Like all of these gadgets, it helps to have an eight year old, with small fingers, who is more tech-savy than Grandma.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear a watch at work so this product is super helpful with keeping me on time.  It is small so I can put it in my pocket. It is loud enough for me to hear the time being read over the obnoxious sounds of the machines in the shop.</li>
            <li> For the price this device more than met my need.  Since this device was for a blind person, so he could know what time it was, the talking feature was vital.  However, we had to put a piece of cardboard with tape over the back to ensure the user did not erroneously change the settings on the watch, and thereby the correct time setting.  The cardboard and tape cover the &amp;#34;raised&amp;#34; setting buttons on the back of the device.  Time will tell the dependability of the device.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I wanted and needed. I am legally blind, and can keep this in my pocket or next to my bed, and I can know what time it is anytime. I don&#x27;t use it as a key chain, but it&#x27;s very compact and can go with me anywhere and everywhere.</li>
            <li> 89 year old mother loves it, clipped to her purse.  Easy to set time.</li>
            <li> They never last more than 6 to 8 months not the batteries the unit itself. Keep buying because there needed. Oh well.</li>
            <li> It worked &amp; was a good price!  Buttons on back are not easy to set the time &amp; stick out too much!</li>
            <li> Sounds great, clear voice.</li>
            <li> excellent for nursing home residents ..good for the visionally impaired</li>
            <li> Works well. Programming is a little touchy but then the price is pretty low too.</li>
            <li> works great! My 95 year old, legally blind grandmother, who can only see shadows, loved it.  She only needs to press the one large button.  A+++++.</li>
            <li> got to say this thing is great.  i got it because with macular degeneration i can no longer see my clock very well on the bedside table so i put this on a cord and hung it on the bed post.  i tried a clock that speaks the time and while it is nice and easy, it has an annoying chime before the voice speaks that drove me nuts.  this is very simple and just speaks the time in a female voice.  it has 2 volume setting. and uses one of those button batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am getting a second one that i think i will clip on my purse or perhaps add to the cord i wear every day that has a LED tiny flashlight that helps me find things.  im not into wearing watches and while i dont have to know what time it is too often, this thing is quite handy and makes things easier.</li>
            <li> parent has no vision, this little device is perfect. thank you.</li>
            <li> My legally blind mother loves this clock keychain, I made a beaded necklace and attached the clock to it.  It&#x27;s big enough to slip over head and everyone who lives at her assisted living thinks its beautiful !  Makes her happy and that makes me happy !</li>
            <li> Arrived DOA. Do not purchase.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my mother who can no longer see clocks from a distance.  She was so happy to finally be able to know what time it is with a press of a button.  The reason I gave 4 stars is that the buttons to set the device are open on the back .  They can be inadvertently pressed and the time changes.  We saw other reviews and placed a small plastic piece over the back buttons and the problem was stopped.</li>
            <li> a friend  can&#x27;t see a wristwatch so it&#x27;s perfect to take with her !!</li>
            <li> It didnt work from day one! I sent it back.</li>
            <li> great for on the go in the car on the key chine</li>
