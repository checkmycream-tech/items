            <li>goes on so smooth, it feels like silk.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product and will continue using it.</li>

            <li>love this product, works very well on  my skin and keep the moisture as well</li>

            <li>It glides over you face like it is on ball bearings, very fast and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>excellent for every day use, but not strong enough for a day at the beach.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready for the day!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and will continue to use as part of my daily skin regimen.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>Even though this is expensive, I do think its the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Five stars for the product, 1 star for the vendor: I was first introduced to Minus-Sol by my aesthetician and I&#x27;ve been using it for a number of years now.</li>
            <li>I only wish they made more shades.</li>
            <li>Minus-Sol is more than just Sun protection, it is a wonderful face cream and makeup base.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for those girls who feel naked without make-up, but who don&#x27;t want to use a heavy foundation while swimming.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it to be very waterproof also.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>and it is very water proof.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My skin seems to be much smoother since I have started to use it.</li>
            <li>This lotion fills in my skin to hide more pores and also prevents blackheads and other acne.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and lasts (hopefully) a long time.</li>
            <li>I really cannot live without this product.  </li>
            <li>It feels light and dry.</li>
            <li>but I do not because it is too expensive and would have to buy way many more</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was mainly drawn to it because of the zinc content.</li>
            <li>recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I top it will a little pressed powder</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll need to look for a new vendor</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It goes on silky smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>It feels really smooth when it goes on your skin and doesn&#x27;t look heavy.  </li>
            <li>This is way too long a shipping time, given that they are located in Southern CA and I&#x27;m in Northern CA and the shipping should&#x27;ve taken a matter of a few days at most and the order said it would be delivered between 6/22 &amp; 6/27.</li>
            <li>Unlike other sun blocks, this one really blocks the sun.</li>
            <li>The Minus Sol Facial Sun Protection works very well as a sunscreen</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This stuff is expensive but worth it.  </li>
            <li> gives it a little coverage with no &amp;#34;ghost&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li> I would never consider using foundation which is so heavy.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is crazy expensive but the smallest dab goes a long, long way.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love this product, works very well on  my skin and keep the moisture as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Minus-Sol daily for years after it was recommended by my dermatologist at the time. It goes on silky smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy. The Ivory has just enough tint to even out my fair complexion. I top it will a little pressed powder and I&#x27;m ready for the day! I absolutely love it and will continue to use as part of my daily skin regimen.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would be inclined to  write a review of a sun screen but here I am doing so. This stuff is crazy expensive but the smallest dab goes a long, long way. It glides over you face like it is on ball bearings, very fast and silky smooth. You can not feel that it is even on your skin afterwards and it stays on even when you&#x27;re sweating and for some reason doesn&#x27;t get into your eyes. I&#x27;ve found it to be very waterproof also.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  Although the tube looks really small, believe me that a little goes a super long way.  A 50 mg tube lasts me about 3 months.  I use the ivory-colored one which provides great coverage and excellent sun protection.  I have very oily skin and this product keeps that under control.  I&#x27;ve also used it when I go swimming and it is very water proof.  It&#x27;s great for those girls who feel naked without make-up, but who don&#x27;t want to use a heavy foundation while swimming.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Excellent protection. Smooth even look.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it highly. It&#x27;s the only sun block protection I use now. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have been using Minus-Sol for many years,  it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time already. Go try it! It&#x27;s amazing. Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> This serves as sunscreen, make-up and is non-comodomedic.  I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and I swear my acne- prone skin is better because of it.  This lotion fills in my skin to hide more pores and also prevents blackheads and other acne.  I think this has slowed down wrinkles and the aging process overall. I would never consider using foundation which is so heavy.  When I use this - people compliment me on my &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; complexion.  I really cannot live without this product.  Used it for years.</li>
            <li> I started using this about 2-3 years ago and always purchase it here in Amazon. Unlike other sun blocks, this one really blocks the sun. I use it on my office and another product on the rest of my body. I always notice that my body gets a bit tan but NOT my face, this is how I know this product works. I wish I could use it on my body as well but I do not because it is too expensive and would have to buy way many more if I also apply it on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was mainly drawn to it because of the zinc content. My dermatologist told me that ingredient is essential when buying a product to block the sun.</li>
            <li> Even though this is expensive, I do think its the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve used. It goes on smoothly and lasts (hopefully) a long time.</li>
            <li> My favorite sunblock.  Goes on like make-up, protects like amour!</li>
            <li> The wife says she loves it. Bought this for the wife and this is a repeat order. She likes the size for travel.</li>
            <li> goes on so smooth, it feels like silk. excellent for every day use, but not strong enough for a day at the beach.</li>
            <li> I love this product as it works great and feels wonderful to the skin.  Not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;The picture is misleading as you are only getting one tube not two.</li>
            <li> The Minus Sol Facial Sun Protection works very well as a sunscreen and I actually use it like a foundation.  It feels light and dry.</li>
            <li> Best facial sunblock I&#x27;ve found so far. It has 0 oil</li>
            <li> This is recommended by my dermatologist.  I really enjoy this product and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Five stars for the product, 1 star for the vendor: I was first introduced to Minus-Sol by my aesthetician and I&#x27;ve been using it for a number of years now. I&#x27;m a huge fan! However, I&#x27;m very disappointed with the service I&#x27;ve received from the vendor \\&quot;Skinpatico\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve purchased from them several times now and always received the product promptly. This time I ordered on 6/18/12 and it wasn&#x27;t delivered until 7/2. This is way too long a shipping time, given that they are located in Southern CA and I&#x27;m in Northern CA and the shipping should&#x27;ve taken a matter of a few days at most and the order said it would be delivered between 6/22 &amp; 6/27. I guess I&#x27;ll need to look for a new vendor</li>
            <li> I love this product!  My skin is prone to breakouts and I can wear this every day with no problems.  It goes on very smooth and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy at all.  The tinted color is nice but I wish they&#x27;d make more color options.</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive but worth it.  It&#x27;s not greasy or uncomfortable to wear.  My son HATES sunblock but this doesn&#x27;t bother him at all.  I have very sensitive skin and it&#x27;s the only sunblock I can use.</li>
            <li> My go to daily sunblock!  I love the texture &amp; the tint gives it a little coverage with no &amp;#34;ghost&amp;#34; look.  Will buy this forever!</li>
            <li> a smooth pleasant facial sun protection in ivory color which blends well in once face&#x27;s skin also recommended by dermatologists.</li>
            <li> It feels really smooth when it goes on your skin and doesn&#x27;t look heavy.  I only wish they made more shades.</li>
            <li> Minus-Sol is more than just Sun protection, it is a wonderful face cream and makeup base.  My skin seems to be much smoother since I have started to use it.</li>
