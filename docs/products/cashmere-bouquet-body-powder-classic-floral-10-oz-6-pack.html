Thank you, Amazon.</li>
            <li> USED FOR YEARS. NOT ABLE TO FIND IN STORES LOCALLY.  AMAZON CARRIES SO I CAN GET ANYTIME.  ENJOY SCENT AND FEELS LIKE CASHMERE ON SKIN.</li>
            <li> smells good and quite a good product. Based on other reviews I purchased this product. Smells great for whole day.</li>
            <li> I had heard others talking over the years,how great this product worked for them.I bought a ten pack,and have been giving them out to people I like and care for,sincerely.L.J.B</li>
            <li> This is the best, softest powder around. Makes your skin feel like pure silk. Helps to keep you dry, and fresh in any weather conditions, any time of the year. Great powder!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this body powder been buying this for years but stores no longer carries this, I don&#x27;t know why.  You can not get this anywhere any more except on line.  Love it!</li>
            <li> The Body Powder is the best I have ever used.  It does not clump, keeps you dry, smells wonderful.  I gave a 10oz  one to a friend for Christmas last year.  She was having problems under her breast with breaking out.  The doctor gave her cream to use but was not making the rash any better.  I told her the powder would not hurt her or do anything to her.  She is now hooked the same as I.&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine who was in her 80 at the time introduced me to your product, as she said she had used it for years. At that time we could buy them in Walgreens.  Her son who lives in North Carolina orders for her on the internet.  She used to give me one about twice a year as I would drive her to go out to eat and shopping and that was her way of showing appreciation.  She is all most 92 and your Body Powder is still being used by this beautiful lady.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife because she just loves the fragrance of the talc. She uses this after her bath and to tell the truth I love the smell too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always heard how good Cashmere Bouquet body powder is so I ordered the 6 pack.  To me it doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as nice as Shower to Shower which is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> My sister loves this powder.  I  always purchase it through Amazon.  It smells just like it used to when we were little.  It arrived packaged great (no spillage).</li>
            <li> Compared to other powders, this has by far, exceeded our expectations.  Absolutely no triggering of allergies at all with one of the most pleasant fragrances.  My wife has used this product for nearly 10 years and we usually buy it by the case for the best pricing and hopefully, it will continue to be made.</li>
            <li> Cashmere Bouquet Body Powder Classic Floral Fragrance Talc is just as I remembered it.  I purchased it for my mother who always used to use it and loved it&#x27;s fragrance.  I purchased the 6 pack for her and she shared a container of it with me.  I love it!!!!  It&#x27;s very refreshing especially on a hot and humid day.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this powder!! I ordered it for her and we had it amazingly quick.</li>
            <li> I Love this product Cashmere Bouquet Body Powder. I&#x27;ve used it for years and Walgreens used to sell it and they don&#x27;t anymore. I&#x27;m so glad Amazon carries it so I can still pamper myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope I will still be able to purchase this product for many years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
            <li> I liked the fragrance of the powder, but it was a little too clumpy on wet skin.  After mixing it with equal amounts of cornstarch, it was perfect.</li>
            <li> This product &amp;#34;SMELLS&amp;#34;  de-liteful.......I buy it by the case (it&#x27;s getting hard to find in stores)  Try this on your Sheets after you change the bed...In your shoes on a HOT day..etc....</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!! Too bad I cannot buy it at this price again.</li>
            <li> I have used this powder for years but cannot find it locally anymore. When I saw the opportunity to buy a 6 pack of the powder I pounced on it. I will continue to buy Cashmere Bouquet as long as it is available. I love the fresh clean fragrance and always use after a shower.</li>
            <li> Excellent.....thank you</li>
            <li> Have been using Cashmere Bouquet Talc since 1957, when I was in the service.&lt;br /&gt;for a couple of years I could not find it anywhere. Then my sister in SC located it on Amazon. She ordered me some. Then I recently ordered a supply for myself for the future . It is a great body power that goes well with  any aftershave or cologne.</li>
            <li> I had only one store where I could find this to purchase near where I lived.  I was so happy to find out I could order it from here and get it so quickly.  I have been using this for years and have been unable to find a talc that I liked and the fragrance is perfect.</li>
            <li> Came real fast;  I &#x27;ve been looking for cashmere Bouquet for a long time.THEY were for my sister,  and she was very happy and greatful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank&#x27;s for being so quick.</li>
            <li> Amazon is the only place where I can find this product.  This powder has a nice, but not overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> Cashmere Boquet Classic is my favorite. No lingering fragrance that stays with you all day long like some talcs. Does not smell like baby powder. It is perfect for after a shower to make your skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been using this powder for years(my grandmother used it too!) and was sad I could no longer purchase it from stores in my area! I looked on Ebay and found it there. I should be set for a long time since I bought 6 of them-it was more economical to buy the this way!</li>
            <li> I have used this powder for years. I started having a real problem finding it; when in the past I could get it in several places locally. I tell everyone \\&quot;can&#x27;t find it look on Amazon, they have everything\\&quot;! This is a fine Italian talc, it&#x27;s lightly scented and it feels silky on the skin.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I love the soft fragrance it has!&lt;br /&gt;Light enough that it doesn&#x27;t trigger my allergies or migraines!&lt;br /&gt;I used this for years and then was unable to locate it on any shelves, last place was Walgreens. When I got to the last bottle of my stock up, I mix it half and half with baby powder to make it last and still get some of  the scent. I finally called the company and learned the I could purchase it thur them. The cost was still high and I decided to look some more before ordering. Finally found it here for a decent cost and even good shipping! THANK YOU SO MUCH!</li>
