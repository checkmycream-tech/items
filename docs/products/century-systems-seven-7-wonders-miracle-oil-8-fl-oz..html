            <li>I love this oil!</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful and very relaxing.</li>
            <li>It is also great as a hot oil treatment for your hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair shines but its not oily looking after washing, it semi tames and makes it so much better...</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Amazon should use much better packaging for this product.</li>
            <li>This is such a wonderful blend for lots of uses.  </li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>it does leave a light very fine oil film if it doesnt soak in 100%.</li>
            <li>then rub my hands/palms quickly together till oil is warm-</li>
            <li>A neighbor used it for her tummy when she was pregnant and loved it, so she shared a bottle with me when I was pregnant 13 years ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a lovely scent and goes on light and silky.  </li>
            <li>It smells AMAZING (much like a vanilla/lavendar blend) and applies very smoothly.</li>
            <li>skin/cuts/wind burn more quickly than salves.   </li>
            <li>This product contains no animal fat or oils and is a cruelty free product.    </li>
            <li>I lightly apply it through my hair the day I need to wash it-</li>
            <li>this oil is fantastic, when you put it on your skin and rub it into your skin it leaves you skin feeling so silky but not oily.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used this one yet but the Miracle Lotion is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good natural oil for allover use.  </li>
            <li>I can not smell any fragrance with this at all,   this is best used in light applications for body and hair- a little goes along way!</li>
            <li>I recently had my first massage (loved it!) and was introduced to Seven Wonders.</li>
            <li>lightly oil all hair, twist up/clip, time it like a light hot oil treatment so it can soak in and work.</li>
            <li>I use it as a hot oil treatment  for my hair and as a lotion right out of the shower!!</li>
            <li>Worth the $.</li>
            <li>it looks alive and healthy.</li>
            <li>and this is my favorite by far.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair healthy and my skin soft and supple...</li>
            <li>It washes right out no residue.</li>
            <li>I have found its so much cheaper and works far much better than high scale salon items.</li>
            <li>It had a nice smell and, aside from the fragrance (last on the ingredients list), it was all natural oils.</li>
            <li>This is a great-smelling oil that absorbs easily into the skin and give enough slip for a massage.</li>
            <li>I also put it on my face as a night treatment - it&#x27;s light enough.  </li>
            <li>makes pale skin glow with health and provides an overall pleasant feeling.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this oil!</li>
            <li>Certainly less synthetic ingredients than most products on the market.</li>
            <li>There is no doubt that most of these oils/ingredients are extremely beneficial and have made my skin soft without being overly oily.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert/New Mexico/</li>
            <li>(I otherwise have totally clear skin).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients and that it&#x27;s not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>But one ingredient, DiMethicone, isn&#x27;t quite so natural.</li>
            <li>In his final year a massage therapist recommended this oil and it absolutely changed his life.</li>
            <li>Ingredients:  Miracle OilÂ® Ingredients:     Olive Oil, Canola Oil, Wheat Germ Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Sesame Seed Oil, Castor Oil, Safflower Oil, Dimethicone, Vitamins E, A &amp; D, Burdock Root, Chamomile, Hyssop, Henna, Alfalfa, Sage, Goldenseal, Jaborandi, Slippery Elm Bark, Sheep Sorrell, Wheat Germ, Cherry Bark, Comfrey, Black Walnut, Yarrow, Fragrance     </li>
            <li>I keep my oil bottle on the (metal) end of an old frozen OJ tube style container- making a tiny saucer in case</li>
            <li>It is something added to help make the oils more spreadable across the skin and something that often leaves a thin layer of build up, almost has a plastic feel.</li>
            <li>it sinks right into dry scaley elbows, chapped lips, wind burned knees- etc.</li>
            <li>But I will definitely look for a totally natural product next time.</li>
            <li>At first we applied it several times a day and after less than a month his skin was like a baby&#x27;s.</li>

            <li> Ingredients:  Miracle OilÂ® Ingredients:     Olive Oil, Canola Oil, Wheat Germ Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Sesame Seed Oil, Castor Oil, Safflower Oil, Dimethicone, Vitamins E, A &amp; D, Burdock Root, Chamomile, Hyssop, Henna, Alfalfa, Sage, Goldenseal, Jaborandi, Slippery Elm Bark, Sheep Sorrell, Wheat Germ, Cherry Bark, Comfrey, Black Walnut, Yarrow, Fragrance     This product contains no animal fat or oils and is a cruelty free product.    ***  I have used this for 20 years. I can not smell any fragrance with this at all,   this is best used in light applications for body and hair- a little goes along way! Its NOT gloppy like olive oil/almond/canola, seems lighter than grape seed oil even.  Worth the $. I lightly apply it through my hair the day I need to wash it- lightly oil all hair, twist up/clip, time it like a light hot oil treatment so it can soak in and work. It is a God send for unruley eyebrows. It washes right out no residue. I do this 2 times a week. I live in the desert/New Mexico/hard water/50 yrs/unprocessed thick semi curly hair. My hair shines but its not oily looking after washing, it semi tames and makes it so much better...it looks alive and healthy. My beautican is astounded. I have found its so much cheaper and works far much better than high scale salon items. It feeds your hair and body.  How I apply this I squeaze a small amount (pea size) onto one palm then rub my hands/palms quickly together till oil is warm- then lay my hands on area and massage in-it sinks right into dry scaley elbows, chapped lips, wind burned knees- etc. it does leave a light very fine oil film if it doesnt soak in 100%. If that happens it doesnt stain my clothes.  Oddly I have found for some reason it heals skin/cuts/wind burn more quickly than salves.   I keep my oil bottle on the (metal) end of an old frozen OJ tube style container- making a tiny saucer in case a drop oil seeps out.  Just my 2 cents....</li>
            <li> this oil is fantastic, when you put it on your skin and rub it into your skin it leaves you skin feeling so silky but not oily. I love it</li>
            <li> I love using this oil after every bath and shower!  I feel like I&#x27;m nourishing my skin, instead of putting on a cream that contains all sorts of ingredients that I don&#x27;t know what they are or where they came from!</li>
            <li> I recently had my first massage (loved it!) and was introduced to Seven Wonders. The smell is wonderful and very relaxing. I use it at night, especially in the summer for dry skin. Use just a little, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil before and because it&#x27;s not readily found, I sought it out with you guys.  I&#x27;d recommend to anyone looking for an oil for multipurpose applications.</li>
            <li> I use this oil every day in lieu of lotion.  It makes my skin glow.  The blend of oils is fantastic and the product is wonderful. I only find this at health food stores locally so I am happy to find this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every body oil out there and this is my favorite by far.  I use it in the shower on my legs and arms every day.  It&#x27;s got a lovely scent and goes on light and silky.  I also put it on my face as a night treatment - it&#x27;s light enough.  It&#x27;s a good natural oil for allover use.  I&#x27;ve tried it on my hair as an oil treatment and it worked well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!! It smells good and is not greasy... I use it as a hot oil treatment  for my hair and as a lotion right out of the shower!! It keeps my hair healthy and my skin soft and supple... I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this oil at my local health food store, and decided to order a bottle here, as the products at the local store tend to be pricey. This is a great-smelling oil that absorbs easily into the skin and give enough slip for a massage. I&#x27;ve used it on my hands and feet to soften skin, as an after-bath oil, a massage oil, and put a little in my hair to moisturize it. I like that it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients and that it&#x27;s not tested on animals. Great product!</li>
            <li> The oil and cream work extremely well. It&#x27;s truly a miracle lotion. Amazon should use much better packaging for this product.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! A neighbor used it for her tummy when she was pregnant and loved it, so she shared a bottle with me when I was pregnant 13 years ago. It had a nice smell and, aside from the fragrance (last on the ingredients list), it was all natural oils. I have used it in my hair for about 10 years now. After multiple pregnancies and regular coloring, my hair can get a little frizzy and dry. I don&#x27;t like the waxy feel of the fancy and expensive oils from the hair salons. This oil feels just like oil, nothing else. I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> There is no doubt that most of these oils/ingredients are extremely beneficial and have made my skin soft without being overly oily. But one ingredient, DiMethicone, isn&#x27;t quite so natural. It is something added to help make the oils more spreadable across the skin and something that often leaves a thin layer of build up, almost has a plastic feel. I used it on my face and I have a small breakout on my cheek now (I otherwise have totally clear skin). I am not allergic to any other ingredient, and I suspect that my pores got clogged from the Dimethicone. Also, not sure what they use as &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; but that is likely synthetic as well. Certainly less synthetic ingredients than most products on the market. But I will definitely look for a totally natural product next time.</li>
            <li> Skip the lotion - use this oil after showering while your body is still damp with moisture - and you will have the smoothest possible skin you could ask for. It smells AMAZING (much like a vanilla/lavendar blend) and applies very smoothly. I swear by the Miracle Oil!</li>
            <li> This product does everything it promises.  Will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is the same product I bought in the nineties in an herb shop at college but it has the same oils.  This is such a wonderful blend for lots of uses.  It moisturizes dry skin, protects dry hair, soothes headaches,  makes pale skin glow with health and provides an overall pleasant feeling.</li>
            <li> Love this Product!!!! I used to purchase this product from a local health food shop and they quit carrying it. It took me some time to locate it on amazon, but so happy I did.  The fragrance is awesome! it has a tropical smell mixed with a floral smell.  It is a blend of natural essential oils in amond oil, jahoba oil, and olive oil base.  I have eczema and this is the only thing that prevents a break out in the winters. It is a heavier oil but I use it in the shower and towel it off.  It is also great as a hot oil treatment for your hair.  I have used it on my babies as a calming oil after bathing them, because of the chamomile in it. I can&#x27;t say enough about it. I just love it.</li>
            <li> All the Seven Wonders products are excellent.  Haven&#x27;t used this one yet but the Miracle Lotion is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this oil! It&#x27;s a heavenly moisturizer &amp; my heels never look dry! I always receive compliments on the softness of my skin! Lol! ðŸ˜Œ</li>
            <li> In his final years my father developed awful, itchy, scaly, flaking skin - everywhere on his body. It was torture for him. In his final year a massage therapist recommended this oil and it absolutely changed his life. At first we applied it several times a day and after less than a month his skin was like a baby&#x27;s. We used it everywhere, even his scalp and ears. Absolutely perfect. Thank you for carrying it.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderfully nourishing oil.  I discovered it at the massage spa and now use it on my skin and hair.  It is lightweight with an inviting subtle fragrance.</li>
