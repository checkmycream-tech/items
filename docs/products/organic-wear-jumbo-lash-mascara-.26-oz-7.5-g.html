    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>It does not seem to flake off like the others and I have been very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>which is awesome!  </li>
            <li>The Physician&#x27;s Formula Organic Wear line is great stuff!  </li>
            <li>It is non-toxic to my system and that is a beautiful thing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>The Organic wear has a great brush and doesn&#x27;t clump up my lashes at all.</li>
            <li>My lashes look great and no irritation even while wearing contacts.  </li>
            <li>Best looking mascara I&#x27;ve used, better than all the chemical</li>
            <li>Love it!!! :)&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good price, works well, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It goes on and dries fairly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;ll find a healthy good mascara eventually!</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I love the way this mascara goes on, provides great volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this mascara!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this mascara!</li>
            <li>I always liked this one because it never clumped.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s not waterproof to be honest because it&#x27;s easily&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also own their Organic Wear eyeliner and tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>So far, Loreal Collagen is the best mascara I&#x27;ve used, but it has parabens.  </li>
            <li>The silver lining is that it washes off really easily with soap and water - no makeup remover needed!</li>
            <li>from what ive seen, its easy to apply and has a nice consistency and color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good deal and a good product - definitely the best I&#x27;ve encountered so far, and I plan to stick with it!</li>
            <li>I love the brush on this</li>
            <li>Kept wiping it, more would appear.</li>
            <li>I love Physicians</li>
            <li>Plus I love the ingredients.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off just not wearing any at all.</li>
            <li>I just have to hold my face under the shower without touching my eyes and it all comes off.</li>
            <li>but for the price and quality of ingredients, its a worthwhile tradeoff for me.  </li>
            <li>Out of all the organic mascaras I tried this was the best overall.</li>
            <li>The mascara itself is ok.</li>
            <li>Mostly both.</li>
            <li>It takes more than one coat to the get look</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and as described, love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Color is rich doesnt clump but smudges VERY easily and then burns my eyes</li>
            <li>I love that it comes off easily with water and doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes or contact</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this one would work after reading so many good reviews, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>The other one was perfect...</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It comes off with water way too easily.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clump, extends your lashes and easy to get off.</li>
            <li>When smudged, it is also easily cleaned up and retouched.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes off easily with soap and water, so it&#x27;s easy to clean up any under eye smudges.  </li>
            <li>How can this product be advertised as 100% cruelty free when Beeswax is used as an ingredient?</li>
            <li>brush is great, big and fat.&lt;br /&gt;-Physicians</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and dark, and seems to do a good job of coating my lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved this when I first got it, it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and felt clean on, but it ran out really fast.</li>
            <li>First off, I love the way this looks.</li>
            <li>I was not at all sure about this when I first pulled it out of the box -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ts a great mascara!&lt;br /&gt;You just need to be careful because it&#x27;s not waterproof.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However the benefits are pretty great, finally an affordable organic mascara!</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work because I love the way mascara looks, but it always make my eyes sting by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I recommend this stuff to everyone that wants to treat their skin, body and Earth with more respect.</li>
            <li>I was paying more than twice this much for another clean brand that smudged just as much and wasn&#x27;t as dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sorry I took the chance!.  </li>
            <li>but I feel like the mascara kind of dries out quickly or there is just not enough liquid.</li>
            <li>love the natural ingredients, quality, price and ease of accessibility (found in Target, Rite Aid, CVS, etc.) of this product.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not unhappy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>They were absolutely RIGHT.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much that I don&#x27;t want to try any new mascaras.</li>
            <li>The brush is large and takes a little getting used to but the result it great.  </li>
            <li>Get teary eyed watching a touching commercial on TV?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and black though and doesn&#x27;t flake or clump.</li>
            <li>Bought this because someone said its good for people with dry eyes but after a day wearing it my eyes turned red.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not irritate my eyes at all, and comes off completely cleanly and easily with a little bit of coconut oil.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like how it goes on so much.</li>
            <li>but after several layers and a bit of clean up, I was satisfied with the end result and hoped that it would dry and stay put.</li>
            <li>I noticed at the slightest watering of my eyes it would smudge, and what really sealed the deal was when I looked in the mirror after a yoga class and looked like a racoon.</li>
            <li>I love other mascaras made by Physicians Formula but not this one.</li>
            <li>I love that it stays on, but to know that it is not poisoning my blood stream with chemicals, cannot even tell the difference between this and other mascaras...</li>
            <li>and It makes my eyelashes look super black, super long and lovely while keeping them soft and flexible.</li>
            <li>Somehow it always looked pretty natural.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to pay the high dollar.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m female writing on my husband&#x27;s account: I try to use and consume organic products as much as possible, thus when I found this I was excited!</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ll probably try another brand next time because I don&#x27;t consider this quite worth the price.</li>
            <li>being new to makeup, i asked for suggestions from friends and this is one that i got.</li>
            <li>They were much harder to take off or clean the smudges and they tended to flake mascara bits into my eyes or sting them.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>Rejuva Minerals mascara was the same exact way of this.  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try it again, but it does the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and moist, and I think it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe this would work better because it is natural, but the product was no exception to my usual reaction to mascara.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it was pretty runny, and it clumps a little.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a staple in my natural make-up</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the pros of the natural ingredients outweigh the cons</li>
            <li>This stuff is all natural, and making it waterproof would require adding chemicals.</li>
            <li>and I do not have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I decided I had nothing to lose as buying natural and/or organic products</li>
            <li>but after two or three layers it looks just as good as the (sadly toxic) stuff I used to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They tend to have a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; effect... i.e. they do very little of the volumizing or emphasizing of one&#x27;s lashes that is so appealing in standard mascara!</li>
            <li>I have tried this style and the one in the pink, black and white tube as well, they are all amazing.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clump, normal shape and smaller wand.</li>
            <li>This one is super wet and never seems to dry.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like that it takes a bit longer to dry because its more wet than other mascara&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive eyes, and this is the only mascara I&#x27;ve ever used that didn&#x27;t cause irritation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, as noted above, at least this mascara actually creates the look I have so missed being able to create and never irritates my eyes.</li>
            <li>I love the brush, and the formula isn&#x27;t irritating.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive, not completely organic, but 100% natural</li>
            <li>I would recommend this mascara to anyone who goes for a natural look and does not need to have ridiculously long lasting results.</li>
            <li>Extensive reading of reviews for every mascara that gets safe ratings in the Skin Deep database sadly supports my own experience - easy smudge is just part of the price paid for not putting nasty chemicals near your eyes.</li>
            <li>I like the other organice mascara they sell that is a normal shape, beige color.  </li>

            <li> It only took a few tries to get used to, however, and the mascara is totally worth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed and really want a healthy mascara.  </li>
            <li> did not take off any stars for that, however, as it is apparently (and unfortunately) unavoidable in clean mascaras.</li>
            <li> and I need it to hold up well over long days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried, but other than that, I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Going on I noticed it&#x27;s definitely a bit wetter and messier than my other mascaras</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter whether it&#x27;s humid or dry, or whether I wear powder under my eyes or not.</li>
            <li> the flat top, where you hold onto the wand felt weird and awkward the first couple times I used it.</li>
            <li> Also it seemed to loose some of its intensity after 6-8 hours</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t smudge at all, but if you are looking for a mascara that will give you long lashes, this is certainly not it.</li>
            <li> I like my eye makeup to be pretty dramatic</li>
            <li> I like this mascara but wished that it didn&#x27;t have beeswax in it and wished that the brush was a little different.</li>
            <li> ill certainly be buying another when my current one runs out.</li>
            <li> eyelashes are fairly soft to the touch, they&#x27;re not rock hard like with some mascaras.&lt;br</li>
            <li> keep in mind that it is not waterproof and will run if you get it wet.</li>
            <li> However it was still lacking in a few areas for me personally.  </li>
            <li> This one actually is an appreciably dark black, and adds both volume and emphasis.</li>
            <li> I am sticking with the other one.  </li>
            <li> I read the other reviews that emphasized the mascara&#x27;s inability to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; and thought I would give it a shot and see for myself.  </li>
            <li> The wide lash comb/applicator makes this easier to put on than almost every other mascara I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> Works just as well as any other mascara!  </li>
            <li> I tried this mascara and another one...trying to save money and figured I would try to find one that didn&#x27;t give me the black shadow under my eye.  </li>
            <li> Globs of black underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> Then my husband pointed out that I looked like I had 2 black eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have an active lifestyle, and I find it gives me a little shadow under my eyes after a few hours of sweating/hard work/</li>
            <li> I usually have this problem with other mascaras too.  </li>
            <li> It was a little cheaper than this one</li>
            <li> but every time I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror, it had smudged underneath my eye, or flaked a little bit.</li>
            <li> It gives you jumbo lashes and its organic but it clumps easily and the weird shape of it makes it difficult to hold.  </li>
            <li> because so few of them are actually dark!</li>
            <li> I bought this a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> Lasts throughout the day but leaves smudges under my eyes that I have to wipe off a few times.</li>
            <li> DOES smudge - do not even think about rubbing your eyes or crying with this stuff on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve poked myself with the stiff spike bristles a few times and it hurts like hell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very black, and doesn&#x27;t clump.....</li>
            <li> It smudges abysmally, coats very thin even if you put on dozens of coats, and the brush is huge and impossible to control.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced anything like that with any other mascara</li>
            <li> My eyes are very sensitive and this is one of the only mascaras I can wear with out my eyes feeling awful at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> The mascara is too thick and flaky.</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for an organic mascara that isn&#x27;t so expensive (previously using Tarte brand) and was hoping this would be it.</li>
            <li> Also, I hate to admit it, but those run of the mill Covergirl and Revlon mascaras simply do a much better job curling and lengthening your lashes &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> have been very frustrated by &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; mascaras (organic/all natural)</li>
            <li> By evening I&#x27;d have black sand-like granules on and under my contacts which had scratched my eye badly a couple times before I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I could not get the dramatic effect with this mascara.</li>
            <li> I used this product several years ago, but hated how it smudged under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this does not stay on my lashes well.</li>
            <li> hated this mascara.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> a cruel practice.</li>
            <li> It irritates my contacts horribly because the mascara crumbles as the day wears on.</li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I did cry, it immediately liquified into my eyes and burned terribly.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wear contacts and this product does not bother my eyes.  There are not any mascara particles coming off my lashes into my eyes.  It does smudge a bit under the eye depending on activity or weather.  It comes off easily with soap and water, so it&#x27;s easy to clean up any under eye smudges.  I usually have this problem with other mascaras too.  They were much harder to take off or clean the smudges and they tended to flake mascara bits into my eyes or sting them.  This product does not feel like it dries out my lashes.</li>
            <li> I tried this mascara and another one...trying to save money and figured I would try to find one that didn&#x27;t give me the black shadow under my eye.  The other one was perfect...this one did not work....it still gave me the shadow.  I am sticking with the other one.  It was a little cheaper than this one and I don&#x27;t have to pay the high dollar.  I was really hoping this one would work after reading so many good reviews, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes. I really wanted this to work because I love the way mascara looks, but it always make my eyes sting by the end of the day. I thought maybe this would work better because it is natural, but the product was no exception to my usual reaction to mascara. It also got really flaky after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Works great! Adds enough to make your lashes look longer and fuller!</li>
            <li> Back when I wore mascara I always liked this one because it never clumped.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! The wide lash comb/applicator makes this easier to put on than almost every other mascara I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I love the brush on this but I feel like the mascara kind of dries out quickly or there is just not enough liquid.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few days ago.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t smudge at all, but if you are looking for a mascara that will give you long lashes, this is certainly not it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ts a great mascara!&lt;br /&gt;You just need to be careful because it&#x27;s not waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s not waterproof to be honest because it&#x27;s easily&lt;br /&gt;washed before going to sleep!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> Globby!!! Globs of black underneath my eyes. Kept wiping it, more would appear. Never buying again. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Can I say this is the only mascara that won&#x27;t break my lashes!!!! Love it!!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Pam B.&lt;br /&gt;Cincinnati, Ohio-</li>
            <li> I love Physicians Formula Organic Wear Jumbo Lash Mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply one coat and It makes my eyelashes look super black, super long and lovely while keeping them soft and flexible. I love that it comes off easily with water and doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes or contact lenses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the natural ingredients, quality, price and ease of accessibility (found in Target, Rite Aid, CVS, etc.) of this product. It&#x27;s a staple in my natural make-up collection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Orange Fruit Water*, Glycerin, Iron Oxide, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Glyceryl Stearate, Water, Beeswax,* Jojoba Esters, Tapioca Starch,* Carnauba Wax*, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice*, Cellulose Gum, Cucumber Fruit Extract,* Soybean Oil,* Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Olive Leaf Extract*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May Contain: Titanium Dioxide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Organic</li>
            <li> I will only wear this brand mascara from now on. I have tried this style and the one in the pink, black and white tube as well, they are all amazing. The Organic wear has a great brush and doesn&#x27;t clump up my lashes at all. Plus I love the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I had no problem with this product.  It&#x27;s smooth and moist, and I think it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> This mascara would be under my eyes before the end of the day, every time I used it.</li>
            <li> First off, I love the way this looks. It&#x27;s nice and dark, and seems to do a good job of coating my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like how it goes on so much. The first time I used it, it was pretty runny, and it clumps a little. I have an active lifestyle, and I find it gives me a little shadow under my eyes after a few hours of sweating/hard work/wind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the pros of the natural ingredients outweigh the cons so I&#x27;m not unhappy with my purchase. However, I&#x27;ll probably try another brand next time because I don&#x27;t consider this quite worth the price.</li>
            <li> How can this product be advertised as 100% cruelty free when Beeswax is used as an ingredient? A lot of people who would buy this product for its \\&quot;cruelty free\\&quot; status find the harvesting of beeswax, (from organic farming or not, whatever that means?) a cruel practice.</li>
            <li> The mascara is too thick and flaky. It irritates my contacts horribly because the mascara crumbles as the day wears on. By evening I&#x27;d have black sand-like granules on and under my contacts which had scratched my eye badly a couple times before I stopped using it. I love other mascaras made by Physicians Formula but not this one.</li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I have ever tried. You&#x27;d be better off just not wearing any at all. It smudges abysmally, coats very thin even if you put on dozens of coats, and the brush is huge and impossible to control.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive eyes, and this is the only mascara I&#x27;ve ever used that didn&#x27;t cause irritation. It adds a lot of volume and length to my tiny lashes. I love this stuff so much that I don&#x27;t want to try any new mascaras. It&#x27;s a good price, works well, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just keep in mind that it is not waterproof and will run if you get it wet. This stuff is all natural, and making it waterproof would require adding chemicals.</li>
            <li> I love that it stays on, but to know that it is not poisoning my blood stream with chemicals, cannot even tell the difference between this and other mascaras...</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews that emphasized the mascara&#x27;s inability to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; and thought I would give it a shot and see for myself.  They were absolutely RIGHT.  This mascara smears around my eyelids and is goopy on my lashes all day long.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Color is rich doesnt clump but smudges VERY easily and then burns my eyes</li>
            <li> Bought this because someone said its good for people with dry eyes but after a day wearing it my eyes turned red.</li>
            <li> being new to makeup, i asked for suggestions from friends and this is one that i got. from what ive seen, its easy to apply and has a nice consistency and color. ill certainly be buying another when my current one runs out.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-I love the way this mascara goes on, provides great volume.&lt;br /&gt;-It goes on and dries fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;-Your eyelashes are fairly soft to the touch, they&#x27;re not rock hard like with some mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;-The brush is great, big and fat.&lt;br /&gt;-Physicians Formula is a drugstore brand, you can get it almost anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The size of the tube is deceptive because it contains a smaller tube that actually holds the product, about the width of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;-It comes off with water way too easily. I just have to hold my face under the shower without touching my eyes and it all comes off. To some, this is a pro. But this also means that if it&#x27;s too humid out, raccoon eyes. Eyes water after a sneeze? Mascara smudge. Yawn that produces a tear? Mascara smudge. Get teary eyed watching a touching commercial on TV? Goodbye mascara. Legitimate cry? Mascara everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;-When I did cry, it immediately liquified into my eyes and burned terribly. I could not open my eyes unless I wiped it all away. I have not experienced anything like that with any other mascara and I do not have sensitive eyes. The burn is my deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;-Contains beeswax. I prefer cosmetics with no animal products.</li>
            <li> I love the brush, and the formula isn&#x27;t irritating. It does not cause your lashes to look &amp;#34;spidery&amp;#34; if applied correctly. I don&#x27;t like that it takes a bit longer to dry because its more wet than other mascara&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried, but other than that, I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> After reading the mixed reviews, I was hesitant with this purchase.  I decided I had nothing to lose as buying natural and/or organic products seem to always be a gamble.  I&#x27;m not sorry I took the chance!.  The brush is large and takes a little getting used to but the result it great.  It&#x27;s no Dior Show or Lancome but for the price and quality of ingredients, its a worthwhile tradeoff for me.  My lashes look great and no irritation even while wearing contacts.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This did not irritate my eyes at all, and it washes off with water and regular cleanser. Love it! However, the wand doesn&#x27;t give a lot of volume, so 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Out of all the organic mascaras I tried this was the best overall. However it was still lacking in a few areas for me personally.  I like my eye makeup to be pretty dramatic and I need it to hold up well over long days. I could not get the dramatic effect with this mascara. Somehow it always looked pretty natural. Also it seemed to loose some of its intensity after 6-8 hours and I had to reapply. However the benefits are pretty great, finally an affordable organic mascara! I would recommend this mascara to anyone who goes for a natural look and does not need to have ridiculously long lasting results.</li>
            <li> I loved this when I first got it, it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and felt clean on, but it ran out really fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m female writing on my husband&#x27;s account: I try to use and consume organic products as much as possible, thus when I found this I was excited! It&#x27;s very black, and doesn&#x27;t clump.....but every time I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror, it had smudged underneath my eye, or flaked a little bit. Also, I hate to admit it, but those run of the mill Covergirl and Revlon mascaras simply do a much better job curling and lengthening your lashes &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as described, love this stuff!</li>
            <li> The wand is too big for my taste, I end up having to wipe off excess mascara off my skin. The mascara itself is ok. Lasts throughout the day but leaves smudges under my eyes that I have to wipe off a few times.</li>
            <li> Not a fan.  I have been on the search for healthier mascaras from the EWG database.  This one is super wet and never seems to dry.  I touched my eyelash hours later and they all clumped into one.  Then my husband pointed out that I looked like I had 2 black eyes.  I hadn&#x27;t rubbed my eyes, or anything.  I&#x27;m so disappointed and really want a healthy mascara.  Rejuva Minerals mascara was the same exact way of this.  I&#x27;ve tossed them both.  So far, Loreal Collagen is the best mascara I&#x27;ve used, but it has parabens.  I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;ll find a healthy good mascara eventually!</li>
            <li> It gives you jumbo lashes and its organic but it clumps easily and the weird shape of it makes it difficult to hold.  I like the other organice mascara they sell that is a normal shape, beige color.  Doesn&#x27;t clump, normal shape and smaller wand.</li>
            <li> hated this mascara. flaked all over my face within an hour.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara but wished that it didn&#x27;t have beeswax in it and wished that the brush was a little different. I&#x27;ve poked myself with the stiff spike bristles a few times and it hurts like hell. It&#x27;s nice and black though and doesn&#x27;t flake or clump.</li>
            <li> Best looking mascara I&#x27;ve used, better than all the chemical based one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried, my only issue is that it does smudge if you rub  your eyes. Wish they had a waterproof one as well</li>
            <li> I used this product several years ago, but hated how it smudged under my eyes.  I thought I&#x27;d try it again, but it does the exact same thing. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether it&#x27;s humid or dry, or whether I wear powder under my eyes or not. I constantly have to wipe mascara smudges, or else look like a raccoon. Mostly both.</li>
            <li> My eyes are very sensitive and this is one of the only mascaras I can wear with out my eyes feeling awful at the end of the day.  It does not seem to flake off like the others and I have been very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! Was leery about trying a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product but this one lives up to all its claims. Doesn&#x27;t clump, extends your lashes and easy to get off.</li>
            <li> I was not at all sure about this when I first pulled it out of the box - the flat top, where you hold onto the wand felt weird and awkward the first couple times I used it. It only took a few tries to get used to, however, and the mascara is totally worth the effort!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been very frustrated by &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; mascaras (organic/all natural) because so few of them are actually dark! They tend to have a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; effect... i.e. they do very little of the volumizing or emphasizing of one&#x27;s lashes that is so appealing in standard mascara! This one actually is an appreciably dark black, and adds both volume and emphasis. It takes more than one coat to the get look I want, but after two or three layers it looks just as good as the (sadly toxic) stuff I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not irritate my eyes at all, and comes off completely cleanly and easily with a little bit of coconut oil. When smudged, it is also easily cleaned up and retouched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It DOES smudge - do not even think about rubbing your eyes or crying with this stuff on.&lt;br /&gt;I did not take off any stars for that, however, as it is apparently (and unfortunately) unavoidable in clean mascaras. Extensive reading of reviews for every mascara that gets safe ratings in the Skin Deep database sadly supports my own experience - easy smudge is just part of the price paid for not putting nasty chemicals near your eyes. *sigh*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, as noted above, at least this mascara actually creates the look I have so missed being able to create and never irritates my eyes. Also, you can&#x27;t beat the price! I was paying more than twice this much for another clean brand that smudged just as much and wasn&#x27;t as dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good deal and a good product - definitely the best I&#x27;ve encountered so far, and I plan to stick with it!</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for an organic mascara that isn&#x27;t so expensive (previously using Tarte brand) and was hoping this would be it. Going on I noticed it&#x27;s definitely a bit wetter and messier than my other mascaras but after several layers and a bit of clean up, I was satisfied with the end result and hoped that it would dry and stay put. Unfortunately this does not stay on my lashes well. I noticed at the slightest watering of my eyes it would smudge, and what really sealed the deal was when I looked in the mirror after a yoga class and looked like a racoon. I got sweaty and this stuff just melted off my lashes.  The silver lining is that it washes off really easily with soap and water - no makeup remover needed! In any case, I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as any other mascara!  Inexpensive, not completely organic, but 100% natural which is awesome!  It is non-toxic to my system and that is a beautiful thing.  The Physician&#x27;s Formula Organic Wear line is great stuff!  I also own their Organic Wear eyeliner and tinted moisturizer.  I recommend this stuff to everyone that wants to treat their skin, body and Earth with more respect.</li>
