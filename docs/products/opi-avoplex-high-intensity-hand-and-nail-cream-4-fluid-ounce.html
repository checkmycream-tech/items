            <li>A word of warning to others, just in case: This really, really does absorb into the nails, even if you&#x27;re wearing polish.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This lotion is very moisturizing &amp; doesn&#x27;t smell girly.</li>
            <li>During the winter months, we are always searching for a hand cream that really works.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for carrying this product.  </li>
            <li>My husband uses it as his hands tend to dry out easily from playing the guitar.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>It is not over powering by any means but it seems like a smell for older women, I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it for anyone&lt;br /&gt;searching</li>
            <li>also use the OPI Avoplex cuticle oil, which I also highly recommend</li>
            <li>Really does make your hands feel soft.</li>
            <li>Love the feel but wish the scent was a little less strong.</li>
            <li>I use it every night on hands, and elbows right before I go to bed (as well as occasionally during the day).</li>
            <li>I bought this in conjunction with the Opi Nail and cuticle replenishing cream and the Opi Nail envy original on the advice of a friend who had had the samae problem as me....dry, flaky nails, and rough cuticles.  </li>
            <li>This hand and nail cream is a live saver.</li>
            <li>When I apply this fantastic lotion at night, my hands look ten years younger in the morning.  </li>
            <li>But it made my hands very soft.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fairly strong, but it&#x27;s one I like, and it doesn&#x27;t last long in any case.</li>
            <li>Not excessively perfume-y.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hands soft and not greasy and it lasts!</li>
            <li>This lotion is fine, but I don&#x27;t think it worked any miracles on my winter dried hands.</li>
            <li>it soaks in and leave my skin feeling soft and not a bit greasy -- kinda like Ultrasuede.</li>
            <li>and they were so baby soft in the morning</li>
            <li>This bottle was much cheaper and bigger than the ones offered at the nail salon.</li>
            <li>my hands are unbelievably soft since I started using OPI</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and emollient and&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hands become soft instantaneously.</li>
            <li>I keep my nails constantly polished, and though my standard is to wipe the nail down with an alcohol pad to clean them, even applying this lotion a day or so after a fresh manicure the polish will peel up after a short time.  </li>
            <li>I like the other OPI lotions better, I like the pump dispenser on the other ones.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t normal for me, and has only happened when I&#x27;ve used the lotion, but I figured I should make mention.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for only a few weeks, and can see a huge improvement in my hands.</li>
            <li>The product really helps my dry nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li>I am trying to finish my other cream first.</li>
            <li>but as you get older your hands get dry anyway.</li>
            <li>We live in the southwest and the weather is dry and windy.  </li>
            <li>I use my hands a lot and eal with knitting yarn, fabric and gardening on an alomost daily basis and it was really taking a toll oin my nails.  </li>
            <li>Works really good but a little expensive for what you get.</li>

            <li> I bought this in conjunction with the Opi Nail and cuticle replenishing cream and the Opi Nail envy original on the advice of a friend who had had the samae problem as me....dry, flaky nails, and rough cuticles.  </li>
            <li> This hand and nail cream is a live saver.</li>
            <li> When I apply this fantastic lotion at night, my hands look ten years younger in the morning.  </li>
            <li> But it made my hands very soft.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is fairly strong, but it&#x27;s one I like, and it doesn&#x27;t last long in any case.</li>
            <li> Not excessively perfume-y.  </li>
            <li> It makes your hands soft and not greasy and it lasts!</li>
            <li> This lotion is fine, but I don&#x27;t think it worked any miracles on my winter dried hands.</li>
            <li> it soaks in and leave my skin feeling soft and not a bit greasy -- kinda like Ultrasuede.</li>
            <li> and they were so baby soft in the morning</li>
            <li> This bottle was much cheaper and bigger than the ones offered at the nail salon.</li>
            <li> my hands are unbelievably soft since I started using OPI</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and emollient and&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hands become soft instantaneously.</li>
            <li> I keep my nails constantly polished, and though my standard is to wipe the nail down with an alcohol pad to clean them, even applying this lotion a day or so after a fresh manicure the polish will peel up after a short time.  </li>
            <li> I like the other OPI lotions better, I like the pump dispenser on the other ones.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t normal for me, and has only happened when I&#x27;ve used the lotion, but I figured I should make mention.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for only a few weeks, and can see a huge improvement in my hands.</li>
            <li> The product really helps my dry nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li> I am trying to finish my other cream first.</li>
            <li> but as you get older your hands get dry anyway.</li>
            <li> We live in the southwest and the weather is dry and windy.  </li>
            <li> I use my hands a lot and eal with knitting yarn, fabric and gardening on an alomost daily basis and it was really taking a toll oin my nails.  </li>
            <li> Works really good but a little expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> At first it feels quite wet and slippery, and then within a few seconds of spreading it over my hands (and elbows)</li>
            <li> A tiny bit of it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My husband has very dry hands and after trying several things this was the only thing that worked</li>
            <li> After using regularly for about a week my cuticles were no longer dry and splitting.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really, REALLY heal skin like some other heavy duty creams (I suffer from dry hands)</li>
            <li> You can get similar quality from other moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I would not purchase this hand cream at spa or studio markups, but it is a heavenly treat and treatment for my dry hands when I can get it on Amazon at bargain prices.</li>
            <li> and my hands are so dry this has been my saving grace!</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands and cuticles</li>
            <li> I am a gardener with very dry hands and cuticles.</li>
            <li> It was not what i was expected.</li>
            <li> nails daughter loves it will other again as soon as needed</li>
            <li> Really softens them while not being thick and greasy!!</li>
            <li> DOES NOT LIGHTEN DARK SPOTS.</li>
            <li> I think it will be thick enough.</li>
            <li> I will buy this again and again--it absorbs completely after massaging the creamy textured stuff into my hands and elbows, and I don&#x27;t have to be troubled with a return of dry skin.</li>
            <li> After I wash my hands, I half to reapply.</li>
            <li> Even slightly ragged cuticles repair.  </li>
            <li> I no longer get the artificial nails, because mine grow and look better then the fake ones.</li>
            <li> Does not have a heavy greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent.</li>
            <li> This makes my cuticles super dry and has a terrible fragrance.</li>
            <li> I use gloves for almost everything, washing dishes, gardening, small outdoor tasks &amp;c</li>
            <li> AT LEAST TWICE A DAY</li>
            <li> Disappointed, I usually like OPI products</li>
            <li> I bought it after I stopped getting artificial nails....</li>
            <li> I am highly disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed OPI lovers!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> All the ladies in my family are using this and loving the effectiveness.  Would be nice if it was available in the normal retail market</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. Really does make your hands feel soft. Thank you</li>
            <li> I use this on my hands in the morning, after gardening, and before bed.  It works nicely and smells great. I use it along with the OPI Avoplex replenishing oil.  My nails are a lot better since I started using these products.</li>
            <li> My favorite hand lotion.</li>
            <li> This product is heavenly!!!! I have very dry hands and cuticles and it feels so good on my hands! I keep 1 in my purse, 1 on my kitchen sink &amp; 1 on my nightstand! Not greasy at all.   A bit pricey but worth it.   Try it and you&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
            <li> My favorite hand cream for years. I use it every night on hands, and elbows right before I go to bed (as well as occasionally during the day). The fragrance is lovely and my nails have never been stronger! I love this hand cream!</li>
            <li> Smell good my hands are soft now</li>
            <li> Great hand cream, Great price!</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. It&#x27;s not a super-thick and creamy lotion, but it&#x27;s not too watery either, just right for a day lotion. It absorbs pretty quickly and leaves a nice, light, pleasant scent. I use this in conjunction with the Avoplex Cuticle Oil. Great price, too!</li>
            <li> Awesome! Great. Fabulous outstanding fun smooth smells.great. healed cracked handbags nourished nails daughter loves it will other again as soon as needed</li>
            <li> I had used opi products before and liked them-but this is not what I had expected it to be-didn&#x27;t do a thing for my hands or nails as it stated</li>
            <li> It smells awesome too. I Love this stuff for my hands. I use gloves for almost everything, washing dishes, gardening, small outdoor tasks &amp;c but as you get older your hands get dry anyway. Another petite luxury of mine. I wish it lasted longer or was around $5</li>
            <li> Not excessively perfume-y.  Seems to work well for mooisturising and preventing hang nails and split cuticles.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product to keep your hands and nails hydrated.i see a big difference in my nails if I don&#x27;t use this product.  I always recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have not tried it yet I am trying to finish my other cream first. I think it will be thick enough.</li>
            <li> Very moisturize and smells good</li>
            <li> Excellent hand &amp; nail cream. I had ordered 2 tubes, so I plan to keep a spare all the times now.</li>
            <li> This is the richest and most luxurious hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used. A tiny bit of it goes a long way. At first it feels quite wet and slippery, and then within a few seconds of spreading it over my hands (and elbows) it soaks in and leave my skin feeling soft and not a bit greasy -- kinda like Ultrasuede. The fragrance is fairly strong, but it&#x27;s one I like, and it doesn&#x27;t last long in any case. I&#x27;ve used it for only a few weeks, and can see a huge improvement in my hands.</li>
            <li> I have tubes of this stuff in every purse, at work, at home, etc.  Love it because it absorbs super quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  It does have a scent to it, but it dissipates pretty quickly and isn&#x27;t anything offensive.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any benefit to my cuticles, even though it says &amp;#34;hand and nail cream.&amp;#34;  Still use solar oil at night for those.</li>
            <li> i was diappointed because i thought it would keep my hands moist for a longer period of time, but the avon lotion i already had work better.</li>
            <li> I handle a lot of paper day in and day out on my job which can be drying to your hands and cuticles.  This hand and nail cream helps to keep them very hydrated and supple. After using regularly for about a week my cuticles were no longer dry and splitting.  I keep one tube in my desk drawer and one on my night stand.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands a lot for my job and my hands are so dry this has been my saving grace! I love it</li>
            <li> Great product! I love it!!!  The scent is very nice and it works great!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream I have ever used and I highly recommend it for anyone&lt;br /&gt;searching for a well made product.  OPI is the best in hand care.</li>
            <li> This product is ok, ,  not much help to my nail after 2 weeks of using it. Just regular hand Cream.  Vaseline hand &amp; nail cream is better.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It keeps your hands soft and moist and smells wonderful.  Would definitely recommend this product to all.</li>
            <li> The lotion makes my hands feel good. After I wash my hands, I half to reapply. Has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It smells wonderful and leaves your hands soft. It doesn&#x27;t wash off and isn&#x27;t greasy. I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> Great hand cream. It doesn&#x27;t help cuticles much. But it made my hands very soft. Absorbs quick with no greasy feel. I actually used this on my feet one night and they were so baby soft in the morning it was amazing. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent. It is not over powering by any means but it seems like a smell for older women, I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Couldn&#x27;t live without it! It makes your hands soft and not greasy and it lasts!</li>
            <li> the hype online works better than the cream</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this hand cream at spa or studio markups, but it is a heavenly treat and treatment for my dry hands when I can get it on Amazon at bargain prices. I will buy this again and again--it absorbs completely after massaging the creamy textured stuff into my hands and elbows, and I don&#x27;t have to be troubled with a return of dry skin. It does have added fragrance, which it would be more therapeutic without, but I must admit I love the smell, so I can&#x27;t downgrade it for that. I will be buying this again, and in multiples to have around the house and in my purse.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  It melts right into my skin in seconds, leaving my skin feeling supple and soothed for hours at a time.  A word of warning to others, just in case: This really, really does absorb into the nails, even if you&#x27;re wearing polish.  I keep my nails constantly polished, and though my standard is to wipe the nail down with an alcohol pad to clean them, even applying this lotion a day or so after a fresh manicure the polish will peel up after a short time.  This isn&#x27;t normal for me, and has only happened when I&#x27;ve used the lotion, but I figured I should make mention.  It isn&#x27;t an issue for me since it just encourages me to change my colour more often, but for others it might be a problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this in conjunction with the Opi Nail and cuticle replenishing cream and the Opi Nail envy original on the advice of a friend who had had the samae problem as me....dry, flaky nails, and rough cuticles.  I use my hands a lot and eal with knitting yarn, fabric and gardening on an alomost daily basis and it was really taking a toll oin my nails.  I have been using this prodict for about 3 weeks and my hands are much better looking now and feel very soft.  It does take a while to rub the cream in well, if you don&#x27;t your hands feel quite greasy.  Ij ust rub lots in and then use a towel to remove any excess.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! Works really good but a little expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> Love the feel but wish the scent was a little less strong. It doesn&#x27;t really, REALLY heal skin like some other heavy duty creams (I suffer from dry hands) but it&#x27;s a very nice lotion for maintenance. I do feel that it has nail strengthening properties and my cuticles definitely improved! OPI makes quality products and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> Very good hand cream, especially for winter and dry chapped hands.</li>
            <li> It was not what i was expected. i was looking for more silky feels after i use. but cream it&#x27;s self is good. it&#x27;s didn&#x27;t meet my expectation.</li>
            <li> the composition is great, the absorption and the smell also..&lt;br /&gt;immediatly after the application my hands feel wayyy more confortable! yet i cannot say that their visual aspect improved&lt;br /&gt;i like the composition.. i&#x27;ll probably try another more chemical cream and if not concluent will come back to that one</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely fantastic! It smells great, rubs in great, and works great! It is perfect for dry hands, and isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky on your skin. Honestly, my husband uses it just as often as I do. The bottle lives on our coffee table, because there&#x27;s just no sense in putting it away. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This lotion is very moisturizing &amp; doesn&#x27;t smell girly. My husband uses it as his hands tend to dry out easily from playing the guitar. He has tried many, but this one absorbs into his skin easily without being greasy or smelling like a flower.</li>
            <li> This bottle was much cheaper and bigger than the ones offered at the nail salon. I love this product! I even use it on my feet!</li>
            <li> Nice cream for the hands, but not something that is unique.  You can get similar quality from other moisturizers.  I would still recommend</li>
            <li> I like the other OPI lotions better, I like the pump dispenser on the other ones.  This lotion is fine, but I don&#x27;t think it worked any miracles on my winter dried hands.</li>
            <li> During the winter months, we are always searching for a hand cream that really works.  This is our first time to use Avoplex by OPI and we are very impressed.  The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming, the hand cream is not oily and after several weeks of use, we are very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is best smelling hand &amp; nail cream with the best effect I ever knew. I will always recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am a gardener with very dry hands and cuticles. When I apply this fantastic lotion at night, my hands look ten years younger in the morning.  Even slightly ragged cuticles repair.  I&#x27;ve used many others. This is far and away the best hand lotion I have ever used.  Pricey but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This product leaves you hands moisturized and feeling good -and it doesn&#x27;t leave them feeling greasy. The product really helps my dry nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li> Really works! It comes in a OPI box and is sealed. Smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue on your hands. Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> The best hand care product ever!!  What a find.  Thank you so much for carrying this product.  I have used it for at least one year and it provides the best results for a product of this type.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing! You will not be disappointed OPI lovers! Bought this for my daughters birthday she is going to love me!</li>
            <li> I am a nurse and am constantly washing my hands. I keep the smaller sized tube in my scrubs and the larger one in my bag my hands are unbelievably soft since I started using OPI Avoplex.&lt;br /&gt;I also use the OPI Avoplex cuticle oil, which I also highly recommend</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I bought it after I stopped getting artificial nails....and my damaged nail grew out quicker, healthier, thicker then in my entire life. I no longer get the artificial nails, because mine grow and look better then the fake ones.</li>
            <li> A manicurist introduced me to it and I&#x27;ve used ever since. My husband has very dry hands and after trying several things this was the only thing that worked</li>
            <li> I wash my hands constantly at work and this has healed my chronic hangnails!</li>
            <li> We live in the southwest and the weather is dry and windy.  This hand and nail cream is a live saver. It&#x27;s soft and emollient and&lt;br /&gt;is not sticky or greasy.  Great Stuff.</li>
            <li> Best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used. Repairs dry,rough and calloused skin rapidly. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hands oily.</li>
            <li> moisturizes well and smells good</li>
            <li> I use this hand cream in conjunction with the cuticle exfoliator and cuticle oil all work well in maintaining my quick growing cuticles keeping my hands and nails well groomed in between manicures.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Great and absorbs quickly so your hands are not greasy, leaves your hands super soft!</li>
            <li> Great for your hands! Really softens them while not being thick and greasy!! Absorbs fast!! Will never be without !!</li>
            <li> My favorite hand lotion! I keep one in my purse, one at my office, one by my bedside, and one in my car. Does not have a heavy greasy feeling. Has a nice fragrance. Even my boyfriend likes using it. Hands become soft instantaneously.</li>
            <li> I bought this in combination with a cuticle pen based on reviews. I am highly disappointed with this product. This makes my cuticles super dry and has a terrible fragrance. Do not try this.</li>
            <li> leaves my hands feeling soft and hydrated throughout the day, love it!</li>
            <li> This really soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave hands feeling sticky.  Use this in combination of the OPI oil and they will work miracles!</li>
            <li> SEEMS TO WORK BETTER THAN BODY LOTION ON MY HANDS. DOES NOT LIGHTEN DARK SPOTS. NEEDS TO BE USED AT LEAST TWICE A DAY</li>
            <li> Disappointed, I usually like OPI products&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten better results from Almond oil or Aveeda products&lt;br /&gt;would not order again</li>
            <li> keeps my hands feeling smooth</li>
