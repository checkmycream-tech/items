    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I must say I&#x27;m impressed with its performance.  </li>
            <li>I frankly pay a lot to get the best shave I can get.  </li>
            <li>While still a bit bulky, it provided the best combination for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, I believe the Hydro 3 has the best combination of features for me.  </li>
            <li>The Hydro 3 is a bit clunky, but the combination of long-lasting lubrication and blades was the best I&#x27;ve come</li>
            <li>If the lubricant lasted just a bit longer, this would be a perfect product.</li>
            <li>Even with my Norelco as backup, the Schick Hydor 3 has delivered the best results ever, shave after shave.  </li>
            <li>I get the best results with a Schick Injector with Personna blades.</li>
            <li>I have been very happy with them.  </li>
            <li>The best part about this blade?</li>
            <li>This is an Excellent product by Schick!!!</li>
            <li>I bought it for great price!!</li>
            <li>and I think the Schick Hydro 3 is almost perfect.  </li>
            <li>No need to use 5 blades when 3 can do the job perfectly !!</li>
            <li>This is the best razor blade system I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>Great inexpensive blades.</li>
            <li>great price for blades.</li>
            <li>Great product..</li>
            <li>is a swell guy, and spoke great French).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are great to travel with.</li>
            <li>I am very happy and satisfied with this order/product.</li>
            <li>Perhaps not quite as good as my 5-blade Fusion, but comparable.  </li>
            <li>I also found the blades to be fairly long-lasting and held up well given the task it was given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a good shave and each razor gives me about a week of shaves.  </li>
            <li>These razor blades are vey good.</li>
            <li>Found these to be surprisingly good.  </li>
            <li>Buying them on Amazon was a good way to save some money.</li>
            <li>good deal</li>
            <li>Good value for price paid with Amazon gift card.</li>
            <li>2 or 3 blades seems to be a good balance in my experience.</li>
            <li>Great product at a much better price than brick-and-mortar stores.</li>
            <li>When I first used it, I was amazed: it was the best shave I ever had.  </li>
            <li>So despite the gender assignment, it really doesn&#x27;t matter who you are, this is a great blade!</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I never feel the blades against my face...ever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I&#x27;m fairly manly and need something strong, and the Schick Hydro 3 Blade won&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m tempted to quit looking for perfection and except what is a very, very good shave in exchange for the most comfortable and irritation free shave</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m tempted to quit looking for perfection and except what is a very, very good shave in exchange for the most comfortable and irritation free shave</li>
            <li>The hydro is by far the best product that has been put into the razor market int</li>
            <li>Again: So far the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s that the Schick blades are sharper, the skin guard more effective, or the embedded gel working better that leads to it</li>
            <li>This purchase was a great deal and a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>If it were only better at catching all the beard I&#x27;d convert completely.&lt;br /&gt;Overall an excellent razor and blade</li>
            <li>If it were only better at catching all the beard I&#x27;d convert completely.&lt;br /&gt;Overall an excellent razor and blade</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The Fusion Glide:  Best overall shave and comfort, but the duration of the lubricating strip</li>
            <li>others have suggestions for a better razor, please let me know.</li>
            <li>With this being said, on the Schick Hydro Package, there is a statement that states that it shaves better than a Mach 3</li>
            <li>See my review for the system for more detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better value than the Gillette.</li>
            <li>They stopped selling sensor blades and fusion has too many blades for me.</li>
            <li>These blades are cheaper and better than Mach3.</li>
            <li>I am getting twice as many shaves as Mach3.</li>
            <li>Better than the Hydro 5, wish we would stop the shaving blade arms race.</li>
            <li>but Schick is better Hydro 5 are better</li>
            <li>but I like a Double razor best.</li>
            <li>This is a significantly better razor than the Hydro 5.</li>
            <li>Also the razor tugs more than it has to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient and it&#x27;s one more thing</li>
            <li>A sure bet.</li>
            <li>Subscribe and save for even more savings - with my Prime membership no shipping cost either.</li>
            <li>Saves me more than $4 per order.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll have to work for it and that&#x27;ll use up more of the gel released by the cartridge.</li>
            <li>then you&#x27;ll love this razor.</li>
            <li>In short, this gives me the best shave out of any blade I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>why do I need more words klkllkkl ;lkkl; lkk;l ; lkklk ;k;k  ; ;k ;k  ;k ;k ;</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s some combination of the three), but the hydro 3 glides effortlessly</li>
            <li>Therefore are s much better value in the end.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these blades for several years and Amazon seems to offer the best deal.</li>
            <li>It give a very clean shave.  </li>
            <li>After several shaves, the lubricant was gone, but using Edge I found that the shave was still very good.  </li>
            <li>It delivers a smooth shave for about a week, which is pretty good for a cartridge.</li>
            <li>the most comfortable shave</li>
            <li>the most comfortable shave</li>
            <li>/&gt;...and another star - because it&#x27;s a great value for someone with very light facial hair, and who develops a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow in a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT IS TRUE!</li>
            <li>Once the lubricant has been depleted, you need to replace the blade very quickly.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t seem to trim around my lips and mustache as easily.</li>
            <li>First, the lubrication it provides is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It uses ONE blade and it is extremely comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have been pleased overall and compared to some other good razors I have had, I like this one the best.</li>
            <li>It will power through your stubble and give you a mighty fine shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about every razor and blade on the market, and these so far are the best as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>All of that being stated, when you combine the greater degree of comfort and the more economical cost, it is definitely worth switching to this brand.  </li>
            <li>I use mine primarily when I&#x27;m traveling:  I take along a cheap disposable razor for the purpose of shaving below my nose.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it shave great</li>
            <li>/&gt;Executive summary is that the goo is redundant market differentiator and the blades are excellent.</li>
            <li>Its a smooth close shave</li>
            <li>Back to the Schick Hydro 3 refills, these are great</li>
            <li>Overall a great razor.  </li>
            <li>If you reverse shave and go for a smooth look, you&#x27;ll literally shave years off your face.</li>
            <li>These razors give me a smooth shave without razor burn</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite razor but at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It is VERY rare these days that I take time to write a review about a product.</li>
            <li>The womenfolk at work will complement you for your clean cut look, and management will enjoy putting you in a client-facing role.</li>
            <li>Hands down this is the best razor on the market right now.</li>
            <li>star - because of Amazon&#x27;s and Schick&#x27;s commitment to professionalism, quality craftsmanship at an accessible price</li>
            <li>The razors didn&#x27;t come in the original packaging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given up on looking clean cut</li>
            <li>Super smooth shave</li>
            <li>hey..... what can be said about only the most amazing blade refill offer for a 3-blade system in a \\&quot;4-count (pack of 2)\\&quot; ever created?</li>
            <li>and it is the exact same great product.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m at the point where good enough is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had picked up one of the razors in our local grocery store as it was a good price</li>
            <li>In this case, I needed some refills and could not find them locally--- Amazon had them and the price was fair.</li>
            <li>cause you to get cuts, and wear out fast causing you to have to buy more blades.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for that:)  As of today I&#x27;m on day 7 shaving with the blade that came with my razor</li>
            <li>I use a Trac II most of the time because it gives me the closest shave and leaves me with a BBS face without much touch-up at all if ever.</li>
            <li>I use a Trac II most of the time because it gives me the closest shave and leaves me with a BBS face without much touch-up at all if ever.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this good a deal at any store locally.</li>
            <li>My favorite blades by far!!!  </li>
            <li>and I did a quick search and gave it a try.</li>
            <li>Just used these for the first time- incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li>and I can say that this 7th shave was a close and comfortable as the first one.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what we expected &amp; great price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been on a campaign now for a year trying to find a razor and blades that are cost effective, long lasting, do a good job without causing razor burn</li>
            <li>These blades last for a very long time, so indeed, a great value for money!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice little marketing ploy to sell more blades.     </li>
            <li>I gladly retired my old Mach3 Turbo.   </li>
            <li>and I rarely ever nick myself.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny and a lot cheaper than mach and even hydro 5.</li>
            <li>That being said, I feel like the 3 blades are better for those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>They last a decent amount of time and give a really good shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different shavers but the hydro 3 is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Even with a good shave - regardless of razor, my face looks like I typically need to shave (the perpetual 5 o&#x27;clock shadow).  </li>
            <li>I would suspect normal hairiness humans would be fine with the lubricating strip and last more than one shave, but in my case, not so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have grown to like these blades very much.  </li>
            <li>This blade shaves closer and more comfortably than any other I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This is the first Schick branded razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;s my overall assessment on the many razors I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I suspect for most folks, their razor can last 2, 3, or 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>I absolutely know without a doubt you will agree!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind changing your blade frequently, you will be rewarded with a fantastic shave.</li>
            <li>I like shick better than fusion both work the same to me</li>
            <li>It seems pretty well built.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>The only downside of this razor has to do with the \\&quot;hydro\\&quot; strip on the top of the blade.  </li>
            <li>They seem to last longer than most blades.</li>
            <li>The blades arrived when scheduled and were exactly what I wanted and ordered.  </li>
            <li>works very well!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Simply put, this is the first cartridge razor blade I&#x27;ve ever used where I didn&#x27;t feel like I was having to settle in any aspect of performance.  </li>
            <li>These are hands down the most comfortable razors I have every used.</li>
            <li>great blades, work well, not as close as the 5 blade systems, but far less money</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut myself there more than I want to remember -- they are simply too large.  </li>
            <li>We could only find it at CVS, but now that it is available on Amazon in a two-pack, it is convenient and economical.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because the more blades you put on a razor, the more drag it creates on your skin, so it needs the lube that is applied above the blades.</li>
            <li>If minor areas of missed beard doesn&#x27;t bother you or matters in your employment then you&#x27;ll love this razor.</li>
            <li>So, they are pretty economical as well, as of the last time I bought them on subscribe and save, it ended up being about 1.25/week... not bad.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting, very smooth, comfortable on legs and under arms.  </li>
            <li>Work well and get pretty decent number of days from them.</li>
            <li>Getting the moisturizing first, before the blades hit, instead of after is obviously right right way to do it -- it&#x27;s hard to believe that most blades reverse the setup.</li>
            <li>Really felt like a never-ending lubricating strip (i jest a bit), but the whole shaving piece was a monster in size.  </li>
            <li>I started with a safety razor, which is a real oxymoron.  </li>
            <li>The moisturizing strip is in front of the blade path and not behind it.</li>
            <li>blades arrived a day earlier than promised and were well packaged, secure.</li>
            <li>Works very well and the price is very competitive.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and these razors do not cut my skin and am sure you would feel the same way too.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the new 4- and 5-blade razors very much.</li>
            <li>now I would even say it shaves better than any razor in any other company&#x27;s arsenal, period.</li>
            <li>I like these blades better than any other razor I have used.</li>
            <li>They work much better than other 3 and 5 blade razors.</li>
            <li>These &amp;#34;Hydro 3&amp;#34; are even better than other Schick 3 blade razors.  </li>
            <li>Other brands have given me a cut or more.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s better than any other 3,4 or 5 blade</li>
            <li>a professional with a very good career and need to look professional - suit and tie is not uncommon.  </li>
            <li>A five blade razor is too dense for head shaving, but a three blade is perfect and very difficult to find anymore.</li>
            <li>Unless your boss is a woman who likes men with facial hair (or if it&#x27;s acceptable in your work place to have lumberjack face), you don&#x27;t want to go into the work looking like a Tunisian cab driver (full disclaimer - the Tunisian cabbie who ferried us from the office Christmas party at Yoshis</li>
            <li>In addition to the smooth shave, it has never cut me and lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>They could have been very old and I ended up getting a rash all over my legs and had to throw the rest away!</li>
            <li>With a full face and neck medium/heavy beard I can get about 2.5 - 3 weeks of shaves out of one blade which brings the cost per shave down to about 0.30 cents per shave.&lt;br /&gt;Never any razor burn or irritation that causes break-outs and pretty much as close a shave as I can expect.</li>
            <li>I have found these blades to be just as good as the more expensive ones from other companies.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this product, because when new, the shave is unparallelled.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll also mention that my fiancee uses the same set-up as me (different blade ofcourse) and it works fabulously for her.  </li>
            <li>The lubrication strips work better than I&#x27;ve seen in the past.  </li>
            <li>The price was good, a little less than stores.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hydro 5 was a whole different breed.  </li>
            <li>I have a sensitive face, so I decided to go with the 3 blade instead of the 5.  </li>
            <li>and when I&#x27;m done shaving I don&#x27;t feel like I just dragged bits of steel across my face, and buying them from amazon is so much cheaper than my local box store.</li>
            <li>Works well with the Nivea for Men Sensitive Skin Shave Cream.</li>
            <li>Harder to find in stores but worth it.  </li>
            <li>I had a good initial shave, after that, the lubricating strip wore out for me and it was all downhill from there - land of the uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it shaved really close for about a week, and it smeared the weird \\&quot;lubrication\\&quot; all over my skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and my beard comes in thick, making for a tricky combination to manage; up until discovering these I had found the Mach 3 to be the best I&#x27;d found, and while not flawless, they had done their job well enough.  </li>
            <li>The Fusion has a separate single blade on the reverse side of the cartridge for that very purpose.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter how slow or how attentive I am</li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re comfortable, they last longer than the competition, and if you purchase on Amazon you&#x27;ll save a bunch of hard cash.  </li>
            <li>Not a single drop of blood has been lost since I began using this razor.</li>
            <li>If Schick improved the form factor by making the razor more similar to a disposable razor like the Schick Xtreme 3, then it would be easier to navigate around tight corners and get into tight spaces.</li>
            <li>So much more convenient to buy online than in the store where they have to be kept behind lock and key!</li>
            <li>Zero irritation and my tough stubble is cut easily.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t miss the hard to reach or tight fitting areas either, like just under your nostrils.</li>
            <li>The blades are very sharp, so only one swipe is needed over each area of my face, and the blades last much longer than any disposables I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>It took me a while to discover that leaving the razors in the shower (and thus being exposed to high moisture levels for long periods of time) not only caused the blades to dull much faster, but also ruined the gel in the head of the razor.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I must say I&#x27;m impressed with its performance.  </li>
            <li> I frankly pay a lot to get the best shave I can get.  </li>
            <li> While still a bit bulky, it provided the best combination for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, I believe the Hydro 3 has the best combination of features for me.  </li>
            <li> The Hydro 3 is a bit clunky, but the combination of long-lasting lubrication and blades was the best I&#x27;ve come</li>
            <li> If the lubricant lasted just a bit longer, this would be a perfect product.</li>
            <li> Even with my Norelco as backup, the Schick Hydor 3 has delivered the best results ever, shave after shave.  </li>
            <li> I get the best results with a Schick Injector with Personna blades.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with them.  </li>
            <li> The best part about this blade?</li>
            <li> This is an Excellent product by Schick!!!</li>
            <li> I bought it for great price!!</li>
            <li> and I think the Schick Hydro 3 is almost perfect.  </li>
            <li> No need to use 5 blades when 3 can do the job perfectly !!</li>
            <li> This is the best razor blade system I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive blades.</li>
            <li> great price for blades.</li>
            <li> Great product..</li>
            <li> is a swell guy, and spoke great French).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are great to travel with.</li>
            <li> I am very happy and satisfied with this order/product.</li>
            <li> Perhaps not quite as good as my 5-blade Fusion, but comparable.  </li>
            <li> I also found the blades to be fairly long-lasting and held up well given the task it was given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a good shave and each razor gives me about a week of shaves.  </li>
            <li> These razor blades are vey good.</li>
            <li> Found these to be surprisingly good.  </li>
            <li> Buying them on Amazon was a good way to save some money.</li>
            <li> good deal</li>
            <li> Good value for price paid with Amazon gift card.</li>
            <li> 2 or 3 blades seems to be a good balance in my experience.</li>
            <li> Great product at a much better price than brick-and-mortar stores.</li>
            <li> When I first used it, I was amazed: it was the best shave I ever had.  </li>
            <li> So despite the gender assignment, it really doesn&#x27;t matter who you are, this is a great blade!</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I never feel the blades against my face...ever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I&#x27;m fairly manly and need something strong, and the Schick Hydro 3 Blade won&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m tempted to quit looking for perfection and except what is a very, very good shave in exchange for the most comfortable and irritation free shave</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m tempted to quit looking for perfection and except what is a very, very good shave in exchange for the most comfortable and irritation free shave</li>
            <li> The hydro is by far the best product that has been put into the razor market int</li>
            <li> Again: So far the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s that the Schick blades are sharper, the skin guard more effective, or the embedded gel working better that leads to it</li>
            <li> This purchase was a great deal and a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> If it were only better at catching all the beard I&#x27;d convert completely.&lt;br /&gt;Overall an excellent razor and blade</li>
            <li> If it were only better at catching all the beard I&#x27;d convert completely.&lt;br /&gt;Overall an excellent razor and blade</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The Fusion Glide:  Best overall shave and comfort, but the duration of the lubricating strip</li>
            <li> others have suggestions for a better razor, please let me know.</li>
            <li> With this being said, on the Schick Hydro Package, there is a statement that states that it shaves better than a Mach 3</li>
            <li> See my review for the system for more detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better value than the Gillette.</li>
            <li> They stopped selling sensor blades and fusion has too many blades for me.</li>
            <li> These blades are cheaper and better than Mach3.</li>
            <li> I am getting twice as many shaves as Mach3.</li>
            <li> Better than the Hydro 5, wish we would stop the shaving blade arms race.</li>
            <li> but Schick is better Hydro 5 are better</li>
            <li> but I like a Double razor best.</li>
            <li> This is a significantly better razor than the Hydro 5.</li>
            <li> Also the razor tugs more than it has to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient and it&#x27;s one more thing</li>
            <li> A sure bet.</li>
            <li> Subscribe and save for even more savings - with my Prime membership no shipping cost either.</li>
            <li> Saves me more than $4 per order.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll have to work for it and that&#x27;ll use up more of the gel released by the cartridge.</li>
            <li> then you&#x27;ll love this razor.</li>
            <li> In short, this gives me the best shave out of any blade I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> why do I need more words klkllkkl ;lkkl; lkk;l ; lkklk ;k;k  ; ;k ;k  ;k ;k ;</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s some combination of the three), but the hydro 3 glides effortlessly</li>
            <li> Therefore are s much better value in the end.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades for several years and Amazon seems to offer the best deal.</li>
            <li> It give a very clean shave.  </li>
            <li> After several shaves, the lubricant was gone, but using Edge I found that the shave was still very good.  </li>
            <li> It delivers a smooth shave for about a week, which is pretty good for a cartridge.</li>
            <li> the most comfortable shave</li>
            <li> the most comfortable shave</li>
            <li> /&gt;...and another star - because it&#x27;s a great value for someone with very light facial hair, and who develops a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow in a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> IT IS TRUE!</li>
            <li> Once the lubricant has been depleted, you need to replace the blade very quickly.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t seem to trim around my lips and mustache as easily.</li>
            <li> First, the lubrication it provides is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It uses ONE blade and it is extremely comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have been pleased overall and compared to some other good razors I have had, I like this one the best.</li>
            <li> It will power through your stubble and give you a mighty fine shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every razor and blade on the market, and these so far are the best as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> All of that being stated, when you combine the greater degree of comfort and the more economical cost, it is definitely worth switching to this brand.  </li>
            <li> I use mine primarily when I&#x27;m traveling:  I take along a cheap disposable razor for the purpose of shaving below my nose.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it shave great</li>
            <li> /&gt;Executive summary is that the goo is redundant market differentiator and the blades are excellent.</li>
            <li> Its a smooth close shave</li>
            <li> Back to the Schick Hydro 3 refills, these are great</li>
            <li> Overall a great razor.  </li>
            <li> If you reverse shave and go for a smooth look, you&#x27;ll literally shave years off your face.</li>
            <li> These razors give me a smooth shave without razor burn</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite razor but at a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It is VERY rare these days that I take time to write a review about a product.</li>
            <li> The womenfolk at work will complement you for your clean cut look, and management will enjoy putting you in a client-facing role.</li>
            <li> Hands down this is the best razor on the market right now.</li>
            <li> star - because of Amazon&#x27;s and Schick&#x27;s commitment to professionalism, quality craftsmanship at an accessible price</li>
            <li> The razors didn&#x27;t come in the original packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given up on looking clean cut</li>
            <li> Super smooth shave</li>
            <li> hey..... what can be said about only the most amazing blade refill offer for a 3-blade system in a \\&quot;4-count (pack of 2)\\&quot; ever created?</li>
            <li> and it is the exact same great product.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m at the point where good enough is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had picked up one of the razors in our local grocery store as it was a good price</li>
            <li> In this case, I needed some refills and could not find them locally--- Amazon had them and the price was fair.</li>
            <li> cause you to get cuts, and wear out fast causing you to have to buy more blades.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for that:)  As of today I&#x27;m on day 7 shaving with the blade that came with my razor</li>
            <li> I use a Trac II most of the time because it gives me the closest shave and leaves me with a BBS face without much touch-up at all if ever.</li>
            <li> I use a Trac II most of the time because it gives me the closest shave and leaves me with a BBS face without much touch-up at all if ever.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this good a deal at any store locally.</li>
            <li> My favorite blades by far!!!  </li>
            <li> and I did a quick search and gave it a try.</li>
            <li> Just used these for the first time- incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li> and I can say that this 7th shave was a close and comfortable as the first one.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what we expected &amp; great price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on a campaign now for a year trying to find a razor and blades that are cost effective, long lasting, do a good job without causing razor burn</li>
            <li> These blades last for a very long time, so indeed, a great value for money!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice little marketing ploy to sell more blades.     </li>
            <li> I gladly retired my old Mach3 Turbo.   </li>
            <li> and I rarely ever nick myself.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny and a lot cheaper than mach and even hydro 5.</li>
            <li> That being said, I feel like the 3 blades are better for those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> They last a decent amount of time and give a really good shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different shavers but the hydro 3 is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Even with a good shave - regardless of razor, my face looks like I typically need to shave (the perpetual 5 o&#x27;clock shadow).  </li>
            <li> I would suspect normal hairiness humans would be fine with the lubricating strip and last more than one shave, but in my case, not so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have grown to like these blades very much.  </li>
            <li> This blade shaves closer and more comfortably than any other I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This is the first Schick branded razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s my overall assessment on the many razors I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I suspect for most folks, their razor can last 2, 3, or 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Really!</li>
            <li> I absolutely know without a doubt you will agree!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind changing your blade frequently, you will be rewarded with a fantastic shave.</li>
            <li> I like shick better than fusion both work the same to me</li>
            <li> It seems pretty well built.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> The only downside of this razor has to do with the \\&quot;hydro\\&quot; strip on the top of the blade.  </li>
            <li> They seem to last longer than most blades.</li>
            <li> The blades arrived when scheduled and were exactly what I wanted and ordered.  </li>
            <li> works very well!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Simply put, this is the first cartridge razor blade I&#x27;ve ever used where I didn&#x27;t feel like I was having to settle in any aspect of performance.  </li>
            <li> These are hands down the most comfortable razors I have every used.</li>
            <li> great blades, work well, not as close as the 5 blade systems, but far less money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut myself there more than I want to remember -- they are simply too large.  </li>
            <li> We could only find it at CVS, but now that it is available on Amazon in a two-pack, it is convenient and economical.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s because the more blades you put on a razor, the more drag it creates on your skin, so it needs the lube that is applied above the blades.</li>
            <li> If minor areas of missed beard doesn&#x27;t bother you or matters in your employment then you&#x27;ll love this razor.</li>
            <li> So, they are pretty economical as well, as of the last time I bought them on subscribe and save, it ended up being about 1.25/week... not bad.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting, very smooth, comfortable on legs and under arms.  </li>
            <li> Work well and get pretty decent number of days from them.</li>
            <li> Getting the moisturizing first, before the blades hit, instead of after is obviously right right way to do it -- it&#x27;s hard to believe that most blades reverse the setup.</li>
            <li> Really felt like a never-ending lubricating strip (i jest a bit), but the whole shaving piece was a monster in size.  </li>
            <li> I started with a safety razor, which is a real oxymoron.  </li>
            <li> The moisturizing strip is in front of the blade path and not behind it.</li>
            <li> blades arrived a day earlier than promised and were well packaged, secure.</li>
            <li> Works very well and the price is very competitive.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and these razors do not cut my skin and am sure you would feel the same way too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the new 4- and 5-blade razors very much.</li>
            <li> now I would even say it shaves better than any razor in any other company&#x27;s arsenal, period.</li>
            <li> I like these blades better than any other razor I have used.</li>
            <li> They work much better than other 3 and 5 blade razors.</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;Hydro 3&amp;#34; are even better than other Schick 3 blade razors.  </li>
            <li> Other brands have given me a cut or more.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s better than any other 3,4 or 5 blade</li>
            <li> a professional with a very good career and need to look professional - suit and tie is not uncommon.  </li>
            <li> A five blade razor is too dense for head shaving, but a three blade is perfect and very difficult to find anymore.</li>
            <li> Unless your boss is a woman who likes men with facial hair (or if it&#x27;s acceptable in your work place to have lumberjack face), you don&#x27;t want to go into the work looking like a Tunisian cab driver (full disclaimer - the Tunisian cabbie who ferried us from the office Christmas party at Yoshis</li>
            <li> In addition to the smooth shave, it has never cut me and lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> They could have been very old and I ended up getting a rash all over my legs and had to throw the rest away!</li>
            <li> With a full face and neck medium/heavy beard I can get about 2.5 - 3 weeks of shaves out of one blade which brings the cost per shave down to about 0.30 cents per shave.&lt;br /&gt;Never any razor burn or irritation that causes break-outs and pretty much as close a shave as I can expect.</li>
            <li> I have found these blades to be just as good as the more expensive ones from other companies.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product, because when new, the shave is unparallelled.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll also mention that my fiancee uses the same set-up as me (different blade ofcourse) and it works fabulously for her.  </li>
            <li> The lubrication strips work better than I&#x27;ve seen in the past.  </li>
            <li> The price was good, a little less than stores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hydro 5 was a whole different breed.  </li>
            <li> I have a sensitive face, so I decided to go with the 3 blade instead of the 5.  </li>
            <li> and when I&#x27;m done shaving I don&#x27;t feel like I just dragged bits of steel across my face, and buying them from amazon is so much cheaper than my local box store.</li>
            <li> Works well with the Nivea for Men Sensitive Skin Shave Cream.</li>
            <li> Harder to find in stores but worth it.  </li>
            <li> I had a good initial shave, after that, the lubricating strip wore out for me and it was all downhill from there - land of the uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it shaved really close for about a week, and it smeared the weird \\&quot;lubrication\\&quot; all over my skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and my beard comes in thick, making for a tricky combination to manage; up until discovering these I had found the Mach 3 to be the best I&#x27;d found, and while not flawless, they had done their job well enough.  </li>
            <li> The Fusion has a separate single blade on the reverse side of the cartridge for that very purpose.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter how slow or how attentive I am</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re comfortable, they last longer than the competition, and if you purchase on Amazon you&#x27;ll save a bunch of hard cash.  </li>
            <li> Not a single drop of blood has been lost since I began using this razor.</li>
            <li> If Schick improved the form factor by making the razor more similar to a disposable razor like the Schick Xtreme 3, then it would be easier to navigate around tight corners and get into tight spaces.</li>
            <li> So much more convenient to buy online than in the store where they have to be kept behind lock and key!</li>
            <li> Zero irritation and my tough stubble is cut easily.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t miss the hard to reach or tight fitting areas either, like just under your nostrils.</li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp, so only one swipe is needed over each area of my face, and the blades last much longer than any disposables I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> It took me a while to discover that leaving the razors in the shower (and thus being exposed to high moisture levels for long periods of time) not only caused the blades to dull much faster, but also ruined the gel in the head of the razor.</li>
            <li> : At this price it&#x27;s the equivilant of paying %5.50 for a pack of 10 D/E blades since the Hydro 3 blades will last at least 2 if not 3 weeks...and the way the blades feel right now</li>
            <li> Three blades is enough for a close shave, and the lubricating strips make getting past the tougher parts of the face much easier.  </li>
            <li> does the job equally as well as 5 or 6 blade model, next step is single blade, the need for all these blades is justa bunch of hype.</li>
            <li> It seems like Schick uses poor-quality steel; the blades simply don&#x27;t last long.     </li>
            <li> pluses are it really is a very long lasting blade, and</li>
            <li> pluses are it really is a very long lasting blade, and</li>
            <li> Cuts have been marginalized, I only go through a razor once every two weeks or so, and my face doesn&#x27;t dry out</li>
            <li> The razors last a lot longer if you put them in a dry place as soon as you&#x27;re done with them.</li>
            <li> I find the lubricating strip long lasting...certainly long enough to get some well lubricated shaves.  </li>
            <li> Even the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; units that seem to buzz around my face with little effect as far as closeness.  </li>
            <li> I chose it because it had a hard plastic head cover that protects the blades very well.  </li>
            <li> Feel a little odd since the blade piece is so large, but it works...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how long that stuff lasts with me.  </li>
            <li> Previously a long time</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d tough it out, but my hubris turned into major league skin irritation and a decent amount of blood.   </li>
            <li> I give the razors four stars because the top of the razor head (where the gel is stored) makes it difficult to shave small, tight areas like my upper lip or my side burns near by ears.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But the other reviews were enough to convince me to try these.  </li>
            <li> The one problem (and it is a very minor one at that)is shaving the mustache area.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that it&#x27;s difficult to shave right under my nose with them, so I keep an old disposable around just to get that tiny spot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Second, the razor has a built in skin guard below the blades which dramatically reduce the amount of friction (and leads to less irritation).  </li>
            <li> I get a crazy amount of uses from it and will continue to use as long as they remain available.</li>
            <li> These shave as well as the Gillette equivalent (Mach Turbo), they cost less, and they last longer.</li>
            <li> I have a little plastic suction cup holder stuck to the outside of my shower.</li>
            <li> I personally did not enjoy the experience.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no pulling (with or against grain).</li>
            <li> Absolutely no irritation or razor burn at all.  </li>

            <li> I used to be 100% Gillette, but we were looking for ways to trim our budget. I had used a Schick when I was 15 but it was horrible. I decided to try the schick hydro 3 and it blows gillette fusion and mach 3 out of the water and is literally half the price!</li>
            <li> This is the first Schick branded razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  (I had previously been shaving with the Mach 3 Turbo.)  I must say I&#x27;m impressed with its performance.  It has the following pros: First, the lubrication it provides is amazing.  The water activated gel reservoir helps the razor glide effortlessly.  Second, the razor has a built in skin guard below the blades which dramatically reduce the amount of friction (and leads to less irritation).  Third, the cartridges last longer than any blade from the leading competitor.  Finally, these cartridges are less expensive than ones for Mach 3 Turbo and definitely less expensive than the Fusion replacement cartridges.  The one problem (and it is a very minor one at that)is shaving the mustache area.  Given the size of the cartridge, the upper part may be a little difficult at first, but with some practice this difficulty can be overcome (it took me about three days to adjust my shaving technique.)  All of that being stated, when you combine the greater degree of comfort and the more economical cost, it is definitely worth switching to this brand.  This comes from somebody who was exclusively a Gillette customer for 16 years.</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive blades. Helps keep the ingrown hairs to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than Mach 3.</li>
            <li> I bought the 3-blade Hydro when traveling.  I chose it because it had a hard plastic head cover that protects the blades very well.  I don&#x27;t think you get that cover any longer.  I also bought it because of their gimmick: built-in lubricant.  When I first used it, I was amazed: it was the best shave I ever had.  After several shaves, the lubricant was gone, but using Edge I found that the shave was still very good.  Perhaps not quite as good as my 5-blade Fusion, but comparable.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it is nearly impossible to shave the little strip of skin just below my nose.  The Fusion has a separate single blade on the reverse side of the cartridge for that very purpose.  I use mine primarily when I&#x27;m traveling:  I take along a cheap disposable razor for the purpose of shaving below my nose.  It will last a lifetime shaving that 0.5 sq. in. strip.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have a thick beard...really thick.  I shave once a day and even after my shave - typically in the morning, you can say I have the proverbial five o&#x27;clock shadow. My beard is THICK. Even with a good shave - regardless of razor, my face looks like I typically need to shave (the perpetual 5 o&#x27;clock shadow).  I&#x27;m 43 now, but probably started shaving in earnest at around 19 or 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a professional with a very good career and need to look professional - suit and tie is not uncommon.  I have tried a lot of different razors. I frankly pay a lot to get the best shave I can get.  I&#x27;ve given up on looking clean cut - I&#x27;m at the point where good enough is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my overall assessment on the many razors I&#x27;ve tried.  The Fusion Glide:  Best overall shave and comfort, but the duration of the lubricating strip left a lot to be desired...especially given the price.  It is one expensive razor and if money was not an object at all, this would likely be my razor of choice.  However, I have a really thick beard.  I had a good initial shave, after that, the lubricating strip wore out for me and it was all downhill from there - land of the uncomfortable.  I would suspect normal hairiness humans would be fine with the lubricating strip and last more than one shave, but in my case, not so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hydro 5 was a whole different breed.  Really felt like a never-ending lubricating strip (i jest a bit), but the whole shaving piece was a monster in size.  What the heck?  I found it hard to get under the nose and if my skin was a bit raw, the 5 blades didn&#x27;t help the cause.  It&#x27;s clunky and just big.  I personally did not enjoy the experience. Even with 5 blades, I didn&#x27;t think it was a smoother ride than the Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final razor I will provide my thoughts on is the 3 blade Hydro.  While still a bit bulky, it provided the best combination for me.  I find the lubricating strip long lasting...certainly long enough to get some well lubricated shaves.  I also found the blades to be fairly long-lasting and held up well given the task it was given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I believe the Hydro 3 has the best combination of features for me.  It was a good shave and each razor gives me about a week of shaves.  I suspect for most folks, their razor can last 2, 3, or 4 weeks.  The Hydro 3 is a bit clunky, but the combination of long-lasting lubrication and blades was the best I&#x27;ve come across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I have tried some of the battery operated versions of razors.  I don&#x27;t get the appeal.  I don&#x27;t like the feeling, doesn&#x27;t improve the experience, and I feel robbed when paying for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If others have suggestions for a better razor, please let me know.</li>
            <li> Actually have to go out a buy the razor first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the other reviews were enough to convince me to try these.  I need something that will last for several shaves.</li>
            <li> It is VERY rare these days that I take time to write a review about a product. With this being said, on the Schick Hydro Package, there is a statement that states that it shaves better than a Mach 3.....well folks....IT IS TRUE! After using this razor for over a month now I would even say it shaves better than any razor in any other company&#x27;s arsenal, period. Really! With other razors from various companies in the past I usually nick my head at least in one spot every time I shave. Doesn&#x27;t matter how slow or how attentive I am (listen I have head shaving down so well that I have even used double edge safety razors like grandpa used and didn&#x27;t have to go to the ER). All joking aside, since using the Hydro....I have ZERO nicks. Not a single drop of blood has been lost since I began using this razor. Not only does it shave great it shaves close! Hands down this is the best razor on the market right now. Try it for yourself! I absolutely know without a doubt you will agree!</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product, because when new, the shave is unparallelled. This blade shaves closer and more comfortably than any other I&#x27;ve used. I gladly retired my old Mach3 Turbo.   There is, however, a big downside. Once the lubricant has been depleted, you need to replace the blade very quickly. If you continue to use the blade afterwards, it will carve you up pretty badly. I thought I&#x27;d tough it out, but my hubris turned into major league skin irritation and a decent amount of blood.   If the lubricant lasted just a bit longer, this would be a perfect product. If you don&#x27;t mind changing your blade frequently, you will be rewarded with a fantastic shave.</li>
            <li> See my review for the system for more detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Executive summary is that the goo is redundant market differentiator and the blades are excellent.</li>
            <li> I use a safety razor for my face, but use these for shaving my head. A five blade razor is too dense for head shaving, but a three blade is perfect and very difficult to find anymore. I get a crazy amount of uses from it and will continue to use as long as they remain available.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only razor my husband will use. We could only find it at CVS, but now that it is available on Amazon in a two-pack, it is convenient and economical.</li>
            <li> Just used these for the first time- incredibly smooth. Absolutely no pulling (with or against grain). Very smooth shave. The hydrating gels actually work, too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different shavers but the hydro 3 is by far my favorite.  Its a smooth close shave and I rarely ever nick myself.  Heck even my girlfriend switched from the girly shavers to these because they&#x27;re so sharp its easier and quicker for her to shave her legs.  Worth every penny and a lot cheaper than mach and even hydro 5.</li>
            <li> Got it in a timely fashion...as expected from Amazon!  I am very happy and satisfied with this order/product. Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> These shave as well as the Gillette equivalent (Mach Turbo), they cost less, and they last longer. Better value than the Gillette.</li>
            <li> This says pack of two, but you only receive one. Not a deal by any means! Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with Gillette products ever since i started shaving 15 years back. They stopped selling sensor blades and fusion has too many blades for me. SO my only choice was Mach3. I purchase blades in bulk from Sams club. I have noticed that the quality has gone down recently(or maybe it was just my batch). So i decided to try Shick3. These blades are cheaper and better than Mach3. I am getting twice as many shaves as Mach3. I am a convert!</li>
            <li> I like these blades better than any other razor I have used. Something about them seems to get a cleaner shave and do less damage to my neck.</li>
            <li> Harder to find in stores but worth it.  Three blades is enough for a close shave, and the lubricating strips make getting past the tougher parts of the face much easier.  Better than the Hydro 5, wish we would stop the shaving blade arms race.</li>
            <li> I like shick better than fusion both work the same to me but Schick is better Hydro 5 are better but I like a Double razor best.</li>
            <li> great price for blades. will last a year</li>
            <li> These razor blades are vey good. They last a week to sometimes two weeks of shaving. I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> These razors shave extremely close.  The blades are very sharp, so only one swipe is needed over each area of my face, and the blades last much longer than any disposables I&#x27;ve ever tried.  The only negative is that it&#x27;s difficult to shave right under my nose with them, so I keep an old disposable around just to get that tiny spot.&lt;br /&gt;*TIP: Shaving in a steamy shower prevents razor bumps, especially for people prone to getting them on the neck!!</li>
            <li> As discribed. No problems</li>
            <li> I had picked up one of the razors in our local grocery store as it was a good price and I did a quick search and gave it a try. I have been pleased overall and compared to some other good razors I have had, I like this one the best. In this case, I needed some refills and could not find them locally--- Amazon had them and the price was fair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every razor and blade on the market, and these so far are the best as far as I&#x27;m concerned. They work much better than other 3 and 5 blade razors. These &amp;#34;Hydro 3&amp;#34; are even better than other Schick 3 blade razors.  They last a decent amount of time and give a really good shave. I don&#x27;t get uneven or too close of a shave with these. Other brands have given me a cut or more. You don&#x27;t miss the hard to reach or tight fitting areas either, like just under your nostrils. The lubrication strips work better than I&#x27;ve seen in the past.  Try them!!!</li>
            <li> great blades, work well, not as close as the 5 blade systems, but far less money and ... we used to shave with bics....... and facial hair grows back on a regular basis, so why not have some treats.........</li>
            <li> If your a manual shaving male like me, you probably hate it when your shaving products dry your skin out, cause you to get cuts, and wear out fast causing you to have to buy more blades.  WELL!  Finally Shick has the Hydro three, of which I&#x27;ve been using for the last year.  Cuts have been marginalized, I only go through a razor once every two weeks or so, and my face doesn&#x27;t dry out and I don&#x27;t even use aftershave etc.  The hydro is by far the best product that has been put into the razor market int he last decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll also mention that my fiancee uses the same set-up as me (different blade ofcourse) and it works fabulously for her.  So despite the gender assignment, it really doesn&#x27;t matter who you are, this is a great blade!</li>
            <li> I have been a razor guy since my Navy days in the 60s.  I started with a safety razor, which is a real oxymoron.  I&#x27;ve traveled through time as blades have evolved.  Even with my Norelco as backup, the Schick Hydor 3 has delivered the best results ever, shave after shave.  Gee, that sounds like an endorsement.  I accept that.</li>
            <li> This is a significantly better razor than the Hydro 5. I have a very tough beard especially around the chin. The Hydro 5 against the grain there feels like a cheese grater and it tugs horribly. I shaved with it once and there was massive irritation that would not heal for 2 days. This Hydro 3 tugs a bit but did not cause the irritation that the Hydro 5 did. It seems pretty well built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like- the lube strip. I don&#x27;t like any lube strip they are completely unnecessary and get sticky and nasty and is hard to wash off my face. Also the razor tugs more than it has to. I get the best results with a Schick Injector with Personna blades. It uses ONE blade and it is extremely comfortable and easy to use. Zero irritation and my tough stubble is cut easily. This Hydro 3 does not meet that standard. It is a shame they downgraded and no longer make injectors. I got mine used and Personna still makes injector blades.</li>
            <li> I have an average beard -- meaning I have to shave every day and maybe in the evening if I know I&#x27;m going to be out late.  I have unsuccessfully tried all the newest &amp;#34;improvements&amp;#34; like the four or five blades.  Even the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; units that seem to buzz around my face with little effect as far as closeness.  I don&#x27;t like the larger multiple blades because the blade unit is a lot larger than the Hydro 3 blades and I can&#x27;t seem to trim around my lips and mustache as easily. Also, I don&#x27;t like the bulkier blades under my chin either.  I&#x27;ve cut myself there more than I want to remember -- they are simply too large.  Besides, the larger 4 to 5 blades are more expensive and I still have to replace the blades just as often.  I see no advantage -- why spend the extra money?  Back to the Schick Hydro 3 refills, these are great, they&#x27;re comfortable, they last longer than the competition, and if you purchase on Amazon you&#x27;ll save a bunch of hard cash.  I order a year&#x27;s supply at a time.  It&#x27;s convenient and it&#x27;s one more thing I don&#x27;t have to think about.  Oder.  Done for the year!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Great product..I&#x27;ve been using these razors for a couple years now.</li>
            <li> After deciding to go with a \\&quot;permanent\\&quot; razor instead of disposables, I was taken in by the claim of \\&quot;shaves closer than Mach 3!\\&quot;     Sure, it shaved really close for about a week, and it smeared the weird \\&quot;lubrication\\&quot; all over my skin. That&#x27;s because the more blades you put on a razor, the more drag it creates on your skin, so it needs the lube that is applied above the blades. That&#x27;s the dirty little secret the manufacturers don&#x27;t tell you. It&#x27;s proven by their advice to pitch the razor when the little wells of lube are gone from the razor. It&#x27;s a nice little marketing ploy to sell more blades.     After the lube was gone, the blade dragged horribly. I was afraid it was going to take my skin with it. It seems like Schick uses poor-quality steel; the blades simply don&#x27;t last long.     It&#x27;s back to Sensor for me; only two blades, less drag, close shave in tight corners, and no applications of weird lube all over my face.</li>
            <li> My favorite blades by far!!!  Super smooth shave that&#x27;s better than any other 3,4 or 5 blade I&#x27;ve tried. A sure bet.</li>
            <li> I have been using these razors since they came out.  Overall a great razor.  I have a sensitive face, so I decided to go with the 3 blade instead of the 5.  I have been very happy with them.  It delivers a smooth shave for about a week, which is pretty good for a cartridge. (I shave every day) So, they are pretty economical as well, as of the last time I bought them on subscribe and save, it ended up being about 1.25/week... not bad.  The only downside of this razor has to do with the \\&quot;hydro\\&quot; strip on the top of the blade.  If you forget to flip your razor over or dry it off and leave it in a puddle beside the sink or face down, it will expand and ooze out of the razor.  If this happens, it will end the life of that blade.</li>
            <li> One of our item subscriptions can&#x27;t go wrong for price</li>
            <li> hey..... what can be said about only the most amazing blade refill offer for a 3-blade system in a \\&quot;4-count (pack of 2)\\&quot; ever created? (excluding 4 blade, 5 blade, 6 blade models... models featuring the extract of endangered plants... electric humming models or models that jive obscure Irish folk-dances while waiting to be used the next time.</li>
            <li> The best part about this blade? The moisturizing strip is in front of the blade path and not behind it. Getting the moisturizing first, before the blades hit, instead of after is obviously right right way to do it -- it&#x27;s hard to believe that most blades reverse the setup. If you like extra moisture and lubrication before the blades cross over, this is the blade that does it.</li>
            <li> They seem to last longer than most blades.</li>
            <li> These are hands down the most comfortable razors I have every used. the hydo strip actually seems to do something and when I&#x27;m done shaving I don&#x27;t feel like I just dragged bits of steel across my face, and buying them from amazon is so much cheaper than my local box store.</li>
            <li> 1 star - because of Amazon&#x27;s and Schick&#x27;s commitment to professionalism, quality craftsmanship at an accessible price point.&lt;br /&gt;...and another star - because it&#x27;s a great value for someone with very light facial hair, and who develops a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow in a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m fairly manly and need something strong, and the Schick Hydro 3 Blade won&#x27;t do it. It will work once, perhaps twice, and then it&#x27;ll just glide over your facial hair and not cut jack. Which can be a problem if you have a 9:30 meeting. Unless your boss is a woman who likes men with facial hair (or if it&#x27;s acceptable in your work place to have lumberjack face), you don&#x27;t want to go into the work looking like a Tunisian cab driver (full disclaimer - the Tunisian cabbie who ferried us from the office Christmas party at Yoshis is a swell guy, and spoke great French).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, I swear by the Executive razor from the Dollar Shave Club. Google it. It will power through your stubble and give you a mighty fine shave. The womenfolk at work will complement you for your clean cut look, and management will enjoy putting you in a client-facing role. If you reverse shave and go for a smooth look, you&#x27;ll literally shave years off your face.</li>

            <li> This is an Excellent product by Schick!!! I bought it for great price!! These blades last for a very long time, so indeed, a great value for money!!!</li>
            <li> (Update to the review below:)&lt;br /&gt;The blades arrived a day earlier than promised and were well packaged, secure. Thanks for that:)  As of today I&#x27;m on day 7 shaving with the blade that came with my razor and I can say that this 7th shave was a close and comfortable as the first one.  The lubercant in the razor head is still pumping out stuff giving my face a slickness that adds to the qualtiy of the shave as well as cools my face after a razor pass; couldn&#x27;t be happier with this razor. At this rate it will be another month before I open the blades I purchased from this seller as I have the two blades that came with the razor still to go through.  Think about that: At this price it&#x27;s the equivilant of paying %5.50 for a pack of 10 D/E blades since the Hydro 3 blades will last at least 2 if not 3 weeks...and the way the blades feel right now I&#x27;m thinking 3 weeks. I&#x27;ll post an update when I change blades. Again: So far the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used. The rest is below...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on a campaign now for a year trying to find a razor and blades that are cost effective, long lasting, do a good job without causing razor burn and I think the Schick Hydro 3 is almost perfect.  With a full face and neck medium/heavy beard I can get about 2.5 - 3 weeks of shaves out of one blade which brings the cost per shave down to about 0.30 cents per shave.&lt;br /&gt;Never any razor burn or irritation that causes break-outs and pretty much as close a shave as I can expect. I can honestly say that I never feel the blades against my face...ever. Absolutely no irritation or razor burn at all.  Ever.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative to me is this blade doesn&#x27;t catch it all.  There is always spots of stubble that require touch-up and is hard to get. If you&#x27;re going for a BBS shave you&#x27;ll have to work for it and that&#x27;ll use up more of the gel released by the cartridge. I&#x27;m amazed at how long that stuff lasts with me.  But for comfort this razor and blade can not be beat. If minor areas of missed beard doesn&#x27;t bother you or matters in your employment then you&#x27;ll love this razor. If it wasn&#x27;t for this I&#x27;d give this blade 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;The pluses are it really is a very long lasting blade, and hands down the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I use a Trac II most of the time because it gives me the closest shave and leaves me with a BBS face without much touch-up at all if ever. But after a few days I do experience some razor burn to the point I need to give my face a break. The Schick Hydro 3 lets me have that break and shave at the same time.  If it were only better at catching all the beard I&#x27;d convert completely.&lt;br /&gt;Overall an excellent razor and blade and I&#x27;m tempted to quit looking for perfection and except what is a very, very good shave in exchange for the most comfortable and irritation free shave I&#x27;ve ever had.eard doesn&#x27;t bother you or matters in your employment then you&#x27;ll love this razor.

            <li> This purchase was a great deal and a very reasonable price.  I can&#x27;t find this good a deal at any store locally.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t usually use this brand.  Found these to be surprisingly good.  Long lasting, very smooth, comfortable on legs and under arms.  LIke the feel/weight/balance of the razor, too.</li>
            <li> My Husband loves these razors. they don&#x27;t cut his face up. The price was good, a little less than stores.</li>
            <li> It give a very clean shave.  Feel a little odd since the blade piece is so large, but it works...</li>
            <li> The blades arrived when scheduled and were exactly what I wanted and ordered.  As an aside I buy razor blades online usually from an Amazon associate because they are so much less expensive than buying the same item from my local grocery store or pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because for the price the description said a pack of 2.  Amazon only sent 1.  What a ripoff!!!!! Don&#x27;t purchase this item.</li>
            <li> Works very well and the price is very competitive.  So much more convenient to buy online than in the store where they have to be kept behind lock and key!</li>
            <li> works very well!  No need to use 5 blades when 3 can do the job perfectly !!</li>
            <li> I have found these blades to be just as good as the more expensive ones from other companies.  Buying them on Amazon was a good way to save some money.</li>
            <li> The razors didn&#x27;t come in the original packaging. They could have been very old and I ended up getting a rash all over my legs and had to throw the rest away!</li>
            <li> In short, this gives me the best shave out of any blade I&#x27;ve ever used. In addition to the smooth shave, it has never cut me and lasts a very long time. As the Hydro 5 is overkill, I&#x27;m hoping they don&#x27;t discontinue the Hydro 3. Only complaint is that this and all blades have gotten ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li> good deal why do I need more words klkllkkl ;lkkl; lkk;l ; lkklk ;k;k  ; ;k ;k  ;k ;k ;</li>
            <li> I bought the 2 packs of 4 in November for 14 and change, it&#x27;s went up $10.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, like the blades a lot. Work well and get pretty decent number of days from them.</li>
            <li> Previously a long time Mach 3 user, I&#x27;m now fully converted to these Hydro 3 blades.  I have very sensitive skin and my beard comes in thick, making for a tricky combination to manage; up until discovering these I had found the Mach 3 to be the best I&#x27;d found, and while not flawless, they had done their job well enough.  Not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s that the Schick blades are sharper, the skin guard more effective, or the embedded gel working better that leads to it (I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s some combination of the three), but the hydro 3 glides effortlessly and I have no issues whatsoever with irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These cartridges also seem to retain their edge longer than the Gilletes, and at a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, this is the first cartridge razor blade I&#x27;ve ever used where I didn&#x27;t feel like I was having to settle in any aspect of performance.  Kudos, Schick!</li>
            <li> The razors are Cheaper than at any store i have been to and it is the exact same great product.</li>
            <li> does the job equally as well as 5 or 6 blade model, next step is single blade, the need for all these blades is justa bunch of hype.</li>
            <li> Great product at a much better price than brick-and-mortar stores.</li>
            <li> Good value for price paid with Amazon gift card.The only 3-blade razor I can use that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> These are not cheap, but they last almost month of shaving everything! Therefore are s much better value in the end.</li>
            <li> and a solid value as well.  However, if you have tried the Hydro 5 in the past be aware that the flip trimmer is not included with the 3 blade model.  This makes it tough for those areas under your nose or when you need to line up the bottom of your sideburns.  That being said, I feel like the 3 blades are better for those with sensitive skin (fewer blades scraping your skin perhaps).  Works well with the Nivea for Men Sensitive Skin Shave Cream.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we expected &amp; great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades for several years and Amazon seems to offer the best deal. I don&#x27;t like the new 4- and 5-blade razors very much. 2 or 3 blades seems to be a good balance in my experience. These razors give me a smooth shave without razor burn and I almost never nick myself. The razors last a lot longer if you put them in a dry place as soon as you&#x27;re done with them. It took me a while to discover that leaving the razors in the shower (and thus being exposed to high moisture levels for long periods of time) not only caused the blades to dull much faster, but also ruined the gel in the head of the razor. I have a little plastic suction cup holder stuck to the outside of my shower. I give the razors four stars because the top of the razor head (where the gel is stored) makes it difficult to shave small, tight areas like my upper lip or my side burns near by ears. I&#x27;m not sure the gel head is necessary or improves the shaving experience. If Schick improved the form factor by making the razor more similar to a disposable razor like the Schick Xtreme 3, then it would be easier to navigate around tight corners and get into tight spaces.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and these razors do not cut my skin and am sure you would feel the same way too.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor blade system I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 57 years.</li>
            <li> These seem to be hard to find now and I have grown to like these blades very much.  They are great to travel with.</li>
