            <li> I love the color and does not dry my lips, I recommend it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s A Beautiful Color, Just As Described. A Bit Creamier Than I Thought It Would Be. More A Creme Finish Instead Of Matte. I Will Buy Again Because It Is Highly Pigmented &amp; It Lasts Long</li>

            <li> I was nit expecting it to be this purple but I like it, not a color I would wear every day. It looks different in the picture to what you actually get.</li>
            <li> Lorde can definitely rock this lipstick shade but so can you! I am absolutely in LOVE with this color and the matte finish...it really works so well on so many skin tones...don&#x27;t shy away from this bold color with a fun name...it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Color is very pigmented, and beautiful. It really looks great on, and can make you look put together. Definitely not an everyday color though. After a couple of hours it starts to fade, but it&#x27;s not a big problem.</li>
            <li> Like the color was a little brighter then I thought it wold be. But I&#x27;ll still wear it.</li>
