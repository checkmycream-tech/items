            <li>This kind of service is unheard of in the business community.  </li>
            <li>It has two speeds which is nice.</li>
            <li>Now when guests come over they compliment me for the nice \\&quot;hotel\\&quot; upgrade.  </li>

            <li>Looks nice.</li>
            <li>is so nice...</li>
            <li>Sunbeam owns Oster I think, but I decided the magnetic switch would be a nice change on the Oster.  </li>
            <li>Always handy, but not in the way.  </li>
            <li>Bought it because I&#x27;ve always liked the ones in the hotel rooms.  </li>
            <li>They both operate nicely.</li>
            <li>always handy.</li>
            <li>I had one for about 7 years and the fan blades came off and created some nice sparks.  </li>
            <li>I would say she liked it to :</li>
            <li>works nicely...</li>
            <li>Nice appearance and feel.</li>
            <li>Like the ones in nice hotels it has it&#x27;s own GFCI protector</li>
            <li>It may not be the absolute best hair dryer out there</li>
            <li>So nice to have it on the wall out of the way.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice wall-mount hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife, who liked the product until three of the plastic fan blades broke after 15 months of use.</li>
            <li>cost effective if you buy from Amazon and look at pricing.</li>
            <li>This is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>I liked the style of this hair dryer, and the name Oster has always stood for quality.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of having it hang on the wall.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product.</li>
            <li>My husband does a lot of traveling and had commented he liked the hair dryers that are in hotels that hang on the wall.</li>
            <li>In addition, if you put it in the wall mount while it is on, it automatically turns off, which is kind of convenient.  </li>
            <li>It looks great on the wall, but just isn&#x27;t very powerful.</li>
            <li>It had sufficient power, but the air was warm at best, even on the high setting.  </li>
            <li>Wall mount from much older model did not have to removed - perfect match.  </li>
            <li>Nice to be able to offer guests an option instead of them having to bring their own.</li>
            <li>The cord is a good length but tangles easily.</li>
            <li>Mounting was very easy.</li>
            <li>Very easy to install&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very easy to install &amp; use</li>
            <li>This dryer works well and was very easy to install.</li>
            <li>Very easy to mount.</li>
            <li>A very nice perk at a very reasonable price!  </li>
            <li>Love having my hair dryer so handy.</li>
            <li>Love it, just like being a t a nice hotel.  </li>
            <li>fit on wall great and easy to install...</li>
            <li>Very handy and useful in our bathroom.</li>
            <li>Pretty nifty for my weekend cabin/guesthouse and great for my RV.</li>
            <li>I actually bought 3 units, just to have one for backup, as I have never had good luck with hairdryers, but have a good feeling about this one!</li>
            <li>Another very important feature is the removable filter for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I first saw one of these in a hotel room many years ago and thought it would be great to have one at home.</li>
            <li>Great Product, easy to install and easy to clean the filter.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and we all love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the convenience.  </li>
            <li>Love this purchase.</li>
            <li>Okay, how could I have lived 63years and never thought of installing a hair dryer on the wall?  </li>
            <li>it will only make you happy!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>fit my old wall mount - works great!</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed the blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I would have paid a lot more for this item considering the results I receive.  </li>
            <li>and i love love love how you just shove it in it</li>
            <li>Love that about it.</li>
            <li>I love my Wall mount hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I like hers (this one) better.</li>
            <li>different settings are perfect.</li>
            <li>Stylish and quite.  </li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>- maybe you&#x27;ll have better results.</li>
            <li>well satisfied with it&#x27;s performance.  </li>
            <li>Buying one more for my Dad .</li>
            <li>&quot; (i.e. cord on top), which requires the fifth (optional) screw through the hole in the magnet</li>
            <li>With once-a-day use, none lasted more than a year without burning out.</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of hanging it on the wall.  </li>
            <li>just love this.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Would like the cord about 1ft longer, but love it anyway.</li>
            <li>and it sure was convenient.  </li>
            <li>but surely it should have lasted more than 3 1/2 months.</li>
            <li>It seems like more work then just to have the controls on the dryer itself.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the compact size and the wall-mount comes in handy when you don&#x27;t have a lot of counter space for hair dryers.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair faster, and styles it better than any product I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of the wall mounted hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I love these hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>One of the better things I have purchased.</li>
            <li>Maybe 15 months is OK for a hair dryer at this price point, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>Good, powerful, adjustable air flow efficiently dries hair.</li>
            <li>iT&#x27;S ok JUST OVERHEATS WHEN DRYING THE DOG AFTER HIS BATH.</li>
            <li>It worked much better.</li>
            <li>I was able to pull the plug (the GFI never tripped).  </li>
            <li>man, I would love to have one of these at home.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This unit was to be mounted just in front of a mirror but is too bulky to look appropriate.  </li>
            <li>Love this hairdryer.....</li>
            <li>which doesn&#x27;t bother me, but will bother others I am sure.  </li>
            <li>They really love it.  </li>
            <li>Like most hair dryers if you get your hair too close to the fan</li>
            <li>I love this hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>I love having this on the wall and out of the way</li>
            <li>But I will continue to rebuy and stick it up on the metal piece that is already on the wall as I do love having it on the wall.</li>
            <li>; Love the convenience of a wall dryer.</li>
            <li>how did this product get so many 5 star</li>
            <li>I bought us one and am sure glad I did.</li>
            <li>Replaced one I had for so many years.</li>
            <li>Glad I never mounted it.</li>
            <li>Very easy to mount, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and love how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the easier magnetic switch in the wall mount and the comfort when holding the dryer as I dry my hair.</li>
            <li>Much more convenient and easy to use, just pull it off the wall and turn it on.  </li>
            <li>Product works fine and installs easily - but you should make sure that you have an outlet and a place to mount the dryer that allows the cord to reach the outlet and the dryer to reach your head.</li>
            <li>Installed great, not too loud, compact......</li>
            <li>Does not look like a cheap add on  when mounted on wall and is much better than a hand held unit.</li>
            <li>this hair drter is great so far.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll update my review if I ever have problems with it, but so far it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>Great hair dryer, not too loud, multi speed and compact out of the way.</li>
            <li>Received on time and works great so far.</li>
            <li>not as powerful as i would have liked.  </li>
            <li>Loved it so much bought our son and daughter one for there homes.</li>
            <li>Nice to have  the dryer right at hand</li>
            <li>Very happy with the product and would recommend them to other businesses.</li>
            <li>this is very light weight for me to use and the love the convenience of having right</li>
            <li>What really impressed me about the new unit was that I was able to mount it using the hardware from the old dryer;  all I had to do was slip it into place.  </li>
            <li>Nice nite lite, not too bright, just enough to see your way to the bathroom at night.</li>
            <li>Easy to install and use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to mount and works well.  </li>

            <li>Dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to install, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be working well, was easy to mount on the wall.</li>
            <li>It was easy to hang, but the bracket holds the unit away from the wall a bit.  </li>
            <li>Easy wall mount.  </li>
            <li>This makes it so so easy.  </li>
            <li>The Wall Mount is invaluable and the drying power is very adequate.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The Oster wall mounted dryer is easy to set up and easier to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to install and works well.  </li>
            <li>Easy to install.  </li>
            <li>This wall mounted unit was easy to install, has plenty of power and eliminates all the bother of storage and cord untangling of a portable unit.</li>
            <li>Love the ease of cleaning it too....easy to take the fan vent off and clean.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to put on the wall.</li>
            <li>Easy to install.</li>
            <li>so easy to install, so sturdy.</li>
            <li>installation was easy.</li>
            <li>This unit performs well and was easy to install.  </li>
            <li>Mounted in master bath, easy access makes drying hair a snap also added dryers in guest bathrooms.</li>
            <li>Been in use 3 months still going strong.</li>
            <li>Mounts easy, and looks fine on the wall.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to hold because of the light weight and is easy to control</li>
            <li>It was easy to install in less than 10 minutes and my wife is very happy.</li>
            <li>This one works fine</li>
            <li>and my wife said it works fine.  </li>
            <li>(Although it&#x27;s quite powerful and pretty good), but a fancy hairdryer won&#x27;t help you if it&#x27;s stuck in the under sink cabinet because you can&#x27;t be bothered to fetch</li>
            <li>If seems to work fine</li>
            <li>Works just fine, and has a heavier, quality &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; than the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li>This product quit almost out of the box, returned it to Amazon, the replacement has been working fine.</li>
            <li>Performs fine, but kinda noisy.</li>
            <li>The dryer is light and easy to hold with a sleek design.</li>
            <li>So handy, works great, frees up counter top space in my small bathroom.</li>
            <li>They have lots of power, they are easy to clean, and fairly light weight to hold while drying your hair.  </li>
            <li>It is wall mounted so it leaves your counter space free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy it again tomorrow if faced with the same need and happily recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s considering a purchase.</li>
            <li>Keeps the bathroom counter and cabinet free.</li>
            <li>the led light is great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and so it wouldn&#x27;t fit in the spot I had chosen for it.</li>
            <li>Easy clean filter.  </li>
            <li>They are no longer available.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want to have to find another kind and change the mounting bracket, etc.  </li>
            <li>It works fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice just to reach up and have it there ready to use, instead of having it in a drawer or under the counter with the cord wrapped around it.</li>
            <li>I have purchased three of these and have experienced the same demise with all three.  </li>
            <li>I chose to purchase the unit again because it fit the wall mount w/o needing to redrill.  </li>
            <li>So far it seems like a good product.  </li>
            <li>If this one lasts as long as the first one I will be  very happy</li>
            <li>(Good hair dryer, Oster Professional 76932-710 Wall Mount Hair Dryer )  </li>
            <li>My old wall drier died when the fan split, but it had been good</li>
            <li>Overall, the product is very nice in display and function.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to install and drying my hair on a lower wattage lessens the drying effect to my scalp and hair.  </li>
            <li>It has adequate power and the controls are easy.  </li>
            <li>I also love that the fan head is so short and very light!</li>
            <li>Was excited</li>
            <li>but so far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Originally I bought it because it was compact.  </li>
            <li>Glad I read reviews first</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to handle, easy to hang up when done, works very well.</li>
            <li>I walked into the bathroom, there&#x27;d be the clean counter with the blowdryer sitting on it</li>
            <li>We all love the convenience of not having to store it anywhere and always have it handy next to the vanity where it is needed.  </li>
            <li>Functionally, the latest Oster is much improved regarding sound.</li>
            <li>Easier than some to remove the lent sceen to clean.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as I was hoping, but it installed easily.</li>
            <li>, just need to clean fan area occassionally.</li>
            <li>Blows nice warm air but doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to style your hair.  </li>
            <li>So far, I noticed that it has pretty good blowing power, but it doesn&#x27;t run as hot as the Andis did, which may be better for my hair</li>
            <li>If you have long hair, and need to use a dryer for more than 3 - 4 minutes, it probably won&#x27;t stand up to that kind of use.</li>
            <li>This morning, without warning, it started smoking and glowing bright red inside.  </li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>fair enough.</li>
            <li>Even though the Sunbeam attaches to the wall better, it is really bulky and noticeable.  </li>
            <li>In my experience, they are good products initially but have not lasted for me.</li>
            <li>To be fair, these dryers are used on a daily basis but by people(wife</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an Andis Hang-up Turbo (Full sized) that lasted for 7 years.</li>
            <li>I love it so much i placed three in each bathroom</li>
            <li>but it works just as good at basic temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had one since 1998 and loved the size and ease of use mounted on the wall, so when it started acting up</li>
            <li>Love the convenience of it hanging on the wall ready to use with a touch of a button</li>
            <li>fit right where we needed it in our motorhome</li>
            <li>The best part of this dryer is that you can open the back and clean the fan blades.  </li>
            <li>works well, was a direct replacement for old unit, so it was very easy to reinstall, handy to use from wall mount</li>
            <li>Amazon.com from a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>With the cord from the dryer only about six feet when fully extended, finding that perfect spot is not necessarily as simple as you might think.</li>
            <li>Power is adequate for me.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>As described and quick shipping</li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>I quickly got used to turning it on and off at the wall mount - it not the annoyance I anticipated.  </li>
            <li>This appliance looks great, takes up very little space and was easily installed.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer is powerful, easy to mount on the wall, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>They are very easy to use but all of a sudden, go dead,even when you keep the fan area free of hair.</li>
            <li>We have two of these dryers at home in Michigan and purchased two more for our new condo in Florida.  </li>
            <li>Was exactly what I expected, will work great at my cabin</li>
            <li>I loved my first Oster wall mount hair dryer; it lasted 8 years before I had to replace it with the same model.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, looks modern, and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and wanted!</li>
            <li>It easily comes off the cradle, it is fairly quiet (compared to the Sunbeam) and the design is just more user-friendly.  </li>
            <li>...nice having the new ones fit the original wall mount.</li>
            <li>It is always available and visitors comment how much they like it also.  </li>
            <li>but installation was a breeze and the dryer seemed powerful.</li>
            <li>I guess for $10 a year it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>I got my moneys worth out of it anyway.  </li>
            <li>So far I am pleased with the Oster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Powerful.</li>
            <li>Where are the economical competitors?</li>
            <li>Powerful and compact</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful, but compact.</li>
            <li>I am on my 3 one over many many years and will not buy any other dryer when you can have this one to keep your life fast and simple and still looks good mounted on you wall.</li>
            <li>This one is a bit bigger, feels great in the hand and has a little switch you can set to make it run either warm or hot.  </li>
            <li>Also the cord is just right to reach the plug.  </li>
            <li>and it gets put away -- right away.  </li>
            <li>It took five minutes to hang, we plugged it right into the outlet</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s convenient to have it right on the wall.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s right there when I need it.</li>
            <li>(otherwise it would slip right off the wall mount).  </li>
            <li>The price is certainly right as well.</li>
            <li>right)</li>
            <li>I miss the three temperature settings available on the older model.  </li>
            <li>looks good,easy to install fast ship like the fact you can take off vent and clean when its time also cord has not tangled</li>
            <li>It was very easy to mount to the wall, and simple to use.  </li>
            <li>I loved the convenience of the first one so much that I purchased a second one after the first one quit working.  </li>
            <li>Always loved how quickly my hair dried when I was staying at the hotel...</li>
            <li>Colors are not too white, more ivory and light taupe, but very neutral.  </li>
            <li>Usually Oster is a great product, but not my unit.</li>
            <li>One finally shelled out and I replaced it...am getting ready to move and will order two more!</li>
            <li>The size is a little smaller than the Conair 1600 watt that I had to return and this Oster is perfect for the space I had.  </li>
            <li>This is the second one we have ordered, product works great, easy install and very powerful, last one was left on and clipped into the holder, it melted the holder enought</li>
            <li>The heat is just right, not too hot.</li>
            <li>I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT BUY THIS BRAND EVER !</li>
            <li>Large square plug cover both of them!</li>
            <li>This new one fit our old Oster wall plate for easy installation.  </li>
            <li>so it may come out easily if you use a plastic anchor to mount it instead of mounting directly into a stud.</li>
            <li>Was easy tp install and looks like a professional job of installation.</li>
            <li>I actually mounted 2 on the wall using commercial grade Velcro, which works great.  </li>
            <li>I was not sure if I would be able to find a replacement that I liked as much.  </li>
            <li>Wife likes very much.</li>
            <li>It came quickly; was easy to install; and after 3 weeks of using it daily, I ask myself &amp;#34;why</li>
            <li>Best thing about these dryers is they are easily installed and seem to last a long time and if you need to replace one you just lift it up and put on the new one since the wall mounts are the same!  </li>
            <li>I shuts of when it gets to hot.</li>
            <li>The 710 watt Oster is a great dryer and does the job well on my thick hair.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot.  </li>
            <li>In an effort to become more organized in my bathroom at home &amp; in my motorhome, I ordered 2 different wall-mounting hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>In all fairness, it does exactly what I bought it to do.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one of these Oster wall mount dryers for 15 years, since they first came out in hotels and at discount stores for home purchase.  </li>
            <li>I first used this hair dryer while staying at a Disney World Resort hotel.</li>
            <li>It gets hot, but the blower does not come on - probably a fire hazard.  </li>
            <li>Bought this to replace a Sunbeam 1500 and was VERY happy to find that the wall mount was compatible!&lt;br /&gt;Comparing the 2, the Sunbeam had 3 speeds, of which I only used the upper 2, and the Oster has 2 speeds, the &#x27;upper 2&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Have had the first one about 4 years with no problems, use almost every day and still works well.</li>
            <li>Very convenient and actually fun to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wanted one of these things forever--since I first saw one in a hotel.</li>
            <li>I just ordered one to replace my latest Oster and hope that it will last longer.</li>
            <li>the first one was a &#x27;welcomed gift&#x27;</li>
            <li>my favorite criteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two on 2 day prime shipping and received them the very next day.</li>
            <li>I received this item yesterday, tried it for the first time this morning.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; makes me a better self-stylist, but is works well all the same.</li>
            <li>Most likely just one broke off, and its rattling around inside the housing immediately caused others to start breaking.</li>
            <li>It comes on the 1200 setting, but to boost it up to 1500, all you need to do is pry off the rear filter and click a switch to the higher setting.  </li>
            <li>No need to spend money on higher priced units.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li>There is also a &amp;#34;hidden&amp;#34; setting where you can turn the power up, and I did that when it first arrived.</li>
            <li>Dryer is strong and not extremely noisy</li>
            <li>This is a great product and having it hang on the wall frees up counter space and not more tangled cords!</li>
            <li>I purchased this March 2014 &amp; originally gave it 5 stars review; however, in less than 4 months the fan in the unit broke into many pieces causing the dryer to almost catch fire.  </li>
            <li>easy to use, looks good, light weight and less hassle than taking out and putting away a heavy bulky dryer.</li>
            <li>I could understand that it might not be powerful enough for many women who have a full head of hair (such as my wife) but it works for me.</li>
            <li>better way to mount is to drill a second hole in the mounting plate and to screw it to a wall stud with long screws.&lt;br /&gt;Another good product hijacked by under engineered Chinese Manufacture!</li>
            <li>Our youngest daughter that is 7 is even able to use this hair dryer because of the small and easy to manage size.  </li>
            <li>It is larger than my old one, but a lot more powerful.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy with the Andis, but I bought the Oster due to it being off-white instead of white which looks a little more high end.</li>
            <li>Easy to mount in bathroom although I put in an extra screw to increase wall mount security.</li>
            <li>There is a quite large gap between hairdryer and wall.</li>
            <li>I can quickly dry and style my hair and love the fact that it is attached to the wall and ready to use.</li>
            <li>After 6 months of daily use by my wife, I noticed a high pitched buzzing on top of the already *normal* noise from the unit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It works just as expected and I love having it ready to go whenever I am.</li>
            <li>to be quickly ready at all times.</li>
            <li>This accomplished the goal.</li>
            <li>We really like it.</li>
            <li>I received my dryer and I really like that it&#x27;s compact</li>
            <li>The hairdryer looks sleek &amp; modern, works efficiently.</li>
            <li>Runs and runs and runs forever, really.</li>
            <li>I am not using my curling iron and hair spray nearly as much after using this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It looks very neat on the wall.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The only thing I would add would be a night light to it.</li>
            <li>The wall mount is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>d&#x27;Armes about these units, and was told that they were very reliable,</li>
            <li>and I needed a wall mount dryer that would fit in a smaller space.</li>
            <li>use&lt;br /&gt;Dryes hair fast</li>
            <li>Seems to be a very well made dryer.  </li>
            <li>Throughout all of these years it performed very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Oster engineers, for that.  </li>
            <li>I really like this unit.</li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the convenience of the wall mount.</li>
            <li>It attaches to the wall as advertised, is unobtrusive, doesn&#x27;t make too much noise when operating and has an acceptable range of heat adjustments.  </li>
            <li>What is otherwise a great product is ruined by the poorly made fan blades.  </li>
            <li>Having this wall mount hair dryer has ben a real convience, It reduces a lot of cluter around the sink It works and looks well.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say much else about it.</li>
            <li>Received rapidly packaged very well.  </li>
            <li>The nozzle is much longer than pictured.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is what I wanted at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Works very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Much!&lt;br /&gt;Dean</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>Seems very well made.</li>
            <li>It looks kind of yellow in photo but is white.  </li>
            <li>Only wish it was more compact like the old Sunbeam.</li>
            <li>The wattage is strong enough to dry your hair quickly too!  </li>
            <li>It is very quiet and very powerful.</li>
            <li>It was just what I wanted and worked great for a few months, then one of the fan blades broke off for no apparent reason just after the warranty expired.</li>
            <li>This is our second one of these, the first quit working within the first year!</li>
            <li>This one seems to be a bit better than any other we&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>Ihave had other  Oster products and we are pleased with there performance.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even need to remove the old wall mounting hardware, it connected right to my old hardware!!  </li>
            <li>Dries hair fast on high.  </li>
            <li>My first one just got old and need to be replaced.</li>
            <li>No more dryers on the lavatory with the cords catching on the cabinet knobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No cords to tangle and no laying on counter to cool off prior to putting inside cabinet.  </li>
            <li>This new dryer replaced an Oster wall-mounted hair dryer I installed in 1994!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older now</li>
            <li>I like the smaller size better, but needed to go with something that might last longer.  </li>
            <li>I pushed the fan back into place on the shaft and applied super glue to *hopefully* keep it from moving again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>They like theirs also.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I had just been replacing them because the new dryer would fit into the old wall mount, but decided not to keep shelling out money for an inferior product that did not last.&lt;br /&gt;Bought a different competing model</li>
            <li>The unit has 2 speeds, however the high speed is normally used.</li>
            <li>(like slamming an old telephone haha)</li>
            <li>Works very well so far.  </li>
            <li>My feelings about blow dryers is that they&#x27;re pretty much all the same within price ranges.  </li>
            <li>I first used one of these and a hotel room and found it to be light and dried my hair</li>
            <li>Convenience and low price is worth replacing unit.</li>
            <li>Noise is per a normal hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>but it started making a high pitched sound after 2 days, and did not get hot enough to efficiently dry hair</li>
            <li>We had our first really cold day here (in the South) and I found it&#x27;s also handy for warming yourself up quickly when coming out of the shower; I&#x27;ve suggested it to my husband for that purpose</li>
            <li>I bought this one to replace my home hair dryer even though I didn&#x27;t need a new one.</li>
            <li>We moved into a new house and my wife selected this one for her bathroom...</li>
            <li>My wife couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Oster with new one.  </li>
            <li>I like the dryer and bought a second one simply because it would fit the bracket.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s obvious that the blade material is cheap and simply can&#x27;t hold up.  </li>
            <li>At least this one doesn&#x27;t have the night light and the price is right.  </li>
            <li>It functions well as a hair dryer, exactly the same as one you would find in a hotel.   </li>
            <li>the first one (not a well-known brand) died on me after a short time, but I believe Oster is a quality brand.</li>
            <li>week, I called Oster about my latest problem and was told that if it&#x27;s past one year(it is), no help from them.</li>
            <li>This is my second one - the first lasted about five years.</li>
            <li>Not a small gap.</li>
            <li>it would either be in the way of the light switches or it would have to under the hand towels and make an odd bulge.</li>
            <li>However, the cord used to be super elastic (and it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m trying to drag it across the bathroom from wall-to-wall).</li>
            <li>We have always liked this product and have had several in the past.</li>
            <li>This replaced my previous hair dryer, same brand and model, that had lasted many years.  </li>
            <li>Just the right size to fit on the small apace next to the mirror.</li>
            <li>The dryer is powerful enough to get your hair dried quickly.</li>
            <li>They last a long time if you keep the screen filter clean.  </li>
            <li>Nice but does not blow hard enough for me.</li>
            <li>After the purchase of our fourth very satisfactory Oster wall mount hairdryer the fifth one did not work, out of a factory sealed box.</li>
            <li>B000RZLL38 Oster Professional 76932-710 Wall Mount Hair Dryer]]</li>
            <li>Oster Professional 76932-710 Wall Mount Hair Dryer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasonably priced and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>B000RZLL38 Oster Professional 76932-710 Wall Mount Hair Dryer]]</li>
            <li>Recently, my old dryer broke, so I ordered this one.  </li>
            <li>I got this hairdryer for my wife for Christmas to replace the Norelco wall mount that was 26 years old and died.  </li>
            <li>My hair was so soft after drying my hair and had never felt like this before after using a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>it’s mount and work with it directly.</li>
            <li>Replacement for an old one of another brand.  </li>
            <li>As a frequent traveler, I&#x27;ve become accustomed to a wall mounted hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>If I could have gotten another fan blade, I could have easily fixed it.  </li>
            <li>but it only has two speeds \\&quot;Lo\\&quot; and \\&quot;Hi\\&quot; and even the \\&quot;Hi\\&quot; setting doesn&#x27;t give much airflow and the amount of heat like the portable ones you can can get at cheaper prices.</li>
            <li>Anyone can mount it to the wall near an outlet and a mirror.</li>
            <li>I actually often skipped drying my hair because it was too much hassle.  </li>
            <li>The actual item is much thicker...</li>
            <li>It took the place of my old one which died.</li>
            <li>Fairly loud but not obnoxious.  </li>
            <li>Replaced my old (20 years old)</li>
            <li>There is high and low, but no temperature switch.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was easy to hang and don&#x27;t worry if it breaks down because all the dryers are universal and the wholes will line up to replace it if necessary.  </li>
            <li>I also got the Oster because it had smaller footprint because I installed a new medicine cabinet</li>
            <li>ordering my third so I don&#x27;t have to fix the holes in my tile wall for a new backplate that may not cover it.</li>
            <li>Takes much longer to dry my hair, wish I had known.</li>
            <li>This is our second one and the first one lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>The mounting screws and anchors are too small, in my opinion, so I substituted something with a bit more heft that will hold up to pulling the dryer out of it&#x27;s slot over the long haul.  </li>
            <li>I was tired of the clutter from a regular hair dryer in my bathroom, and had a nice space on the wall for one of these.  </li>
            <li>Mounted right on to the bracket I had on the wall with my previous dryer.</li>
            <li>Quality dryer that blows hot and hard enough to dry you hair very quickly and hang it back up</li>
            <li>Plus they kept the same mounting scheme and it fits on the old bracket.</li>
            <li>No regrets with this purchase.</li>
            <li>We had one of these over 18yrs old and it finally gave out!  </li>
            <li>If your unit is making a similar *buzzing* noise rather like the old baseball card rubbing on bicycle spokes</li>
            <li>The dryer is white and gray (wish it were all white), but the gray is a normal gray, not the greenish color that it looks like in the listing.  </li>
            <li>I usually get a couple of years out of my hair dryers and hope this holds true for this one.  </li>
            <li>Works OK but mount design is poor.  </li>
            <li>I like the design and mounting, but unfortunately the a heating element stopped working and it barely blows warm air after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the reviewer who told me how to switch the lever behind the lint filter to get full power.</li>
            <li>I wanted to return it, but between a restocking charge and postage it just isn&#x27;t worth the trouble.  </li>
            <li>only issue with having a compact hair dryer vs. my previous full sized hair dryer is that the back fan is closer to my head.</li>
            <li>lots of power, super small, and compact.</li>
            <li>You do need to be careful to thread the cord through the bottom to get a tight fit against the wall.</li>
            <li>I have owned several wall mount dryers and they seem to be chintzy - overly small and too hot, way too hot to dry my kids&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li>and I)who rarely have problems with other appliances, large or small.</li>
            <li>Mine only lasted 18 months with daily use, then died completely.</li>
            <li>The current price is only slightly higher than what I paid for the other two.</li>
            <li>There is a high spot in the center which hooks onto the wall bracket.  </li>
            <li>so I just take down old and put up new.  </li>
            <li>Finally my old blow dryer went kaput, so I had an excuse to purchase this</li>
            <li>Small but plenty powerful.</li>
            <li>Small but powerful</li>
            <li>The first issue is that the \\&quot;on / off\\&quot; buttons have less than permanent lettering on them!  </li>
            <li>But that is not a biggie, because you ought to vacuum and clean your bathroom at least twice that often anyway.</li>
            <li>No more hunting for the hairdryer, it&#x27;s right there on the wall, just like in a hotel bathroom.</li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t had it long enough to give it 5 stars but so far there are no problems.</li>
            <li>I love it, with a few minor little complaints....</li>
            <li>But the good outweighs the bad.</li>

            <li> Works great, and so easy to hang up.  </li>
            <li> Great hairdryer, I got one just like it that I though quit working but was working fine sot</li>
            <li> This kind of service is unheard of in the business community.  </li>
            <li> It has two speeds which is nice.</li>
            <li> Now when guests come over they compliment me for the nice \\&quot;hotel\\&quot; upgrade.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping, works great!</li>
            <li> Nice to have it on the wall and out of the way.</li>
            <li> Looks nice.</li>
            <li> is so nice...</li>
            <li> Sunbeam owns Oster I think, but I decided the magnetic switch would be a nice change on the Oster.  </li>
            <li> Always handy, but not in the way.  </li>
            <li> Bought it because I&#x27;ve always liked the ones in the hotel rooms.  </li>
            <li> They both operate nicely.</li>
            <li> always handy.</li>
            <li> I had one for about 7 years and the fan blades came off and created some nice sparks.  </li>
            <li> I would say she liked it to :</li>
            <li> works nicely...</li>
            <li> Nice appearance and feel.</li>
            <li> Like the ones in nice hotels it has it&#x27;s own GFCI protector</li>
            <li> It may not be the absolute best hair dryer out there</li>
            <li> So nice to have it on the wall out of the way.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice wall-mount hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, who liked the product until three of the plastic fan blades broke after 15 months of use.</li>
            <li> cost effective if you buy from Amazon and look at pricing.</li>
            <li> This is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> I liked the style of this hair dryer, and the name Oster has always stood for quality.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of having it hang on the wall.  </li>
            <li> I liked this product.</li>
            <li> My husband does a lot of traveling and had commented he liked the hair dryers that are in hotels that hang on the wall.</li>
            <li> In addition, if you put it in the wall mount while it is on, it automatically turns off, which is kind of convenient.  </li>
            <li> It looks great on the wall, but just isn&#x27;t very powerful.</li>
            <li> It had sufficient power, but the air was warm at best, even on the high setting.  </li>
            <li> Wall mount from much older model did not have to removed - perfect match.  </li>
            <li> Nice to be able to offer guests an option instead of them having to bring their own.</li>
            <li> The cord is a good length but tangles easily.</li>
            <li> Mounting was very easy.</li>
            <li> Very easy to install&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very easy to install &amp; use</li>
            <li> This dryer works well and was very easy to install.</li>
            <li> Very easy to mount.</li>
            <li> A very nice perk at a very reasonable price!  </li>
            <li> Love having my hair dryer so handy.</li>
            <li> Love it, just like being a t a nice hotel.  </li>
            <li> fit on wall great and easy to install...</li>
            <li> Very handy and useful in our bathroom.</li>
            <li> Pretty nifty for my weekend cabin/guesthouse and great for my RV.</li>
            <li> I actually bought 3 units, just to have one for backup, as I have never had good luck with hairdryers, but have a good feeling about this one!</li>
            <li> Another very important feature is the removable filter for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I first saw one of these in a hotel room many years ago and thought it would be great to have one at home.</li>
            <li> Great Product, easy to install and easy to clean the filter.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and we all love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the convenience.  </li>
            <li> Love this purchase.</li>
            <li> Okay, how could I have lived 63years and never thought of installing a hair dryer on the wall?  </li>
            <li> it will only make you happy!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> fit my old wall mount - works great!</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed the blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> I would have paid a lot more for this item considering the results I receive.  </li>
            <li> and i love love love how you just shove it in it</li>
            <li> Love that about it.</li>
            <li> I love my Wall mount hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I like hers (this one) better.</li>
            <li> different settings are perfect.</li>
            <li> Stylish and quite.  </li>
            <li> OK</li>
            <li> - maybe you&#x27;ll have better results.</li>
            <li> well satisfied with it&#x27;s performance.  </li>
            <li> Buying one more for my Dad .</li>
            <li> &quot; (i.e. cord on top), which requires the fifth (optional) screw through the hole in the magnet</li>
            <li> With once-a-day use, none lasted more than a year without burning out.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of hanging it on the wall.  </li>
            <li> just love this.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Would like the cord about 1ft longer, but love it anyway.</li>
            <li> and it sure was convenient.  </li>
            <li> but surely it should have lasted more than 3 1/2 months.</li>
            <li> It seems like more work then just to have the controls on the dryer itself.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the compact size and the wall-mount comes in handy when you don&#x27;t have a lot of counter space for hair dryers.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair faster, and styles it better than any product I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of the wall mounted hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I love these hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> One of the better things I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Maybe 15 months is OK for a hair dryer at this price point, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Good, powerful, adjustable air flow efficiently dries hair.</li>
            <li> iT&#x27;S ok JUST OVERHEATS WHEN DRYING THE DOG AFTER HIS BATH.</li>
            <li> It worked much better.</li>
            <li> I was able to pull the plug (the GFI never tripped).  </li>
            <li> man, I would love to have one of these at home.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This unit was to be mounted just in front of a mirror but is too bulky to look appropriate.  </li>
            <li> Love this hairdryer.....</li>
            <li> which doesn&#x27;t bother me, but will bother others I am sure.  </li>
            <li> They really love it.  </li>
            <li> Like most hair dryers if you get your hair too close to the fan</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> I love having this on the wall and out of the way</li>
            <li> But I will continue to rebuy and stick it up on the metal piece that is already on the wall as I do love having it on the wall.</li>
            <li> ; Love the convenience of a wall dryer.</li>
            <li> how did this product get so many 5 star</li>
            <li> I bought us one and am sure glad I did.</li>
            <li> Replaced one I had for so many years.</li>
            <li> Glad I never mounted it.</li>
            <li> Very easy to mount, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and love how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the easier magnetic switch in the wall mount and the comfort when holding the dryer as I dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Much more convenient and easy to use, just pull it off the wall and turn it on.  </li>
            <li> Product works fine and installs easily - but you should make sure that you have an outlet and a place to mount the dryer that allows the cord to reach the outlet and the dryer to reach your head.</li>
            <li> Installed great, not too loud, compact......</li>
            <li> Does not look like a cheap add on  when mounted on wall and is much better than a hand held unit.</li>
            <li> this hair drter is great so far.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll update my review if I ever have problems with it, but so far it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer, not too loud, multi speed and compact out of the way.</li>
            <li> Received on time and works great so far.</li>
            <li> not as powerful as i would have liked.  </li>
            <li> Loved it so much bought our son and daughter one for there homes.</li>
            <li> Nice to have  the dryer right at hand</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product and would recommend them to other businesses.</li>
            <li> this is very light weight for me to use and the love the convenience of having right</li>
            <li> What really impressed me about the new unit was that I was able to mount it using the hardware from the old dryer;  all I had to do was slip it into place.  </li>
            <li> Nice nite lite, not too bright, just enough to see your way to the bathroom at night.</li>
            <li> Easy to install and use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to mount and works well.  </li>
            <li> It sits easily in the holder.</li>
            <li> The dryer snaps easily in and out of the holder.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to mount</li>
            <li> Easy mount.</li>
            <li> It is compact, convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> it’s easy to use</li>
            <li> Hangs on the wall, easy</li>
            <li> Dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be working well, was easy to mount on the wall.</li>
            <li> It was easy to hang, but the bracket holds the unit away from the wall a bit.  </li>
            <li> Easy wall mount.  </li>
            <li> This makes it so so easy.  </li>
            <li> The Wall Mount is invaluable and the drying power is very adequate.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The Oster wall mounted dryer is easy to set up and easier to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to install and works well.  </li>
            <li> Easy to install.  </li>
            <li> This wall mounted unit was easy to install, has plenty of power and eliminates all the bother of storage and cord untangling of a portable unit.</li>
            <li> Love the ease of cleaning it too....easy to take the fan vent off and clean.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to put on the wall.</li>
            <li> Easy to install.</li>
            <li> so easy to install, so sturdy.</li>
            <li> installation was easy.</li>
            <li> This unit performs well and was easy to install.  </li>
            <li> Mounted in master bath, easy access makes drying hair a snap also added dryers in guest bathrooms.</li>
            <li> Been in use 3 months still going strong.</li>
            <li> Mounts easy, and looks fine on the wall.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to hold because of the light weight and is easy to control</li>
            <li> It was easy to install in less than 10 minutes and my wife is very happy.</li>
            <li> This one works fine</li>
            <li> and my wife said it works fine.  </li>
            <li> (Although it&#x27;s quite powerful and pretty good), but a fancy hairdryer won&#x27;t help you if it&#x27;s stuck in the under sink cabinet because you can&#x27;t be bothered to fetch</li>
            <li> If seems to work fine</li>
            <li> Works just fine, and has a heavier, quality &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; than the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> This product quit almost out of the box, returned it to Amazon, the replacement has been working fine.</li>
            <li> Performs fine, but kinda noisy.</li>
            <li> The dryer is light and easy to hold with a sleek design.</li>
            <li> So handy, works great, frees up counter top space in my small bathroom.</li>
            <li> They have lots of power, they are easy to clean, and fairly light weight to hold while drying your hair.  </li>
            <li> It is wall mounted so it leaves your counter space free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy it again tomorrow if faced with the same need and happily recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s considering a purchase.</li>
            <li> Keeps the bathroom counter and cabinet free.</li>
            <li> the led light is great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and so it wouldn&#x27;t fit in the spot I had chosen for it.</li>
            <li> Easy clean filter.  </li>
            <li> They are no longer available.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to have to find another kind and change the mounting bracket, etc.  </li>
            <li> It works fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice just to reach up and have it there ready to use, instead of having it in a drawer or under the counter with the cord wrapped around it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased three of these and have experienced the same demise with all three.  </li>
            <li> I chose to purchase the unit again because it fit the wall mount w/o needing to redrill.  </li>
            <li> So far it seems like a good product.  </li>
            <li> If this one lasts as long as the first one I will be  very happy</li>
            <li> (Good hair dryer, Oster Professional 76932-710 Wall Mount Hair Dryer )  </li>
            <li> My old wall drier died when the fan split, but it had been good</li>
            <li> Overall, the product is very nice in display and function.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to install and drying my hair on a lower wattage lessens the drying effect to my scalp and hair.  </li>
            <li> It has adequate power and the controls are easy.  </li>
            <li> I also love that the fan head is so short and very light!</li>
            <li> Was excited</li>
            <li> but so far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Originally I bought it because it was compact.  </li>
            <li> Glad I read reviews first</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to handle, easy to hang up when done, works very well.</li>
            <li> I walked into the bathroom, there&#x27;d be the clean counter with the blowdryer sitting on it</li>
            <li> We all love the convenience of not having to store it anywhere and always have it handy next to the vanity where it is needed.  </li>
            <li> Functionally, the latest Oster is much improved regarding sound.</li>
            <li> Easier than some to remove the lent sceen to clean.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I was hoping, but it installed easily.</li>
            <li> , just need to clean fan area occassionally.</li>
            <li> Blows nice warm air but doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to style your hair.  </li>
            <li> So far, I noticed that it has pretty good blowing power, but it doesn&#x27;t run as hot as the Andis did, which may be better for my hair</li>
            <li> If you have long hair, and need to use a dryer for more than 3 - 4 minutes, it probably won&#x27;t stand up to that kind of use.</li>
            <li> This morning, without warning, it started smoking and glowing bright red inside.  </li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> fair enough.</li>
            <li> Even though the Sunbeam attaches to the wall better, it is really bulky and noticeable.  </li>
            <li> In my experience, they are good products initially but have not lasted for me.</li>
            <li> To be fair, these dryers are used on a daily basis but by people(wife</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an Andis Hang-up Turbo (Full sized) that lasted for 7 years.</li>
            <li> I love it so much i placed three in each bathroom</li>
            <li> but it works just as good at basic temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had one since 1998 and loved the size and ease of use mounted on the wall, so when it started acting up</li>
            <li> Love the convenience of it hanging on the wall ready to use with a touch of a button</li>
            <li> fit right where we needed it in our motorhome</li>
            <li> The best part of this dryer is that you can open the back and clean the fan blades.  </li>
            <li> works well, was a direct replacement for old unit, so it was very easy to reinstall, handy to use from wall mount</li>
            <li> Amazon.com from a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> With the cord from the dryer only about six feet when fully extended, finding that perfect spot is not necessarily as simple as you might think.</li>
            <li> Power is adequate for me.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> As described and quick shipping</li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> I quickly got used to turning it on and off at the wall mount - it not the annoyance I anticipated.  </li>
            <li> This appliance looks great, takes up very little space and was easily installed.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer is powerful, easy to mount on the wall, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> They are very easy to use but all of a sudden, go dead,even when you keep the fan area free of hair.</li>
            <li> We have two of these dryers at home in Michigan and purchased two more for our new condo in Florida.  </li>
            <li> Was exactly what I expected, will work great at my cabin</li>
            <li> I loved my first Oster wall mount hair dryer; it lasted 8 years before I had to replace it with the same model.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, looks modern, and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and wanted!</li>
            <li> It easily comes off the cradle, it is fairly quiet (compared to the Sunbeam) and the design is just more user-friendly.  </li>
            <li> ...nice having the new ones fit the original wall mount.</li>
            <li> It is always available and visitors comment how much they like it also.  </li>
            <li> but installation was a breeze and the dryer seemed powerful.</li>
            <li> I guess for $10 a year it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> I got my moneys worth out of it anyway.  </li>
            <li> So far I am pleased with the Oster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Powerful.</li>
            <li> Where are the economical competitors?</li>
            <li> Powerful and compact</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful, but compact.</li>
            <li> I am on my 3 one over many many years and will not buy any other dryer when you can have this one to keep your life fast and simple and still looks good mounted on you wall.</li>
            <li> This one is a bit bigger, feels great in the hand and has a little switch you can set to make it run either warm or hot.  </li>
            <li> Also the cord is just right to reach the plug.  </li>
            <li> and it gets put away -- right away.  </li>
            <li> It took five minutes to hang, we plugged it right into the outlet</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s convenient to have it right on the wall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s right there when I need it.</li>
            <li> (otherwise it would slip right off the wall mount).  </li>
            <li> The price is certainly right as well.</li>
            <li> right)</li>
            <li> I miss the three temperature settings available on the older model.  </li>
            <li> looks good,easy to install fast ship like the fact you can take off vent and clean when its time also cord has not tangled</li>
            <li> It was very easy to mount to the wall, and simple to use.  </li>
            <li> I loved the convenience of the first one so much that I purchased a second one after the first one quit working.  </li>
            <li> Always loved how quickly my hair dried when I was staying at the hotel...</li>
            <li> Colors are not too white, more ivory and light taupe, but very neutral.  </li>
            <li> Usually Oster is a great product, but not my unit.</li>
            <li> One finally shelled out and I replaced it...am getting ready to move and will order two more!</li>
            <li> The size is a little smaller than the Conair 1600 watt that I had to return and this Oster is perfect for the space I had.  </li>
            <li> This is the second one we have ordered, product works great, easy install and very powerful, last one was left on and clipped into the holder, it melted the holder enought</li>
            <li> The heat is just right, not too hot.</li>
            <li> I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT BUY THIS BRAND EVER !</li>
            <li> Large square plug cover both of them!</li>
            <li> This new one fit our old Oster wall plate for easy installation.  </li>
            <li> so it may come out easily if you use a plastic anchor to mount it instead of mounting directly into a stud.</li>
            <li> Was easy tp install and looks like a professional job of installation.</li>
            <li> I actually mounted 2 on the wall using commercial grade Velcro, which works great.  </li>
            <li> I was not sure if I would be able to find a replacement that I liked as much.  </li>
            <li> Wife likes very much.</li>
            <li> It came quickly; was easy to install; and after 3 weeks of using it daily, I ask myself &amp;#34;why</li>
            <li> Best thing about these dryers is they are easily installed and seem to last a long time and if you need to replace one you just lift it up and put on the new one since the wall mounts are the same!  </li>
            <li> I shuts of when it gets to hot.</li>
            <li> The 710 watt Oster is a great dryer and does the job well on my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot.  </li>
            <li> In an effort to become more organized in my bathroom at home &amp; in my motorhome, I ordered 2 different wall-mounting hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> In all fairness, it does exactly what I bought it to do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these Oster wall mount dryers for 15 years, since they first came out in hotels and at discount stores for home purchase.  </li>
            <li> I first used this hair dryer while staying at a Disney World Resort hotel.</li>
            <li> It gets hot, but the blower does not come on - probably a fire hazard.  </li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a Sunbeam 1500 and was VERY happy to find that the wall mount was compatible!&lt;br /&gt;Comparing the 2, the Sunbeam had 3 speeds, of which I only used the upper 2, and the Oster has 2 speeds, the &#x27;upper 2&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Have had the first one about 4 years with no problems, use almost every day and still works well.</li>
            <li> Very convenient and actually fun to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted one of these things forever--since I first saw one in a hotel.</li>
            <li> I just ordered one to replace my latest Oster and hope that it will last longer.</li>
            <li> the first one was a &#x27;welcomed gift&#x27;</li>
            <li> my favorite criteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two on 2 day prime shipping and received them the very next day.</li>
            <li> I received this item yesterday, tried it for the first time this morning.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; makes me a better self-stylist, but is works well all the same.</li>
            <li> Most likely just one broke off, and its rattling around inside the housing immediately caused others to start breaking.</li>
            <li> It comes on the 1200 setting, but to boost it up to 1500, all you need to do is pry off the rear filter and click a switch to the higher setting.  </li>
            <li> No need to spend money on higher priced units.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li> There is also a &amp;#34;hidden&amp;#34; setting where you can turn the power up, and I did that when it first arrived.</li>
            <li> Dryer is strong and not extremely noisy</li>
            <li> This is a great product and having it hang on the wall frees up counter space and not more tangled cords!</li>
            <li> I purchased this March 2014 &amp; originally gave it 5 stars review; however, in less than 4 months the fan in the unit broke into many pieces causing the dryer to almost catch fire.  </li>
            <li> easy to use, looks good, light weight and less hassle than taking out and putting away a heavy bulky dryer.</li>
            <li> I could understand that it might not be powerful enough for many women who have a full head of hair (such as my wife) but it works for me.</li>
            <li> better way to mount is to drill a second hole in the mounting plate and to screw it to a wall stud with long screws.&lt;br /&gt;Another good product hijacked by under engineered Chinese Manufacture!</li>
            <li> Our youngest daughter that is 7 is even able to use this hair dryer because of the small and easy to manage size.  </li>
            <li> It is larger than my old one, but a lot more powerful.  </li>
            <li> I was very happy with the Andis, but I bought the Oster due to it being off-white instead of white which looks a little more high end.</li>
            <li> Easy to mount in bathroom although I put in an extra screw to increase wall mount security.</li>
            <li> There is a quite large gap between hairdryer and wall.</li>
            <li> I can quickly dry and style my hair and love the fact that it is attached to the wall and ready to use.</li>
            <li> After 6 months of daily use by my wife, I noticed a high pitched buzzing on top of the already *normal* noise from the unit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It works just as expected and I love having it ready to go whenever I am.</li>
            <li> to be quickly ready at all times.</li>
            <li> This accomplished the goal.</li>
            <li> We really like it.</li>
            <li> I received my dryer and I really like that it&#x27;s compact</li>
            <li> The hairdryer looks sleek &amp; modern, works efficiently.</li>
            <li> Runs and runs and runs forever, really.</li>
            <li> I am not using my curling iron and hair spray nearly as much after using this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It looks very neat on the wall.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The only thing I would add would be a night light to it.</li>
            <li> The wall mount is very convenient.  </li>
            <li> d&#x27;Armes about these units, and was told that they were very reliable,</li>
            <li> and I needed a wall mount dryer that would fit in a smaller space.</li>
            <li> use&lt;br /&gt;Dryes hair fast</li>
            <li> Seems to be a very well made dryer.  </li>
            <li> Throughout all of these years it performed very well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Oster engineers, for that.  </li>
            <li> I really like this unit.</li>
            <li> Thanks.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the convenience of the wall mount.</li>
            <li> It attaches to the wall as advertised, is unobtrusive, doesn&#x27;t make too much noise when operating and has an acceptable range of heat adjustments.  </li>
            <li> What is otherwise a great product is ruined by the poorly made fan blades.  </li>
            <li> Having this wall mount hair dryer has ben a real convience, It reduces a lot of cluter around the sink It works and looks well.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much else about it.</li>
            <li> Received rapidly packaged very well.  </li>
            <li> The nozzle is much longer than pictured.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is what I wanted at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Works very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Much!&lt;br /&gt;Dean</li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> Seems very well made.</li>
            <li> It looks kind of yellow in photo but is white.  </li>
            <li> Only wish it was more compact like the old Sunbeam.</li>
            <li> The wattage is strong enough to dry your hair quickly too!  </li>
            <li> It is very quiet and very powerful.</li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted and worked great for a few months, then one of the fan blades broke off for no apparent reason just after the warranty expired.</li>
            <li> This is our second one of these, the first quit working within the first year!</li>
            <li> This one seems to be a bit better than any other we&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Ihave had other  Oster products and we are pleased with there performance.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even need to remove the old wall mounting hardware, it connected right to my old hardware!!  </li>
            <li> Dries hair fast on high.  </li>
            <li> My first one just got old and need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> No more dryers on the lavatory with the cords catching on the cabinet knobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No cords to tangle and no laying on counter to cool off prior to putting inside cabinet.  </li>
            <li> This new dryer replaced an Oster wall-mounted hair dryer I installed in 1994!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older now</li>
            <li> I like the smaller size better, but needed to go with something that might last longer.  </li>
            <li> I pushed the fan back into place on the shaft and applied super glue to *hopefully* keep it from moving again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> They like theirs also.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had just been replacing them because the new dryer would fit into the old wall mount, but decided not to keep shelling out money for an inferior product that did not last.&lt;br /&gt;Bought a different competing model</li>
            <li> The unit has 2 speeds, however the high speed is normally used.</li>
            <li> (like slamming an old telephone haha)</li>
            <li> Works very well so far.  </li>
            <li> My feelings about blow dryers is that they&#x27;re pretty much all the same within price ranges.  </li>
            <li> I first used one of these and a hotel room and found it to be light and dried my hair</li>
            <li> Convenience and low price is worth replacing unit.</li>
            <li> Noise is per a normal hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> but it started making a high pitched sound after 2 days, and did not get hot enough to efficiently dry hair</li>
            <li> We had our first really cold day here (in the South) and I found it&#x27;s also handy for warming yourself up quickly when coming out of the shower; I&#x27;ve suggested it to my husband for that purpose</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace my home hair dryer even though I didn&#x27;t need a new one.</li>
            <li> We moved into a new house and my wife selected this one for her bathroom...</li>
            <li> My wife couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Oster with new one.  </li>
            <li> I like the dryer and bought a second one simply because it would fit the bracket.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obvious that the blade material is cheap and simply can&#x27;t hold up.  </li>
            <li> At least this one doesn&#x27;t have the night light and the price is right.  </li>
            <li> It functions well as a hair dryer, exactly the same as one you would find in a hotel.   </li>
            <li> the first one (not a well-known brand) died on me after a short time, but I believe Oster is a quality brand.</li>
            <li> week, I called Oster about my latest problem and was told that if it&#x27;s past one year(it is), no help from them.</li>
            <li> This is my second one - the first lasted about five years.</li>
            <li> Not a small gap.</li>
            <li> it would either be in the way of the light switches or it would have to under the hand towels and make an odd bulge.</li>
            <li> However, the cord used to be super elastic (and it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m trying to drag it across the bathroom from wall-to-wall).</li>
            <li> We have always liked this product and have had several in the past.</li>
            <li> This replaced my previous hair dryer, same brand and model, that had lasted many years.  </li>
            <li> Just the right size to fit on the small apace next to the mirror.</li>
            <li> The dryer is powerful enough to get your hair dried quickly.</li>
            <li> They last a long time if you keep the screen filter clean.  </li>
            <li> Nice but does not blow hard enough for me.</li>
            <li> After the purchase of our fourth very satisfactory Oster wall mount hairdryer the fifth one did not work, out of a factory sealed box.</li>
            <li> B000RZLL38 Oster Professional 76932-710 Wall Mount Hair Dryer]]</li>
            <li> Oster Professional 76932-710 Wall Mount Hair Dryer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasonably priced and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> B000RZLL38 Oster Professional 76932-710 Wall Mount Hair Dryer]]</li>
            <li> Recently, my old dryer broke, so I ordered this one.  </li>
            <li> I got this hairdryer for my wife for Christmas to replace the Norelco wall mount that was 26 years old and died.  </li>
            <li> My hair was so soft after drying my hair and had never felt like this before after using a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> it’s mount and work with it directly.</li>
            <li> Replacement for an old one of another brand.  </li>
            <li> As a frequent traveler, I&#x27;ve become accustomed to a wall mounted hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> If I could have gotten another fan blade, I could have easily fixed it.  </li>
            <li> but it only has two speeds \\&quot;Lo\\&quot; and \\&quot;Hi\\&quot; and even the \\&quot;Hi\\&quot; setting doesn&#x27;t give much airflow and the amount of heat like the portable ones you can can get at cheaper prices.</li>
            <li> Anyone can mount it to the wall near an outlet and a mirror.</li>
            <li> I actually often skipped drying my hair because it was too much hassle.  </li>
            <li> The actual item is much thicker...</li>
            <li> It took the place of my old one which died.</li>
            <li> Fairly loud but not obnoxious.  </li>
            <li> Replaced my old (20 years old)</li>
            <li> There is high and low, but no temperature switch.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was easy to hang and don&#x27;t worry if it breaks down because all the dryers are universal and the wholes will line up to replace it if necessary.  </li>
            <li> I also got the Oster because it had smaller footprint because I installed a new medicine cabinet</li>
            <li> ordering my third so I don&#x27;t have to fix the holes in my tile wall for a new backplate that may not cover it.</li>
            <li> Takes much longer to dry my hair, wish I had known.</li>
            <li> This is our second one and the first one lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> The mounting screws and anchors are too small, in my opinion, so I substituted something with a bit more heft that will hold up to pulling the dryer out of it&#x27;s slot over the long haul.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of the clutter from a regular hair dryer in my bathroom, and had a nice space on the wall for one of these.  </li>
            <li> Mounted right on to the bracket I had on the wall with my previous dryer.</li>
            <li> Quality dryer that blows hot and hard enough to dry you hair very quickly and hang it back up</li>
            <li> Plus they kept the same mounting scheme and it fits on the old bracket.</li>
            <li> No regrets with this purchase.</li>
            <li> We had one of these over 18yrs old and it finally gave out!  </li>
            <li> If your unit is making a similar *buzzing* noise rather like the old baseball card rubbing on bicycle spokes</li>
            <li> The dryer is white and gray (wish it were all white), but the gray is a normal gray, not the greenish color that it looks like in the listing.  </li>
            <li> I usually get a couple of years out of my hair dryers and hope this holds true for this one.  </li>
            <li> Works OK but mount design is poor.  </li>
            <li> I like the design and mounting, but unfortunately the a heating element stopped working and it barely blows warm air after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the reviewer who told me how to switch the lever behind the lint filter to get full power.</li>
            <li> I wanted to return it, but between a restocking charge and postage it just isn&#x27;t worth the trouble.  </li>
            <li> only issue with having a compact hair dryer vs. my previous full sized hair dryer is that the back fan is closer to my head.</li>
            <li> lots of power, super small, and compact.</li>
            <li> You do need to be careful to thread the cord through the bottom to get a tight fit against the wall.</li>
            <li> I have owned several wall mount dryers and they seem to be chintzy - overly small and too hot, way too hot to dry my kids&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li> and I)who rarely have problems with other appliances, large or small.</li>
            <li> Mine only lasted 18 months with daily use, then died completely.</li>
            <li> The current price is only slightly higher than what I paid for the other two.</li>
            <li> There is a high spot in the center which hooks onto the wall bracket.  </li>
            <li> so I just take down old and put up new.  </li>
            <li> Finally my old blow dryer went kaput, so I had an excuse to purchase this</li>
            <li> Small but plenty powerful.</li>
            <li> Small but powerful</li>
            <li> The first issue is that the \\&quot;on / off\\&quot; buttons have less than permanent lettering on them!  </li>
            <li> But that is not a biggie, because you ought to vacuum and clean your bathroom at least twice that often anyway.</li>
            <li> No more hunting for the hairdryer, it&#x27;s right there on the wall, just like in a hotel bathroom.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t had it long enough to give it 5 stars but so far there are no problems.</li>
            <li> I love it, with a few minor little complaints....</li>
            <li> But the good outweighs the bad.</li>
            <li> This model is a little bigger than our older wall mount blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> For commercial setting they are neat and clean but with heavy everyday use they get about 1-1.5 years before burning out.</li>
            <li> You also need to vacuum out the filter about once a month to prevent the overheat protector from tripping.  </li>
            <li> It would stop half way through drying (and it takes less then ten minutes to dry my hair) and I would have to let it cool off before it would restart.</li>
            <li> This is a decent little hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easily stored on the wall, doesn&#x27;t make an annoying noise and dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand why they didn&#x27;t make the back side flat.</li>
            <li> but if you have long or thick hair it may not be powerful enough.</li>
            <li> While it remains to be seen if this product will last in the long term, it was only $30.  </li>
            <li> One advantage I discovered with mounting it higher is that it&#x27;s never going to get caught on knobs or anything else--a frequent frustration when I&#x27;m tired in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and on most days only dry my bangs for a total of about 3 minutes drying time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard (even for me) to believe, but my hair dries faster using the lower wattage option on this dryer (1200 watts) than on the higher one (1500 watts).  </li>
            <li> This hairdryer is small and compact and the wall mount is very convenient and space saving.</li>
            <li> Really works well for our small bathroom.</li>
            <li> Unit does not sit flat against the wall.  </li>
            <li> Because of this, when I held the dryer too close to my hair (which is long) and some hair got sucked into the fan in the back.</li>
            <li> This one won&#x27;t even stay on long enough for me to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000RZLL38 Oster Professional 76932-710 Wall Mount Hair Dryer]] OWNED THIS UNIT FOR LESS THAN THREE MONTHS</li>
            <li> I have short hair, so I&#x27;m not trying to dry a mane.</li>
            <li> Second, it was a bit larger than I expected</li>
            <li> directions were very clear and it is now anchored firmly on the wall.</li>
            <li> The new one outdoes the previous model!</li>
            <li> Not sure if a new one will last over a year or not.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s plain old white.</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is that it died so quickly.</li>
            <li> Have not had it long</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long this one lasts.  </li>
            <li> Just but a few nails near an outlet, and you&#x27;re done.  </li>
            <li> Hope this one lasts as long.</li>
            <li> In other words, we try to be careful.&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I&#x27;ve noticed motels using a Andis brand dryer and some of the reviews state that they last for years.</li>
            <li> Those reviewers who find the heat output on the weak side evidently have not read the instructions.  </li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t work very long.  </li>
            <li> My kids no longer scream and yell when I dry their hair.  </li>
            <li> I dry my hair with another hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Every time I dry my hair in a hotel, I say to myself...</li>
            <li> , I use it every single morning and also with some craft projects.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair, be careful to keep hair away from intake.</li>
            <li> I opened it up noticed the fan had come loose and slid into the cover allowing the blade tips to rub on the air inlet screen.  </li>
            <li> I finally broke down and purchased this wall-mounted unit and put it in my wife&#x27;s bathroom.  </li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t have to hold the dryer far away from my head as with my previous heavy hand held dryer which has a long fan</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one in less than 2 years.  </li>
            <li> I hung a little picture next to it</li>
            <li> We bought this dryer, because we have a tiny bathroom with little storage space.  </li>
            <li> The cord is a little short so distance from out</li>
            <li> *, the magnetic retainer, is inadequate, the handset can be expected to fall out if not meticulously replaced...</li>
            <li> So I will go through the trouble and possible cost of returning it, just on principle.</li>
            <li> It is as I expected.</li>
            <li> The next time I turned it on it ran for a few seconds then stopped working at all.  </li>
            <li> Some of the other wall mount hair dryers I have looked at in stores and on line were too wide for the area I have.</li>
            <li> It had hardly been used, but I had it long enough that I couldn&#x27;t return it.  </li>
            <li> The second little issue is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t mount flush to the wall, so if you don&#x27;t want to see what&#x27;s holding it up, don&#x27;t buy this product!    </li>
            <li> The kids can all use it easily (5 yrs and up), simple on/off button on the base, hi/lo on the dryer handle</li>
            <li> It takes up quite a bit of space especially if you have a small bathroom.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 Oster 76932-710 and put one up in my bathroom and the other in the spare bath.  </li>
            <li> Spend the extra few bucks on this one!  </li>
            <li> Had the other one for 6 yrs.</li>
            <li> Seems sturdier than other brands.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the cord stretches out after time.</li>
            <li> I suspect build up of lint on the blades is what eventually caused the other dryers to burn out, and with the other dryers it is not possible to access the blades (at least not easily).  </li>
            <li> A little awkward to turn it on and off on the main piece but no big deal.</li>
            <li> Every time I went to a hotel, I wrote down the brand with the intention of ordering one.</li>
            <li> Extremely convenient!  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the way that it &#x27;wobbles&#x27; slightly when mounted to the wall bracket, insert the 5th (optional) screw, as directed.</li>
            <li> I have purchased at least three of these wall mounted hair dryers over the last few years.</li>
            <li> I have previously owed one of these</li>
            <li> No popped circuit breakers, either, so I know it uses less energy.  </li>
            <li> I had one just like it for a couple years previously.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has thick long hair and this dryer doesn&#x27;t work for her.</li>
            <li> I tried removing the broken pieces the first time, but found that the unit was still broken.  </li>
            <li> I looked in the usual stores to replace my other Oster Wall Mounted Hair Dryer we&#x27;ve had for about 10yrs and could not find this item.  </li>
            <li> THE DRYER COULD USE A LITTLE LONGER CORD.  </li>
            <li> I have a cramped bathroom with little space for a hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> EVERYDAY.  </li>
            <li> While staying in hotels, I always noticed that my hair dried faster when I used this type of dryer.  </li>
            <li> BUT the on button is broken after using only 3 times.</li>
            <li> mounted mine onto tile with two 3M heavy duty adhesive strips</li>
            <li> IT SOLVES THE MESSY STORAGE PROBLEM.  </li>
            <li> The dryer is much larger than it looks and would stick out from the wall approximately 6 inches.  </li>
            <li> Out of about six I&#x27;ve bought, I have had one that I purchased in May 2015 to quit working, although it&#x27;s had very little use.</li>
            <li> I can hardly imagine having to deal with a pull out and plug in everyday hairdryer again.  </li>
            <li> Was not easy nor neat to install due to poor power cord arrangement...had to modify wall mount housing.</li>
            <li> No more cords dangling in the sink and knocking items on the floor.  </li>
            <li> The small size allows me to style my hair while drying and</li>
            <li> No more clutter in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> No more plugging it in, coiling when finished, putting it away, etc.  </li>
            <li> Because of the small area against the wall, the unit rocks and there is a 1/4\\&quot; gap all around the edge.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if the dryers in the hotel are made exclusive like that.</li>
            <li> Have used in the past as well.</li>
            <li> No more hairdryers on the counters, tangled cords, etc.  </li>
            <li> Newer but definitely NOT better.</li>
            <li> No more digging through drawers or cupboards to find the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I have a small bathroom and space is at a premium.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fighting with the cord on that thing for the past three years in our small bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I need a small unit....</li>
            <li> The product fails in my view because the three tiny &#x27;Mollies&#x27; supplied to hold it to the wall are pathetically under engineered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these in each of our 3 bathrooms for at least the past 15 years.  </li>
            <li> There is at least a 1/4 inch gap between the wall and dryer.  </li>
            <li> it sucks it in.</li>
            <li> Usually, I would just say &#x27;forget-about-it&#x27;!    </li>
            <li> No more knocking my dryer off the counter!</li>
            <li> I have a very small space where it is mounted on the wall.</li>
            <li> Having an oster wall mounted hairdryer in excess of 10 years , that had 3 speeds , it is a little difficult getting accustomed to a two speed model.</li>
            <li> No longer do I need to leave the house with my wet hair because it is somewhat inconvenient to reach my husband&#x27;s plug-in for the hair dryer...</li>
            <li> It has decent power, it keeps the clutter off my counter &amp; out of my drawer, and it&#x27;s not that bad to look at!  </li>
            <li> My wife has used this dryer for eleven months without complaint, UNTIL NOW!  </li>
            <li> The on/off button does jam and needs to be pressed very hard.</li>
            <li> Tough to beat.  </li>
            <li> and I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> Bought this unit to replace a Sunbeam 1500 watt model that had a broken fan blade (was dropped on a tile floor).  </li>
            <li> You can see the metal mounting plate behind the unit.  </li>
            <li> Design was poorly thought out as the on off button should have been on the handle.  </li>
            <li> but it ended up being a poorly designed dryer.</li>
            <li> game*</li>
            <li> The base is a little poorly designed because it doesn&#x27;t flush with the wall</li>
            <li> When one goes bad we have had a hard time finding one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been unable to read the words since about a week after mounting it on the wall.  </li>
            <li> Unable to return.</li>
            <li> 5/25/15 Silly me for buying another one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, lousy design and assembly detail, shame on Oster.  </li>
            <li> kids play, don&#x27;t ignor it as the fan will eventually fail if not repaired....</li>
            <li> /&gt;BTW, another lousy design *feature</li>
            <li> (I have a bad back which is at its worst in the morning</li>
            <li> I am always afraid it will come off the metal mount on the wall.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I have a bad thermistor in my unit because it kicks off within moments of turning it on.  </li>
            <li> It is not as aesthetically pleasing as competing models, but not quite as ugly as the photo makes it seem.  </li>
            <li> Was really disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this dryer.</li>
            <li> Although I hate to throw it in to the dump.</li>
            <li> and when it is time to take it off, you just slide the base off</li>
            <li> Now the dryer is worthless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This unit shuts off when returned to the base but does not turn on when removed from the base...</li>
            <li> Turning it on requires holding the hand set in hand while also pressing the on button on the base..</li>
            <li> I hated having to pull out my hair dryer every morning from under the sink, deal with the cord, then put it away when I was done.</li>
            <li> My husband (firefighter) had a nasty habit of leaving the blowdryer on the bathroom counter \\&quot;until it cooled off\\&quot;.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect!  The size is a little smaller than the Conair 1600 watt that I had to return and this Oster is perfect for the space I had.  Also the cord is just right to reach the plug.  Love it. Got one in every bath and my rv bath also.  Nice nite lite, not too bright, just enough to see your way to the bathroom at night.</li>
            <li> So far it seems like a good product.  I like the size &amp; the feature of it hanging on the wall to be quickly ready at all times.</li>
            <li> Great replacement for one already installed!</li>
            <li> Actually used this in a hotel while on vacation and thought if it could withstand a hotel bathroom, it could handle our kids, and it has.  No complaints at all.  It looks kind of yellow in photo but is white.  Easy to install and use.</li>
            <li> I purchased as a back up for the last one I bought.  I shuts of when it gets to hot.</li>
            <li> Very similar to models found in hotels.  It was very easy to mount to the wall, and simple to use.  Dries hair fast on high.  If you have long hair, be careful to keep hair away from intake.</li>
            <li> After the purchase of our fourth very satisfactory Oster wall mount hairdryer the fifth one did not work, out of a factory sealed box. Amazon.com replaced this factory defective item even before we returned the defective one. This kind of service is unheard of in the business community.  Thank You! Amazon.com from a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> I loved my first Oster wall mount hair dryer; it lasted 8 years before I had to replace it with the same model. No. 2 just died after 7 years&#x27; dependable service (the plastic fins on the fan became brittle and snapped off.) There&#x27;s no use trying to improve on such a reliable product, so I&#x27;m ordering No. 3. The current price is only slightly higher than what I paid for the other two.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer after I used one like it during a hotel stay. It hangs on the wall and is always there when needed. It is very quiet and very powerful. This is a great hair dryer for a man.</li>
            <li> Having an oster wall mounted hairdryer in excess of 10 years , that had 3 speeds , it is a little difficult getting accustomed to a two speed model. ( this is what the newer ones are ) If this one lasts as long as the first one I will be  very happy</li>
            <li> More expensive than a regular dryer, but the wall mount took it off the counter.  Works well. We&#x27;ve had it in operation for about a month now.[[ASIN:B000RZLL38 Oster Professional 76932-710 Wall Mount Hair Dryer]]</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer but doesn&#x27;t work very long.  Overheats and quits.  This is the 2nd one in less than 2 years.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I  bought this  for our master  bath  to  remove the clutter that a hand dryer creates.  This accomplished the goal.</li>
            <li> It is great to have this --- just like the hotels!  A very nice perk at a very reasonable price!  Extremely convenient!  No longer do I need to leave the house with my wet hair because it is somewhat inconvenient to reach my husband&#x27;s plug-in for the hair dryer...Usually, I would just say &#x27;forget-about-it&#x27;!    Love the product!</li>
            <li> The merchandise is as advertised.  It is easy to mount and works well.  The only draw back is the size of the wall unit itself.  It takes up quite a bit of space especially if you have a small bathroom.</li>
            <li> Oster Professional 76932-710 Wall Mount Hair Dryer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasonably priced and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> This is like the hair dryers you see in hotels.It is wall mounted so it leaves your counter space free. We really like it.</li>
            <li> Product works fine and installs easily - but you should make sure that you have an outlet and a place to mount the dryer that allows the cord to reach the outlet and the dryer to reach your head. With the cord from the dryer only about six feet when fully extended, finding that perfect spot is not necessarily as simple as you might think.</li>
            <li> The dryer works like a charm and is just what we were looking for. I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want a hair dryer just lying around on their countertop.</li>
            <li> My husband (firefighter) had a nasty habit of leaving the blowdryer on the bathroom counter \\&quot;until it cooled off\\&quot;.  Everytime I walked into the bathroom, there&#x27;d be the clean counter with the blowdryer sitting on it so I&#x27;d wind up the cord and put it in the cabinet. EVERYDAY.  So for Christmas, I got hubby this blowdryer and we all love it.  Colors are not too white, more ivory and light taupe, but very neutral.  The kids can all use it easily (5 yrs and up), simple on/off button on the base, hi/lo on the dryer handle and it gets put away -- right away.  It took five minutes to hang, we plugged it right into the outlet and I love it!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve all used the wall-mounted blow dryers in hotels, and then gone home to the unit sitting on the counter-top in our bathroom.  I finally broke down and purchased this wall-mounted unit and put it in my wife&#x27;s bathroom.  It only took a couple of minutes to install the mounting plate with the supplied hardware.  What a difference.  No more cords dangling in the sink and knocking items on the floor.  I chose this model because it has a removable filter to allow easier cleaning.  My feelings about blow dryers is that they&#x27;re pretty much all the same within price ranges.  I don&#x27;t expect a $35 item to last 10 years. . . I will happily replace it when it wears out.  This one works fine and I don&#x27;t have any complaints.  I&#x27;d buy it again tomorrow if faced with the same need and happily recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s considering a purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience.  Don&#x27;t have drawers in the bathroom so this works great.  It is always available and visitors comment how much they like it also.  Don&#x27;t have any complaints on this product.</li>
            <li> I looked in the usual stores to replace my other Oster Wall Mounted Hair Dryer we&#x27;ve had for about 10yrs and could not find this item.  We all love the convenience of not having to store it anywhere and always have it handy next to the vanity where it is needed.  It is a great product besides.  I definitely will re-order this again.</li>
            <li> I have owned several wall mount dryers and they seem to be chintzy - overly small and too hot, way too hot to dry my kids&#x27; hair.  This one is a bit bigger, feels great in the hand and has a little switch you can set to make it run either warm or hot.  My kids no longer scream and yell when I dry their hair.  It has plenty of power and it looks good too.  The only drawbacks are the length of the cord (could be a tad longer), and the back vent sometimes pulls a hair or two - neither are deal breakers.  I&#x27;m very happy with this dryer.</li>
            <li> Love this purchase. The heat is just right, not too hot. It sits easily in the holder. It has two speeds which is nice. It great not to have to dig the hair dryer out of drawer,  it&#x27;s convenient to have it right on the wall.</li>
            <li> Replaced a earlier version. Works well. Wife happy</li>
            <li> Okay, how could I have lived 63years and never thought of installing a hair dryer on the wall?  It&#x27;s a no brainer!  Dragging out the hairdryer every day and trying to put it away neatly is a hassle and there is no reason to put up with it any longer!  I bought 2 Oster 76932-710 and put one up in my bathroom and the other in the spare bath.  Now when guests come over they compliment me for the nice \\&quot;hotel\\&quot; upgrade.  Everybody comments on what a good idea.    The 710 watt Oster is a great dryer and does the job well on my thick hair.  The dryer snaps easily in and out of the holder.  It took me about 30 minutes to install both dryers...and that included the time it took me to find my drill and try and read 3/16 on the drill bit!  Buy this...it will only make you happy!</li>
            <li> Wish it had a cooling button!</li>
            <li> I am always looking for organizational tips.  When I saw this hair dryer I thought this would be perfect to cover the hole that a non operating  wall phone would leave. It is perfect and no storage problem.  Works well.[[ASIN:B000RZLL38 Oster Professional 76932-710 Wall Mount Hair Dryer]]</li>
            <li> I love it. It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> dvice work with 110 ac and my home 220  also not writ in amazon abut ac tks</li>
            <li> While staying in hotels, I always noticed that my hair dried faster when I used this type of dryer.  Recently, my old dryer broke, so I ordered this one.  It&#x27;s hard (even for me) to believe, but my hair dries faster using the lower wattage option on this dryer (1200 watts) than on the higher one (1500 watts).  And it dries faster than it did when I was using my longer, heavier 1875 watt dryer with the air-flow diffuser on it, too!  It&#x27;s super easy to install and drying my hair on a lower wattage lessens the drying effect to my scalp and hair.  It&#x27;s a win-win.  It&#x27;s easily stored on the wall, doesn&#x27;t make an annoying noise and dries my hair quickly.  I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> No complains, my wife use it every day. (Good hair dryer, Oster Professional 76932-710 Wall Mount Hair Dryer )  Great!.</li>
            <li> I received my dryer and I really like that it&#x27;s compact and it has the power of bigger one. It has two settings and that is wall that I need.</li>
            <li> Have not had it long but installation was a breeze and the dryer seemed powerful.</li>
            <li> Terrific.  Works well and great to have it on the wall.</li>
            <li> Mounting was very easy. The hairdryer looks sleek &amp; modern, works efficiently. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I got this hairdryer for my wife for Christmas to replace the Norelco wall mount that was 26 years old and died.  It was easy to mount and my wife said it works fine.  We haven&#x27;t had it long enough to give it 5 stars but so far there are no problems.</li>
            <li> Love the hairdryer.  The mount could be sturdier.  I am always afraid it will come off the metal mount on the wall.</li>
            <li> Easy mount. Heats well</li>
            <li> Worked for 3 years than burned out.  Decided to order another one since I have the wall plate already on the wall.  I guess for $10 a year it was worth it.  Although I hate to throw it in to the dump.</li>
            <li> Installed great, not too loud, compact......BUT the on button is broken after using only 3 times.</li>
            <li> Bought this hairdryer to replace the same one that had been hanging on the wall for 10 years and finally died.  Was excited when the bracket was the same so didn&#x27;t have to do anything but hang it up..Then I used it.  It doesn&#x27;t get hot.  Blows nice warm air but doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to style your hair.  I now have this one hanging on the wall, unplugged, while I use one that I haul out of the drawer every morning.</li>
            <li> fit my old wall mount - works great!</li>
            <li> I was tired of the clutter from a regular hair dryer in my bathroom, and had a nice space on the wall for one of these.  The color (off-white and gray) matches my bath, and the unit works great.  So glad I got it!</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer, I got one just like it that I though quit working but was working fine sot I returned it.</li>
            <li> Love having my hair dryer so handy.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, works great!</li>
            <li> Quality hair dryer, works perfectly. You do need to be careful to thread the cord through the bottom to get a tight fit against the wall. Runs and runs and runs forever, really.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is perfect. No more hunting for the hairdryer, it&#x27;s right there on the wall, just like in a hotel bathroom. I&#x27;ve only had it for a month but so far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> fit right where we needed it in our motorhome</li>
            <li> I always wanted a hair dryer like they have in hotels.  It&#x27;s great not to have it laying around on the counter taking up a lot of space.  It is a very good hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Bought this unit to replace a Sunbeam 1500 watt model that had a broken fan blade (was dropped on a tile floor).  I miss the three temperature settings available on the older model.  This one only has two.  Otherwise it is a good product.</li>
            <li> In an effort to become more organized in my bathroom at home &amp; in my motorhome, I ordered 2 different wall-mounting hair dryers.  The Oster is the one in my house.  I love it, with a few minor little complaints.... The first issue is that the \\&quot;on / off\\&quot; buttons have less than permanent lettering on them!  I&#x27;ve been unable to read the words since about a week after mounting it on the wall.  The second little issue is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t mount flush to the wall, so if you don&#x27;t want to see what&#x27;s holding it up, don&#x27;t buy this product!    In all fairness, it does exactly what I bought it to do.  It has decent power, it keeps the clutter off my counter &amp; out of my drawer, and it&#x27;s not that bad to look at!  I would definitely recommend it, and I am actually buying a 2nd one for my daughter&#x27;s apartment bathroom!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these Oster wall mount dryers for 15 years, since they first came out in hotels and at discount stores for home purchase.  It&#x27;s so convenient.  I can hardly imagine having to deal with a pull out and plug in everyday hairdryer again.  (Several friends have purchased one for their homes after being guests at my home.)  They last a long time if you keep the screen filter clean.  I have had to replace about once every 5 years.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed the blow dryer.  I also bought one for my second home.  It is compact, convenient and easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Wife likes very much. Been in use 3 months still going strong.</li>
            <li> Pretty nifty for my weekend cabin/guesthouse and great for my RV. Just like the ones at the hotels. Nice to have it on the wall and out of the way.</li>
            <li> Works great for awhile, but then burns out. Looks nice.</li>
            <li> I first used this hair dryer while staying at a Disney World Resort hotel. I fell in love with it.  My hair was so soft after drying my hair and had never felt like this before after using a hair dryer.  It is so easy to hold because of the light weight and is easy to control but it has a lot of power in it. The small size allows me to style my hair while drying and I am getting it done faster too!  I am not using my curling iron and hair spray nearly as much after using this hair dryer. I bought this one to replace my home hair dryer even though I didn&#x27;t need a new one. I would have paid a lot more for this item considering the results I receive.  Our youngest daughter that is 7 is even able to use this hair dryer because of the small and easy to manage size.  She loves it too!  I usually get a couple of years out of my hair dryers and hope this holds true for this one.  I am VERY happy with this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Everyone that comes over comments: “WHERE did you get a hotel hair dryer! I WANT ONE!!!” it works great, I use it every single morning and also with some craft projects. it’s easy to use and i love love love how you just shove it in it’s holster (like slamming an old telephone haha) very satisfying because it turns OFF when you put it in its home. Love that about it. I also like the position of the grip.&lt;br /&gt;I mounted mine onto tile with two 3M heavy duty adhesive strips so we didn’t have to drill holes. It’s holding up well and when it is time to take it off, you just slide the base off it’s mount and work with it directly. Great buy</li>
            <li> It looks great on the wall, but just isn&#x27;t very powerful. Takes much longer to dry my hair, wish I had known.</li>
            <li> This wall mounted hair dryer is so nice... I also have the Sunbeam 1500 but I prefer this one.  It easily comes off the cradle, it is fairly quiet (compared to the Sunbeam) and the design is just more user-friendly.  Spend the extra few bucks on this one!  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I love my Wall mount hair dryer. It&#x27;s right there when I need it. I would highly recommend this to&lt;br /&gt;all my friends!</li>
            <li> Love it. Hangs on the wall, easy</li>
            <li> Originally I bought it because it was compact.  I&#x27;ve been buying these for almost 20 years and had two go kaput; fair enough. The quality is still good.  At least this one doesn&#x27;t have the night light and the price is right.  Plus they kept the same mounting scheme and it fits on the old bracket.</li>
            <li> I love it. No more clutter in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> This is my second Oster wall mount blow dryer. I loved the convenience of the first one so much that I purchased a second one after the first one quit working.  I use it every day and love how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> Dries very quickly. Only wish it was more compact like the old Sunbeam.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer quit working within one month.  It gets hot, but the blower does not come on - probably a fire hazard.  This is our second one of these, the first quit working within the first year!</li>
            <li> Like the Oster hair dryer a lot.  It is larger than my old one, but a lot more powerful.  Great choice!</li>
            <li> I have bought several Sunbeam 1500 wall mount dryers and they have only lasted one year.  The switch in the wall mount becomes inoperable.  Sunbeam owns Oster I think, but I decided the magnetic switch would be a nice change on the Oster.  I am very happy with the easier magnetic switch in the wall mount and the comfort when holding the dryer as I dry my hair. It fits the bracket already on the wall, which was used for the Sunbeam Dryer.  The price was cheaper also.  It can be used as 1200 w or 1500 w.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a Sunbeam 1500 and was VERY happy to find that the wall mount was compatible!&lt;br /&gt;Comparing the 2, the Sunbeam had 3 speeds, of which I only used the upper 2, and the Oster has 2 speeds, the &#x27;upper 2&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Attractive and easy install.  Husband thinks it does not have enough power and we are hoping the cord will relax with use. Great feature hanging on wall and not fighting with cords in drawer or cabinet, so we are going to try and adapt.</li>
            <li> A great dryer.  Always handy, but not in the way.  This is our second one and the first one lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Bought it because I&#x27;ve always liked the ones in the hotel rooms.  Has good power and lightweight.  Helps to organize my bathroom.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my dad. He loves it.</li>
            <li> Replacement for an old one of another brand.  Glad I read reviews first that explained the switch to up it from 1200 to 1500 and now very happy with it.</li>
            <li> We moved into a new house and my wife selected this one for her bathroom...I bought the Sunbeam with retractable cord for my bathroom.  I like hers (this one) better. Even though the Sunbeam attaches to the wall better, it is really bulky and noticeable.  This Oster is sleek and looks good.  They both operate nicely.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!! Does not look like a cheap add on  when mounted on wall and is much better than a hand held unit.</li>
            <li> Great product easy to use and keep in place on the wall and one in RV is great never forget the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, easy to use.  Always at your finger tips and doesn&#x27;t take up space in a drawer, etc.  I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> We had one before and when it came time to replace the unit we looked all over the area andcould not find a store that stocked the unit so we turned to Amazon and purchased our replacemnt a a lower cost and we were back in operation in two days</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I expected, will work great at my cabin</li>
            <li> So handy, works great, frees up counter top space in my small bathroom.</li>
            <li> This is the second one we have ordered, product works great, easy install and very powerful, last one was left on and clipped into the holder, it melted the holder enought so it would not stay in. Have had the first one about 4 years with no problems, use almost every day and still works well. Keeps the bathroom counter and cabinet free.</li>
            <li> Very easy to install&lt;br /&gt;Works great and the led light is great.&lt;br /&gt;It looks very neat on the wall.&lt;br /&gt;The different settings are perfect.</li>
            <li> As a frequent traveler, I&#x27;ve become accustomed to a wall mounted hair dryer.  Much more convenient and easy to use, just pull it off the wall and turn it on.  No more plugging it in, coiling when finished, putting it away, etc.  This hair dryer is powerful, easy to mount on the wall, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> nothing fancy - just what you&#x27;d expect.    If you don&#x27;t like the way that it &#x27;wobbles&#x27; slightly when mounted to the wall bracket, insert the 5th (optional) screw, as directed.</li>
            <li> this hair drter is great so far.  always  there  always handy. never have to fumble around looking for a hair dryer. just grab the handle and use it  end of story.</li>
            <li> This is my second hairdryer of the same model, the last one lasted 1.5yrs.  I like the dryer and bought a second one simply because it would fit the bracket.  We&#x27;ll see how long this one lasts.  I don&#x27;t abuse it plus it is set on the lower heat settings, as was the last one.  If this one only lasts 1.5yrs I&#x27;ll be looking for something different.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is small and compact and the wall mount is very convenient and space saving. Really works well for our small bathroom.</li>
            <li> There are not a lot of wall-mount blow-driers to choose from. This one seems to be a bit better than any other we&#x27;ve had. No regrets with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It functions well as a hair dryer, exactly the same as one you would find in a hotel.   However, the cord used to be super elastic (and it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m trying to drag it across the bathroom from wall-to-wall). It&#x27;s been almost 2 years since I purchased this and there is ZERO coil left in the cord. It&#x27;s like an extension cord is now hanging from my wall. This shouldn&#x27;t have happened so soon in my opinion.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A VERY HANDY DRYER.  IT SOLVES THE MESSY STORAGE PROBLEM.  THE DRYER COULD USE A LITTLE LONGER CORD.  I&#x27;VE USED THEM IN HOTELS QUITE OFTEN.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer.  Stylish and quite.  Tough to beat.  I had one for about 7 years and the fan blades came off and created some nice sparks.  If I could have gotten another fan blade, I could have easily fixed it.  I got my moneys worth out of it anyway.  Bought another one.  The only thing I would add would be a night light to it.</li>
            <li> Purchased in July of 2011, still reliable and doing the job.  This is the second wall hair dryer I purchased, the first one (not a well-known brand) died on me after a short time, but I believe Oster is a quality brand. Very convenient and actually fun to use.  If you have long hair, and need to use a dryer for more than 3 - 4 minutes, it probably won&#x27;t stand up to that kind of use.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well, was easy to mount on the wall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted one of these things forever--since I first saw one in a hotel. Every time I went to a hotel, I wrote down the brand with the intention of ordering one. Finally my old blow dryer went kaput, so I had an excuse to purchase this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I don&#x27;t know why the photo shows it somewhat pearly looking: it&#x27;s plain old white. Second, it was a bit larger than I expected and so it wouldn&#x27;t fit in the spot I had chosen for it. I ended up having to mount it above a towel bar since if it was below it would either be in the way of the light switches or it would have to under the hand towels and make an odd bulge. So I put it in myself--didn&#x27;t use the anchors as I think it will stay in place without. I hung a little picture next to it so it wouldn&#x27;t look so out of place above the towel bar by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works just as expected and I love having it ready to go whenever I am. One advantage I discovered with mounting it higher is that it&#x27;s never going to get caught on knobs or anything else--a frequent frustration when I&#x27;m tired in the morning. We had our first really cold day here (in the South) and I found it&#x27;s also handy for warming yourself up quickly when coming out of the shower; I&#x27;ve suggested it to my husband for that purpose (he&#x27;s bald and otherwise wouldn&#x27;t need it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update my review if I ever have problems with it, but so far it&#x27;s great--just have to get used to seeing it there on the wall.</li>
            <li> Great dryer! This is my third one. Very convenient to use...no messy cords to contend with. This is a quality item!</li>
            <li> Very easy to install &amp; use</li>
            <li> Works OK but mount design is poor.  Unit does not sit flat against the wall.  There is a high spot in the center which hooks onto the wall bracket.  Because of the small area against the wall, the unit rocks and there is a 1/4\\&quot; gap all around the edge.  Don&#x27;t understand why they didn&#x27;t make the back side flat.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works OK but it only has two speeds \\&quot;Lo\\&quot; and \\&quot;Hi\\&quot; and even the \\&quot;Hi\\&quot; setting doesn&#x27;t give much airflow and the amount of heat like the portable ones you can can get at cheaper prices. Also, the dryer doesn&#x27;t turn on automatically as some of the dryers I use in the hotels. You have to push a button to turn it on. Not sure if the dryers in the hotel are made exclusive like that. The base is a little poorly designed because it doesn&#x27;t flush with the wall so it may come out easily if you use a plastic anchor to mount it instead of mounting directly into a stud.</li>
            <li> We bought this dryer, because we have a tiny bathroom with little storage space.  It was easy to hang, but the bracket holds the unit away from the wall a bit.  It has adequate power and the controls are easy.  We are very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased at least three of these wall mounted hair dryers over the last few years. In my experience, they are good products initially but have not lasted for me. They are very easy to use but all of a sudden, go dead,even when you keep the fan area free of hair. And, they don&#x27;t seem to be repairable so they just get thrown away.&lt;br /&gt;This week, I called Oster about my latest problem and was told that if it&#x27;s past one year(it is), no help from them. To be fair, these dryers are used on a daily basis but by people(wife and I)who rarely have problems with other appliances, large or small. In other words, we try to be careful.&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I&#x27;ve noticed motels using a Andis brand dryer and some of the reviews state that they last for years. I just ordered one to replace my latest Oster and hope that it will last longer. I&#x27;m just reporting my experience with the Oster wall mount - maybe you&#x27;ll have better results.</li>
            <li> Easy wall mount.  Plenty of power with two settings.  Easy clean filter.  The cord is a little short so distance from out let to mirror is a consideration.  Overall, I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Nice dryer and very handy wall mount.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have bought 2 of these...the first one was a &#x27;welcomed gift&#x27;...nice having the new ones fit the original wall mount. Very good product...well satisfied with it&#x27;s performance.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> We had one of these over 18yrs old and it finally gave out!  The new one outdoes the previous model!</li>
            <li> I like the design and mounting, but unfortunately the a heating element stopped working and it barely blows warm air after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and they are the best hair dryer wall mount you are ever going to buy. Quality dryer that blows hot and hard enough to dry you hair very quickly and hang it back up and you are off and running. Anyone can mount it to the wall near an outlet and a mirror. I am on my 3 one over many many years and will not buy any other dryer when you can have this one to keep your life fast and simple and still looks good mounted on you wall.</li>
            <li> Purchased May 3rd. Died August 3rd. Smells like it burnt. Used 3 days per week. Unable to return. Will not purchase again. End of Short Story.</li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted and worked great for a few months, then one of the fan blades broke off for no apparent reason just after the warranty expired. No way to fix it, so it went into the garbage!</li>
            <li> The wall mount dryer is so convenient.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair so it works great for me but if you have long or thick hair it may not be powerful enough.</li>
            <li> bought it for the wife, and she no longer keeps the blow dryer under the sink. I would say she liked it to :</li>
            <li> This works great for me in the space where I needed it.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a wall hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Bought two of  these...and the best item ever. works nicely...fit on wall great and easy to install...Buying one more for my Dad .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older now and I have very thick hair this is very light weight for me to use and the love the convenience of having right there.&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to hang and don&#x27;t worry if it breaks down because all the dryers are universal and the wholes will line up to replace it if necessary.  I first used one of these and a hotel room and found it to be light and dried my hair fast.&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy to find one on line.</li>
            <li> This model was installed by our contractor and served well for several years, until one day its innards flew apart (nobody was hurt) -- so we bought a replacement.  The wall mount is very convenient.  Because we installed it low on a cabinet and the cord is a bit short, we hung it \\&quot;upside-down\\&quot; (i.e. cord on top), which requires the fifth (optional) screw through the hole in the magnet (otherwise it would slip right off the wall mount).  Power is adequate for me.</li>
            <li> This is the third wall mount I have purchased. L ove the convenience and that  I don&#x27;t have to keep in a drawer.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought this wall mount hair dryer.  I was happy to find it again, because I already had the mounting brackets still on the wall.  I have a very small space where it is mounted on the wall. Some of the other wall mount hair dryers I have looked at in stores and on line were too wide for the area I have. The hair dryer works well and the cord is perfect length. My first one just got old and need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> Nice appearance and feel. But I&#x27;ve gone through three of these now. With once-a-day use, none lasted more than a year without burning out.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000RZLL38 Oster Professional 76932-710 Wall Mount Hair Dryer]] OWNED THIS UNIT FOR LESS THAN THREE MONTHS AND IT QUIT. I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT BUY THIS BRAND EVER !</li>
            <li> I like these and have one in each bathroom</li>
            <li> Just what my wife wanted for the bath room. Just the right size to fit on the small apace next to the mirror. Was easy tp install and looks like a professional job of installation.</li>
            <li> looks good,easy to install fast ship like the fact you can take off vent and clean when its time also cord has not tangled</li>
            <li> Everyone should have one! So convenient hanging on my wall and out of the way. Please develop something like this for curling irons too</li>
            <li> We used one in a hotel on vacation and wanted one like it. This was the perfect buy. I ordered another one!</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE...... I purchased this March 2014 &amp; originally gave it 5 stars review; however, in less than 4 months the fan in the unit broke into many pieces causing the dryer to almost catch fire.  I reached out to the seller but received no response.  I had purchased this one because I had had a wall mount similar that lasted for years.  I have since ordered a Conair from someone else.</li>
            <li> I like the looks of these and have purchased a number of them for the rentals I manage as they mount on the wall. Out of about six I&#x27;ve bought, I have had one that I purchased in May 2015 to quit working, although it&#x27;s had very little use. But, I am replacing it with the same type.</li>
            <li> not as powerful as i would have liked.  dislike the on/off switch location.</li>
            <li> I had seen these before in various hotels/motels. Last week I asked the maintenance person at the Place d&#x27;Armes about these units, and was told that they were very reliable, my favorite criteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two on 2 day prime shipping and received them the very next day. They are unbelievably easy to install, and work flawlessly. No more dryers on the lavatory with the cords catching on the cabinet knobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an Andis Hang-up Turbo (Full sized) that lasted for 7 years. I was very happy with the Andis, but I bought the Oster due to it being off-white instead of white which looks a little more high end. I also got the Oster because it had smaller footprint because I installed a new medicine cabinet and I needed a wall mount dryer that would fit in a smaller space. So far, I noticed that it has pretty good blowing power, but it doesn&#x27;t run as hot as the Andis did, which may be better for my hair so it won&#x27;t get too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue with having a compact hair dryer vs. my previous full sized hair dryer is that the back fan is closer to my head. Because of this, when I held the dryer too close to my hair (which is long) and some hair got sucked into the fan in the back. I had to stop the dryer and untangle my hair from the fan.  This is no fault of Oster, I just have to get used to a shorter length of hair dryer! Just letting others know what to expect. So far I am pleased with the Oster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: It is July 2014, and it hasn&#x27;t even been a year that I&#x27;ve owned this dryer and my Oster has already died! I&#x27;m going to request a replacement.</li>
            <li> Works great! Have used in the past as well. I love it so much i placed three in each bathroom so family and guest could use.&lt;br /&gt;Easy hang wall mount&lt;br /&gt;Easy use&lt;br /&gt;Dryes hair fast</li>
            <li> Used one of these in a hotel and decided to get one for myself.  I love the convenience of hanging it on the wall.  No more knocking my dryer off the counter! Powerful. Dries quickly. Lightweight.  Have been using it for a couple months now with no complaints!</li>
            <li> We ended up buying two of these. One for each bathroom. Great hair dryer, not too loud, multi speed and compact out of the way. Like the ones in nice hotels it has it&#x27;s own GFCI protector so it can be installed by the sink. Save a drawer in the vanity, or get the counter cleaned off.</li>
            <li> I have owned this product. It lasted 3 years. The fan blades shattered into pieces.  I chose to replace it with the same unit. That translates into $10 /yr.  Prior to the Oster I had Sunbeams. One lasted 8 years. They are no longer available. There cost was 2/3&#x27;rds the cost of the Oster. Where are the economical competitors? Functionally, the latest Oster is much improved regarding sound. In fact it is whisper quiet by comparison. Overall, the product is very nice in display and function.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a very well made dryer.  Enough power for me with the two settings.  A little awkward to turn it on and off on the main piece but no big deal. We put it in a cupboard so it is out of the way.</li>
            <li> Very handy and useful in our bathroom.</li>
            <li> I have a cramped bathroom with little space for a hairdryer.  I actually often skipped drying my hair because it was too much hassle.  This makes it so so easy.  It may not be the absolute best hair dryer out there (Although it&#x27;s quite powerful and pretty good), but a fancy hairdryer won&#x27;t help you if it&#x27;s stuck in the under sink cabinet because you can&#x27;t be bothered to fetch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love this.  I don&#x27;t skip drying my hair anymore.  Works great, and so easy to hang up.  Just but a few nails near an outlet, and you&#x27;re done.  It&#x27;s the sort of thing everyone should have.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for one I had purchased several years ago. That one was well used as this one will be. I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it is identical to the dryer I use after my swim at the YMCA.  I can quickly dry and style my hair and love the fact that it is attached to the wall and ready to use.</li>
            <li> This replaced my previous hair dryer, same brand and model, that had lasted many years.  My wife couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I installed these in the bathrooms of our house.  No more hairdryers on the counters, tangled cords, etc.  No replacing the portable units every year.  Only wish is I had done this 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> Wall mount from much older model did not have to removed - perfect match.  Hope this one lasts as long.</li>
            <li> We had an Oster wall dryer for 10 years and it finally died.  This new one fit our old Oster wall plate for easy installation.  Power cord can be fitted to correct length so you won&#x27;t have any excess cord laying around.  Dryer is strong and not extremely noisy</li>
            <li> Works great. Have had it about a year. So nice to have it on the wall out of the way.  Easier than some to remove the lent sceen to clean.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer pointed out, this dryer does not sit flush with the wall.  You can see the metal mounting plate behind the unit.  There is at least a 1/4 inch gap between the wall and dryer.  If seems to work fine otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re worried about the finished look of the product, do not buy this.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I was hoping, but it installed easily.</li>
            <li> I received this item yesterday, tried it for the first time this morning.  It had sufficient power, but the air was warm at best, even on the high setting.  I could put my hand about an inch in front of the blower and leave it without getting burned.  Was really disappointed in this product.  I am returning it and will try another brand.</li>
            <li> Oster makes some great products.  This new dryer replaced an Oster wall-mounted hair dryer I installed in 1994!  Throughout all of these years it performed very well.  What really impressed me about the new unit was that I was able to mount it using the hardware from the old dryer;  all I had to do was slip it into place.  Thanks, Oster engineers, for that.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am ordering my 2nd hairdryer for another bathroom.  Great price and works great!  My unit has stopped working 2x, but when I looked at the filter, there was hair clogging it.  The unit will turn itself off to prevent overheating.  As soon as I cleaned out the hair, the unit worked great again.</li>
            <li> Installed this for my wife, to try to keep the counter uncluttered. Good quality product.Very easy to mount, easy to use. Would like the cord about 1ft longer, but love it anyway. Especially like the way it shuts off when you push it back in its holder, and it has a magnetic clasp to hold it..  Very happy</li>
            <li> The Wall Mount is invaluable and the drying power is very adequate.</li>
            <li> This is our second wall mounted hair dryer and I can see some improvements in the design.  We are very happy with its performance.</li>
            <li> Used one in a hotel and it sure was convenient.  No cords to tangle and no laying on counter to cool off prior to putting inside cabinet.  Has been a pleasure to use.  It works as good as any hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever bought.  Recommend</li>
            <li> We have two of these dryers at home in Michigan and purchased two more for our new condo in Florida.  Small but plenty powerful.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer I purchased in June has burned up and has to be replaced. It was great while it was working and wife loved it but surely it should have lasted more than 3 1/2 months.</li>
            <li> I really like this unit. My only complaint is that the cord stretches out after time. The convenience of having it on the wall and out of the way is awesome. If this one breaks, I will buy another one immediately.</li>
            <li> Bought this product thinking it was a good product.  After using this product about 5 times the on off button jams.  the on button doesn&#x27;t hold you have to hold the on button with one hand while drying your hair.  Design was poorly thought out as the on off button should have been on the handle.  It makes no sense to hold the dryer then having to push the on button on the wall mount then to turn off you then put the dryer back into the case to turn it off.  It seems like more work then just to have the controls on the dryer itself.  I bought this to save space but it ended up being a poorly designed dryer.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Small but powerful</li>
            <li> This is my second one - the first lasted about five years. For me, a perfect size - good value for the money with convenient wall mount access. I could understand that it might not be powerful enough for many women who have a full head of hair (such as my wife) but it works for me.</li>
            <li> Really great.  Got it in 2 days on a Sunday.  Thanks.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Hangs great in the RV . Powerful and compact</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a timely manner and was as advertized. It was purchased to replace an earlier model and mounted on the same wall brackes and so was a breeze to install.</li>
            <li> 3/2014  Worked great until one year mark.  Broke the week the warranty expired!  Cannot be replaced at this time.  I&#x27;ll have to repair the wall where it was mounted or get one just like it.  Not sure if a new one will last over a year or not. Edited Review: 5/25/15 Silly me for buying another one.  Purchased 3/28/14.  Broke 5/20/15.</li>
            <li> I have previously owed one of these and I really like the convenience of the wall mount. heat and air are great</li>
            <li> I enjoy the compact size and the wall-mount comes in handy when you don&#x27;t have a lot of counter space for hair dryers.</li>
            <li> Works just fine, and has a heavier, quality &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; than the cheaper ones. Mounts easy, and looks fine on the wall.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Convenient.</li>
            <li> Lots of power and is an excellent addition to our bathrooms.</li>
            <li> This product quit almost out of the box, returned it to Amazon, the replacement has been working fine. 04/16/2015 I spoke too soon, this one is just like the one before it, fan exploded in a dozen pieces. About 3 months out of warranty. I&#x27;ve had it with this model and manufacturer.</li>
            <li> What can I say - It&#x27;s a hair dryer!  I was hair dryer-less for quite a while and this one works great.  It attaches to the wall as advertised, is unobtrusive, doesn&#x27;t make too much noise when operating and has an acceptable range of heat adjustments.  I don&#x27;t know if the \\&quot;Professional\\&quot; makes me a better self-stylist, but is works well all the same.</li>
            <li> I wanted a smaller wall mounted &amp;#34;hotel style&amp;#34; hair drier for my wife and zoster is a brand I trust for years. It was easy to install in less than 10 minutes and my wife is very happy.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this dryer for eleven months without complaint, UNTIL NOW!  This morning, all six internal blower blades literally just suddenly fell apart.  What is otherwise a great product is ruined by the poorly made fan blades.  It&#x27;s obvious that the blade material is cheap and simply can&#x27;t hold up.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and wanted!</li>
            <li> This model is a little bigger than our older wall mount blow dryer.  I like the smaller size better, but needed to go with something that might last longer.  The on/off switch for this model is on the hanger (the wall mount) and not on the dryer itself.  I prefer the switch to be on the handle of the dryer.  Those details aside, the force and heat of the dryer is excellent for its size.  It dries my hair quickly.  I&#x27;m happy with this dryer.  Will have to wait to see what its longevity is.</li>
            <li> Over 10 years ago I bought a wall mounted blow dryer after using it in a hotel while on a business trip. I loved it!  When that died, I couldn&#x27;t find a dryer in any retail store that came close to its quality and durability.  Well, I have now! The Oster wall mounted dryer is easy to set up and easier to use. It&#x27;s powerful, but compact. It dries my hair faster, and styles it better than any product I&#x27;ve used to date. No popped circuit breakers, either, so I know it uses less energy.  I won&#x27;t be needing another blow dryer for the next decade. And is that ever nice!</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my reliable Sunbeam 1500 wall mount hair dryer which lasted over 4 years.  This model is the newer replacement version.  Newer but definitely NOT better. It lasted only 3 months before before it burned out; sparks, smoke and then death. Cheaply made junk!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and having it hang on the wall frees up counter space and not more tangled cords!</li>
            <li> After 6 months of daily use by my wife, I noticed a high pitched buzzing on top of the already *normal* noise from the unit.  I opened it up noticed the fan had come loose and slid into the cover allowing the blade tips to rub on the air inlet screen.  I pushed the fan back into place on the shaft and applied super glue to *hopefully* keep it from moving again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, lousy design and assembly detail, shame on Oster.  If your unit is making a similar *buzzing* noise rather like the old baseball card rubbing on bicycle spokes *game* kids play, don&#x27;t ignor it as the fan will eventually fail if not repaired....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, another lousy design *feature*, the magnetic retainer, is inadequate, the handset can be expected to fall out if not meticulously replaced...</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of the wall mounted hair dryer. I hated having to pull out my hair dryer every morning from under the sink, deal with the cord, then put it away when I was done. (I have a bad back which is at its worst in the morning and... I am NOT a morning person) Now I just pull it off the wall, push a button to turn it on, and place it back in the cradle to turn if off!!! I also love that the fan head is so short and very light! (I don&#x27;t have to hold the dryer far away from my head as with my previous heavy hand held dryer which has a long fan head)&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the air flow, which is good for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love these hair dryers.  I have one in ever bathroom. They hang on the wall and I don&#x27;t have guests asking me for a hair dryer all the time.  They have lots of power, they are easy to clean, and fairly light weight to hold while drying your hair.  What I don&#x27;t like is you can&#x27;t hide the plugin cord. But the good outweighs the bad. The convenience of the dryer on the wall was a great selling feature for me.  No more digging through drawers or cupboards to find the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Having this wall mount hair dryer has ben a real convience, It reduces a lot of cluter around the sink It works and looks well. One of the better things I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I had the same hair dryer for about six years, then it gave up.  I really didn&#x27;t want to have to find another kind and change the mounting bracket, etc.  So I ordered the same model number and the bracket was still the same!  Yeah!  I was able to change it out myself!</li>
            <li> Nice but does not blow hard enough for me. Styling is nice, good looking unit and ergonomic. I would recommend</li>
            <li> IT DOES A GREAT JOB AND IS UP AND OUT OT THE WAY~IT AUTOMATICALLY TURNS  OFF WHICH IS GREAT AWESOME</li>
            <li> Received on time and works great so far.</li>
            <li> still going stong . Works awsome!!!! love the space saving!</li>
            <li> I always order this hair dryer---it works well!</li>
            <li> This is a nice wall-mount hair dryer.  It is easy to install and works well.  Looks good.  Can&#x27;t say much else about it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, who liked the product until three of the plastic fan blades broke after 15 months of use. Most likely just one broke off, and its rattling around inside the housing immediately caused others to start breaking. Now the dryer is worthless. The warranty was for one year, so no luck there, and replacement parts cannot be found. Maybe 15 months is OK for a hair dryer at this price point, I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m buying another, and hope it breaks in under 12 months this time.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent hairdryer.  It&#x27;s easy to use, looks modern, and gets the job done.  The dust filter on the air intake can be removed for cleaning, but it&#x27;s not likely to fall off accidentally and get lost.  Contrary to what another reviewer stated, the unit turns off automatically when the hand-held part is replaced into the cradle (or the user can just press the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; button).  The price is certainly right as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer 5 years ago and it finally bit the dust. I bought it again because my last one received quite a bit of use and abuse and held up quite well. This one stood the test of time so why try another brand.</li>
            <li> Just like the units used at the Disney resorts! It works fantastic. Stays up and out of your way in the dressing room!</li>
            <li> Replaced an identical dryer I had for years.  Mounted right on to the bracket I had on the wall with my previous dryer.</li>
            <li> I have bought 4 of these over time and they are very handy for the bathroom.  Eliminate that struggle to locate a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Satisified with this unit, it works well. If needed we would probably order another or one similar to it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Jackie Wyrick</li>
            <li> Bought this dryer for a vacation rental. Received rapidly packaged very well.  Easy to install.  Looks good on wall. Good air flow with 1500 watt heat.  simple two speed.  Thank you.  Ken K. Maui</li>
            <li> We have always liked this product and have had several in the past. When one goes bad we have had a hard time finding one so I was real glad when I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good, powerful, adjustable air flow efficiently dries hair. Easy to mount in bathroom although I put in an extra screw to increase wall mount security.</li>
            <li> iT&#x27;S ok JUST OVERHEATS WHEN DRYING THE DOG AFTER HIS BATH.</li>
            <li> I first saw one of these in a hotel room many years ago and thought it would be great to have one at home. Have been using this brand ever since. (started out as a Conair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Best thing about these dryers is they are easily installed and seem to last a long time and if you need to replace one you just lift it up and put on the new one since the wall mounts are the same!  I have replaced several over the years and keep coming back to the same brand.  if you look close you and also increase the heat temperature up to 1500W but it works just as good at basic temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very cost effective if you buy from Amazon and look at pricing. (they  all look the same so buy right) easy to use, looks good, light weight and less hassle than taking out and putting away a heavy bulky dryer.</li>
            <li> This dryer works well and was very easy to install. directions were very clear and it is now anchored firmly on the wall. turns off automatically when dryer is put back in holder. This is a nice feature. All in all, very nice product.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer cuts off within a couple minutes.  I dry my hair with another hair dryer.  This one won&#x27;t even stay on long enough for me to style my hair.  I had one just like it for a couple years previously.  It worked much better.</li>
            <li> I have a small bathroom and space is at a premium.  I have used wall mounted hair dryers at hotels and they seemed to work satisfactorly.  I liked the style of this hair dryer, and the name Oster has always stood for quality. Another very important feature is the removable filter for cleaning.  All in all, I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always thought that Oster produced great products but not this time.  I purchased this hair dryer in November 2007.  This morning, without warning, it started smoking and glowing bright red inside.  I was able to pull the plug (the GFI never tripped).  I won&#x27;t be buying another one of these hair dryers.</li>
            <li> Love it, just like being a t a nice hotel.  I Have one in my guest bath also!  Your guests will love you!!</li>
            <li> I am purchasing my 5th unit.  They last anywhere from 3-5 years.  Thankfully mounting design has stayed the same so I just take down old and put up new.  Convenience and low price is worth replacing unit.</li>
            <li> While it remains to be seen if this product will last in the long term, it was only $30.  So I won&#x27;t be too upset if I only get a couple of years out of it.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s the perfect replacement for my wife&#x27;s dryer.  I&#x27;ve been fighting with the cord on that thing for the past three years in our small bathroom.  It was always in the way, getting wrapped around drawer knobs and caught in the drawers.  This appliance looks great, takes up very little space and was easily installed.  The mounting screws and anchors are too small, in my opinion, so I substituted something with a bit more heft that will hold up to pulling the dryer out of it&#x27;s slot over the long haul.  The dryer replaced one that was 1875W, but I don&#x27;t notice the difference in drying time.</li>
            <li> Very good easy installation.would recommend to anyone to try it,saw this in hotel and loved it</li>
            <li> Every time I dry my hair in a hotel, I say to myself...man, I would love to have one of these at home. So, now I do. It came quickly; was easy to install; and after 3 weeks of using it daily, I ask myself &amp;#34;why didn&#x27;t I get this sooner?&amp;#34;  Love it.</li>
            <li> The advertised pictures of this item are a lie.  The nozzle is much longer than pictured.  The picture on the box is different than what is in the box.  The actual item is much thicker... It sticks out almost 5 inches from the wall.  The listed dimension is 4 and 1/2 inches.. This is incorrect... It is closer to 5 inches than 4 and 1/2.  The images of on the website hide this dimension visually and the listed dimension is not even true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit was to be mounted just in front of a mirror but is too bulky to look appropriate.  I need a small unit.... like the one in the picture... Not what is in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit shuts off when returned to the base but does not turn on when removed from the base... Turning it on requires holding the hand set in hand while also pressing the on button on the base.. It would be easier to simply have the on switch on the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost just kept the item.. but then I would be playing into the lie.  So I will go through the trouble and possible cost of returning it, just on principle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these in each of our 3 bathrooms for at least the past 15 years.  It is still the best designed wall-mount dryer on the market.  Those reviewers who find the heat output on the weak side evidently have not read the instructions.  The dryer has two power settings: 1200 watts and 1500 watts.  It comes on the 1200 setting, but to boost it up to 1500, all you need to do is pry off the rear filter and click a switch to the higher setting.  You also need to vacuum out the filter about once a month to prevent the overheat protector from tripping.  But that is not a biggie, because you ought to vacuum and clean your bathroom at least twice that often anyway.</li>
            <li> Nice to have  the dryer right at hand</li>
            <li> The Oster wall mounted hair dryer is great. When I need to use the dryer I just take it off the wall. I don&#x27;t need to dig it out of a cabinet and don&#x27;t have cords all over the place. The dryer is powerful enough to get your hair dried quickly.</li>
            <li> This wall mounted unit was easy to install, has plenty of power and eliminates all the bother of storage and cord untangling of a portable unit. The automatic shutoff feature works great. The unit has 2 speeds, however the high speed is normally used.</li>
            <li> Love this hairdryer.....lots of power, super small, and compact. Love the ease of cleaning it too....easy to take the fan vent off and clean.  On and off switch is on the wall mounted unit, so it turns off when you return the dryer to the wall unit.  There is high and low, but no temperature switch.....which doesn&#x27;t bother me, but will bother others I am sure.  I actually mounted 2 on the wall using commercial grade Velcro, which works great.  I just did not want to put nails in the wall.  I actually bought 3 units, just to have one for backup, as I have never had good luck with hairdryers, but have a good feeling about this one!</li>
            <li> This is great product.  I brought one for my sisters and mother.  They really love it.  I also put on in our RV coach.  I would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Like this blow dryer because of the space savings. Had the other one for 6 yrs. before we needed to repurchase</li>
            <li> It works well but it takes a lot of room over the outlet. Large square plug cover both of them!</li>
            <li> I have had one since 1998 and loved the size and ease of use mounted on the wall, so when it started acting up and I needed to replace it... I was not sure if I would be able to find a replacement that I liked as much.  But this one was perfect!!!  I didn&#x27;t even need to remove the old wall mounting hardware, it connected right to my old hardware!!  Very happy.</li>
            <li> My old wall drier died when the fan split, but it had been good so I reordered.  It is as I expected.</li>
            <li> This dryer is what I wanted at a reasonable price. It was easy to put on the wall.</li>
            <li> Put this in our bathroom at our Oceanfront rental condo, and it works great.  Nice to be able to offer guests an option instead of them having to bring their own.</li>
            <li> Had to be replaced after about a year. Smelled smoke and had to unplug it. Will see how the second one does.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I have a bad thermistor in my unit because it kicks off within moments of turning it on.  I have short hair, so I&#x27;m not trying to dry a mane. So, I bought a regular hair dryer instead. Usually Oster is a great product, but not my unit.</li>
            <li> I replaced this unit after 15 years with the same model.  Works great, just need to clean fan area occassionally.</li>
            <li> This was exactly as advertised; I especially liked the dimensions given. Thanks to the reviewer who told me how to switch the lever behind the lint filter to get full power.</li>
            <li> This is a decent little hair dryer. Mine only lasted 18 months with daily use, then died completely. I have very thin hair and on most days only dry my bangs for a total of about 3 minutes drying time. The on/off button does jam and needs to be pressed very hard. The cord is a good length but tangles easily. My daughter has thick long hair and this dryer doesn&#x27;t work for her. Like most hair dryers if you get your hair too close to the fan it sucks it in. My only real complaint is that it died so quickly. If you are looking for a very basic dryer that can hang on the wall and you don&#x27;t mind replacing it every year or 2, this one is sufficient. I am going to try a different brand and see if I can find one that lasts longer than a year and a 1/2.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer.  It keeps my bathroom counter uncluttered and when I use it I feel like I&#x27;m in a hotel!  After seeing mine, several of my friends have purchased one too.</li>
            <li> While using it one day it all of a sudden sounded like it went on low, but it just lost its oomph and it never came back.  The next time I turned it on it ran for a few seconds then stopped working at all.  It had hardly been used, but I had it long enough that I couldn&#x27;t return it.  Bummer.  I liked the idea of having it hang on the wall.  I hadn&#x27;t even gotten around to hanging it yet.</li>
            <li> As described and quick shipping</li>
            <li> Love the convenience of having it on the wall and it works great.  It&#x27;s the second one I&#x27;ve owned and I would buy an Oster again.</li>
            <li> Performs fine, but kinda noisy. Was not easy nor neat to install due to poor power cord arrangement...had to modify wall mount housing.</li>
            <li> I love having this on the wall and out of the way so I&#x27;d give that 5 stars.  However, with that said this is the third one I have purchased in 8 years so they do not last.  At some point the thing will make a racket and spark and poof....toast.  But I will continue to rebuy and stick it up on the metal piece that is already on the wall as I do love having it on the wall.</li>
            <li> Great Product, easy to install and easy to clean the filter. Works very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Much!&lt;br /&gt;Dean Huey&lt;br /&gt;Columbus, Nebraska</li>
            <li> It took the place of my old one which died.</li>
            <li> Good hairdryer; Love the convenience of a wall dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these for ourrental beach cottage so renters wouldn&#x27;t have to use up space.  I just bought a third one.  I&#x27;ve used it myself while staying at the beach cottage and it&#x27;s great!!</li>
            <li> I liked this product. It works well,handy in the bath rooms. Easy to install. Ihave had other  Oster products and we are pleased with there performance.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this dryer. I wanted to return it, but between a restocking charge and postage it just isn&#x27;t worth the trouble.  The dryer is much larger than it looks and would stick out from the wall approximately 6 inches.  It will go into the donation box!!!  Don&#x27;t order it!!</li>
            <li> These seem to work up until a couple of months after warrantee expires in one year. .am ordering my third so I don&#x27;t have to fix the holes in my tile wall for a new backplate that may not cover it.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> Always loved how quickly my hair dried when I was staying at the hotel...now I have that same result at home.  I love the wall mount!</li>
            <li> I have had two hair dryers like this for years...One finally shelled out and I replaced it...am getting ready to move and will order two more!</li>
            <li> how did this product get so many 5 star reviews?&lt;br /&gt;The product is good and the idea of a wall mounted dryer is excellent. The product fails in my view because the three tiny &#x27;Mollies&#x27; supplied to hold it to the wall are pathetically under engineered. The dryer will just pull off the wall after a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;A better way to mount is to drill a second hole in the mounting plate and to screw it to a wall stud with long screws.&lt;br /&gt;Another good product hijacked by under engineered Chinese Manufacture!</li>
            <li> My husband does a lot of traveling and had commented he liked the hair dryers that are in hotels that hang on the wall. I bought us one and am sure glad I did. It&#x27;s nice just to reach up and have it there ready to use, instead of having it in a drawer or under the counter with the cord wrapped around it. Loved it so much bought our son and daughter one for there homes. They like theirs also.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very easy to mount. Even easier to use. The unit automatically shuts off when returned to the cradle. No need to spend money on higher priced units. Very nice product</li>
            <li> Great product. Have used similar dryer for 20 years in 2 bathrooms. This model seems quieter but still has the power.</li>
            <li> so easy to install, so sturdy. I love it!</li>
            <li> Great price. Replaced one I had for so many years.</li>
            <li> my bathroom looks neater</li>
            <li> The screws that they provide, unsatisfactory, had to be replaced with screws that work.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I like it!</li>
            <li> installation was easy. Have not used it yet. Not too big or bulky.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my bathroom size, ease of operation and storage and quality meets my needs.&lt;br /&gt;What is there to be said.</li>
            <li> The dryer is light and easy to hold with a sleek design. The wattage is strong enough to dry your hair quickly too!  Also, having the dryer wall mounted keeps the bathroom neat and tidy!</li>
            <li> This unit performs well and was easy to install.  We especially like the magnet &amp;#34;latch&amp;#34; which holds the dryer into the wall mount.  There are no plastic latch parts to break and you don&#x27;t have to push the dryer into the mount to lock it into place.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to handle, easy to hang up when done, works very well. Fairly loud but not obnoxious.  Seems very well made.</li>
            <li> Love the convenience of it hanging on the wall ready to use with a touch of a button</li>
            <li> Replaced my old (20 years old) Oster with new one.  It works just as good.  I have no&lt;br /&gt;regrets.  Great product</li>
            <li> Mounted in master bath, easy access makes drying hair a snap also added dryers in guest bathrooms.</li>
            <li> Use it in a Motor Home and works great.</li>
            <li> Received a replacement for this one that exploded about 4-6 months ago and that also blew up yesterday....if you use a hairdryer every day this is not the one for you. It would stop half way through drying (and it takes less then ten minutes to dry my hair) and I would have to let it cool off before it would restart. Glad I never mounted it.</li>
            <li> For commercial setting they are neat and clean but with heavy everyday use they get about 1-1.5 years before burning out. Very happy with the product and would recommend them to other businesses. I will be purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li> Love my hair dryer, best one ever.</li>
            <li> This does not mount CLOSE to wall. There is a quite large gap between hairdryer and wall. You can mount it with the provided bracket, or with a screw through the back. Either way there is a gap that requires caulking. Not a small gap.</li>
            <li> I have purchased three of these and have experienced the same demise with all three.  Two have been purchased from Amazon.  The last one was purchased on 11/1/14 and lasted 2 months.  The model before this one was purchased on 4/13/14 and lasted 7 months.  All three performed great until the propeller broke apart and the unit overheated.  I tried removing the broken pieces the first time, but found that the unit was still broken.  I chose to purchase the unit again because it fit the wall mount w/o needing to redrill.  I would not recommend this unit to anyone.</li>
            <li> works well, was a direct replacement for old unit, so it was very easy to reinstall, handy to use from wall mount</li>
            <li> Works very well so far.  Seems sturdier than other brands.  Dries hair quickly.  Noise is per a normal hair dryer.  Heat and air velocity both normal.&lt;br /&gt;I went through 3 or 4 of a competing model that would last only 1-2 years and then burn out.  I had just been replacing them because the new dryer would fit into the old wall mount, but decided not to keep shelling out money for an inferior product that did not last.&lt;br /&gt;Bought a different competing model but it started making a high pitched sound after 2 days, and did not get hot enough to efficiently dry hair so it was returned.&lt;br /&gt;Finally bought this one.  It is not as aesthetically pleasing as competing models, but not quite as ugly as the photo makes it seem.  The dryer is white and gray (wish it were all white), but the gray is a normal gray, not the greenish color that it looks like in the listing.  The wall mount does not install flush to the wall, as others have mentioned, but it is close enough.  I quickly got used to turning it on and off at the wall mount - it not the annoyance I anticipated.  In addition, if you put it in the wall mount while it is on, it automatically turns off, which is kind of convenient.  The best part of this dryer is that you can open the back and clean the fan blades.  I suspect build up of lint on the blades is what eventually caused the other dryers to burn out, and with the other dryers it is not possible to access the blades (at least not easily).  Thus, I expect this dryer to last longer.  There is also a &amp;#34;hidden&amp;#34; setting where you can turn the power up, and I did that when it first arrived.</li>
