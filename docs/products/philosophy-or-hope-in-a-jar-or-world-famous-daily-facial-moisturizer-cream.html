    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>All Philosophy products are great!  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent face cream.</li>
            <li>best , all the time.</li>
            <li>Good feel on face and neck!</li>
            <li>My skin at 53 is beautiful and luminous.  </li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be a happy, repeat customer, too.</li>
            <li>It is great for AM or PM.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is great, but Philosophy&#x27;s delivery was changed  a number of times.</li>
            <li>In the meantime I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Works great...</li>
            <li>I loved this product because it moisturized my skin and didn&#x27;t make it oily.  </li>
            <li>fair skin.</li>
            <li>I have used many top brand moisturizers (Lancome, Estee Lauder, Avon, Neutogena, etc.) and have found this to be the best, lightest one.</li>
            <li>Very light moisturizer with pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I got the product in good order and love the product.</li>
            <li>Have received compliments on how nice my skin is since using this product.</li>
            <li>My review is based on my own skin type.    </li>
            <li>I love this stuff - i&#x27;ve used it before but had forgotten how truly good it</li>
            <li>There really hasn&#x27;t been any Philosophy products that I dislike, but this should be on one the top 10 best beauty products list.</li>
            <li>My skin is very smooth now</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s very very light.    </li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;s a cream, it spread on very smoothly.    </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t give me break oust which is very important.</li>
            <li>love this cream, very smooth and silky</li>
            <li>It goes goes on very smooth &amp; is not greasy, it&#x27;s nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>that I didn&#x27;t love.  </li>
            <li>I like hope in a jar better than Estee Lauder, Elizabeth Arden, Clinique, Celex C, Avon, Mary Kay, Clarins, Biotherm, Prescriptives, Oil of Olay and even La Mer.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love Philosophy products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a cream.  </li>
            <li>It has repair properties and is wonderful under foundation for a lasting glow all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I felt my skin more moisturized but not greasy.</li>
            <li>Thanks Philosophy!!!!</li>
            <li>My fine lines are reduced and my enlarged pores look better.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easily.</li>
            <li>I own a whole bunch of them!</li>
            <li>This has a very light fresh smell.</li>
            <li>My skin looks radiant and feel so smooth.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and was so happy to get the larger size at such a good price.</li>
            <li>Hope in a Jar is a smooth light weight cream that seems to melt into your skin.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, Hope in a Jar is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Whenever I come back to my Hope in  Jar, my skin is happy.  </li>
            <li>I like this product, but it does not smell great, so I added some essential oil to it.</li>
            <li>The texture of the cream is extremely light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing, clean smelling, and is so creamy.</li>
            <li>Love the feel, and certainly the results.</li>
            <li>Thanks for being prompt in sending it and the packaging was safe and arrived in tact.</li>
            <li>The odor: It has true lavender oil in it, and you can tell.  </li>
            <li>This is the best moisturizer I have ever used, and I have tried many, including the incredibly expensive \\&quot;La Mer\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It feels like cream but quickly dissolves into a water like substance once it hits your skin.</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing.</li>
            <li>but since I&#x27;m getting older I need something more.</li>
            <li>My skin did not suck it up as quickly as the moisture surge, but unlike the Clinique Moisture Surge, it seems to be just the right combination of moisture addition, and moisture retention (something I feel the Moisture Surge Lacks).      </li>
            <li>Which is honestly the first time, after years of searching, that I have been able to say this for any moisturizer other than Clinique Moisture Surge.</li>
            <li>It is so moist and is absorbed into your skin as soon as it is applied.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>and I rarely get any break outs since I started using it.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>After the product was fully absorbed, my skin looked fresh and dewy (no, it&#x27;s not a miracle cream, it just gave my skin the non-dehydrated look).    </li>
            <li>I cant believe philosophy always has everything 100% right.</li>
            <li>Makeup seems to glide right over it.  </li>
            <li>At first I quite liked this product as it was recommended to me by a couple different friends, so I went out and purchased it.</li>
            <li>The first impression: \\&quot;Oh great, another cream that&#x27;s going to just turn me into an oil slick within 15 minutes.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>With that said, what I first noticed about the product:    </li>
            <li>I waited a while before reviewing the product because I have to use it first.</li>
            <li>Especially this face cream, it is my absolute favorite, Iv&#x27;e tried em all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard a lot of great things about this product, so finally I broke down and bought it.</li>
            <li>but it feels light and smooth, not think and heavy at all.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m really an oily skin</li>
            <li>really well&lt;br /&gt;have</li>
            <li>I love this facial moisturizer because it absorbs into the skin, and leaves skin feeling soft without any oily look.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and wouldn&#x27;t buy it in anything other than the jumbo size.  </li>
            <li>I use many other Philosophy products</li>
            <li>Like most women of a certain age, I have bought many brands of moisturizers and spent way too much money on stuff that just plain did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin but no problems with this product, you don&#x27;t have to use very much for coverage.</li>
            <li>In the morning, after applying at night, my face is soft and pretty.  </li>
            <li>Like another reviewer has stated, \\&quot;Oil of Olay\\&quot; works better or as well as this, for a lot less money....</li>
            <li>The only one other than hope in a jar that I&#x27;ve enjoyed (which I still do, VERY MUCH) is Clinique Moisture Surge -</li>
            <li>It is not greasy or heavy at all, and quickly gets absorbed which I really like.</li>
            <li>I was apprehensive about purchasing a new moisturizer.</li>
            <li>, I need more water in my skin, not oil or the slick substance that was in this product.  </li>
            <li>As a man I don&#x27;t want anything heavy or with a strong smell.</li>
            <li>With each purchase I had hoped that I would find a moisturizer that would actually DO something positive for my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a great cream only small other than that its a 5 star product with a 3 star size</li>
            <li>Was 40 years old when I started using it.</li>
            <li>I am a 59 year old woman.  </li>
            <li>It did not irritate my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it will diminish wrinkles or fine lines</li>
            <li>Short of Botox injections or surgery there are no miracles...especially for older skin.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old daughter put it on her face and the next day got a rash..........</li>
            <li>Most were irritating and perfumey resulting in red, blotchy skin.</li>
            <li>My skin has always been very dry and sensitive.</li>

            <li> Most were irritating and perfumey resulting in red, blotchy skin.</li>
            <li> My skin has always been very dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li> It has a catchy name and it is cheap compared to a lot of other brands on the market but actually using this doesn&#x27;t do anything, at least not for me.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m EXTREMELY acne prone due to high sebum production.  </li>
            <li> only used a week and will by other philosphy products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clinique moisturizer for a very long time.</li>
            <li> And I would suggest anyone with dry skin to use it.</li>
            <li> My skin does not feel greasy after and the dry skin is gone</li>
            <li> I do not have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really feel the difference, but I only used it for a couple of weeks as it started to smell very medicinal (in a bad way)</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s old or what.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks radiant and much less red.</li>
            <li> I personally wanted something a little richer for my dry skin and sun protection for during the day.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not not get it too close to your eyes because it will sting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundreds, if not more, on facial lotions, etc....</li>
            <li> Application: A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that it does not have any SPF.</li>
            <li> Hours later, no oil slick... in fact I do believe that rather than increasing sebum it actually decreased it (probably due to the actual hydration it recieved).    </li>
            <li> I am not sure if she had ever used Philosophy products before I bought this for her, but since she has spent a lot of money on the Philosophy line.  </li>
            <li> I do have a little sag at the jawline.</li>
            <li> In the summer time, I use this at night as well instead of Miracle in a Jar, as that would cause my skin to be a little oily.  </li>
            <li> I like a few</li>
            <li> not sure I&#x27;d order this again</li>
            <li> The previous one I purchased was for dry skin and it did not have an unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li> It lasts me at least 4 months, depending on whether I use it day and night.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strong, and though some people find it unpleasant, I certainly do not.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other products with lots of disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve broken out in a rash all over!</li>
            <li> Finally, skeptically, I tried philosophy&#x27;s hope in a jar.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with purchasing ANY Philosophy products and I should know</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s a bit too pricy for me.    </li>
            <li> The smell and texture was unpleasant and I did not see any changes as the jar promised.  </li>

            <li> All Philosophy products are great!  I haven&#x27;t purchased one yet that I didn&#x27;t love.  Works great, odor not overpowering.  I will cotinue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Have been buying this product since it was sold under the BioMedic brand that you had to get from the plastic surgeon&#x27;s office!  Has a medicinal smell, but it works well for keeping wrinkles at bay and clarifying the skin. Was 40 years old when I started using it. My skin at 53 is beautiful and luminous.  No wrinkles either.  I do have a little sag at the jawline.</li>
            <li> Short of Botox injections or surgery there are no miracles...especially for older skin.</li>
            <li> At first I quite liked this product as it was recommended to me by a couple different friends, so I went out and purchased it. I didn&#x27;t really feel the difference, but I only used it for a couple of weeks as it started to smell very medicinal (in a bad way) and I couldn&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li> I got the product in good order and love the product. Thanks for being prompt in sending it and the packaging was safe and arrived in tact.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent face cream. As a man I don&#x27;t want anything heavy or with a strong smell. This has a very light fresh smell. It is not greasy or heavy at all, and quickly gets absorbed which I really like. The only negative is that it does not have any SPF. If they would add an SPF of 15 or so, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hope in A Jar since the beginining of this year.  My skin looks radiant and feel so smooth.  The texture of my skin has also improved.  It is so moist and is absorbed into your skin as soon as it is applied.  I am a 59 year old woman.  It is worth the price.  I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> Stinks! Hate the smell!  Returned</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and was so happy to get the larger size at such a good price.I received it promptly too.Thanks so much</li>
            <li> I loved this product because it moisturized my skin and didn&#x27;t make it oily.  However, 2 days later....I&#x27;ve broken out in a rash all over!</li>
            <li> I am reviewing this for my wife.  I am not sure if she had ever used Philosophy products before I bought this for her, but since she has spent a lot of money on the Philosophy line.  No amount of words can praise a product quite like the expense report.</li>
            <li> Like most women of a certain age, I have bought many brands of moisturizers and spent way too much money on stuff that just plain did nothing for me. With each purchase I had hoped that I would find a moisturizer that would actually DO something positive for my skin. Some moisturizers were too oily resulting in break outs or a patent leather shine (ugh). Most were irritating and perfumey resulting in red, blotchy skin. None did anything for my enlarged pores or lines. Finally, skeptically, I tried philosophy&#x27;s hope in a jar. I LOVE IT! Your skin will be moisturized but not greasy. It did not irritate my extremely sensitive skin. My skin looks radiant and much less red. My fine lines are reduced and my enlarged pores look better.  I like hope in a jar better than Estee Lauder, Elizabeth Arden, Clinique, Celex C, Avon, Mary Kay, Clarins, Biotherm, Prescriptives, Oil of Olay and even La Mer. Try hope in a jar. You&#x27;ll be a happy, repeat customer, too.</li>
            <li> My skin has always been very dry and sensitive. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other products with lots of disappointment.  I started using this cream about 8 months ago and it has totally changed my complexion.I put t on at night before I go to bed and in the morning before I put on my makeup. My skin is very smooth now and I rarely get any break outs since I started using it. It is worth every penny. Just be careful not not get it too close to your eyes because it will sting.</li>
            <li> Good feel on face and neck!</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used, and I have tried many, including the incredibly expensive \\&quot;La Mer\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I cant believe philosophy always has everything 100% right. It&#x27;s moisturizing, clean smelling, and is so creamy. And I would suggest anyone with dry skin to use it.</li>
            <li> Hope in a Jar is a smooth light weight cream that seems to melt into your skin.  Pores seem to disappear and&lt;br /&gt;there is no greasy feel.  It is great for AM or PM.  Makeup seems to glide right over it.  You feel refreshed without  a shiny look.  You look and feel&lt;br /&gt;your best , all the time. That&#x27;s what I want from a moisturizer...</li>
            <li> Started using this years ago after Oprah called it one of her &amp;#34;favorite things&amp;#34;.  Yes, it is pricey...but you get what you pay for.  I would never use anything but this product on my face.  Love the feel, and certainly the results.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily. My skin does not feel greasy after and the dry skin is gone and I swear some of my wrinkle are gone. Have received compliments on how nice my skin is since using this product. I have sensitive skin but no problems with this product, you don&#x27;t have to use very much for coverage.</li>
            <li> This cream did not work as well as I had hoped.  The smell and texture was unpleasant and I did not see any changes as the jar promised.  Was not that moisterizing either, I need more water in my skin, not oil or the slick substance that was in this product.  I looked forward to using it up!</li>
            <li> I love Philosophy products. Especially this face cream, it is my absolute favorite, Iv&#x27;e tried em all. Im stickin with this!!!! Thanks Philosophy!!!!</li>
            <li> This is another Philosophy product that I have used for numerous years.  I do NOT go a day without it.  Doesn&#x27;t matter what the weather or the seasons, I use this product daily.  In the summer time, I use this at night as well instead of Miracle in a Jar, as that would cause my skin to be a little oily.  I love this product and wouldn&#x27;t buy it in anything other than the jumbo size.  It lasts me at least 4 months, depending on whether I use it day and night.  There really hasn&#x27;t been any Philosophy products that I dislike, but this should be on one the top 10 best beauty products list.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin. I was apprehensive about purchasing a new moisturizer. I had been a DEDICATED neutragena user for over like 20 yrs. Anyway, Hope in a Jar is fabulous. It feels like cream but quickly dissolves into a water like substance once it hits your skin. Super moisturizing. You never feel like you need to re-apply later. If you&#x27;re prone to acne then also get Hope in a Bottle. You cannot go wrong with purchasing ANY Philosophy products and I should know b/c I own a whole bunch of them!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great, but Philosophy&#x27;s delivery was changed  a number of times. The service department was non responsive.  In the future I will order through QVC.</li>
            <li> My review is based on my own skin type.    I do not have dry skin.  I have dehydrated/thirsty OILY skin.  I&#x27;m EXTREMELY acne prone due to high sebum production.  Because of that, it is very very difficult for me to find a moisturizer.  The only one other than hope in a jar that I&#x27;ve enjoyed (which I still do, VERY MUCH) is Clinique Moisture Surge - Unfortunately it&#x27;s a bit too pricy for me.    With that said, what I first noticed about the product:    The odor: It has true lavender oil in it, and you can tell.  It&#x27;s not strong, and though some people find it unpleasant, I certainly do not.    The consistency: I was hoping for a gel type but it&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s more of a cream.  However, it&#x27;s very very light.    Application: A little goes a long way.  Though it&#x27;s a cream, it spread on very smoothly.    The first impression: \\&quot;Oh great, another cream that&#x27;s going to just turn me into an oil slick within 15 minutes.\\&quot;    The final impression: \\&quot;WOW!!\\&quot;    So it took about 5-10 minutes for it to fully soak in, but it actually did (which is a surprise).  My skin did not suck it up as quickly as the moisture surge, but unlike the Clinique Moisture Surge, it seems to be just the right combination of moisture addition, and moisture retention (something I feel the Moisture Surge Lacks).      After the product was fully absorbed, my skin looked fresh and dewy (no, it&#x27;s not a miracle cream, it just gave my skin the non-dehydrated look).    Hours later, no oil slick... in fact I do believe that rather than increasing sebum it actually decreased it (probably due to the actual hydration it recieved).    Days later, my skin actually looks like it&#x27;s improving.      I will definitely be purchasing this product again, and again.  Which is honestly the first time, after years of searching, that I have been able to say this for any moisturizer other than Clinique Moisture Surge.</li>
            <li> I have used many top brand moisturizers (Lancome, Estee Lauder, Avon, Neutogena, etc.) and have found this to be the best, lightest one. It has repair properties and is wonderful under foundation for a lasting glow all day. I also do not break out using this product.</li>
            <li> They say you should change your skincare line with the seasons, because your skin adapts to the products.  Whenever I come back to my Hope in  Jar, my skin is happy.  I love this facial moisturizer because it absorbs into the skin, and leaves skin feeling soft without any oily look.  In the morning, after applying at night, my face is soft and pretty.  I use many other Philosophy products but this is a must.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using it some, I&#x27;m one of these people that thinks I have to try everything ! I&#x27;ve heard a lot of great things about this product, so finally I broke down and bought it. It goes goes on very smooth &amp; is not greasy, it&#x27;s nice and smooth. I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but it does not smell great, so I added some essential oil to it. The previous one I purchased was for dry skin and it did not have an unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my wife and she loves it&lt;br /&gt;It is a great cream only small other than that its a 5 star product with a 3 star size</li>
            <li> I waited a while before reviewing the product because I have to use it first. It&#x27;s been almost two weeks and this product is for me. I&#x27;ve been using Clinique moisturizer for a very long time. It&#x27;s ok but since I&#x27;m getting older I need something more. Hope in a jar suits my skin, I&#x27;m really an oily skin but it doesn&#x27;t give me break oust which is very important. I felt my skin more moisturized but not greasy. I may need to add Hope is not Enough depending on how my skin responds the longer I use hope in a jar. In the meantime I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the hype and belief in this cream. It has a catchy name and it is cheap compared to a lot of other brands on the market but actually using this doesn&#x27;t do anything, at least not for me..... I am in my mid-40&#x27;s &amp; have oily (still!) fair skin. I&#x27;ve spent hundreds, if not more, on facial lotions, etc.... I like a few but this is not one of them. Like another reviewer has stated, \\&quot;Oil of Olay\\&quot; works better or as well as this, for a lot less money....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, do not like this line and do not recommend. Maybe it is my oily skin?</li>
            <li> Works great...fiancé loves it.</li>
            <li> this product has a different oder.  Not sure if it&#x27;s old or what.  The texture of the cream is extremely light.  My 13 year old daughter put it on her face and the next day got a rash..........not sure I&#x27;d order this again</li>
            <li> After using this product for a week I can actually say that my face feels smoother in the morning. I put it on every night before bed.  I&#x27;m not sure it will diminish wrinkles or fine lines but it feels light and smooth, not think and heavy at all.  Only drawback....no sunscreen protection.</li>
            <li> love this cream, very smooth and silky&lt;br /&gt;does not leave face greasey&lt;br /&gt;absorbs really well&lt;br /&gt;have only used a week and will by other philosphy products</li>
            <li> Very light moisturizer with pleasant smell.  I personally wanted something a little richer for my dry skin and sun protection for during the day.</li>
            <li> The only cream I use on my face&lt;br /&gt;Need the larger size please&lt;br /&gt;Ill be back for more&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell or the way it turned watery upon application. I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - i&#x27;ve used it before but had forgotten how truly good it performs.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it were cheaper and I&#x27;d use it for a body lotion!!!</li>
