            <li>spatula is handy because I use it to scoop out some of my eyeshadow</li>
            <li>It is nice and sturdy and gets the job done</li>
            <li>I wanted these so I can play around with making my own beauty products.</li>
            <li>Both plates are nice.</li>
            <li>I received a discount on purchasing this for reviewing this product, but all reviews are my own.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own bag.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This comes with a nice plastic pouch to hold it in with the spatula, then a drawstring bag to carry it in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions.</li>
            <li>However your own opinion might vary.</li>
            <li>I try to do my reviews honest with the pros and cons</li>
            <li>I try to do my reviews honest with the pros and cons</li>
            <li>and this palette and spatula is ABSOLUTELY generous in size which allows me to experiment greatly and simultaneously!</li>
            <li>The spactula is nicely made as well.</li>
            <li>This would make a great unique gift of a make up lover.</li>
            <li>I use it to mix primer and my favorite foundation to get my own kind of BB cream.</li>
            <li>I keep a bottle of brush cleaner on my desk to give my brushes a quick wash after each use, it works perfect to clean this also.</li>
            <li>It is a good size for getting makeup out of bottles,but the palette makes mixing easy.</li>
            <li>Thumb-hole makes it very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love the finger hole (because I&#x27;m a klutz) and it&#x27;s a nice ergonomic feature.</li>
            <li>Great stainless steel makeup palette!</li>
            <li>Love the palette knife.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with my purchase and</li>
            <li>The seller shipped both of my purchases together and made sure they were not damaged during shipment.</li>
            <li>I love using a brush or my beauty blender with this.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of these as Christmas gifts for my daughters</li>
            <li>Fits perfect in my palm allowing for total control.</li>
            <li>I love it for mixing foundation and masks.</li>
            <li>Love that.</li>
            <li>I got this at a review and love it.</li>
            <li>This is such a great item !</li>
            <li>I am a pro makeup artist and I absolutely love this palette.</li>
            <li>This stainless steel palette and spatula are great for mixing make-up colors.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than premixed formulas.</li>
            <li>Love using this when applying makeup for my clients.</li>
            <li>and I love it. :)</li>
            <li>Good packaging, this is exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Came came quickly and cleans nicely.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to clean and sanitize in between uses.</li>
            <li>Perfect size, light weight enough to be easy to hold, but</li>
            <li>As expected, awesome quality.</li>
            <li>This makeup palette is a good quality stainless steel.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t see this set needing to be replaced for a while due to the great quality!</li>
            <li>I also like that everything is washable and can be easily sanitized.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The rubber ring makes it so comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very durable and has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li>The thumb hole has rubber in it making it comfortable to wear/</li>
            <li>Looks very professional and nice on any makeup vanity and to decorate the &amp;#34;girly cave&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This is a really cool pallet.</li>
            <li>I really was most interested in the spatula.</li>
            <li>Worth every Penny.  </li>
            <li>It is sturdy (as in not flimsy at all) and is just the right size.  </li>
            <li>The palette is just the right size.</li>
            <li>I used it to blend several cream foundations I have to test different colors on people and it worked great.</li>
            <li>I like to apply my liquid foundation with a brush, and this palette is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>When I first received it in the mail, I opened it and was truly amazed at the weight of it.</li>
            <li>Nicely packaged in a yellow cute pouch and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do - put some liquid makeup on there and not waste it on foam pads or the back of your hand.</li>
            <li>even more so with their customer service to check up and make sure I was satisfied with my product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any short vacation, rest assured it&#x27;s slim enough and has a nice thick plastic that it slides into with a little bag as well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not flimsy, very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Very helpful that it comes with</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy made, highly polished stainless steel just like a mirror on both sides.</li>
            <li>The bag it comes in is kind of cheap &amp; useless, but the actual palette &amp; spatula feel heavy duty &amp; great.</li>
            <li>the palette and spatula are both polished stainless regardless of what the color lt looks like, you can even see the reflection of my fingers holding the camera and a few smudges already from my fingers touching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>I can see myself in a product, and with facts that a potential customer might find useful.</li>
            <li>I can mix multiple things at a time because it&#x27;s pretty spacious, and</li>
            <li>The tool is a quality piece and offers itself for mixing to your hearts content.</li>
            <li>so you have literally no waste.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would change is make the flat head side a bit more flexible, but I know it&#x27;s hard to do that and keep it stainless steel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much heavier than I expected and because it has the rubber won&#x27;t move around on the counter when you have it resting.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a professional touch to a makeup artist.</li>
            <li>and I am not good with pics, but I put the fine point sharpie marker in there to show you the size of the spatula with something you could compare it to.</li>
            <li>Small enough to fit down in a narrow neck of a foundation bottle if need be but strong enough to not bend.</li>

            <li> I am not a professional, but makeup is a hobby</li>
            <li> It is highly polished also, pointed on one end and round on the other.</li>
            <li> seriously how much eye does one have?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on quiet a few jobs since I purchased it.</li>
            <li> heavy enough it will not bend or break.</li>
            <li> and I turn it into eyeliner with other products.  </li>
            <li> Other than that zero complaints.</li>
            <li> hold on my thumb or any other finger.</li>
            <li> I guess my only complaint would be the little plastic case to get the spatula out</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to worry about a mess or poked holes</li>
            <li> was a little too tight.</li>
            <li> This is a neat little palette.</li>
            <li> Not cheaply made at all.</li>
            <li> Small so check the measurements.</li>
            <li> Not sure how i would like the thumb holder</li>

            <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it. It is nice and sturdy and gets the job done</li>
            <li> Worth every Penny.  Works Great</li>
            <li> I received this at a cheaper rate for review. The seller shipped both of my purchases together and made sure they were not damaged during shipment. I wanted these so I can play around with making my own beauty products. Both plates are nice. This is the bigger one of the two I purchased.</li>
            <li> Great pallet and knife. exactly what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Worked as needed and as described. I guess my only complaint would be the little plastic case to get the spatula out was a little too tight. Needed to wiggle around to get it out. Other than that zero complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on quiet a few jobs since I purchased it. When I first received it in the mail, I opened it and was truly amazed at the weight of it. It&#x27;s not flimsy, very sturdy. Easy to clean. I would definitely order it again. However, I don&#x27;t see this set needing to be replaced for a while due to the great quality!</li>
            <li> This was a great product. It&#x27;s much heavier than I expected and because it has the rubber won&#x27;t move around on the counter when you have it resting. The spatula are solid and work to blend product well. I used it to blend several cream foundations I have to test different colors on people and it worked great. As a bonus the spatula is double-ended with a scraping end and I used it to scrape out the last of a lipstick which I wasn&#x27;t expecting. I also like that everything is washable and can be easily sanitized. The only thing I would change is make the flat head side a bit more flexible, but I know it&#x27;s hard to do that and keep it stainless steel. I received a discount on purchasing this for reviewing this product, but all reviews are my own.</li>
            <li> Great stainless steel makeup palette! As expected, awesome quality. I love using a brush or my beauty blender with this. Thumb-hole makes it very easy to use. The palette is just the right size. Not too large, and small enough for travel. Very helpful that it comes with it&#x27;s own bag.</li>
            <li> A bit smaller than I expected but no big deal!</li>
            <li> Great bargain, a must have if you love make up. I am not a professional, but makeup is a hobby and I want it all! I have always wanted one of these, just never invested in one yet. This one is superb! Perfect size, light weight enough to be easy to hold, but heavy enough it will not bend or break. It is very sturdy made, highly polished stainless steel just like a mirror on both sides. The picture makes it look white to me but it is not. The rubber ring makes it so comfortable to hold. I took a pic and I am not good with pics, but I put the fine point sharpie marker in there to show you the size of the spatula with something you could compare it to. It is highly polished also, pointed on one end and round on the other. Small enough to fit down in a narrow neck of a foundation bottle if need be but strong enough to not bend. Has a grip pattern on the handle so it doesn&#x27;t roll around and slide in your fingers. It is polished enough the picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice for color, the palette and spatula are both polished stainless regardless of what the color lt looks like, you can even see the reflection of my fingers holding the camera and a few smudges already from my fingers touching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with a nice plastic pouch to hold it in with the spatula, then a drawstring bag to carry it in. In my one pic, the yellow bag underneath is the carry bag. Very easy to clean and sanitize in between uses. I keep a bottle of brush cleaner on my desk to give my brushes a quick wash after each use, it works perfect to clean this also. Looks very professional and nice on any makeup vanity and to decorate the &amp;#34;girly cave&amp;#34;. I will be buying more of these as Christmas gifts for my daughters I am so happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions.

            <li> Very good quality, perfect size.</li>
            <li> Perfect size , good quality</li>
            <li> It has a nice mirror finish that I wasn&#x27;t expecting, and its the perfect size. Fits perfect in my palm allowing for total control. The tool is a quality piece and offers itself for mixing to your hearts content. cant complain at all 5/5</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged in a yellow cute pouch and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do - put some liquid makeup on there and not waste it on foam pads or the back of your hand.</li>
            <li> This is a really cool pallet. I love it for mixing foundation and masks. I use to us my hand to put some foundation onto it than use a brush to put it on my face. Now i can put it on the pallet than my face. Love that. Also the spatula will be great in getting the foundation out of the bottle.Not sure how i would like the thumb holder but i just dont use it so it does not bother me. I got this at a review and love it. This would make a great unique gift of a make up lover.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! It has excellent weight to it and has a beautiful mirror finish so I can mix make up on it AND use it as a mirror! I love the finger hole (because I&#x27;m a klutz) and it&#x27;s a nice ergonomic feature. The spatula is great and does the job! I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> good for freelance make up and mixing</li>
            <li> Was everything I needed.</li>
            <li> This is such a great item ! Durable and perfect for all my makeup needs . I am a pro makeup artist and I absolutely love this palette.</li>
            <li> This stainless steel palette and spatula are great for mixing make-up colors.  I would recommend this to everyone.  The spatula is especially helpful in getting the make-up from the bottom of the bottle so you have literally no waste.</li>
            <li> Great product and amazing customer service!</li>
            <li> great product! The bag it comes in is kind of cheap &amp; useless, but the actual palette &amp; spatula feel heavy duty &amp; great.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! I blend foundations, concealers, lipstick, and eye shadows  and this palette and spatula is ABSOLUTELY generous in size which allows me to experiment greatly and simultaneously! This was a great buy; quality, price, and the Amazon experience, THANK YOU!!</li>
            <li> very good, like the size and does the job!</li>
            <li> This is a neat little palette. I really was most interested in the spatula. It is a good size for getting makeup out of bottles,but the palette makes mixing easy. I use it to mix primer and my favorite foundation to get my own kind of BB cream. I like it better than premixed formulas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very durable and has a nice weight to it. Not cheaply made at all. The thumb hole has rubber in it making it comfortable to wear/ hold on my thumb or any other finger. The spactula is nicely made as well. Overall, it&#x27;s a professional touch to a makeup artist.</li>
            <li> Love using this when applying makeup for my clients. It keeps everything sanitary this way and I love it. :)</li>
