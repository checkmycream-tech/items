            <li>The color I chose matched my hair perfectly, to the point where it looks like someone took hair from my head and made extensions!</li>

            <li>and I love them!</li>
            <li>The first time that I ordered these extensions, they were perfect!</li>
            <li>Either way, I love these!</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>Extensions&lt;br /&gt;These are great, easy to put in and remove.</li>
            <li>and it came out amazing.</li>
            <li>so they are amazing.</li>
            <li>i actually really liked this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice, holds a curl, and can dye it.  </li>
            <li>so the customer service is really nice.</li>
            <li>I washed them and they came out thicker, which is nice.</li>
            <li>They are nice to have</li>
            <li>The length was just what I was looking for and to be honest</li>
            <li>I am being completely honest, I have fine/thin hair, and this works wonders.</li>
            <li>I rather safe and get good quality hair extensions like luxy hair.</li>
            <li>package said to treat them as you would your own hair</li>
            <li>They are nice.</li>
            <li>but i was thrilled when i saw these for under 35$.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a toss up.</li>
            <li>the best part os that i can curl and straight them...</li>
            <li>thats my own fault .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tangles very easily and the clips don&#x27;t want to stay in.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re going for a natural look these are perfect!</li>
            <li>honestly still a lot better than i thought i was going to get.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;d be nice to get some thicker and longer ones that have a better color to match my hair.</li>
            <li>Perfect color, perfect length, and it really was real human hair....</li>
            <li>I love, love, love, my hair extensions they are great and are so easy to put on.</li>
            <li>The quality of the hair is great and the color is exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very cheap looking.</li>
            <li>The color and length is really nice, however they do tangle extremely easy.</li>
            <li>I love, love, LOVE these.</li>
            <li>I love them, I just don&#x27;t know how to store them.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna order another pare. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Overall not a horrible product</li>
            <li>so maybe getting two sets would be better</li>
            <li>I love these hair extensions.</li>
            <li>I even dyed my first set successfully.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these.</li>
            <li>These are excellent quality extensions I would definitely recommend these!</li>
            <li>I say get them if you want some okay quality hair.</li>
            <li>and i love them.</li>
            <li>When purchasing extensions people dont realize that you need more than one pack.</li>
            <li>Buy two in slightly different lengths and its perfect.</li>
            <li>and I regret not buying 2 more sets.</li>
            <li>They do not tangle and they curl lovely.</li>
            <li>and i am enjoying wearing them</li>
            <li>The hair is okay.</li>
            <li>I would save up more money and buy belemmi hair extensions.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it would&#x27;ve gotten five stars:)</li>
            <li>I thought these were perfect, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve gotten better hair quality for 12$ before ..</li>
            <li>I would order from here again for sure.</li>
            <li>I had to order another package that was 10 clip in pieces with 100 g just to add on to that 17 clips better fill my head</li>
            <li>I love these extensions, they took about a WEEK to get to get delivered.</li>
            <li>They got here in a week (estimated time was MORE than a month.)</li>
            <li>EVERY form I&#x27;ve read about clip ins is you need to make sure you have 100-150g for extensions 10inches-16inches</li>
            <li>I always order an inch or two MORE than the length I want.</li>
            <li>My extensions arrived a week or so earlier then I was expecting which was awesome!</li>
            <li>Just so everyone knows, I LOVE this vendor for hair extensions.</li>
            <li>I would definiently recommend them:)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>Better off getting hair extensions with more g&#x27;s...</li>
            <li>Honestly, they&#x27;re this cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have them out of the packaging for more them 30 seconds and hair was falling everywhere.</li>
            <li>I love then and always receive a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li>i started wearing extensions 5 years ago, and i have been through many extensions, all of them way pricier than these.</li>
            <li>I love my hair extensions.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>Okay so I wouldn&#x27;t buy these.</li>
            <li>I ordered more in January just to make it thicker.</li>
            <li>I know better buying extensions off the Internet.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves them I have to get more for my youngest now also a wig for my daughter with alopecia</li>
            <li>I am so pleased.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love them tho ,</li>
            <li>i ordered #60, and so far, so good!</li>
            <li>They are really pretty good Quality.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the hair extensions was very good, there just wasn&#x27;t enough of it</li>
            <li>so I would be able to trim them just a bit to fit in with my hair</li>
            <li>i love these hair extensions, these are my first hair extensions and they are really great to have as my first.</li>
            <li>These were really good and blended very well in my hair.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to take care of</li>
            <li>These extensions were easy to put in and have been easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t easy you&#x27;re money.</li>
            <li>Their easy to put in</li>
            <li>But now that I know how to properly put them in and I (kind of) have a way to store them, they are good.</li>
            <li>I got the dark brown and it matched my hair color perfectly.</li>
            <li>The hair I recieved from were nice the first day I had them</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t curl it&#x27;s not human hair frys easily too off!!!</li>
            <li>Super fast and super great.</li>
            <li>And the smell is perfectly fine</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s secure, and it brushes easily.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I figured since my hair is fine</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m super glad</li>
            <li>Overall was very pleased!</li>
            <li>Very pretty!</li>
            <li>but overall, great cheap buy.</li>
            <li>They give plenty of room to cut them to fit your style.</li>
            <li>I put in all of the wefts and it still could look fuller, but I can&#x27;t complain because these are so cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>easy to clean</li>
            <li>I ended up getting them because of how cheap they were.</li>
            <li>My friend liked them so much</li>
            <li>I bought them back in December and they were great.</li>
            <li>Cheap quality for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>I think I will have to attach one clip to the middle of one but still happy</li>
            <li>They still are ok but they have gotten really short from the breakage, but they are good for beginners that just want them in on occasion.</li>
            <li>So far, they seem good.</li>
            <li>2 Sets of 7 pcs is good enough for me don&#x27;t need more then that .</li>
            <li>I just got these in the mail today, but I am so pleased with them that I want to write a review right away.</li>
            <li>other than that it was great, looking for fullness, you&#x27;re gonna need two packs or more.</li>
            <li>be they don&#x27;t even arch real hair!!!</li>
            <li>They are super easy to use.</li>
            <li>This hair is very soft and fine like my own.</li>
            <li>overall quick delivery and great for the price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars because the hair is beautiful and shiny and is great, just very thin.</li>
            <li>I originally was going to buy some at Sally, but after seeing the price tag of $125</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still able to blend them very well!</li>
            <li>Let me say that I was so excited when I ordered these extensions.</li>
            <li>I was so excited for them</li>
            <li>those who complain that they won&#x27;t hold dye: These aren&#x27;t the original colors of the hair.</li>
            <li>Still worth the buy!</li>
            <li>so if i were to buy another one id definantly have to order two but other than that i loved them!</li>
            <li>even if you have super fine hair</li>
            <li>I was really excited about that .</li>
            <li>They were very nice and long.</li>
            <li>I hope you enjoy these as much as I am!!</li>
            <li>I was super excited til I opened the product and seen the quality ......</li>
            <li>The last time I ordered these the quality was good</li>
            <li>they happen to match your hair perfect without dying go for it also for thick hair</li>
            <li>and it should be perfect for my thick hair</li>
            <li>this productit is very shiney and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast got it in 3 days, hair was so soft felt like my own , love it .</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, I got better quality than I expected, and I am happy with the order.</li>
            <li>They shipped a lot faster than i anticipated and the hair was nice and soft</li>
            <li>These have always lasted me a good while for the price, this is my second time buying</li>
            <li>If your hair is thick, 2 will make it perfect.</li>
            <li>Also true to color on package.</li>
            <li>I loved it , but I wished the hair last longer with out getting so tangled.</li>
            <li>so I know good quality and human hair</li>
            <li>i would recommend getting two packs, so the hair is super full.</li>
            <li>For my first hair extensions there &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;. They tangle VERY easily, don&#x27;t seem like real hair.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I brush it, it won&#x27;t stay tangle free or smooth.</li>
            <li>I am most likely going to purchase some more hair so that I have it as my hair continues to grow.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not 100% sure why everyone is giving such a low rating, these extensions are CHEAP!!!</li>
            <li>they were very long and i loved that</li>
            <li>ALWAYS read how much comes in each pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who complain about the shiny: Easy fix.</li>
            <li>I would need 2 or 3 sets but there isn&#x27;t enough room on my head to clip that many in!</li>
            <li>I love how soft they are!</li>
            <li>lol dont buy not worth the money!</li>
            <li>the clips are absolutely fabulous they all stay in my head very well.</li>
            <li>course these are cheap so don&#x27;t except much.</li>
            <li>Takes a while but its worth it for the price and quialty of the hair.  </li>
            <li>Not even worth the hassle of a rerun.</li>
            <li>They came with extra clips just in case, and a nice letter just letting you know about them.</li>
            <li>my hair color perfect, but the texture of it is so thin at the bottom.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even my husband thought they were worth it</li>
            <li>I will be as honest and as blunt as possible.</li>
            <li>Its fun to wear for a couple hours though.</li>
            <li>I havent tried bleaching them jet bc for the moment im broke, for the rest it was cool ;)</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money, they do look great and natural but they arent 100% human hair like they said, to most this may not be a problem</li>
            <li>I love my long hair, looks very natural and cute :) highly recommended !</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t the right item and needs to be returned.</li>
            <li>very well(I have them in curls in my hair right now!).</li>
            <li>I usually get my extensions at Sally&#x27;s for $150, these are GREAT.</li>
            <li>Great prices for extensions especially since this is real human hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*These clip ins are great if you only want the back of your hair to look thicker and</li>
            <li>the delivery was very fast</li>
            <li>The length is what she wanted and the price was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>They are the exact color as in the picture.</li>
            <li>Only a couple of hair strans reach the 20in I would rather pay for the price for better ones.</li>
            <li>they shipped fast!</li>
            <li>Try buying a higher gram set.  </li>
            <li>the color doesn&#x27;t exactly match</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure two sets would be enough.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend them to anyone who wanted to get them for an in expensive price and still look great!</li>
            <li>Will probably buy again, but only for hair length :)</li>
            <li>Their nice but their thin not enough to wear as full set extensions would not buy again good quality though</li>
            <li>so I should have ordered 2 packages on the first order.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For those who complain about the length: In my 7 years of getting extensions, I&#x27;ve NEVER had a pack come with the EXACT length.</li>
            <li>Very upset!</li>
            <li>I have been wearing extensions for several years now and I am pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li>The color was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It gives it so much volume!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different extensions</li>
            <li>I have colored it to match my hair color, used the hot iron and hot rollers on it.  </li>
            <li>This will be my first time using clip ins</li>
            <li>I am absolutely furious!</li>
            <li>Came on time exactly the day they said it would be shipped</li>
            <li>, must of came from a real proffesional hair dresser A++ to you !  .</li>
            <li>Other then that I was pleased and enjoyed the natural look .</li>
            <li>Nice hair extensions :) they are to thin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent hair, it&#x27;s soft but it does tangle quite easily.  </li>
            <li>Its soft and Smith so if you have thin fine hair this will be great for you, but if you have thicker hair I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li>(Pretty much any shampoo has this.)</li>
            <li>went with a 70g cause my hair is not thick so its the right one for my hair type.</li>
            <li>Also, they are VERY long which I love.</li>
            <li>I have found a way to curl and straighten them  To curl them make sure they are WET not damp and use a medium heat and hold till the hair is too hot to touch.</li>
            <li>Only good if you have long hair and are just trying to thicken it up.</li>
            <li>It is a little darker than my hair, but It was an easy solution to just alter my color to fit.</li>
            <li>Pure Barbie doll-like hair.  </li>
            <li>After looking through multiple exspensive hair extensions, I finally found these, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>but I bought 2 packs so its perfect for my thick hair plus it came a month before it was supposed to!!!</li>
            <li>The first one was good but the second one had something like glue all over it and the hairs were stock to each other...</li>
            <li>The hair is high quality for the price, and the color comes exactly as it states.</li>
            <li>that was to much</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to it&#x27;s arrival...</li>
            <li>The hair feels like real hair, can be curled and straightened.</li>
            <li>had to re-sew on the clips because they weren&#x27;t secure enough... practically not sewed on at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I really feel like when ive gotten my wear out of these I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 pks and its almost too much.</li>
            <li>Very unsatisfied</li>
            <li>So if you have thin hair this product would be great for you.</li>
            <li>I recommend these to any one who wants to ad leighnth to their hair.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t feel real, nor do the curl or straighten.</li>
            <li>Their great extensions they&#x27;re just waaaaay too thin</li>
            <li>specifically got them for prom, and had to wear them straight.</li>
            <li>but these really wouldnt have been of any use to me...</li>
            <li>You REALLY get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>The extensions are very thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks again for all your help</li>
            <li>I really really didn&#x27;t like this at all</li>
            <li>She has also kept them straight but also has curled them as well.</li>
            <li>need to be reinforced when you receive this pack as they are not sewn on very securely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Real hair,</li>
            <li>and it was also really inexpensive.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much fuller.</li>
            <li>await your response thanks</li>
            <li>It feels and looks close to real hair.</li>
            <li>all very well and fast, and all this and</li>
            <li>They are so soft and they were exact color that i wanted and the exact length.</li>
            <li>i wasn&#x27;t pleased at first, they where very itchy and didn&#x27;t match my hair texture,after washing them they where a little wavy like my hair.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s much more sparse than other brands.</li>
            <li>Believing it was human hair, I was excited for my item to arrive.</li>
            <li>I wish the hair itself was a bit thicker but other than that I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>Yes they&#x27;re soft and the color is pretty, but there might be a whole 8gms of hair there...</li>
            <li>Overall, quality was good, shipping was great, but quantity was very disappointing.</li>
            <li>If I would have gotten a dark brown they would have looked better.</li>
            <li>Well i got my extensions today and they are so pretty so soft,</li>
            <li>These are good for pick-a-boos or if you just need a little extra hair to play with (that&#x27;s why I got them).</li>
            <li>I will be using them for my wedding in about a week and a half and wanted longer, thicker looking hair but nothing over the top</li>
            <li>We did take them in to our hair dresser and she cut them slightly to blend into my daughter&#x27;s layers better.</li>
            <li>IT FALLS OUT OF THE CLIP EASILY, AND THERE IS NOT MUCH HAIR ON EACH CLIP.</li>
            <li>And I have super short hair</li>
            <li>Wondering if some are just using too high of a temperature.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I dyed it to match my hair a little better</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be honest, I already have long thick hair, but I just wanted a few more inches for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li>THIS ISN&#x27;T REAL HAIR DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li>so I could still look like a normal person.</li>
            <li>I normally buy my hair extensions at Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m purchasing another set because I would like to add a few more pieces to my head.</li>
            <li>I got my package within 8 normal days.</li>
            <li>I wan to buy more soon...</li>
            <li>I will be cutting them to lay more nicely with my natural hair shape.</li>
            <li>I have kind of thick hair</li>
            <li>so they look as thick as my own hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is ridiculously thick and the 160 gram extensions I already own didn&#x27;t blend well.</li>
            <li>The hair color was correct but that was the only thing right with this order.</li>
            <li>The hair had an odor right out the packaging, the clips tangled into my hair and pulled my hair out when taken the extentions out, and the extentions shed before even being brushed.</li>
            <li>When they finally got here they were NOT the right color.</li>
            <li>Its super long.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying these, and have no trouble with heat as long as the heat setting is on LOW!!</li>
            <li>Now I have my extensions for Christmas Eve through New Years.</li>
            <li>and they wouldn&#x27;t send me new extensions</li>
            <li>No, you don&#x27;t get as much hair, but you get the same quality and it will look like it&#x27;s your real hair.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 packs but 1 pack was good enough for my thick hair.</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>And the hair is very soft....</li>
            <li>also they are the exact same length as my 18&amp;#34; extensions.</li>
            <li>I had to change my hairstyle completely!</li>
            <li>I knew that most hair is thinner, and usually requires 2 packs.</li>
            <li>But nonethrless , they were the same exact ones.</li>
            <li>i have ordered so so soooo many extensions in the past.</li>
            <li>These extensions were so soft,easy to manage, and look natural!</li>
            <li>People actually thought the extensions were my real hair!</li>
            <li>is not human hair because it melted when a hot iron is used on them.</li>
            <li>Unlike most people, my hair is very thin and i only need 3 of the extensions that where in the package, i love them</li>
            <li>not real hair, burns after flat ironing and tangles easily.</li>
            <li>Very tangled, and different tones of hair.</li>
            <li>Need four packs to actually look like real hair.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Make sure you brush at least once a day</li>
            <li>Looks and feels like real hair, washes with regular shampoo &amp; conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your time or money on these cause</li>
            <li>As for the quality of the hair, it is real, 100% human hair</li>
            <li>and it is extremely soft.</li>
            <li>the hair not even look natural and each piece is BS</li>
            <li>They are completely washable and stylable.</li>
            <li>These are probably Asian hair, which i can&#x27;t imagine holds up to the 425 degrees my hair needs to get straight.</li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>Depending on how your natural hair looks, you will want to use a hair dryer on them to make them not as shiny as well.</li>
            <li>I tried to curl the hair with curling iron but the hair went back to straight in 15 minutes even after using some hair spry.</li>
            <li>These were absolutely destroyed after two washes, and the color that was sent to me was RED!</li>
            <li>The hair is soft</li>
            <li>Good!!!perfect hair,perfect color,look natural they arive before the time im waiting.</li>
            <li>very satsified and will definitely order remy extensions again!</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li>However the shipping was very convenient and there were extra clips.</li>
            <li>They came early.</li>
            <li>If you have thick hair, like I do, you&#x27;ll need more than one set...</li>
            <li>so you need to buy one more then one package if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li>Good product just confused that it&#x27;s an American product</li>
            <li>and they were thick towards the top</li>
            <li>The color is true, I got dark brown 20&amp;#34; and its true dark brown.</li>
            <li>No joke, I wouldn&#x27;t mind going back to this seller, but I also will (like always) look for other sellers too who will have something similar with better quality.</li>
            <li>Very thin &amp; the color is lighter than it was suppose to be, but Good for price, I don&#x27;t think I would order again online.</li>
            <li>I thought I would be okay because my hair is pretty thin, so I didnt think it would be a big deal when I saw others complaining.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>Other than that, shipment came on time and it put a smile on my face when I tried them on, so</li>
            <li>All in all no regrets on this purchase!!</li>
            <li>they do not taper off much toward the ends, they are very soft, and they are the correct length and color AND shipping is faster than the expected date.</li>
            <li>the color is NOT dark brown</li>
            <li>I had to trim the ends a bit but other than that they worked very well and are very soft.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have any major complaints.</li>
            <li>I mean, at such a bargain you can&#x27;t expect to get the top of the line clip in extensions.</li>
            <li>When i tried to curl the hair it fell flat and the ends frayed so i can only wear them straight.</li>
            <li>Generally when I spend $20+ on extensions on amazon</li>
            <li>, I barely even notice it.</li>
            <li>Far from human hair.</li>
            <li>i have to get hairdye to match my natural color, thats why i ordered the blonde</li>
            <li>and as for shedding of the hair I did not really get much of that.</li>
            <li>First off I want to state the only reason I&#x27;m giving this three stars is because this is not real hair, even though it states in the description that it is.</li>
            <li>They were ok the clips were not falling off and one was even broken</li>
            <li>So I got these today and are so thin and to top it off they came folded like 5x in just bubble wrap</li>
            <li>You will need to buy 2 or even more sets because the hair is astonishingly thin, but as mentioned in the description they were 70 grams, so what can one expect?</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve bought worse quality for WAY more money.</li>
            <li>Her hair is thin and this gives her more volume.</li>
            <li>so you must look at how many grams the hair is 70-100 grams is for thin hair &amp; 120</li>
            <li>They are a little more expensive but the quality is worth the price!</li>
            <li>They are easy to clip in and come with extra clips (although i&#x27;m not sure i am up to trying to sew them back on to the extension).</li>
            <li>I dyed my hair to match them, only to have to by new ones two weeks later.</li>
            <li>I bought these clip ins in January I not to long ago received them not because of amazon but because I live in the Caribbean and it takes forever for me to get my stuff.</li>
            <li>Very thin, nice quality for price.</li>
            <li>This time was a whole other story.</li>
            <li>and I hope this will be enough it is really nice hair just hard to find hair of it thick at the top and thick at the bottom</li>
            <li>hair is soft and looks like Remy human hair just not 20&amp;#34; was my only problem.</li>
            <li>But hey, if you have thin hair and are ok with having to possibly dye them, by all means but them!</li>
            <li>I tried curling them on high and low heat and NOtHING even tried just shampooing and braiding it and letting it dry and</li>
            <li>Matched really well to my dark brown hair</li>
            <li>they were not long at all the sucked</li>
            <li>Need at least 3 packs for a full head.</li>
            <li>False advertisement why can&#x27;t people just be honest and say they are not real hair !</li>
            <li>I mean with the 7 pieces over lapping each other, there will be more volume, but you would probably need 4 of these combined.</li>
            <li>when I initially went to buy them, I looked at the other reviews and most of the reviews said to buy 2 packs of the 7 piece sets if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li>The hair was much lighter than the previous pack I had bought.</li>
            <li>Now I know they weren&#x27;t gonna be super thick</li>
            <li>I really like the hair extensions, they are a little thinner</li>
            <li>but at least a little bit more.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> The color I chose matched my hair perfectly, to the point where it looks like someone took hair from my head and made extensions!</li>

            <li> The length was good, but the clips started to fall apart , and the hair wasn&#x27;t that good.</li>
            <li> Their a good use for curling .</li>
            <li> I loved theses hair extention</li>
            <li> Thank you for checking in, I love my hair extension they allow me a great amount of volume and length.</li>

            <li> I am very pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> Unless if I wanted to look a lol more drastic looking .</li>
            <li> /&gt;they came right on time , and matched my hair PERFECT !</li>
            <li> and i got a very nice letter along with the extensions :)</li>
            <li> still getting used to them though, very nice product i was pleased.</li>
            <li> they are great quality, really soft, and they stay in your hair perfectly!</li>
            <li> The price kept fluctuating and ended up being more when I placed my order, I emailed the person and they reimbursed me 5 dollars!</li>
            <li> I love the hair, the price, and the quality!</li>
            <li> i love them!</li>
            <li> Still love Amazon though!</li>
            <li> i absolutely love these extensions!</li>
            <li> But over all, I&#x27;m sort of satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> and I love them!</li>
            <li> The first time that I ordered these extensions, they were perfect!</li>
            <li> Either way, I love these!</li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> Extensions&lt;br /&gt;These are great, easy to put in and remove.</li>
            <li> and it came out amazing.</li>
            <li> so they are amazing.</li>
            <li> i actually really liked this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice, holds a curl, and can dye it.  </li>
            <li> so the customer service is really nice.</li>
            <li> I washed them and they came out thicker, which is nice.</li>
            <li> They are nice to have</li>
            <li> The length was just what I was looking for and to be honest</li>
            <li> I am being completely honest, I have fine/thin hair, and this works wonders.</li>
            <li> I rather safe and get good quality hair extensions like luxy hair.</li>
            <li> package said to treat them as you would your own hair</li>
            <li> They are nice.</li>
            <li> but i was thrilled when i saw these for under 35$.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of a toss up.</li>
            <li> the best part os that i can curl and straight them...</li>
            <li> thats my own fault .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tangles very easily and the clips don&#x27;t want to stay in.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re going for a natural look these are perfect!</li>
            <li> honestly still a lot better than i thought i was going to get.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;d be nice to get some thicker and longer ones that have a better color to match my hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect color, perfect length, and it really was real human hair....</li>
            <li> I love, love, love, my hair extensions they are great and are so easy to put on.</li>
            <li> The quality of the hair is great and the color is exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very cheap looking.</li>
            <li> The color and length is really nice, however they do tangle extremely easy.</li>
            <li> I love, love, LOVE these.</li>
            <li> I love them, I just don&#x27;t know how to store them.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna order another pare. :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Overall not a horrible product</li>
            <li> so maybe getting two sets would be better</li>
            <li> I love these hair extensions.</li>
            <li> I even dyed my first set successfully.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these.</li>
            <li> These are excellent quality extensions I would definitely recommend these!</li>
            <li> I say get them if you want some okay quality hair.</li>
            <li> and i love them.</li>
            <li> When purchasing extensions people dont realize that you need more than one pack.</li>
            <li> Buy two in slightly different lengths and its perfect.</li>
            <li> and I regret not buying 2 more sets.</li>
            <li> They do not tangle and they curl lovely.</li>
            <li> and i am enjoying wearing them</li>
            <li> The hair is okay.</li>
            <li> I would save up more money and buy belemmi hair extensions.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it would&#x27;ve gotten five stars:)</li>
            <li> I thought these were perfect, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve gotten better hair quality for 12$ before ..</li>
            <li> I would order from here again for sure.</li>
            <li> I had to order another package that was 10 clip in pieces with 100 g just to add on to that 17 clips better fill my head</li>
            <li> I love these extensions, they took about a WEEK to get to get delivered.</li>
            <li> They got here in a week (estimated time was MORE than a month.)</li>
            <li> EVERY form I&#x27;ve read about clip ins is you need to make sure you have 100-150g for extensions 10inches-16inches</li>
            <li> I always order an inch or two MORE than the length I want.</li>
            <li> My extensions arrived a week or so earlier then I was expecting which was awesome!</li>
            <li> Just so everyone knows, I LOVE this vendor for hair extensions.</li>
            <li> I would definiently recommend them:)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Better off getting hair extensions with more g&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> Honestly, they&#x27;re this cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have them out of the packaging for more them 30 seconds and hair was falling everywhere.</li>
            <li> I love then and always receive a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> i started wearing extensions 5 years ago, and i have been through many extensions, all of them way pricier than these.</li>
            <li> I love my hair extensions.</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> Okay so I wouldn&#x27;t buy these.</li>
            <li> I ordered more in January just to make it thicker.</li>
            <li> I know better buying extensions off the Internet.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them I have to get more for my youngest now also a wig for my daughter with alopecia</li>
            <li> I am so pleased.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i love them tho ,</li>
            <li> i ordered #60, and so far, so good!</li>
            <li> They are really pretty good Quality.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the hair extensions was very good, there just wasn&#x27;t enough of it</li>
            <li> so I would be able to trim them just a bit to fit in with my hair</li>
            <li> i love these hair extensions, these are my first hair extensions and they are really great to have as my first.</li>
            <li> These were really good and blended very well in my hair.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to take care of</li>
            <li> These extensions were easy to put in and have been easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t easy you&#x27;re money.</li>
            <li> Their easy to put in</li>
            <li> But now that I know how to properly put them in and I (kind of) have a way to store them, they are good.</li>
            <li> I got the dark brown and it matched my hair color perfectly.</li>
            <li> The hair I recieved from were nice the first day I had them</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t curl it&#x27;s not human hair frys easily too off!!!</li>
            <li> Super fast and super great.</li>
            <li> And the smell is perfectly fine</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s secure, and it brushes easily.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> I figured since my hair is fine</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m super glad</li>
            <li> Overall was very pleased!</li>
            <li> Very pretty!</li>
            <li> but overall, great cheap buy.</li>
            <li> They give plenty of room to cut them to fit your style.</li>
            <li> I put in all of the wefts and it still could look fuller, but I can&#x27;t complain because these are so cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> easy to clean</li>
            <li> I ended up getting them because of how cheap they were.</li>
            <li> My friend liked them so much</li>
            <li> I bought them back in December and they were great.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> I think I will have to attach one clip to the middle of one but still happy</li>
            <li> They still are ok but they have gotten really short from the breakage, but they are good for beginners that just want them in on occasion.</li>
            <li> So far, they seem good.</li>
            <li> 2 Sets of 7 pcs is good enough for me don&#x27;t need more then that .</li>
            <li> I just got these in the mail today, but I am so pleased with them that I want to write a review right away.</li>
            <li> other than that it was great, looking for fullness, you&#x27;re gonna need two packs or more.</li>
            <li> be they don&#x27;t even arch real hair!!!</li>
            <li> They are super easy to use.</li>
            <li> This hair is very soft and fine like my own.</li>
            <li> overall quick delivery and great for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars because the hair is beautiful and shiny and is great, just very thin.</li>
            <li> I originally was going to buy some at Sally, but after seeing the price tag of $125</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still able to blend them very well!</li>
            <li> Let me say that I was so excited when I ordered these extensions.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for them</li>
            <li> those who complain that they won&#x27;t hold dye: These aren&#x27;t the original colors of the hair.</li>
            <li> Still worth the buy!</li>
            <li> so if i were to buy another one id definantly have to order two but other than that i loved them!</li>
            <li> even if you have super fine hair</li>
            <li> I was really excited about that .</li>
            <li> They were very nice and long.</li>
            <li> I hope you enjoy these as much as I am!!</li>
            <li> I was super excited til I opened the product and seen the quality ......</li>
            <li> The last time I ordered these the quality was good</li>
            <li> they happen to match your hair perfect without dying go for it also for thick hair</li>
            <li> and it should be perfect for my thick hair</li>
            <li> this productit is very shiney and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast got it in 3 days, hair was so soft felt like my own , love it .</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, I got better quality than I expected, and I am happy with the order.</li>
            <li> They shipped a lot faster than i anticipated and the hair was nice and soft</li>
            <li> These have always lasted me a good while for the price, this is my second time buying</li>
            <li> If your hair is thick, 2 will make it perfect.</li>
            <li> Also true to color on package.</li>
            <li> I loved it , but I wished the hair last longer with out getting so tangled.</li>
            <li> so I know good quality and human hair</li>
            <li> i would recommend getting two packs, so the hair is super full.</li>
            <li> For my first hair extensions there &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;. They tangle VERY easily, don&#x27;t seem like real hair.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I brush it, it won&#x27;t stay tangle free or smooth.</li>
            <li> I am most likely going to purchase some more hair so that I have it as my hair continues to grow.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sure why everyone is giving such a low rating, these extensions are CHEAP!!!</li>
            <li> they were very long and i loved that</li>
            <li> ALWAYS read how much comes in each pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who complain about the shiny: Easy fix.</li>
            <li> I would need 2 or 3 sets but there isn&#x27;t enough room on my head to clip that many in!</li>
            <li> I love how soft they are!</li>
            <li> lol dont buy not worth the money!</li>
            <li> the clips are absolutely fabulous they all stay in my head very well.</li>
            <li> course these are cheap so don&#x27;t except much.</li>
            <li> Takes a while but its worth it for the price and quialty of the hair.  </li>
            <li> Not even worth the hassle of a rerun.</li>
            <li> They came with extra clips just in case, and a nice letter just letting you know about them.</li>
            <li> my hair color perfect, but the texture of it is so thin at the bottom.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even my husband thought they were worth it</li>
            <li> I will be as honest and as blunt as possible.</li>
            <li> Its fun to wear for a couple hours though.</li>
            <li> I havent tried bleaching them jet bc for the moment im broke, for the rest it was cool ;)</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money, they do look great and natural but they arent 100% human hair like they said, to most this may not be a problem</li>
            <li> I love my long hair, looks very natural and cute :) highly recommended !</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the right item and needs to be returned.</li>
            <li> very well(I have them in curls in my hair right now!).</li>
            <li> I usually get my extensions at Sally&#x27;s for $150, these are GREAT.</li>
            <li> Great prices for extensions especially since this is real human hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*These clip ins are great if you only want the back of your hair to look thicker and</li>
            <li> the delivery was very fast</li>
            <li> The length is what she wanted and the price was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> They are the exact color as in the picture.</li>
            <li> Only a couple of hair strans reach the 20in I would rather pay for the price for better ones.</li>
            <li> they shipped fast!</li>
            <li> Try buying a higher gram set.  </li>
            <li> the color doesn&#x27;t exactly match</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure two sets would be enough.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend them to anyone who wanted to get them for an in expensive price and still look great!</li>
            <li> Will probably buy again, but only for hair length :)</li>
            <li> Their nice but their thin not enough to wear as full set extensions would not buy again good quality though</li>
            <li> so I should have ordered 2 packages on the first order.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For those who complain about the length: In my 7 years of getting extensions, I&#x27;ve NEVER had a pack come with the EXACT length.</li>
            <li> Very upset!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing extensions for several years now and I am pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> The color was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It gives it so much volume!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different extensions</li>
            <li> I have colored it to match my hair color, used the hot iron and hot rollers on it.  </li>
            <li> This will be my first time using clip ins</li>
            <li> I am absolutely furious!</li>
            <li> Came on time exactly the day they said it would be shipped</li>
            <li> , must of came from a real proffesional hair dresser A++ to you !  .</li>
            <li> Other then that I was pleased and enjoyed the natural look .</li>
            <li> Nice hair extensions :) they are to thin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent hair, it&#x27;s soft but it does tangle quite easily.  </li>
            <li> Its soft and Smith so if you have thin fine hair this will be great for you, but if you have thicker hair I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> (Pretty much any shampoo has this.)</li>
            <li> went with a 70g cause my hair is not thick so its the right one for my hair type.</li>
            <li> Also, they are VERY long which I love.</li>
            <li> I have found a way to curl and straighten them  To curl them make sure they are WET not damp and use a medium heat and hold till the hair is too hot to touch.</li>
            <li> Only good if you have long hair and are just trying to thicken it up.</li>
            <li> It is a little darker than my hair, but It was an easy solution to just alter my color to fit.</li>
            <li> Pure Barbie doll-like hair.  </li>
            <li> After looking through multiple exspensive hair extensions, I finally found these, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> but I bought 2 packs so its perfect for my thick hair plus it came a month before it was supposed to!!!</li>
            <li> The first one was good but the second one had something like glue all over it and the hairs were stock to each other...</li>
            <li> The hair is high quality for the price, and the color comes exactly as it states.</li>
            <li> that was to much</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to it&#x27;s arrival...</li>
            <li> The hair feels like real hair, can be curled and straightened.</li>
            <li> had to re-sew on the clips because they weren&#x27;t secure enough... practically not sewed on at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I really feel like when ive gotten my wear out of these I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 pks and its almost too much.</li>
            <li> Very unsatisfied</li>
            <li> So if you have thin hair this product would be great for you.</li>
            <li> I recommend these to any one who wants to ad leighnth to their hair.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t feel real, nor do the curl or straighten.</li>
            <li> Their great extensions they&#x27;re just waaaaay too thin</li>
            <li> specifically got them for prom, and had to wear them straight.</li>
            <li> but these really wouldnt have been of any use to me...</li>
            <li> You REALLY get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The extensions are very thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks again for all your help</li>
            <li> I really really didn&#x27;t like this at all</li>
            <li> She has also kept them straight but also has curled them as well.</li>
            <li> need to be reinforced when you receive this pack as they are not sewn on very securely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Real hair,</li>
            <li> and it was also really inexpensive.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much fuller.</li>
            <li> await your response thanks</li>
            <li> It feels and looks close to real hair.</li>
            <li> all very well and fast, and all this and</li>
            <li> They are so soft and they were exact color that i wanted and the exact length.</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t pleased at first, they where very itchy and didn&#x27;t match my hair texture,after washing them they where a little wavy like my hair.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s much more sparse than other brands.</li>
            <li> Believing it was human hair, I was excited for my item to arrive.</li>
            <li> I wish the hair itself was a bit thicker but other than that I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Yes they&#x27;re soft and the color is pretty, but there might be a whole 8gms of hair there...</li>
            <li> Overall, quality was good, shipping was great, but quantity was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> If I would have gotten a dark brown they would have looked better.</li>
            <li> Well i got my extensions today and they are so pretty so soft,</li>
            <li> These are good for pick-a-boos or if you just need a little extra hair to play with (that&#x27;s why I got them).</li>
            <li> I will be using them for my wedding in about a week and a half and wanted longer, thicker looking hair but nothing over the top</li>
            <li> We did take them in to our hair dresser and she cut them slightly to blend into my daughter&#x27;s layers better.</li>
            <li> IT FALLS OUT OF THE CLIP EASILY, AND THERE IS NOT MUCH HAIR ON EACH CLIP.</li>
            <li> And I have super short hair</li>
            <li> Wondering if some are just using too high of a temperature.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I dyed it to match my hair a little better</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be honest, I already have long thick hair, but I just wanted a few more inches for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li> THIS ISN&#x27;T REAL HAIR DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> so I could still look like a normal person.</li>
            <li> I normally buy my hair extensions at Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m purchasing another set because I would like to add a few more pieces to my head.</li>
            <li> I got my package within 8 normal days.</li>
            <li> I wan to buy more soon...</li>
            <li> I will be cutting them to lay more nicely with my natural hair shape.</li>
            <li> I have kind of thick hair</li>
            <li> so they look as thick as my own hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is ridiculously thick and the 160 gram extensions I already own didn&#x27;t blend well.</li>
            <li> The hair color was correct but that was the only thing right with this order.</li>
            <li> The hair had an odor right out the packaging, the clips tangled into my hair and pulled my hair out when taken the extentions out, and the extentions shed before even being brushed.</li>
            <li> When they finally got here they were NOT the right color.</li>
            <li> Its super long.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying these, and have no trouble with heat as long as the heat setting is on LOW!!</li>
            <li> Now I have my extensions for Christmas Eve through New Years.</li>
            <li> and they wouldn&#x27;t send me new extensions</li>
            <li> No, you don&#x27;t get as much hair, but you get the same quality and it will look like it&#x27;s your real hair.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 packs but 1 pack was good enough for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> And the hair is very soft....</li>
            <li> also they are the exact same length as my 18&amp;#34; extensions.</li>
            <li> I had to change my hairstyle completely!</li>
            <li> I knew that most hair is thinner, and usually requires 2 packs.</li>
            <li> But nonethrless , they were the same exact ones.</li>
            <li> i have ordered so so soooo many extensions in the past.</li>
            <li> These extensions were so soft,easy to manage, and look natural!</li>
            <li> People actually thought the extensions were my real hair!</li>
            <li> is not human hair because it melted when a hot iron is used on them.</li>
            <li> Unlike most people, my hair is very thin and i only need 3 of the extensions that where in the package, i love them</li>
            <li> not real hair, burns after flat ironing and tangles easily.</li>
            <li> Very tangled, and different tones of hair.</li>
            <li> Need four packs to actually look like real hair.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Make sure you brush at least once a day</li>
            <li> Looks and feels like real hair, washes with regular shampoo &amp; conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your time or money on these cause</li>
            <li> As for the quality of the hair, it is real, 100% human hair</li>
            <li> and it is extremely soft.</li>
            <li> the hair not even look natural and each piece is BS</li>
            <li> They are completely washable and stylable.</li>
            <li> These are probably Asian hair, which i can&#x27;t imagine holds up to the 425 degrees my hair needs to get straight.</li>
            <li> Wow...</li>
            <li> Depending on how your natural hair looks, you will want to use a hair dryer on them to make them not as shiny as well.</li>
            <li> I tried to curl the hair with curling iron but the hair went back to straight in 15 minutes even after using some hair spry.</li>
            <li> These were absolutely destroyed after two washes, and the color that was sent to me was RED!</li>
            <li> The hair is soft</li>
            <li> Good!!!perfect hair,perfect color,look natural they arive before the time im waiting.</li>
            <li> very satsified and will definitely order remy extensions again!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> However the shipping was very convenient and there were extra clips.</li>
            <li> They came early.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, like I do, you&#x27;ll need more than one set...</li>
            <li> so you need to buy one more then one package if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> Good product just confused that it&#x27;s an American product</li>
            <li> and they were thick towards the top</li>
            <li> The color is true, I got dark brown 20&amp;#34; and its true dark brown.</li>
            <li> No joke, I wouldn&#x27;t mind going back to this seller, but I also will (like always) look for other sellers too who will have something similar with better quality.</li>
            <li> Very thin &amp; the color is lighter than it was suppose to be, but Good for price, I don&#x27;t think I would order again online.</li>
            <li> I thought I would be okay because my hair is pretty thin, so I didnt think it would be a big deal when I saw others complaining.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> Other than that, shipment came on time and it put a smile on my face when I tried them on, so</li>
            <li> All in all no regrets on this purchase!!</li>
            <li> they do not taper off much toward the ends, they are very soft, and they are the correct length and color AND shipping is faster than the expected date.</li>
            <li> the color is NOT dark brown</li>
            <li> I had to trim the ends a bit but other than that they worked very well and are very soft.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have any major complaints.</li>
            <li> I mean, at such a bargain you can&#x27;t expect to get the top of the line clip in extensions.</li>
            <li> When i tried to curl the hair it fell flat and the ends frayed so i can only wear them straight.</li>
            <li> Generally when I spend $20+ on extensions on amazon</li>
            <li> , I barely even notice it.</li>
            <li> Far from human hair.</li>
            <li> i have to get hairdye to match my natural color, thats why i ordered the blonde</li>
            <li> and as for shedding of the hair I did not really get much of that.</li>
            <li> First off I want to state the only reason I&#x27;m giving this three stars is because this is not real hair, even though it states in the description that it is.</li>
            <li> They were ok the clips were not falling off and one was even broken</li>
            <li> So I got these today and are so thin and to top it off they came folded like 5x in just bubble wrap</li>
            <li> You will need to buy 2 or even more sets because the hair is astonishingly thin, but as mentioned in the description they were 70 grams, so what can one expect?</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve bought worse quality for WAY more money.</li>
            <li> Her hair is thin and this gives her more volume.</li>
            <li> so you must look at how many grams the hair is 70-100 grams is for thin hair &amp; 120</li>
            <li> They are a little more expensive but the quality is worth the price!</li>
            <li> They are easy to clip in and come with extra clips (although i&#x27;m not sure i am up to trying to sew them back on to the extension).</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair to match them, only to have to by new ones two weeks later.</li>
            <li> I bought these clip ins in January I not to long ago received them not because of amazon but because I live in the Caribbean and it takes forever for me to get my stuff.</li>
            <li> Very thin, nice quality for price.</li>
            <li> This time was a whole other story.</li>
            <li> and I hope this will be enough it is really nice hair just hard to find hair of it thick at the top and thick at the bottom</li>
            <li> hair is soft and looks like Remy human hair just not 20&amp;#34; was my only problem.</li>
            <li> But hey, if you have thin hair and are ok with having to possibly dye them, by all means but them!</li>
            <li> I tried curling them on high and low heat and NOtHING even tried just shampooing and braiding it and letting it dry and</li>
            <li> Matched really well to my dark brown hair</li>
            <li> they were not long at all the sucked</li>
            <li> Need at least 3 packs for a full head.</li>
            <li> False advertisement why can&#x27;t people just be honest and say they are not real hair !</li>
            <li> I mean with the 7 pieces over lapping each other, there will be more volume, but you would probably need 4 of these combined.</li>
            <li> when I initially went to buy them, I looked at the other reviews and most of the reviews said to buy 2 packs of the 7 piece sets if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> The hair was much lighter than the previous pack I had bought.</li>
            <li> Now I know they weren&#x27;t gonna be super thick</li>
            <li> I really like the hair extensions, they are a little thinner</li>
            <li> but at least a little bit more.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair i recomend buying two packs because if you dont it wont blend right.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair, so one pack would definitely not be enough for anyone I feel.</li>
            <li> cause i hate havin short hair , and i finally have long pretty hair :)</li>
            <li> My hair is super thin, so I only ordered 1 package.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve curled them and flat ironed them with no problems.</li>
            <li> for the product, I flat ironed them as soon as I pulled them out.</li>
            <li> If you want to straighten them, use your flat iron at 300 or lower.</li>
            <li> but my 3rd time i ordered these it took way to long to come</li>
            <li> Instead I got one big long strand of hair.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thin hair myself, and putting these in makes it SUPER thick.</li>
            <li> It came a little early!</li>
            <li> Ordered this same hair from other sellers and it was 100 percent human for the same price.  </li>
            <li> I wore them once and the second day the ends were so dry</li>
            <li> and it was so thin that it didn&#x27;t appear natural when put in with real hair.</li>
            <li> It was only a single track of hair for someone to sew in..</li>
            <li> /&gt;*There are not dark brown or what I thought to myself as dark brown</li>
            <li> The second time that I ordered these extensions, there were short black ones that were obviously not real human hair.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that they don&#x27;t hold curls very well.</li>
            <li> ITS ONE FIVE FOOT LONG WEFT OF HAIR WITH NO CLIPS.</li>
            <li> Be careful with heat on them, use a low heat if you do.</li>
            <li> &quot; long as it said in the description.</li>
            <li> I got them way earlier than expected</li>
            <li> While the hair is long-</li>
            <li> They were rough and coarse and frayed at the ends.</li>
            <li> It was really strange.</li>
            <li> &quot; long.</li>
            <li> They also didn&#x27;t l sat as long as others hair did.</li>
            <li> Dry flat on towel or hang dry with chip bag clips on coat hangers.</li>
            <li> A little thin and difficult to style, but good price!</li>
            <li> These are sooooo so thin, and they thin out at the bottom even more!</li>
            <li> The hair was very rough, tangled, and definitely not 20\\</li>
            <li> but after I started to notice the ends got really dry and also the lengths as well.</li>
            <li> However these alone are only meant for thin hair, so if you have normal to thick hair they wont do much</li>
            <li> and my hair is pretty thin.</li>
            <li> and they were instantly weighed down and</li>
            <li> My only complaints was the packaging was kind of poor, and the hair was very thin.</li>
            <li> The clips are not sharp enough to part my hair and hold without trouble and they are strangely heavy.</li>
            <li> I guess I was due for a miss, but these were absolutely not worth the money I paid for them, even at a low price.</li>
            <li> I ordered two packs in the darkest brown, and they got here waaay before the expected shipping date they gave me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid three times as much for extensions that were way worse in quality.  </li>
            <li> but I should of known since I spent 20 bucks.</li>
            <li> I received the extensions a day before the expected date, so that&#x27;s always a thumbs up.</li>
            <li> These extensions were not real human hair when I got them they would not curl or do anything it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> All though they aren&#x27;t not real hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not real hair.</li>
            <li> And only a few strands, literally like 5 strands of hair, made it to 20\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Not much hair at all now</li>
            <li> They do not come in the right size, they are not real, they frizz up or start to break with any heat, it took a month for them to get here, and they sent me the wrong color.</li>
            <li> I read a loooot that these were very thin but also that they were worth the $30...</li>
            <li> The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it a five star was because on one of the small extensions pieces came off of the clip, so I had to use it with bobbie pins...</li>
            <li> This is not real hair!</li>
            <li> ITS NOT REAL HAIR IS BARBIE HAIR!</li>
            <li> May be disappointed if you are looking for more volume then length</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> These won&#x27;t curl extremely well unless you have a lot of hair spray.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read other reviews</li>
            <li> i have extremley short hair , so its hard to cover the tracks );</li>
            <li> So I bought two of the 20&amp;#34; dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; came in one long strip with no clips whatsoever and the hair was extremely thin and fake, sent it back straight away</li>
            <li> I do have naturally thick hair, but these gave me that extra boost of volume and length I was looking for.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair just buy an extra set and clip them together.</li>
            <li> The only problem is I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> I will concur that the hair pieces are not super thick, but as another review stated what do you expect for the price and for them being clip-on pieces vs. actual extensions you would get put in at a hair salon.</li>
            <li> Was not the color expected and did not include all clips!!</li>
            <li> They were supposed to be dark brown but look black, the hair is falling out of the clips, they DON&#x27;T curl which is one of the reason I wanted them.</li>
            <li> I ordered 20 inch extentions in dark brown, and they sent me 12 inches in black.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they tangle a little, and you do have to wash them with moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> longer I had to do a half up half down style to make it blend well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided I could do without until I saw these for much less.</li>
            <li> Not only did I spend soo much only to realize their fake</li>
            <li> extensions came in package folded in half &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> reviews.they did have a slight kink in them but</li>
            <li> This will also change the color slightly , which is what you want.</li>
            <li> and they sent me 1b 1 black</li>
            <li> I knew that when buying it from previous reviews but brought it anyway.</li>
            <li> I get the jet black 7 piece extensions.</li>
            <li> These are very thin, look over processed, and I&#x27;m sad to say I won&#x27;t be able to wear them.   </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re thick and lasts so long.</li>
            <li> I wanted to go a little darker anyways.</li>
            <li> When I bought this item I was expecting them to be a little bit thicker.</li>
            <li> I used them to add a little length and volume.</li>
            <li> i am hoping to try and add to each clip a little from another set i have.</li>
            <li> &quot; so it looks a little thicker.&lt;br /&gt;Kinda bummed..</li>
            <li> is very thick and it was only 70 g</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> Yes, they are thin but they do look thicker when properly brushed.  </li>
            <li> To all you people who rated this very low because of how thin it was, it&#x27;s 70g</li>
            <li> I have already recommended this product to a few friends.</li>
            <li> informs me these are fake and didn&#x27;t take they professional dye</li>
            <li> waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste any money on this product again.</li>
            <li> I wasted $50 on these</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Biggest waste of money.</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair, one pack is enough.</li>
            <li> I want a refund for all the waste of my time and money on these extensions.</li>
            <li> the description say HUMAN HAIR, that is false.</li>
            <li> but I hate that I have to brush them constantly for them to look like really hair again.</li>
            <li> Also I tried to curl my hair with my straightner (which I have before with previous hair extensions) and these extensions will not curl at all!</li>
            <li> people said like a cat took half my hair off !</li>
            <li> (I have thick hair, they looked super fake on me soooo thin)</li>
            <li> I feel really bad as I write this comment down, but I was really unsatisfied with these Hair Extensions.</li>
            <li> I have very similar hair so unfortunately after a while even with teasing and spray it slides down.</li>
            <li> So not entirely true !</li>
            <li> This is the most disappointed I have ever been while ordering online!</li>
            <li> cuz I just wasted my time and money :/</li>
            <li> No, they&#x27;re not super thick</li>
            <li> well when I got them I was really surprised on how thin they were and i have thin hair</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, I should have known better.</li>
            <li> This extension is very thin and i won&#x27;t add any length even when i use the whole set because the ends are really thin.</li>
            <li> Very dark brown!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even hit past my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> Am I the only one who received fake hair?</li>
            <li> basically, when I wear it, its like I have really thick hair then at the very bottom I randomly have thin hair.</li>
            <li> I usually get my hair extensions from Sally&#x27;s which are kinda pricey if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Two sets will not fit on my skull and  I will not purchase again!</li>
            <li> So usually i buy my extensions at Sallys for over 100$</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Not sure if I can get a refund anymore...</li>
            <li> Also  if you have thick hair, these will look very odd.</li>
            <li> I have bought these a few times before, they are a little thin</li>
            <li> i read the other reviews saying that these were thin before i purchased them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they are too thin like other reviewers.</li>
            <li> They are thin, poorly put together, and NOT HUMAN HAIR.</li>
            <li> , not a good purchase, not worth my money, clip are weak and don&#x27;t hold</li>
            <li> This will eliminate the ultra shiny and dull them.</li>
            <li> Every extension I&#x27;ve had is always hard to dye.</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s hard to impress in terms of buying un-needed beauty products.</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t matter if they where a little thin.</li>
            <li> If I could give a negative one I would.</li>
            <li> I ordered these extensions despite the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> but i have thick hair</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair like I do, do not get them.</li>
            <li> but it pays off when you are trying to blend with thick hair.  </li>
            <li> is really thick</li>
            <li> And I will agree with any of the reviews that say anything about thick hair,</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair, so I probably would&#x27;ve had to buy like 3 of these.</li>
            <li> -160 and up is for thick hair</li>
            <li> so if you have thick hair or want your hair to look thick</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest these to someone that has thick hair, they are quite thin, but they definitely helped my thin hair thicker, which is what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied!</li>
            <li> These did not work for me whatsoever, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they won&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed and, pardon me, but completely pissed off.</li>
            <li> and they sent me the wrong color i ordered dark brown</li>
            <li> the ends there is seriously like 4 strands, and thats what makes it to 20\\&quot;..</li>
            <li> the clips were the only bad thing</li>
            <li> how could someone sell such a bad product???</li>
            <li> Not good quality hair is synthetic and they get tangled</li>
            <li> Really thin recommen two packets for thick hair😃👏</li>
            <li> They are fairly thin &amp; I have thick hair</li>
            <li> The hair is thin, so if you have thick hair you will need two packages.</li>
            <li> Very thin and a waste of money and time putting them in.</li>
            <li> This product is awful way to thin and stringy not even worth $$$</li>
            <li> I feel dumb for even thinking these would work.</li>
            <li> It will give a fullness at least!</li>
            <li> It was extremely thin and dry, it felt like really badly mistreated extensions.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t recommend this for people with very thick hair like mine.</li>
            <li> They were extremely thin and I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> The hair is too thin</li>
            <li> They are too thin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quality of the hair is thin....</li>
            <li> , it could have been worse...</li>
            <li> Total crap</li>
            <li> its on the thin side.</li>
            <li> These extensions were not 20 inches, the hair was so thin it felt</li>
            <li> like somebody else had already worn them, the clips are poorly sued in (one already came off within a month).</li>
            <li> even did you have thin hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend to people with thin hair or buy two or 3.</li>
            <li> They are thin as can be.</li>
            <li> Yes they are thin</li>
            <li> Shockingly thin.</li>
            <li> They were so thin, and the burned into shreds when I tried to curl them...</li>
            <li> They came in on time, but they are really thin.</li>
            <li> Worse than hair used on baby dolls.</li>
            <li> my hair on the thin side itself</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so thin</li>
            <li> This hair was way too thin</li>
            <li> Yes, the hair is thin</li>
            <li> These are the worse extensions I have ever bought these are no way</li>
            <li> They are WAY to thin...</li>
            <li> if you have really really thin hair they may work for you if you are looking to just add some length</li>
            <li> so I knew that the hair would be thin</li>
            <li> Yes they are thin, but since my hair is thin</li>
            <li> The hair extensions are extremely thin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supper thin hair .</li>
            <li> Yes, their thin, but I&#x27;m wearing them now</li>
            <li> yeah, these are too thin.</li>
            <li> Probably way too thin.</li>
            <li> but when you got to the bottom, they were so thin.</li>
            <li> These extensions are thin but did the job for me.</li>
            <li> they are on the thin side, but thats what two packs were for.</li>
            <li> Also I have thin</li>
            <li> but the ends are scraggly thin and appear damaged.&lt;br /&gt;*The</li>
            <li> I had to order two sets because they were so thin.</li>
            <li> yes its thin</li>
            <li> but they were extreamly thin</li>
            <li> They were just thin.</li>
            <li> i dont like them ,too thin</li>
            <li> They are soooo thin.</li>
            <li> i had to trim them to blend with my hair and thin my hair</li>
            <li> this is false advertisement at its finest.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> TALK ABOUT FALSE ADVERTISING.</li>
            <li> However, like others have commented: It is EXTREMELY thin; pencil thin and almost needle thin towards the tips.</li>
            <li> Thin thin thin.</li>
            <li> False advertisement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very thin and hard to style.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smelled weird when I opened the package.&lt;br /&gt;The clips are poor quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No it didn&#x27;t it was just to thin and fake looking, plus</li>
            <li> They are completely synthetic and crap!</li>
            <li> These are fake and thin.</li>
            <li> The quality of hair was also very poor and thin.</li>
            <li> I like the extensions except that the ends are very thin my hair is already thin at the bottom</li>
            <li> Little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I usually get the euronext extensions from sallys and the ones i had were getting really bad</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time and energy to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I should of ordered the expensive ones</li>
            <li> WTF.</li>
            <li> but they are so expensive, so</li>
            <li> I had like 32 clips in my head which was uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have a weird smell at all.</li>
            <li> When I received them and opened the package I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> They are soooo fake, they won&#x27;t curl or anything.</li>
            <li> they looked fake as s</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just unrealistic.</li>
            <li> I was mortified by this idem unfortunately</li>
            <li> so I did not wanna buy something expensive</li>
            <li> Horrible hair extensions,not enough hair on them.</li>
            <li> Fake hair&lt;</li>
            <li> So I read all the reviews on these, and I was a bit skeptical about them.</li>
            <li> But... I bought the wrong color...</li>
            <li> wrong color and 8 inches shorter than ordered</li>
            <li> So they are useless to me.</li>
            <li> Horrible I got synthetic hair extensions instead of human hair extansions as stated</li>
            <li> They will melt with a flat iron and look horrible</li>
            <li> For those who are mad about how thin they are: read the description.</li>
            <li> These extentions are so incredibly thin its laughable!</li>
            <li> But I have very thin hair</li>
            <li> But very thin.</li>
            <li> Very very thin at the bottom.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair</li>
            <li> , however it was very thin.</li>
            <li> Very thin hair</li>
            <li> This one is very thin</li>
            <li> the customer service with them is terrible and the shipping took way to long.</li>
            <li> i was wrong, these are so thin its a bad hair to clip ratio.</li>
            <li> Truly a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Really disappointing.</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting mine to 16\\</li>
            <li> But when I saw these, I was kinda crazy about them just because of the price.</li>
            <li> Not even cutting a couple inches off would help.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t really go wrong!</li>
            <li> This hair is so fake!</li>
            <li> They looked so fake and stringy!</li>

            <li> Very poor quality!</li>
            <li> but it is very difficult to use and curl.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of buying hair online, and from amazon.</li>
            <li> i ended up getting synthetic which tangles and is annoying and feels weird</li>
            <li> we will see, kinda disappointing :(</li>
            <li> as for shedding, I have gotten some fallout but it&#x27;s nothing too bad</li>
            <li> Also has a bad smell</li>
            <li> , these extensions aren&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and chose to ignore all the bad ones and try it for myself.</li>
            <li> Just bad.</li>
            <li> and woa the bad reviews.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Waste of money The hair is too thin</li>
            <li> They were ok the clips were not falling off and one was even broken but the hair was really good I bought 2 and that was to much the clips were the only bad thing</li>
            <li> I just got these in the mail today, but I am so pleased with them that I want to write a review right away. No, they&#x27;re not super thick but if you&#x27;re going for a natural look these are perfect! I ordered them on Friday night and received them today, Tuesday morning, with Amazon prime shipping. Super fast and super great. I will be using them for my wedding in about a week and a half and wanted longer, thicker looking hair but nothing over the top so I could still look like a normal person. I do have naturally thick hair, but these gave me that extra boost of volume and length I was looking for. The color I chose matched my hair perfectly, to the point where it looks like someone took hair from my head and made extensions! I love, love, LOVE these. I originally was going to buy some at Sally, but after seeing the price tag of $125 I decided I could do without until I saw these for much less. No, you don&#x27;t get as much hair, but you get the same quality and it will look like it&#x27;s your real hair. I can&#x27;t wait to take wedding pictures with these!</li>
            <li> So I got these today and are so thin and to top it off they came folded like 5x in just bubble wrap I should of ordered the expensive ones cuz I just wasted my time and money :/</li>
            <li> I love them, I just don&#x27;t know how to store them. I keep them in a ziplock baggie in a drawer. Also, I sometimes have bumps (where the clips are) if I don&#x27;t tease my hair. I had to look up youtube videos on how to use it (being that I had never had extensions before purchasing these). But now that I know how to properly put them in and I (kind of) have a way to store them, they are good. They are the exact color as in the picture. Very dark brown! It is a little darker than my hair, but It was an easy solution to just alter my color to fit. I wanted to go a little darker anyways. Also, they are VERY long which I love. They give plenty of room to cut them to fit your style.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend to anyone! Very poor quality! Did not come with clips and was just one piece. Very tangled, and different tones of hair.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. honestly still a lot better than i thought i was going to get. Someone said you could only curl them if you have a lot of hair spray. .... didn&#x27;t use anything and curled like a camp. I did use my chi at 410° so helped allot. If you have thick hair just buy an extra set and clip them together.</li>
            <li> There were no separate pieces, it was all one piece and NO clips. I was really looking forward to it&#x27;s arrival...order another product!</li>
            <li> Like these a lot I only wish they came with care instructions and how to put them in for those who don&#x27;t know how</li>
            <li> They are too thin. I will never buy these again. Only a couple of hair strans reach the 20in I would rather pay for the price for better ones.</li>
            <li> the color is NOT dark brown and it&#x27;s very cheap looking. I&#x27;m returning it today. Plus what I got in the box was NOT clip in hair.  It was only a single track of hair for someone to sew in.. DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
            <li> I love these. They were very nice and long. But I have very thin hair and it was thinner than mine. I&#x27;m gonna order another pare. :)&lt;br /&gt;Also they shipped fast!</li>
            <li> 70g WITH clips....I bought two packs still not enough. Need four packs to actually look like real hair. The hair feels like real hair, can be curled and straightened. So there are some pluses. Generally when I spend $20+ on extensions on amazon i dont expect the ends to be scraggly looking. It is what it is.  UPDATE  SO I ACTUALLY OPENED OF THE HAIR PIECE AND ITS ONE FIVE FOOT LONG WEFT OF HAIR WITH NO CLIPS. WTF. OMG IM FURIOUS.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my teen age daughter and they have worked for her. they lasted her about 8 months. They still are ok but they have gotten really short from the breakage, but they are good for beginners that just want them in on occasion.</li>
            <li> Thank you for checking in, I love my hair extension they allow me a great amount of volume and length. And at a great price... They are awesome!!! :)</li>
            <li> Wow. i actually really liked this. i wasn&#x27;t pleased at first, they where very itchy and didn&#x27;t match my hair texture,after washing them they where a little wavy like my hair. Unlike most people, my hair is very thin and i only need 3 of the extensions that where in the package, i love them the delivery was very fast and i got a very nice letter along with the extensions :)&lt;br /&gt;im still getting used to them though, very nice product i was pleased.</li>
            <li> The last time I ordered these the quality was good and they lasted quite awhile.  This time was a whole other story. A clip fell off after opening the package. The hair was much lighter than the previous pack I had bought. These are very thin, look over processed, and I&#x27;m sad to say I won&#x27;t be able to wear them.   It appears that this is a hit or miss item. I guess I was due for a miss, but these were absolutely not worth the money I paid for them, even at a low price.</li>
            <li> I normally buy my hair extensions at Sally&#x27;s but they are so expensive, so I though about trying this brand because of the cheaper cost. You do get what you pay for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Shipping is fast.&lt;br /&gt;Cost is cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Quality is on a scale of 1 to 5... maybe 3.5&lt;br /&gt;If taken care of, can last about 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Smelled weird when I opened the package.&lt;br /&gt;The clips are poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;Quality of the hair is thin.... I recommend getting two packages at minimum.&lt;br /&gt;I had to re-sew on the clips because they weren&#x27;t secure enough... practically not sewed on at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Overall not a horrible product, it could have been worse... will I buy again? Probably not.&lt;br /&gt; This product would be great for a one time event, like a wedding, prom or quince.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Nice hair extensions :) they are to thin so maybe getting two sets would be better but they are good quality extensions . Thank you will buy from you again!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love these hair extensions. I always wear them. Yes, they are thin but they do look thicker when properly brushed.  I&#x27;m purchasing another set because I would like to add a few more pieces to my head. Still, purchasing 2 sets is WAY cheaper than buying a 130 gram set at this length. And I have super short hair so it&#x27;d be best if I got another set anyways.  They&#x27;re easy to take care of I even dyed my first set successfully. To all you people who rated this very low because of how thin it was, it&#x27;s 70g and this is what you&#x27;re going to get. Try buying a higher gram set.  The thinness does not take away from the quality of hair.  It&#x27;s really nice, holds a curl, and can dye it.  Make sure you brush at least once a day or they will get stringy-looking.  I hope you enjoy these as much as I am!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these. I usually get my extensions at Sally&#x27;s for $150, these are GREAT. Longer than Sally&#x27;s and WAY cheaper.</li>
            <li> Horrible quality. Do NOT buy!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Cannot curl cannot straighten it&#x27;s synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> The hair seems to be good quality but it&#x27;s much more sparse than other brands. I would need 2 or 3 sets but there isn&#x27;t enough room on my head to clip that many in!</li>
            <li> When I bought this item I was expecting them to be a little bit thicker. Now I know they weren&#x27;t gonna be super thick but at least a little bit more. I have kind of thick hair and so one didn&#x27;t work and I thought two would work. No it didn&#x27;t it was just to thin and fake looking, plus I had like 32 clips in my head which was uncomfortable. I will say the hair quality is good. Its soft and Smith so if you have thin fine hair this will be great for you, but if you have thicker hair I do not recommend it. If I could I would return them because I do not want to spend another $36 on a third pack of hair. I wish I could get my money back. I hope this has helped you.</li>
            <li> These are excellent quality extensions I would definitely recommend these!</li>
            <li> I got them about 3 weeks ago. I ordered two packs in the darkest brown, and they got here waaay before the expected shipping date they gave me. The price kept fluctuating and ended up being more when I placed my order, I emailed the person and they reimbursed me 5 dollars! so the customer service is really nice. I have pretty thick hair, so one pack would definitely not be enough for anyone I feel. I put in all of the wefts and it still could look fuller, but I can&#x27;t complain because these are so cheap. I washed them and they came out thicker, which is nice. they can hold a curl very well(I have them in curls in my hair right now!). as for shedding, I have gotten some fallout but it&#x27;s nothing too bad, I barely even notice it. the length is great, im 5\\&quot;4&#x27; and they come to my belly button when straightened. the color doesn&#x27;t exactly match, it&#x27;s a bit lighter than my hair but I&#x27;m still able to blend them very well! the clips are absolutely fabulous they all stay in my head very well. And the smell is perfectly fine idunno what everyone else is talking about.  I don&#x27;t wear them every day but I do around 4-5 days a week and I don&#x27;t have any major complaints. I say get them if you want some okay quality hair. besides the thinness they&#x27;re awesome. but I really feel like when ive gotten my wear out of these I will not purchase again. I don&#x27;t regret buying them but it&#x27;d be nice to get some thicker and longer ones that have a better color to match my hair. but overall, great cheap buy. you can&#x27;t really go wrong!</li>
            <li> I really like the hair extensions, they are a little thinner then I thought they would be. Be careful with heat on them, use a low heat if you do. They are a great buy.</li>
            <li> These say human hair...nope!!! They r synthetic!!! Total crap if u ask me!! DO NOT BUY THESE! They will melt with a flat iron and look horrible be they don&#x27;t even arch real hair!!! Crap</li>
            <li> They were extremely thin and I have very thick hair so I don&#x27;t recommend this for people with very thick hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why people are giving such low ratings. Yes if you buy 1 pk its on the thin side. I bought 2 pks and its almost too much. Its super long. Very soft. It didn&#x27;t have a weird smell at all. I dyed it to match my hair a little better and it came out amazing. I can curl it and straighten it. Its gorgeous. Its beautiful period let alone for how inexpensive it is! Also I ordered 2 day shipping and even with our snow storm and terrible roads it still got here when it was supposed too. Very pleased. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. I have already recommended this product to a few friends. Thank you for exceeding all my expectations!</li>
            <li> Let me say that I was so excited when I ordered these extensions. When I received them and opened the package I was not impressed. The hair was very rough, tangled, and definitely not 20\\&quot; long as it said in the description. They were supposed to be dark brown but look black, the hair is falling out of the clips, they DON&#x27;T curl which is one of the reason I wanted them. It goes to show that you get what you pay for. I would not recommend buying these extentsions.</li>
            <li> I purchased the item for a wedding I had a month in advance. It took a month for me to receive it, only after multiple complaints. When it arrived, it was not the correct length. The quality of hair was also very poor and thin. They allowed me to keep it but it is very difficult to use and curl. Very unsatisfied</li>
            <li> I wish I could give no stars.&lt;br /&gt;These extensions are NOT human hair this is false advertisement at its finest.&lt;br /&gt;I tested the hair at home with heat they didn&#x27;t curl, but they didn&#x27;t burn either so I go to the salon thinking that their human hair about $120.00 deep in hair dye my hair dresser informs me these are fake and didn&#x27;t take they professional dye whatever so ever. Not only did I spend soo much only to realize their fake but I was also embarrassed walking out of the salon with my 100% &amp;#34;real human hair&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;If they happen to match your hair perfect without dying go for it also for thick hair I recommend two.</li>
            <li> They look like burnt burnt burnt hair after you comb them. Never buying these again... They are soooo fake, they won&#x27;t curl or anything. It&#x27;s like they are resistant to heat 100%. They also tangle very badly. I feel really bad as I write this comment down, but I was really unsatisfied with these Hair Extensions.</li>
            <li> These extensions were not 20 inches, the hair was so thin it felt like somebody else had already worn them, the clips are poorly sued in (one already came off within a month). Would not recommend! extensions came in package folded in half &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the deal...this set is only 70 grams including the clips as per the description.  It is not a lot of hair.  If you have thick hair, like I do, you&#x27;ll need more than one set...I&#x27;m not even sure two sets would be enough. I bought this and a different set that was 120 grams so the 2 together are enough for my hair.  It&#x27;s decent hair, it&#x27;s soft but it does tangle quite easily.  I conditioned the heck out of it and added some spray on conditioner as well to help.  It&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s human hair and you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Great buy for price.  Looks and feels like real hair, washes with regular shampoo &amp; conditioner.  Dry flat on towel or hang dry with chip bag clips on coat hangers.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing extensions for about 5 years now. I have 3 sets that i have gotten from sallys for over 100 dollars each and i love them. The ones i wear are 18&amp;#34; euronext human remy hair so they are amazing. I decided i wanted 20&amp;#34; extensions so i got on here and found them for 22 dollars. the description say HUMAN HAIR, that is false. you can style human hair. When i tried to curl the hair it fell flat and the ends frayed so i can only wear them straight. also they are the exact same length as my 18&amp;#34; extensions. Do not waste your time or money on these cause they are crap. TALK ABOUT FALSE ADVERTISING. lying to get peoples money. What a SHAME</li>
            <li> Definitely not what I ordered.  It&#x27;s one piece not seven pieces..... It&#x27;s not all the same length and there are no clips as seen in the picture</li>
            <li> DO NOT PURCHASE! All they want is your money. They do not come in the right size, they are not real, they frizz up or start to break with any heat, it took a month for them to get here, and they sent me the wrong color.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 20 inch extensions so I would be able to trim them just a bit to fit in with my hair (ordered for thickness, not length) and when I got them them they were maybe 14 inches. The quality was great but the product was not at all what I ordered even though the package they were in claimed they were 20 in.</li>
            <li> Not at all. Very disappointed. I ordered 20&amp;#34; and got soemthing way shorter!!! It didn&#x27;t even hit past my shoulders.  AND it took close to a month to get!</li>
            <li> Great clip ins! Matched really well to my dark brown hair</li>
            <li> My hair is super thin, so I only ordered 1 package.  It was absolutely perfect.  It looks great on, it&#x27;s secure, and it brushes easily.  I haven&#x27;t curled it yet, so I don&#x27;t know how it takes a curl.  The price was awesome- I&#x27;ve paid three times as much for extensions that were way worse in quality.  Would definitely order again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars because the hair is beautiful and shiny and is great, just very thin. You can tell that this is Asian hair. If you&#x27;re going for thickness and length I&#x27;d buy 3 packages and sew the welts together because 1 pkg won&#x27;t cut it even did you have thin hair.</li>
            <li> I loved these extensions they clip in perfectly.  The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it a five star was because on one of the small extensions pieces came off of the clip, so I had to use it with bobbie pins...</li>
            <li> For my first hair extensions there &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;. They tangle VERY easily, don&#x27;t seem like real hair. Also  if you have thick hair, these will look very odd. I recommend to people with thin hair or buy two or 3. But that&#x27;s one hell of alot of hair extensions to put in. There itchy as well, I tried to wear them but they had me sweating and itching. Here is a picture of my hair without them so you can see my hair type. (I have thick hair, they looked super fake on me soooo thin)</li>
            <li> This hair is so fake! It won&#x27;t even curl! All I know is that I was beyond upset but I should of known since I spent 20 bucks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product so I could dye and cut the hair. Believing it was human hair, I was excited for my item to arrive. When it arrived I was devastated to know that what I had bought was actually synthetic hair. Truly a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I got my clip in extensions and I love them!! They blend well with my hair..after reading some reviews I decided to order 2 packs. I got them way earlier than expected And they did not have any weird smell to them as stated in most reviews.they did have a slight kink in them but nothing my chi couldn&#x27;t fix. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and I would recommend them to anyone who wanted to get them for an in expensive price and still look great!</li>
            <li> Not the quality they describe. They are thin as can be. Look&#x27;s like rats tail when on your head. I ordered two sets... Still not enough! Save yourself the time, money, and hassle of returning and look elsewhere. It wouldn&#x27;t even add volume to your hair if your hair is already this length.</li>
            <li> These are great. When purchasing extensions people dont realize that you need more than one pack. Buy two in slightly different lengths and its perfect. Human hair. I color and curl mine.</li>
            <li> This is not real hair! I bought these for my wedding day and wanted curls... Synthetic hair does not curl. I had to change my hairstyle completely! So disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair so I thought these would do the trick. They looked so fake and stringy! Very disappointed, I should have known better. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these to made into dreadlock extensions believing these to be human hair. Don&#x27;t buy these before reading the reviews! They are completely synthetic and crap! Highly disappointed and, pardon me, but completely pissed off. Will never purchase from here again.</li>
            <li> excellent product, efficient seller and good quality product</li>
            <li> I received the extensions a day before the expected date, so that&#x27;s always a thumbs up. However, like others have commented: It is EXTREMELY thin; pencil thin and almost needle thin towards the tips. I bought the 20&amp;#34; in the color #2 and I regret not buying 2 more sets. You will need to buy 2 or even more sets because the hair is astonishingly thin, but as mentioned in the description they were 70 grams, so what can one expect? As for the quality of the hair, it is real, 100% human hair and it is extremely soft. They do not tangle and they curl lovely. Will probably buy again, but only for hair length :)</li>
            <li> Really thin recommen two packets for thick hair😃👏</li>
            <li> not real hair, burns after flat ironing and tangles easily., not a good purchase, not worth my money, clip are weak and don&#x27;t hold</li>
            <li> The extensions could have been thicker but the quality of the hair is great and i am enjoying wearing them</li>
            <li> Am I the only one who received fake hair? Knew they were synthetic as soon as I touched them. Cant dye or style mine. Really disappointing.</li>
            <li> Yes they are thin but i have thick hair so im gonna buy another pack and it should be perfect for my thick hair I recommend them</li>
            <li> These extensions were not real human hair when I got them they would not curl or do anything it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> this is a scam  and foolishness I will not recommend anyone  the hair not even look natural and each piece is BS</li>
            <li> The hair is okay. But very thin. Tangles very easily and the clips don&#x27;t want to stay in. I wouldn&#x27;t waste any money on this product again.</li>
            <li> These extensions were easy to put in and have been easy to maintain.  I had to trim the ends a bit but other than that they worked very well and are very soft.</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy these. I curled them ONCE &amp; the tips started falling off. They look and feel crunchy. Thin thin thin. Shockingly thin.</li>
            <li> Very very thin at the bottom. I would save up more money and buy belemmi hair extensions. They&#x27;re thick and lasts so long. So if you have thin hair this product would be great for you.</li>
            <li> I like this productit is very shiney and healthy looking. If you have thick hair i recomend buying two packs because if you dont it wont blend right.</li>
            <li> I love how soft they are! But they do shed a lot of hair:(. Otherwise it would&#x27;ve gotten five stars:)</li>
            <li> wonderful price and can cut to suit your needs</li>
            <li> Do not buy these! I bought them reading the reviews but they were a lie. I bought 2 packs but 1 pack was good enough for my thick hair. I wanted to wear these for my WEDDING but they weren&#x27;t human hair they looked fake as s***. &amp; they don&#x27;t even curl or anything. I ripped these out the morning of my wedding. I was so disappointed. I wasted $50 on these &amp; I wish I could get back. Save your money for some real good extentions. I&#x27;m not one to write a review but I&#x27;m so upset with this product</li>
            <li> Great items! thank you</li>
            <li> These look like crap. I was so excited for them and when I got them they only have a couple hairs on each strand. No way I could use them!  What a waist of money!!</li>
            <li> You definintly get what you pay for. THEY SUCK! Very thin and a waste of money and time putting them in. DO NOT RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them, as they look great blended with her hair. They are completely washable and stylable. Would recommend. Great quality for the price</li>
            <li> Their nice but their thin not enough to wear as full set extensions would not buy again good quality though</li>
            <li> I like these extensions, however both times I&#x27;ve bought them the clips arrived either off or hanging off. I&#x27;ve had to repeatedly sew them back on.</li>
            <li> I thought these were perfect, especially for the price. I mean, at such a bargain you can&#x27;t expect to get the top of the line clip in extensions. That&#x27;s just unrealistic. I got the dark brown and it matched my hair color perfectly. I used them to add a little length and volume. I&#x27;ve curled them and flat ironed them with no problems. Wondering if some are just using too high of a temperature. These are probably Asian hair, which i can&#x27;t imagine holds up to the 425 degrees my hair needs to get straight. They are easy to clip in and come with extra clips (although i&#x27;m not sure i am up to trying to sew them back on to the extension). Overall was very pleased!</li>
            <li> So disappointed ! False advertisement why can&#x27;t people just be honest and say they are not real hair ! I tried curling them on high and low heat and NOtHING even tried just shampooing and braiding it and letting it dry and not even 1 wave ! I&#x27;m really disappointed .. You get what you paid for /: but I&#x27;ve gotten better hair quality for 12$ before .. So not entirely true !</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of buying hair online, and from amazon. I knew that most hair is thinner, and usually requires 2 packs. So I bought two of the 20&amp;#34; dark brown hair. It is everything I wanted it to be and although my hair is dyed it matches almost 100% I am very pleased and I plan on continuing to buy from this seller. THANK YOU!! And you did not disappoint</li>
            <li> Extensions&lt;br /&gt;These are great, easy to put in and remove. Makes the wearer fell like a different person.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to clean I recommend these to any one who wants to ad leighnth to their hair.</li>
            <li> Open your package outside!!! I had tons of ants inside my package when I opened it. Not inside the extension package, but in the mailing package.&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, I flat ironed them as soon as I pulled them out. Had no problems with fraying or melting.  They are fairly thin &amp; I have thick hair so I should have ordered 2 packages on the first order.  Took them tony stylist, she trimmed them a tiny bit and they look great. Can&#x27;t wait to get my second set so they look as thick as my own hair.</li>
            <li> They were so thin, and the burned into shreds when I tried to curl them... I was mortified by this idem unfortunately</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product, the hair is synthetic. False advertisement.</li>
            <li> They came in on time, but they are really thin. If you have thick hair like I do, do not get them.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast got it in 3 days, hair was so soft felt like my own , love it .</li>
            <li> ITS NOT REAL HAIR IS BARBIE HAIR!</li>
            <li> This hair is very soft and fine like my own. May be disappointed if you are looking for more volume then length but it still worked for me.</li>
            <li> I have bought these a few times before, they are a little thin so you need to buy one more then one package if you have thick hair. I order 3 at a time. 21 pieces is a lot but it pays off when you are trying to blend with thick hair.  All though they aren&#x27;t not real hair I have found a way to curl and straighten them  To curl them make sure they are WET not damp and use a medium heat and hold till the hair is too hot to touch. Takes a while but its worth it for the price and quialty of the hair.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The hair I recieved from were nice the first day I had them but after I started to notice the ends got really dry and also the lengths as well. Also I tried to curl my hair with my straightner (which I have before with previous hair extensions) and these extensions will not curl at all! No matter how much I brush it, it won&#x27;t stay tangle free or smooth. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these extensions, they aren&#x27;t remy to me.</li>
            <li> Not human hair ! Won&#x27;t curl what so ever. If you try and curl the &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; will burn and turn crispy.</li>
            <li> Worse than hair used on baby dolls. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Should of listen to prior comments. Email the seller as instructed. Never responded. Also has a bad smell</li>
            <li> i read the other reviews saying that these were thin before i purchased them. my hair on the thin side itself i figured these should still work perfectly. i was wrong, these are so thin its a bad hair to clip ratio. so even doubling it up for me does not work because the clips then show in my hair. i am hoping to try and add to each clip a little from another set i have. we will see, kinda disappointing :(</li>
            <li> When I got them it&#x27;s Said Remy human hair I bought them they can straighten but they can&#x27;t curl with heat you have to curl them with duck bill clips. They are nice to have but I hate that I have to brush them constantly for them to look like really hair again. The clump together</li>
            <li> I love, love, love, my hair extensions they are great and are so easy to put on. I would order from here again for sure.</li>
            <li> Wow... This is such a scam it&#x27;s so thin and it&#x27;s the worst hair you can buy my hair is very thick and it was only 70 g I had to order another package that was 10 clip in pieces with 100 g just to add on to that 17 clips better fill my head and if it&#x27;s not enough I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m gonna do my hair is really thick and I hope this will be enough it is really nice hair just hard to find hair of it thick at the top and thick at the bottom so I give it a 2 🌟✨</li>
            <li> This hair was way too thin and I could not curl it. This is the worst hair I have ever used. It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Worst extensions I have ever ordered. Far from human hair. I have ordered plenty of extensions. These were the worst! Biggest waste of money. They don&#x27;t feel real, nor do the curl or straighten. I&#x27;ve ordered them before but these ones were horrid. Not even worth the hassle of a rerun. Hello garbage can.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sure why everyone is giving such a low rating, these extensions are CHEAP!!! You get what you pay for!! With that said the product came on time, and the color matched my color perfect. Yes, the hair is thin but like I said, you get what you pay for! The length was just what I was looking for and to be honest I color my hair a lot so I did not wanna buy something expensive that in a month I can&#x27;t use again because my color has changed. I am enjoying these, and have no trouble with heat as long as the heat setting is on LOW!! All in all no regrets on this purchase!!</li>
            <li> they definitely weren&#x27;t 20&amp;#34; maybe like 12&amp;#34; or something. other than that it was great, looking for fullness, you&#x27;re gonna need two packs or more. hair is soft and looks like Remy human hair just not 20&amp;#34; was my only problem.</li>
            <li> Their great extensions they&#x27;re just waaaaay too thin</li>
            <li> Horrible hair extensions,not enough hair on them. what am I supposed to do with this!</li>
            <li> The hair is awesome... But I feel I have to keep constantly brush it</li>
            <li> These are the worse extensions I have ever bought these are no way remy at all I wore them once and the second day the ends were so dry and I think they are  synthetic</li>
            <li> Fake hair&lt;br /&gt;It burned when i teied using my curling iron</li>
            <li> These extensions did not curl...&lt;br /&gt;I specifically got them for prom, and had to wear them straight. :(&lt;br /&gt;Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Good product just confused that it&#x27;s an American product but I&#x27;m receiving it from China?... Other than that it&#x27;s good. these weren&#x27;t even supposed to be here til April 9th, but here March 26th(:</li>
            <li> They are WAY to thin... I personally would not recommend to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;- The shipping was good... It came a little early! And the hair is very soft....&lt;br /&gt;The color didn&#x27;t match my hair color&lt;br /&gt;&amp;&amp; it didn&#x27;t even look the same as I was looking at it on the web... They totally mistaked my order!!&lt;br /&gt;Never will buy from this again!</li>
            <li> I love these extensions, they took about a WEEK to get to get delivered. That was a really big plus for me. They are so soft and they were exact color that i wanted and the exact length.They came with extra clips just in case, and a nice letter just letting you know about them. My only complaints was the packaging was kind of poor, and the hair was very thin.I have shorter hair and i was looking for length, not thickness.I got 2 packs but one pack was perfectly fine for me GREAT price for Remy Hair!</li>
            <li> I am big on reading reviews before I purchase something and of course there is always mixed reviews..I read a loooot that these were very thin but also that they were worth the $30...well when I got them I was really surprised on how thin they were and i have thin hair but these really wouldnt have been of any use to me...if you are going for volume and length, do not get these...if you have really really thin hair they may work for you if you are looking to just add some length</li>
            <li> So I read all the reviews on these, and I was a bit skeptical about them. I ended up getting them because of how cheap they were. They got here in a week (estimated time was MORE than a month.) You REALLY get what you pay for. But I&#x27;ve bought worse quality for WAY more money. For those who are mad about how thin they are: read the description. You have to do research. EVERY form I&#x27;ve read about clip ins is you need to make sure you have 100-150g for extensions 10inches-16inches and you need 150-250g for 17+ inches. You ALWAYS buy 2 packs of clip ins when you order them online. ALWAYS read how much comes in each pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who complain about the shiny: Easy fix. Wash them with shampoo that contains sulfate (Pretty much any shampoo has this.) This will eliminate the ultra shiny and dull them. This will also change the color slightly , which is what you want. Depending on how your natural hair looks, you will want to use a hair dryer on them to make them not as shiny as well. If you want to straighten them, use your flat iron at 300 or lower. These won&#x27;t curl extremely well unless you have a lot of hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who complain about the length: In my 7 years of getting extensions, I&#x27;ve NEVER had a pack come with the EXACT length. I always order an inch or two MORE than the length I want. You will want to trim the ends and layer them so they bland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who complain that they won&#x27;t hold dye: These aren&#x27;t the original colors of the hair. Every extension I&#x27;ve had is always hard to dye. That&#x27;s just how they are. If you want REAL human hair that HASN&#x27;T been processed, get some that are $300. Like I said, you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, 5 out of 5 stars. Fast shipping, I got better quality than I expected, and I am happy with the order.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE! Pure Barbie doll-like hair.  Ordered this same hair from other sellers and it was 100 percent human for the same price.  This hair is 100 percent synthetic!  Very upset!</li>
            <li> The quality of the hair is great and the color is exactly what I was expecting. My extensions arrived a week or so earlier then I was expecting which was awesome! I read other reviews so I knew that the hair would be thin and I would need to purchase another pack. The price of this hair for the quality of it is a no brainer. They come with clips (already sewn in as well) and it is still cheaper to purchase 2 or 3 packs then it is to just buy them at Sally&#x27;s. I have been wearing extensions for several years now and I am pleased with the quality. I wish the hair itself was a bit thicker but other than that I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> The hair is thin, so if you have thick hair you will need two packages. I have very thin hair so they do wonders! I love the hair, the price, and the quality! TWO THUMBS UP!</li>
            <li> Terrible. Looks and feels like doll hair. So absolutely disappointed.</li>
            <li> The extensions are very thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be honest, I already have long thick hair, but I just wanted a few more inches for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;These extension match my hair color perfect, but the texture of it is so thin at the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;So basically, when I wear it, its like I have really thick hair then at the very bottom I randomly have thin hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered these a while ago... I think it may have been a different person though. But nonethrless , they were the same exact ones. Yes they are thin, but since my hair is thin it&#x27;s perfect! But... I bought the wrong color...my bad! If I would have gotten a dark brown they would have looked better. But that was mty fault, not the seller.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 sets. The first one was good but the second one had something like glue all over it and the hairs were stock to each other... It&#x27;s also very thin and hard to style. I tried to curl the hair with curling iron but the hair went back to straight in 15 minutes even after using some hair spry.</li>
            <li> The hair extensions are extremely thin. I thought I would be okay because my hair is pretty thin, so I didnt think it would be a big deal when I saw others complaining.&lt;br /&gt;At the ends there is seriously like 4 strands, and thats what makes it to 20\\&quot;.. I ended up cutting mine to 16\\&quot; so it looks a little thicker.&lt;br /&gt;Kinda bummed.. but I guess thats what I get for buying online.  Should of just went to Sally&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Just so everyone knows, I LOVE this vendor for hair extensions. I am actually placing another order today for another set for a friend of mine. Great prices for extensions especially since this is real human hair. Amazon said my package would not be to me until next year towards the end of January and I was concerned because I wanted these for my upcoming trip to Puerto Rico. I e-mailed the vendor asking about the shipping because the only option I had was to send it standard but like I said, Amazon said it was going to take a lot longer. I spoke with the vendor and they reassured be that it was standard shipping 10-15 business days. WELL.. let me tell you, that was the fastest I have ever gotten a package. I got my package within 8 normal days. Now I have my extensions for Christmas Eve through New Years. Thanks again for all your help and I am already recomending your product to friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;xoxo Iris</li>
            <li> i love these hair extensions, these are my first hair extensions and they are really great to have as my first. they are great quality, really soft, and they stay in your hair perfectly! i love them! I would definiently recommend them:)</li>
            <li> These were absolutely destroyed after two washes, and the color that was sent to me was RED! I dyed my hair to match them, only to have to by new ones two weeks later.</li>
            <li> I really really didn&#x27;t like this at all It&#x27;s supper thin hair . Sooo disappointed ...</li>
            <li> I bought these hair extensions for my teenage daughter. The color was exactly as described. They are super easy to use. We did take them in to our hair dresser and she cut them slightly to blend into my daughter&#x27;s layers better. You cannot tell when she wears them whether she does an up-do, side pony tail, etc. She has also kept them straight but also has curled them as well. I definitely recommend them. A great value for the money.</li>
            <li> Matched my hair color perfect. I&#x27;m impressed with the fast shipping and incredible price. Even my husband thought they were worth it and he&#x27;s hard to impress in terms of buying un-needed beauty products. Very happy.</li>
            <li> The hair color was correct but that was the only thing right with this order. The hair had an odor right out the packaging, the clips tangled into my hair and pulled my hair out when taken the extentions out, and the extentions shed before even being brushed.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the right item and needs to be returned.</li>
            <li> I usually get my hair extensions from Sally&#x27;s which are kinda pricey if you ask me. But when I saw these, I was kinda crazy about them just because of the price. I did look at the reviews and I gotta tell you, these extensions aren&#x27;t that bad. Yes, their thin, but I&#x27;m wearing them now and I&#x27;m satisfied. I am being completely honest, I have fine/thin hair, and this works wonders. These are good for pick-a-boos or if you just need a little extra hair to play with (that&#x27;s why I got them). And I will agree with any of the reviews that say anything about thick hair, yeah, these are too thin. Probably way too thin. I mean with the 7 pieces over lapping each other, there will be more volume, but you would probably need 4 of these combined. Better off getting hair extensions with more g&#x27;s... No joke, I wouldn&#x27;t mind going back to this seller, but I also will (like always) look for other sellers too who will have something similar with better quality. Other than that, shipment came on time and it put a smile on my face when I tried them on, so I think this product deserves a good four stars.</li>
            <li> I feel dumb for even thinking these would work. I usually get the euronext extensions from sallys and the ones i had were getting really bad but i didn&#x27;t have the $140 to spend at the time. So I wanted to try a cheaper alternative. I read all the reviews and chose to ignore all the bad ones and try it for myself. Honestly, they&#x27;re this cheap for a reason. Very bad quality. Even buying 2 sets wasn&#x27;t enough thickness and my hair is pretty thin. I didn&#x27;t have them out of the packaging for more them 30 seconds and hair was falling everywhere. Some of the clips were already dangling off and they&#x27;re sewed onto the weft terribly. Just bad. Don&#x27;t easy you&#x27;re money. I rather safe and get good quality hair extensions like luxy hair. Which is what I&#x27;m doing now. Hope this helps everyone.</li>
            <li> I DO NOT recommend these extensions! when I initially went to buy them, I looked at the other reviews and most of the reviews said to buy 2 packs of the 7 piece sets if you have thick hair. Well, I did that and they were thick towards the top but when you got to the bottom, they were so thin. Not even cutting a couple inches off would help. I was not satisfied! Please save your money and buy like foxy locks or hello gorgeous. They are a little more expensive but the quality is worth the price! Still love Amazon though!</li>
            <li> I bought these to add to my existing extensions. My hair is ridiculously thick and the 160 gram extensions I already own didn&#x27;t blend well. These extensions are thin but did the job for me. Now my extensions blend perfectly now. However these alone are only meant for thin hair, so if you have normal to thick hair they wont do much but if you&#x27;re doing what I did they work out perfectly.</li>
            <li> Just received my two packs if extensions(since i have thicker hair) i ordered #60, and so far, so good! they are on the thin side, but thats what two packs were for. The hair is soft (: i have to get hairdye to match my natural color, thats why i ordered the blonde so i could dye them. So far, they seem good. I will find out how they are after being dyed soon(; oh yeah, the ETA was april 20th!!! I received them  4 weeks before they said theyd be here. It took me about 2 weeks to get them. I will be definitely purchasing from them again.</li>
            <li> I bought these clip ins in January I not to long ago received them not because of amazon but because I live in the Caribbean and it takes forever for me to get my stuff. When I bought these I cant remember seeing any reviews. I however decided to look it up a month after and woa the bad reviews. I immediately bought another set those are on their way now. These are the fist clip ins I have ever owned. I will be as honest and as blunt as possible. Also I have thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*There are not dark brown or what I thought to myself as dark brown but however I managed to blend them well with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;*Yes they are twenty inches but the ends are scraggly thin and appear damaged.&lt;br /&gt;*The package said to treat them as you would your own hair I put heat protector on them to curl the ends a bit and they were instantly weighed down and the curl would not hold.&lt;br /&gt;*Clips need to be reinforced when you receive this pack as they are not sewn on very securely.&lt;br /&gt;*These clip ins are great if you only want the back of your hair to look thicker and longer I had to do a half up half down style to make it blend well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and as for shedding of the hair I did not really get much of that.</li>
            <li> Very pretty! I love then and always receive a lot of compliments. My one complaint is that they don&#x27;t hold curls very well. Still worth the buy!</li>
            <li> i have ordered so so soooo many extensions in the past. i started wearing extensions 5 years ago, and i have been through many extensions, all of them way pricier than these. these are the best extension deal out there! i would recommend getting two packs, so the hair is super full. i absolutely love these extensions! they do not taper off much toward the ends, they are very soft, and they are the correct length and color AND shipping is faster than the expected date. PICK THESE !</li>
            <li> I love my hair extensions. The only problem is I have really thick hair and I need 2 sets of the extensions. My friend liked them so much I ordered a set for her as well. Will def buy from this seller again</li>
            <li> I had to order two sets because they were so thin. But over all, I&#x27;m sort of satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> I recomended this hair extensions....Good!!!perfect hair,perfect color,look natural they arive before the time im waiting.I wan to buy more soon...WOW!!</li>
            <li> While the hair is long- it is THIN!! The clips are not sharp enough to part my hair and hold without trouble and they are strangely heavy. Two sets will not fit on my skull and  I will not purchase again!</li>
            <li> the hair is so thing my hair looked so fake! people said like a cat took half my hair off ! lol dont buy not worth the money!</li>
            <li> I loved this hair! Real hair, yes its thin but I bought 2 packs so its perfect for my thick hair plus it came a month before it was supposed to!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely Loved them . I ordered 2 and it was also really inexpensive.</li>
            <li> These extensions were so soft,easy to manage, and look natural! They matched my hair perfectly and they&#x27;re so easy to style! People actually thought the extensions were my real hair! very satsified and will definitely order remy extensions again!</li>
            <li> not human hair extensions</li>
            <li> I´m very happy with this extensions! I love my long hair, looks very natural and cute :) highly recommended !</li>
            <li> They are nice. Glad I read some reviews I never purchased extensions before. I have thicker hair so I&#x27;m super glad I bought two instead of one. I have very similar hair so unfortunately after a while even with teasing and spray it slides down. Its fun to wear for a couple hours though.</li>
            <li> they were very long and i loved that but they were extreamly thin so if i were to buy another one id definantly have to order two but other than that i loved them!</li>
            <li> Very thin &amp; the color is lighter than it was suppose to be, but Good for price, I don&#x27;t think I would order again online. Need at least 3 packs for a full head.</li>
            <li> Okay so I wouldn&#x27;t buy these. I bought them back in December and they were great. I could straighten them, curl them, anything. They were just thin. I ordered more in January just to make it thicker. When they finally got here they were NOT the right color. Plus I tried to straighten them like I did the others but the melted. It&#x27;s not real hair.</li>
            <li> So usually i buy my extensions at Sallys for over 100$ but i was thrilled when i saw these for under 35$. They shipped a lot faster than i anticipated and the hair was nice and soft, however it was very thin. And only a few strands, literally like 5 strands of hair, made it to 20\\&quot;. I guess i got what i paid for. It came with a paper stating if i had questions or concerns to email her, i did, and of course no one responded. Overall, quality was good, shipping was great, but quantity was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I just got these today and I love them! My hair is so much fuller. It gives it so much volume!</li>
            <li> Mine were Not Human hair at all...</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for a Christmas present, I hope she likes it.  The length is what she wanted and the price was very reasonable.  I</li>
            <li> Feels like synthetic hair.. Tangles easily.&lt;br /&gt;Of course these are cheap so don&#x27;t except much.</li>
            <li> BADDDDDDDD QUALITY!!! Terrible and FALSE ADVERTISING!! These are fake and thin. This seller shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to put &amp;#34;human remy&amp;#34; hair on the product description! Save your your money. Dollar store quality.</li>
            <li> They were not human hair! They were rough and coarse and frayed at the ends. I would not recomend buying!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it; she has been after this hair since Christmas! Her hair is thin and this gives her more volume.</li>
            <li> If I could give a negative one I would. The &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; came in one long strip with no clips whatsoever and the hair was extremely thin and fake, sent it back straight away don&#x27;t waste your time and energy to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not much hair at all now I know better buying extensions off the Internet. Only good if you have long hair and are just trying to thicken it up.</li>
            <li> The color and length is really nice, however they do tangle extremely easy. I don&#x27;t think they are too thin like other reviewers. I have pretty thin hair myself, and putting these in makes it SUPER thick. I will be cutting them to lay more nicely with my natural hair shape.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of a toss up. The first time that I ordered these extensions, they were perfect! Perfect color, perfect length, and it really was real human hair.... The second time that I ordered these extensions, there were short black ones that were obviously not real human hair. It was really strange. I just re-ordered some, so we&#x27;ll see what the third time brings!!</li>
            <li> These did not work for me whatsoever, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they won&#x27;t for you. When I ordered these extensions, I thought they would be thicker. These are sooooo so thin, and they thin out at the bottom even more! I have really thick hair, so I probably would&#x27;ve had to buy like 3 of these. Also, they were neither the correct length and color I had asked for. But hey, if you have thin hair and are ok with having to possibly dye them, by all means but them! Otherwise, check out something else. :/</li>
            <li> Very beautiful and great extensions, I only wish they were thicker for my hair. They curl and straighten with no problem!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the quality. The color is true, I got dark brown 20&amp;#34; and its true dark brown. I have washed, curled and colored them and they have held up. Good starter extensions until you can afford thicker ones. overall quick delivery and great for the price</li>
            <li> wrong color and 8 inches shorter than ordered</li>
            <li> Well i got my extensions today and they are so pretty so soft, the best part os that i can curl and straight them... I havent tried bleaching them jet bc for the moment im broke, for the rest it was cool ;)</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this. It took over a month to get it. I ordered 20 inch extentions in dark brown, and they sent me 12 inches in black. So they are useless to me. Worst extentions Ive ever seen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different extensions and I have to say this was not remy or human hair. It was extremely thin and dry, it felt like really badly mistreated extensions. However the shipping was very convenient and there were extra clips.</li>
            <li> good morning as I do if I want to clip the extensions but that is per side or curtain await your response thanks</li>
            <li> If there was a 0 star button that&#x27;s the rating I would give!! This is the most disappointed I have ever been while ordering online! The set I bought was SUPPOSED to be 20\\&quot; long. They were NOT that at all. Maybe 3 strands were. LITERALLY only 3 strands!!!! I was so ripped off I could cry!! ALSO, some hair was chopped off just under the clip! making it even THINNER than ehat it already was! how could someone sell such a bad product??? please, for your moneys sake, DO NOT purchase these extensions!!! That&#x27;s all I got to say!</li>
            <li> To all buyers I advise that this is Asian hair so you must look at how many grams the hair is 70-100 grams is for thin hair &amp; 120-160 and up is for thick hair</li>
            <li> Horrendous horrible hair it&#x27;s like she or he cut it off a doll head they were not long at all the sucked</li>
            <li> These extensions are a fraud! is not human hair because it melted when a hot iron is used on them. do not buy them!</li>
            <li> i dont like them ,too thin</li>
            <li> Cheap quality for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> THIS ISNT HUMAN HAIR.</li>
            <li> A little thin and difficult to style, but good price!</li>
            <li> These have always lasted me a good while for the price, this is my second time buying and I received them today and I&#x27;m very happy. If you have thicker hair I would buy another set just in case but in my case it looks very nice. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great extension. Great price. My granddaughter  loves them.</li>
            <li> This is synthetic.. Little disappointed.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of mixed reviews on this product and felt that I needed to add my review to help out.  This is hair is awesome.  I have colored it to match my hair color, used the hot iron and hot rollers on it.  They have held up under all conditions.  I am most likely going to purchase some more hair so that I have it as my hair continues to grow.  I will concur that the hair pieces are not super thick, but as another review stated what do you expect for the price and for them being clip-on pieces vs. actual extensions you would get put in at a hair salon.</li>
            <li> This clips suck and its not human hair. I tried curling it and the hair burned!!!</li>
            <li> Was not the color expected and did not include all clips!!</li>
            <li> These extentions are so incredibly thin its laughable! Yes they&#x27;re soft and the color is pretty, but there might be a whole 8gms of hair there...&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed! Wish I hadn&#x27;t opened the package and thrown away the care instructions. Not sure if I can get a refund anymore...</li>
            <li> This product is awful way to thin and stringy not even worth $$$ it&#x27;s that bad .... I was super excited til I opened the product and seen the quality ...... DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Very thin hair I order the 20 inches &amp; I order 2 packs of hair &amp; they were still very thin &amp; that&#x27;s cause my hair isn&#x27;t thick !!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> IT FALLS OUT OF THE CLIP EASILY, AND THERE IS NOT MUCH HAIR ON EACH CLIP. IF YOU ORDER THIS GET TWO.</li>
            <li> I ordered these extensions despite the negative reviews. I figured since my hair is fine it wouldn&#x27;t matter if they where a little thin. These extensions have like 100 hairs on each clip. They are soooo thin. Do not buy these extensions...even if you have super fine hair it is a waist of money.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t by these extensions i bought these twice and i got the one&#x27;s pictured and i loved them but my 3rd time i ordered these it took way to long to come and they sent me the wrong color i ordered dark brown and they sent me 1b 1 black and i didn&#x27;t get real human hair i ended up getting synthetic which tangles and is annoying and feels weird i contacted the seller evecos and they said i could sent them back but it would cost alot because the came all the way from china so i didn&#x27;t bother sending them back and they said they could give me a 50% refund which they did and i only got 8 dollars back and they wouldn&#x27;t send me new extensions so becareful with the seller &#x27;&#x27;evecos&#x27;&#x27; the customer service with them is terrible and the shipping took way to long.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them I have to get more for my youngest now also a wig for my daughter with alopecia</li>
            <li> I like the extensions except that the ends are very thin my hair is already thin at the bottom so I don&#x27;t need it to be thinner</li>
            <li> I am so pleased. This will be my first time using clip ins and these are absolutely great. I can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
            <li> Horrible I got synthetic hair extensions instead of human hair extansions as stated</li>
            <li> So disappointed. Was expecting to get these with the clips ATTACHED. Instead I got one big long strand of hair. Anyone else had this problem?</li>
            <li> After looking through multiple exspensive hair extensions, I finally found these, and I&#x27;m glad I did! The hair is high quality for the price, and the color comes exactly as it states. If you have thin hair, one pack is enough. If your hair is thick, 2 will make it perfect. My only complaint is that they tangle a little, and you do have to wash them with moisturizing conditioner. Either way, I love these! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Very thin, nice quality for price.</li>
            <li> The quality of the hair extensions was very good, there just wasn&#x27;t enough of it and it was so thin that it didn&#x27;t appear natural when put in with real hair.</li>
            <li> This extension is very thin and i won&#x27;t add any length even when i use the whole set because the ends are really thin. If you want to use it try to trim the ends and blend it with the length of your hair. It will give a fullness at least!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money, they do look great and natural but they arent 100% human hair like they said, to most this may not be a problem but i do a lot with my hair such as curl, straighten, dye, etc. So if youre like me. Please do not buy</li>
            <li> I am absolutely furious! I just received my extensions and they are the darkest nastiest feeling hair extensions I&#x27;ve EVER boughten! I have been wearing hair extensions for 6 years and I know what is real human hair and what is synthetic or a hair blend. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> First off I want to state the only reason I&#x27;m giving this three stars is because this is not real hair, even though it states in the description that it is. I knew that when buying it from previous reviews but brought it anyway. It feels and looks close to real hair. This one is very thin so if you have thick hair or want your hair to look thick I suggest you buy two. Also true to color on package.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t curl it&#x27;s not human hair frys easily too off!!!</li>
            <li> The length was good, but the clips started to fall apart , and the hair wasn&#x27;t that good. They also didn&#x27;t l sat as long as others hair did.</li>
            <li> I loved it , but I wished the hair last longer with out getting so tangled. I prolly won&#x27;t buy that type of hair again . Other then that I was pleased and enjoyed the natural look . 2 Sets of 7 pcs is good enough for me don&#x27;t need more then that . Unless if I wanted to look a lol more drastic looking . But all in all I loved it ! Came on time exactly the day they said it would be shipped it was shipped . I was really excited about that . Their easy to put in and I like the way they give you instructions on how to take care of the hair , must of came from a real proffesional hair dresser A++ to you !  . Their a good use for curling . Excellent job guys ! :)</li>
            <li> I loved theses hair extention but i only wore them once and only when i took pictures but then i got news one and gave these one away to my friend. These were really good and blended very well in my hair.</li>
            <li> These extensions are great i had to trim them to blend with my hair and thin my hair but they are wonderful</li>
            <li> They came early. I was happy went with a 70g cause my hair is not thick so its the right one for my hair type. I think I will have to attach one clip to the middle of one but still happy</li>
            <li> Fake !!!! Not good quality hair is synthetic and they get tangled don&#x27;t recommend this at all ! 😾</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest these to someone that has thick hair, they are quite thin, but they definitely helped my thin hair thicker, which is what I wanted! I love them! They are really pretty good Quality.  (:</li>

            <li> I get the jet black 7 piece extensions. I actually bought to bundles. I am livid and I have had extensions now for over a year so I know good quality and human hair the moment I see it. THIS ISN&#x27;T REAL HAIR DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I want a refund for all the waste of my time and money on these extensions. They are thin, poorly put together, and NOT HUMAN HAIR.</li>
