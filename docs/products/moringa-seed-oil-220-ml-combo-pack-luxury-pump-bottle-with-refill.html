            <li> love, love, love, this product..i have been suffering my RA for over 20 years now, from gerd and heartburn and ulcer damage my system from all kind of medicine i have been taking. all the toxin and serious allergy and i feel like having worst infection from all this prescription medication...there is a time i have worst inflammation not even medication can take care the job, after 3 weeks taking this ingesting it 1 tsp in the morning and 1 tsp at night, i dont have my heartburn my gerd my allergy, and my RA I can tolerated it and feel like 70 percent better. and this is only 3 weeks of period. and this is will be part of my life now, i will be taking it like a religiously.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell if it really works in any particular area, but it really feels good on my skin. No complaints at this time.</li>
            <li> Ins ide Moringa works miracles, capsules, powders. Outside it is just as amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Anti-aging&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin A &amp; C&lt;br /&gt;Natural skin cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Radiance boosting fatty acids&lt;br /&gt;Healthy skin</li>
            <li> People are always asking me what I do for my skin.  Now you know my secret - Moringa oil.  I put it on at night about an hour before I go to bed to allow it time to absorb in and put it on my hair a few nights a week and sleep in it.  It helps keep my curls strong and moisturized and my skin looking fresh.  I love this oil!</li>
            <li> I enjoy using the oil, especially the pump that keep the oil potency intact. The luxury pump delivers the right a a time. I liked it</li>
            <li> I bought this item with the free refill, and, I must say, that the refill had leaked a little out, maybe 3/4\\&quot;.  But I was too eager to complain.  I went ahead and started using it and I can&#x27;t believe how much moisturizing I can obtain from just a little.  My only hope is that they will seal the refill bottle better next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a senior (64) and recently my skin has become so dry and so thin that the slightest bump causes huge reddish-purple bruises on my skin.  The slightest scrape - and I bleed quite a bit, and heal very slowly.  But the Moringa Oil soothes the cuts and makes the bruises begin to heal the very next day.  In fact they even stop stinging when I put it on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin loves this oil.</li>
            <li> So I decided to buy this on a whim. I was pleasently surprised to get it so fast! It&#x27;s only been a few days but when I put this on my skin it makes it feel silky smooth and look very dewy. It is not greasy feeling at all. I have very sensitive skin and eczema patches sometimes and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all in fact it soothed it and made it look more even in tone. I will update again after a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I live in California, and even though the weather isn&#x27;t so bad, the wind and sun have damaged my skin, and i&#x27;ve suffered with dry skin  because of it. Around my T-zone area of my face, I would have red flakey patches with little pimples surrounding it. It was so embarrassing, and I tried EVERYTHING to make it disappear. My friend recommended to use Moringa Oil, and I went online to find the most inexpensive product. I can tell you that this product is inexpensive, but the quality is just INCREDIBLE. They use Moringa Seed Oil that is &amp;#34;cold pressed&amp;#34; which is the purest and best form of oil. Other sellers do not sell a product with the same quality at the same price! I can tell you that my skin has never LOOKED OR FELT ANY BETTER THAN IT HAS NOW! I get so many compliments on my skin, and I have made my mom use it every night for her under eye area, since it is also able to eliminate fine lines and wrinkles. She loves it as well, and we both have seen amazing results. If you have acne, wrinkles, dry, flakey, red skin, I suggest you purchase this product, because YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> I thought I would give the Moringa oil a try.  I was amazed at the benefits.  It has helped with dark spots, more even skin tone, and lines.  An it is all natural, plus so much better than expensive creams and lotions.  This is the only product that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> I took a before picture and after one night of use, my face feels silky and smooth. I can&#x27;t wait to see how it feels in one month. Can&#x27;t wait to take another picture in a month to show the results.</li>
            <li> Great product!  My skin feels super smooth.&lt;br /&gt;my mother is in love with it, she says it has softened the fine lines around her mouth!&lt;br /&gt;We will be using this product for years to come. I hope they will always have this great deal, other companies are selling the same product for double the price!</li>
            <li> This is a great product use it everyday! I love it actually cant live with out it! Buy with confidence!</li>
            <li> Customer service from Earths Moringa made a follow up on an email request that I sent.  They&lt;br /&gt;Quickly resolved the minor issue and exceeded my expectations with free product.  I would highly recommend this company and the product is great as well.</li>
            <li> I have not used this Moringa seed oil very long.  It makes my skin feel good, not sure if it has helped with wrinkles.  But I love the way it smooth on. Will see how it works after further use.</li>
            <li> Am still trying it so far it&#x27;s ok I mix it with the Moringa powder to exfoliate my skin  very nice</li>
            <li> this product has very bad smell,  the color is darker than the first one  I bought a while ago.&lt;br /&gt;the other one was very light yellow no smell at all it is a waste of money, it can not be used at all.&lt;br /&gt;maybe you over cooked it. I do not recommend it to any body.</li>
            <li> It is good.  I like it on my skin.  I will keep ordering it.  I especially like the pump bottle.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and head after I shower and shave daily, Nothing has made my skin more younger looking and I feel like I look years younger as I have been using the product for 6 months. Is amazing on burns, has completely gotten rid of the eczyme on my underarms since I have has as a kid. If you ever get real bad sunburn this oil works so fast the burn goes away in seconds and skin has never felt better,</li>
            <li> This oil is terrific drop by drop in my face cream and night cream applied on my slightly damp face. I noticed improvement within one week. Helps to refurbish leather products also.</li>
