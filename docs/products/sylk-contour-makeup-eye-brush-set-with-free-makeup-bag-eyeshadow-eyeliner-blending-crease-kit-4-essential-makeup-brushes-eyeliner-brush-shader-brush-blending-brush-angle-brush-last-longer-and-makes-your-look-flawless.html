            <li>brush are so soft , and so easy for using and it makes the makeup waaaay nicer</li>
            <li>Even with having my make up in the zippered part it does not make the case bulky at all.&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to clean the brushes, just brush gently on a tissue or paper towel for powder cosmetics and for liquid just carefully remove the excess oil with a tissue.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes especially at this price.</li>
            <li>It has a button closure and has an extra zip up pouch to carry more brushes with or whatever else you need.</li>

            <li>The black travel case is my favorite part of this set, because not only is it for travel, it is nice and compact that I put in my purse.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super soft and carry the makeup so well!</li>
            <li>This set is the perfect combination for a full eye makeup that looks well blended, bristles are firm but soft enough to leave a soft finish.</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean and they feel just as soft as they did the second they arrived to my house.</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to carry all my brushes in and some extra makeup like my lipstick and eyeliner and mascara.</li>
            <li>The brushes are made with synthetic and natural hairs which are so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate these and highly recommend everyone to check them out!</li>
            <li>Before I purchased these, I wasn&#x27;t really a brush person until my friend suggested them to me.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>I really like the idea of receiving a brush for eyebrows, eye shadow, a blending brush and an eyeliner brush all in one set.</li>
            <li>and it keeps all of the brushes perfectly straight and in place the whole time, so you can take it on the go, wherever you go.</li>
            <li>She also uses the brushes to keep her eye liner straight.</li>
            <li>She told me that everyone of the brushes are amazing and better than the ones we paid a lot for in the past and that they seem like they will hold up for a really long time.</li>
            <li>and I get a smooth, sharp look every time thanks to the quality of the bristles and the angle of the brush.</li>
            <li>and I love how you get a little make up bag with them</li>
            <li>The bristles are not hard, they are very soft and it makes putting on make up a lot easier.</li>
            <li>I use the angle brush wet and dry, and it&#x27;s very easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I wanted her to learn how to use brushes instead of those small brushes that come with most eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another big plus about this kit is that it comes in its own personal black silky carrying case</li>
            <li>They are so soft yet strong enough to create sharp lines and not leave makeup all over the place.</li>
            <li>Ive been searching for a brush set that is soft and does not shed hairs</li>
            <li>They felt like soft like feathers.  </li>
            <li>These are professional makeup brushes and make it easier for me now to put on all my eye makeup.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft but not so soft that they do not hold up when you are using them.</li>
            <li>other brushes makes the eyeshadow nicer, and its so fun to use them .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most blending brushes are big and cover too big of an area on the eye and can make a mess for you.</li>
            <li>I really like that they have the long handles which makes controlling the brush easier.</li>
            <li>However, if you purchase it and are not completely satisfied then rest easy knowing that you can get your money back if you so desire.</li>
            <li>I really like that because most cases have the clear plastic that goes over the brushes and if the brushes are dirty it transfers into the case.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and gentle on the eye lids, not rough or stiff.</li>
            <li>I received these brushes for review at little or at no cost and to give my unbiased opinion and that is exactly what I just did.</li>
            <li>These Sylk makeup brushes are just as good, if not better actually, for less than half the price of the Sigmas.</li>
            <li>I have really gone through less makeup since I started using these brushes.</li>

            <li> Before I purchased these, I wasn&#x27;t really a brush person until my friend suggested them to me.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I really like the idea of receiving a brush for eyebrows, eye shadow, a blending brush and an eyeliner brush all in one set.</li>
            <li> and it keeps all of the brushes perfectly straight and in place the whole time, so you can take it on the go, wherever you go.</li>
            <li> She also uses the brushes to keep her eye liner straight.</li>
            <li> She told me that everyone of the brushes are amazing and better than the ones we paid a lot for in the past and that they seem like they will hold up for a really long time.</li>
            <li> and I get a smooth, sharp look every time thanks to the quality of the bristles and the angle of the brush.</li>
            <li> and I love how you get a little make up bag with them</li>
            <li> The bristles are not hard, they are very soft and it makes putting on make up a lot easier.</li>
            <li> I use the angle brush wet and dry, and it&#x27;s very easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I wanted her to learn how to use brushes instead of those small brushes that come with most eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another big plus about this kit is that it comes in its own personal black silky carrying case</li>
            <li> They are so soft yet strong enough to create sharp lines and not leave makeup all over the place.</li>
            <li> Ive been searching for a brush set that is soft and does not shed hairs</li>
            <li> They felt like soft like feathers.  </li>
            <li> These are professional makeup brushes and make it easier for me now to put on all my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but not so soft that they do not hold up when you are using them.</li>
            <li> other brushes makes the eyeshadow nicer, and its so fun to use them .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most blending brushes are big and cover too big of an area on the eye and can make a mess for you.</li>
            <li> I really like that they have the long handles which makes controlling the brush easier.</li>
            <li> However, if you purchase it and are not completely satisfied then rest easy knowing that you can get your money back if you so desire.</li>
            <li> I really like that because most cases have the clear plastic that goes over the brushes and if the brushes are dirty it transfers into the case.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and gentle on the eye lids, not rough or stiff.</li>
            <li> I received these brushes for review at little or at no cost and to give my unbiased opinion and that is exactly what I just did.</li>
            <li> These Sylk makeup brushes are just as good, if not better actually, for less than half the price of the Sigmas.</li>
            <li> I have really gone through less makeup since I started using these brushes.</li>
            <li> This whole set costs less than what I paid for one eye makeup brush at MAC!</li>
            <li> and they weren&#x27;t expensive at all, especially compared to many other brands.</li>
            <li> She has not been wearing makeup long</li>
            <li> This one is small enough to get in targeted areas without blending out the shadow too much and have a mess.</li>
            <li> So I had just bought these expensive Sigma brushes thinking they were going to be great and don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> I literally use these brushes every single day.</li>
            <li> and I have not had any of the bristles fall out or come loose.</li>
            <li> Its small enough to travel with or just keep in your purse for on the go brushes.</li>
            <li> but there is also a zip close area for other makeup</li>
            <li> The carrier pack comes with a zipper pocket where you can store other eye make up products, like mascara or eye liner.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to any of my makeup fanatic friends like myself.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend them, and this is coming from a makeup fanatic!</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t the type to put makeup ,but after i bought it i put make up everyday , it makes the make up look prettier .</li>
            <li> The four brushes that you get are the blending brush, the angle brush, the eye liner brush and a small shading brush.</li>
            <li> but they were so expensive and would not buy again!</li>

            <li> These brushes are superior. Comparable to MAC, Dior and Sephora and check out the price. Boom!!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. Love them! They are so soft yet strong enough to create sharp lines and not leave makeup all over the place. The makeup also adheres to these brushes well. I have really gone through less makeup since I started using these brushes. They have saved me money!! The angled brush is perfect to apply small spaces. I use it to apply makeup in the crease of my eye. I was fortunate enough to be offered these brushes at a great price to test and provide my honest unbiased opioin of them. I plan on purchasing this set for my teenage daughters. The brushes will help anyone apply makeup better.</li>
            <li> I received these sylk contour makeup brushes for eye makeup for a product review and they are my new favorite eye shadow applicators. This set comes with 4 brushes and they come in a very convenient travel bag that I love almost as much as I love the brushes. The bag securely holds all four brushes and has a large zip compartment. I was able to fit 2 of the 4 shades eye shadow cases, 2 eye liners and a tube of mascara into the zip compartment. Then the case has a snap closure. It is very useful. The four brushes that you get are the blending brush, the angle brush, the eye liner brush and a small shading brush. I literally use these brushes every single day. I really like that they have the long handles which makes controlling the brush easier. The bristles are soft and gentle on the eye lids, not rough or stiff. This is a must have item for anybody that loves to effectively put on shadow. I have found the quality of the brush makes a difference in how the eye shadow looks. The better the brush the more professional you can make the application look and feel. I love this set so much, I really think it is a must have. However, if you purchase it and are not completely satisfied then rest easy knowing that you can get your money back if you so desire.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing and so practical to carry around! The eyeshadow brush is soft but applies my shadow on perfectly. I use the angle brush wet and dry, and it&#x27;s very easy to handle. They are so easy to clean which is a huge deal for me, and my makeup looks natural--never caked on. I love the wallet sized pouch it comes in. There is a zipper on the side where I can store my mascara, lipstick and liner. It keeps me super organized when I travel or take my makeup out with me!</li>
            <li> Great high quality brushes! I love these brushes especially at this price. Ive been searching for a brush set that is soft and does not shed hairs and I have found it. The angle and small shader brushes are perfect for filling in and shaping my eyebrows while the blending brush is the perfect size for use in the creases. The eyeliner brush is sturdy enough to perfectly line my water line and create a winged eyeliner look. On top of that is comes with a convenient carrying case that protects the brushes and provides an additional pouch to carry additional makeup. Its great for traveling but compact enough to throw into your purse without adding bulk. They definitely beat out my Sigma brushes especially at this price, this set is a must buy!</li>
            <li> I love the case that they come in. It is a vinyl type case and even the cover that covers the brushes themselves is the same material. I really like that because most cases have the clear plastic that goes over the brushes and if the brushes are dirty it transfers into the case. This does not happen with these brushes because the vinyl material keeps the makeup from transferring and you can not see the makeup marks. It has a button closure and has an extra zip up pouch to carry more brushes with or whatever else you need. Its small enough to travel with or just keep in your purse for on the go brushes. The brushes themselves are awesome! They are very nicely made with a mix of synthetic and natural hairs. It comes with a eyeliner brush, a shader brush, a shadow blending brush, and an angle brush. I personally use the angled brush for a eyebrow brush and it works so amazingly well! It works better than any eyebrow brush I have used before! The brushes are very nicely made and do not shed or come lose at the tips. The blending brush is my favorite out of all four them! It works so nicely getting in the crease and blending out the shadows. Most blending brushes are big and cover too big of an area on the eye and can make a mess for you. This one is small enough to get in targeted areas without blending out the shadow too much and have a mess. I really appreciate these and highly recommend everyone to check them out! ** I got this product free to review in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> This is the perfect set of essential brushes for eye makeup. They are well made, really soft, and the perfect set for travel. The blending brush is absolutely amazing for your crease color. It&#x27;s a perfect lid brush and creates a flawless smokey eye. The blending is amazing with this brush. She angled brush is great for a cut crease look or even to use to fill in your eyebrows. The eyeliner brush is an awesome precision brush to create a nice sleek perfect eyeliner line and helps create the perfect eyeliner wing. The shader brush is awesome for pigments, glitters, or the inner corner of the eye. I was highly impressed with the quality of this brush set. I have been using it daily ever since I got it. I have around 60 brushes ranging from $1 each to $40 each and I have been using these ones each time. They are easy to clean and they feel just as soft as they did the second they arrived to my house. They are so stylish and sleek! This is definitely one of those sets that go above and beyond your expectations when looking at the price. Here, you get WAY more than you pay for! *Sample provided for testing and review*</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:9e787d4acaa0ee3d0631fa9333c812fe]] This set is perfect for all areas of the eyes.

            <li> These brushes are essential when doing your makeup! Before I purchased these, I wasn&#x27;t really a brush person until my friend suggested them to me. I use the angled brush to fill in my eyebrows and draw my gel liner and I get a smooth, sharp look every time thanks to the quality of the bristles and the angle of the brush. The blending brush is perfect for my eyeshadow and the small shader is perfect enough to hey creases and inner corners. Not to mention the bag that it comes in, which was free! It makes it easy to carry all my brushes in and some extra makeup like my lipstick and eyeliner and mascara. I would definitely recommend this product to any of my makeup fanatic friends like myself.</li>
            <li> So I had just bought these expensive Sigma brushes thinking they were going to be great and don&#x27;t get me wrong they were but they were so expensive and would not buy again! These Sylk makeup brushes are just as good, if not better actually, for less than half the price of the Sigmas. They&#x27;re super soft and carry the makeup so well! I love them!! I totally recommend them, and this is coming from a makeup fanatic!</li>
            <li> http://youtu.be/Dhs6sJ-y9RA</li>
            <li> I have used these brushes and all I have to say there sooo amazing they apply make up really nice just like Any other brand name brushes and I love how you get a little make up bag with them incase you don&#x27;t want them uncovered and you can even use it for make up!</li>
            <li> i loved the brushes . i wasn&#x27;t the type to put makeup ,but after i bought it i put make up everyday , it makes the make up look prettier . the eyeliner brush is awesome , since i never put my eyeliner good before , but when i used it ,it turned out perfect .the other brushes makes the eyeshadow nicer, and its so fun to use them .&lt;br /&gt;the brush are so soft , and so easy for using and it makes the makeup waaaay nicer</li>
            <li> I gifted these to my sister who really only uses I make up. She loves them.  Her exact words were they felt so good when applying her eye-shadow.  They felt like soft like feathers.  She&#x27;s headed to town now to get some more eyeliner to try her brush out.  Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the quality and am amazed on how great the Sylk Contour Makeup Brush set is. These are professional makeup brushes and make it easier for me now to put on all my eye makeup. The brushes are made with synthetic and natural hairs which are so soft and smooth. I really like the idea of receiving a brush for eyebrows, eye shadow, a blending brush and an eyeliner brush all in one set. I am completely satisfied with how well made these brushes are and what a difference it has made for me in applying my makeup. These brushes are great, rather I am applying powder or liquid cosmetics to my face.The laminate wood handles feel really good, are sturdy and are the perfect size in width and length. The black travel case is my favorite part of this set, because not only is it for travel, it is nice and compact that I put in my purse. It holds and stores all the brushes in place but the biggest feature to me on the case is on the top part that you fold over the brushes has a separate zippered compartment. In this zippered compartment I put my eyeliner, mascara, compact eye shadow and lip gloss in. Even with having my make up in the zippered part it does not make the case bulky at all.&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to clean the brushes, just brush gently on a tissue or paper towel for powder cosmetics and for liquid just carefully remove the excess oil with a tissue. I did receive a discount for these makeup brushes so that I can provide my honest opinion and feedback. I recommend this makeup brush set, they are great quality brushes with a well made travel bag.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!! I am not really big on make-up or make-up brushes and I am picky with what i use, but these brushes were easy to use, soft, and applied my make-up so well! I am really impressed with their quality and they weren&#x27;t expensive at all, especially compared to many other brands. I also love the cute pouch they come in. There is a place for each brush and an extra zipper pouch that perfectly fits my to-go make up. I would absolutely recommend these brushes to anyone, they are great!</li>
            <li> I must say these brushes come in the most perfect packaging! Love the quality of the bristles. This set is the perfect combination for a full eye makeup that looks well blended, bristles are firm but soft enough to leave a soft finish. The carrier pack comes with a zipper pocket where you can store other eye make up products, like mascara or eye liner.</li>
            <li> Perfect for eye makeup! I love how precise it lets me apply shadow and be able to use different colors together.  These are high quality brushes for a great deal.  This whole set costs less than what I paid for one eye makeup brush at MAC!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! I&#x27;m a new to applying makeup with brushes and these are so easy to use, and effective! I&#x27;ve noticed my makeup looks better and more mature looking, accurate. They are precise, and they clean very easily!</li>
            <li> I recently received the Sylk Contour Makeup Brush set and was amazed by the brushes. I Had my daughter test them out as she is the one that wears all the make up in the house and she said she loved them. The bristles are not hard, they are very soft and it makes putting on make up a lot easier. It comes with a set of four brushes to give you your own personal choice of which brush to use to put on your eye shadow with. Perfect for her. Another big plus about this kit is that it comes in its own personal black silky carrying case and it keeps all of the brushes perfectly straight and in place the whole time, so you can take it on the go, wherever you go. You never have to worry about the brushes getting messed up. She also uses the brushes to keep her eye liner straight. She told me that everyone of the brushes are amazing and better than the ones we paid a lot for in the past and that they seem like they will hold up for a really long time. I was very satisfied to hear how much my daughter enjoys these makeup brushes, she is very picky and I wondered how she was going to rate them. I am very proud to say that they were packed in her luggage tonight as she went off to school and to stay at her aunts. She said there the only brushes she cares to take anywhere because they work so good and are easy to apply her make up with. I would say that is a good review coming from her. I received these brushes for review at little or at no cost and to give my unbiased opinion and that is exactly what I just did. I highly suggest these brushes, even for the pickiest girl in your life:) I&#x27;m so happy to have been given the opportunity to have her try them out and to learn exactly how much she loved them .I almost for got to mention, these do come with a warranty:) BIG PLUS!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for makeup brushes for my teenage daughter.  She has not been wearing makeup long and I wanted to start her off right.  I wanted her to learn how to use brushes instead of those small brushes that come with most eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four brushes come in the set. They each have their own use.  I was very impressed with how easy it was to wash them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pouch they come in is nice.  It holds the brushes and also has a zipper pouch that can hold some lipstick and massacre.</li>
            <li> These are very good quality makeup brushes. The bristles are soft but not so soft that they do not hold up when you are using them. They are well held together. I have used them many times already and they are still help together and I have not had any of the bristles fall out or come loose. This set comes with four different sizes so you have whatever size brush you may need when applying your makeup. This is overall a great set and I would highly suggest it to anyone looking for a good quality makeup brush set. I am very grateful I was given the opportunity to purchase this set at a discount price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
