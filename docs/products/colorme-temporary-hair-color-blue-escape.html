            <li>Good for &amp;#34;crazy</li>
            <li>We Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;A lot easier than chalk!</li>
            <li>used the Fushia Fusion and loved it, now we are onto more colors!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Nice color and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This color looks great on dark hair, and is as bright as the color on the bottle!</li>
            <li>Good product, dries fast &amp; looks cute!</li>
            <li>love it that its gone after washing your hair</li>
            <li>really love it</li>
            <li>I love these &amp;#34;Color</li>
            <li>I love being able to change colors to match my outfits.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite color.</li>
            <li>Easy on, easy off.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is not a fault with this particular brand or color - this is just the truth for this kind of hair coloring.  </li>
            <li>Very bright, even with my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>Washes out easily - quite the thrill the first time!</li>
            <li>It is fun for just a pop of color and to be fun, regardless of your age. :)</li>
            <li>This was fun for the kids and easy to wash out.  </li>
            <li>That is true of any hair chalk.  </li>
            <li>This matches my favorite sweather really well</li>
            <li>It is pretty much exactly like non-waterproof mascara, and will clump up hair like hairspray as it dries, so be sure to comb it all out before applying.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for kids and lets little boys have fun with styling, too!</li>
            <li>The color is fine - but it will absolutely run onto your pillow and clothes.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s fun to play with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get it right or run out of the products.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!!)&lt;br /&gt;(sorry</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>My daughter stuck some in my colored (blond) hair, and it washed readily out (to my relief!)</li>
            <li>The color is bright and you can add as much as you want or as little as you want.</li>
            <li>the color is very vibrant, noticeable, and pretty, and it self-seals.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very bright blue, my little one loves it!</li>
            <li>Washed out easily the next day.</li>
            <li>Wait 10-15 minutes then gently comb through it.</li>
            <li>It really depends on you.</li>
            <li>They go on so easily and are such vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>Once dry, the more I brushed my hair, the more the color faded and it was barely noticable.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to hide the damage looking hair by spraying a dry conditioner on the hair, which made my hair look normal again, so</li>
            <li>Colorme lasts about the same amount of time as the Joyous temporary hair colors, 2-4 days, but starts to fade right after the first day.</li>
            <li>I do streaks in the front of my hair where it&#x27;s mostly gray (the rest of my hair is black.)</li>
            <li>Colorme is okay for a temporary hair color, but I didn&#x27;t like how it makes my hair look; it made my hair look damaged and dried out, unlike the Joyous temporary hair color, so I probably won&#x27;t buy this again, but I really like the color</li>
            <li>but the next day when I washed my hair it was pretty much all off of my fingers.  </li>
            <li>There is no way to tell whether I have received a new item, or used.</li>
            <li>However, it didn&#x27;t frizz my hair enough that it was too noticeable, so with oil or a dry spray on conditioner, you should be perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>This product is not messy like chart.</li>
            <li>Like the Joyous temporary hair colors, the Colorme wash right out when you wet your hair.</li>
            <li>I do recommend trying the Colorme temporary hair colors though because they don&#x27;t stain you or your clothes and get on everything, so there is no mess,</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not easy to clean off.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it take many forever to get one piece of hair blue, but it leaves your hair sticky and stiff.</li>
            <li>and I tried the blue first on dry hair.  </li>
            <li>If you have straight hair, then you won&#x27;t likely care, but if you have curly, kinky, or frizzy hair, this might not completely work for you.</li>
            <li>This product has a very vibrant blue color even on black hair.  </li>

            <li> In addition, if you are Black like me and has hair that can&#x27;t get wet if you want it to look tame and decent, then you need to be aware that this product does wet your hair quite a bit, though it dries almost instantly, but it wets it enough that it somewhat frizzed my hair.</li>
            <li> I tried the teal the second time on wet hair and used a brush rather than my fingers.  </li>
            <li> I put it on after my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> Then I used a conair blow drying brush to dry it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Be warned that the bottle is tiny with a little mascara type applicator.</li>
            <li> That means it&#x27;s going to come off under other circumstance too, so plan accordingly.</li>
            <li> I want the other colors they have as well</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll see how the other colors go.</li>
            <li> Works well in dark hair.  </li>
            <li> My son has black hair and this showed up, a bit greenish.</li>
            <li> and since I have dark hair (almost black), it looks subtle enough that people do a double-take &#x27;cause they&#x27;re not sure they see color in your hair.</li>
            <li> but i think its a little pricey for what you get</li>
            <li> We got this for my 10 year old niece because she is obsessed with mermaids.  </li>
            <li> Use it as a highlight to jazz up some strands for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Washes out easily, so it is not a long-term commitment.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived in an envelope jammed between two broken pieces of Styrofoam.</li>
            <li> This is very messy though.  </li>
            <li> It leaves the hair very rough and difficult to style!</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to apply the product to your hair without making a mess!</li>
            <li> It is unlikely though, because if it looks damaged from this product, then it must have hurt or damaged my hair, and I try to avoid damaging my hair, so I am uncomfortable using the Colorme temporary hair colors.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

            <li> Nice color and easy to use. Washed out easily the next day. I put it on after my hair is dry. Wait 10-15 minutes then gently comb through it. I do give it 5 stars!</li>

            <li> We got this for my 10 year old niece because she is obsessed with mermaids.  My 20-something daughter uses it all the time.  Washes out easily - quite the thrill the first time!</li>

It is unlikely though, because if it looks damaged from this product, then it must have hurt or damaged my hair, and I try to avoid damaging my hair, so I am uncomfortable using the Colorme temporary hair colors.

            <li> This product has a very vibrant blue color even on black hair.  It arrived on time and works great.  Can get flakey.</li>
            <li> Easy on, easy off.  Very bright, even with my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in an envelope jammed between two broken pieces of Styrofoam. Product was not sealed. There is no way to tell whether I have received a new item, or used. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This color looks great on dark hair, and is as bright as the color on the bottle! So it&#x27;s fun to play with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned that the bottle is tiny with a little mascara type applicator. It is almost impossible to apply the product to your hair without making a mess! It leaves the hair very rough and difficult to style! Even after several hours, the color gets on your hands when you run it through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I won&#x27;t recommend applying it liberally. Use it as a highlight to jazz up some strands for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Not only does it take many forever to get one piece of hair blue, but it leaves your hair sticky and stiff. Ended up throwing it away. Horrible!</li>
            <li> The color is fine - but it will absolutely run onto your pillow and clothes.  That is true of any hair chalk.  So - consider if you will be sweating (from dancing or whatever) and whether you will be showering before your head comes into contact with hats and pillows.  This is not a fault with this particular brand or color - this is just the truth for this kind of hair coloring.  It doesn&#x27;t die the hair - which would be temp-permanent.  It is just a coating on the outside of the hair and it needs to be water soluble so you can wash it off.  That means it&#x27;s going to come off under other circumstance too, so plan accordingly.</li>
            <li> Good product, dries fast &amp; looks cute! I want the other colors they have as well but i think its a little pricey for what you get</li>
            <li> I really like it! It&#x27;s a very bright blue, my little one loves it! Every time he gets a haircut his Barber puts some blue color in the front and he loves it, so I bought one for at home. It&#x27;s great for kids and lets little boys have fun with styling, too!</li>
            <li> This is very messy though.  I would definately recommend wearing gloves when using. I bought several of the colors and I tried the blue first on dry hair.  The color bled off onto my hands if I touched my hair.  It left my fingers blue where I touched it when applying it for a day but the next day when I washed my hair it was pretty much all off of my fingers.  I tried the teal the second time on wet hair and used a brush rather than my fingers.  Then I used a conair blow drying brush to dry it.  Not recommended.  The color was left on the hair brush and the dryer brush and it&#x27;s not easy to clean off.  I soaked it and used a toothbrush to scrub it after 1/2 hr of soaking and still couldn&#x27;t get it all off the bristles.  While I was applying it, I still managed to get it all over my fingers/hands.  Once dry, the more I brushed my hair, the more the color faded and it was barely noticable.  I&#x27;ll try it again using different methods til I get it right or run out of the products.  I bought 5 colors so I&#x27;ll see how the other colors go. It is fun for just a pop of color and to be fun, regardless of your age. :)</li>
            <li> Works well in dark hair.  Easy to use. Washes out easily, so it is not a long-term commitment.  Good for &amp;#34;crazy hair day&amp;#34; at camp/school.</li>
            <li> This matches my favorite sweather really well and since I have dark hair (almost black), it looks subtle enough that people do a double-take &#x27;cause they&#x27;re not sure they see color in your hair.</li>
            <li> love it that its gone after washing your hair</li>
            <li> This was fun for the kids and easy to wash out.  It is pretty much exactly like non-waterproof mascara, and will clump up hair like hairspray as it dries, so be sure to comb it all out before applying.  My daughter stuck some in my colored (blond) hair, and it washed readily out (to my relief!)</li>
            <li> We Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;A lot easier than chalk! My son has black hair and this showed up, a bit greenish. I have blonde hair, it is blue!&lt;br /&gt;Ive used the Fushia Fusion and loved it, now we are onto more colors!&lt;br /&gt;If you want a temp sass, this is an awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;(Who needs Prime with this seller? Super fast shipping!!)&lt;br /&gt;(sorry, my son is under age, I dont want to post his pic.)</li>
            <li> This product is not messy like chart. The color is bright and you can add as much as you want or as little as you want. really love it</li>
            <li> I love these &amp;#34;Color me&amp;#34; hair colors. They go on so easily and are such vibrant colors. I do streaks in the front of my hair where it&#x27;s mostly gray (the rest of my hair is black.) I love being able to change colors to match my outfits. I get compliments all the time. This is my favorite color.</li>
