            <li>Also, since using this cream, I&#x27;ve noticed that the redness in my cheeks has significantly diminished!!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so I was delighted to see on the product label that it is paraben-free, fragrance-free, and does not contain mineral oil!!</li>

            <li>and I love the way my skin feels after wards.</li>
            <li>When I tried to apply make-up on top of it, it made my skin flaky.     </li>

            <li>I love this product.  </li>

            <li>It goes on smoothly and is not greasy!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>If it weren&#x27;t for that I would have given it a better rating.</li>
            <li>Love it!it is creamy, lasting and the best!</li>
            <li>reference the EWG for product/ingredient information, your precious face deserves it :)</li>
            <li>and I LOVE the fact that it has no smell.</li>
            <li>Love how it goes on.</li>
            <li>It is gentle but very effective.  </li>
            <li>It feels wonderful and lasts long.  </li>
            <li>So good enough for summer not so good in winter.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product - fragrance free and simply a great product for the price.  </li>
            <li>Great product, absorbs well and makes your skin soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>It is paraben free and filled with healthy nutrients.  </li>
            <li>But Gogi Berry is very mild and moisturizes the driest skin without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>This is the most AMAZING facial cream I&#x27;ve ever tried-with all the same ingredients as many $$$$ creams!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in the texture of my skin, hydration, and reduced look of fine lines.</li>
            <li>but I am glad I don&#x27;t have to pay for a pretty container!</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin either which is a huge deal for me.</li>
            <li>This fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>it was very creamy and felt nice when I rubbed it between my fingers</li>
            <li>I love this facial cream, my sensitive skin loves it and the pricing here is the best around.</li>
            <li>I have tried to go more natural in all aspects of my life in the last year and finding the perfect face cream was like the holy grail for me.  </li>
            <li>the price was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>A truly fragrance free lotion.  </li>
            <li>Overall, good sized bottle (I purchased the 4 oz.) and no scent, which is great for people with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>so it is very economical to use.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly for easy makeup application.</li>
            <li>A wonderful creamy lotion, that really helps if you get dry spots on your face, ears, etc.</li>
            <li>This is a rich and moisturizing cream that does not feel or look greasy.</li>
            <li>This also contains oils which may or may not be friendly for oily skin.</li>
            <li>For the price, it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>If you have psoriasis etc, because it really does make most of it disappear.</li>
            <li>And this stuff is so much more creamy &amp; gentle than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This cream is excellent for dry, irritated, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It would have been great if the product had worked as it is inexpensive compared to the other organic paraben-free face moisturizers with retinols out there.</li>
            <li>It may not have the retinols and may be more expensive, but it is organic and paraben-free, works wonders for my skin and smells just awesome!</li>
            <li>smooth, nice, lasting mosturizer</li>
            <li>This is a great all-around facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It goes on without any tackiness, absorbs easily and makes my mid-40&#x27;s skin positively glow.  </li>
            <li>When I first started using it, people remarked at how young I looked and how nice my skin looked.</li>
            <li>I was very dissappointed as I learned of so many positive results on this website and</li>
            <li>Lightweight, fragrance free, and moisturizes very well.  </li>
            <li>Hmmm, it was worth a try</li>
            <li>This product suits those with dry/mature skin far better.</li>
            <li>I have the most sensitive skin and eyes to even vaseline.  </li>
            <li>other thing that made me want to buy this was that it is a good anti-aging cream.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle since it doesn&#x27;t contain parabens and fragrance.</li>
            <li>A couple of minutes after putting this cream on my face, my skin began to burn and I got many red patches.</li>
            <li>I immediately washed my face and within a couple of minutes most of the red went away.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much I love this facial cream!  </li>
            <li>i will buy more later !!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>Works very well together!</li>
            <li>There are also other great ingredients in this cream, such as: Grapeseed Oil (a skin protectant &amp; an antioxidant) and Evening Primose Oil (an anti-inflammatory agent that revitalizes aging skin).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very particular about ingredients, which is why I use this product.</li>
            <li>It has some smart ingredients like goji berry antioxidants, hyaluronic acid, retinol, and ECGC, amongst others.</li>
            <li>For only $10 you get 4 ounces of this fantastic, certified organic cream that gives my skin a glow like never before</li>
            <li>I have used origins my whole life and then started using acid peels and retin-A</li>
            <li>Priced reasonably as well.</li>
            <li>I have also been drinking Glgi Berry Juice for arthritis and it is very helpful to me.</li>
            <li>A rare find for the chemically sensitive household.  </li>
            <li>I have used a very popular age defying facial cream for several years, but was concerned at the production outside of the U.S and the chemicals used in it.  </li>
            <li>I have used much higher priced products and prefer this one by far.</li>
            <li>The cream also is totally fragrance free, another plus for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff,&lt;br /&gt;great  for aging  skin,&lt;br /&gt; keeps skin tight  and not sagging&lt;br</li>
            <li>It might be the high percentage of ispropyl myristate, which is a known pore clogger.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>, retinol has a High Hazard score of 8 on the EWG&#x27;s skindeep</li>
            <li>and although I started to rash up, it does feel non-greasy, and very moisturizing for someone like me who has super dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, but never have I had such a quick reaction to any product.  </li>
            <li>I saw this for the great price and was skeptical.  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy like some creams, but when you put it on any part of your skin, it is absorbed instantly.    </li>
            <li>They have become more supple and soft and less scaly dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is also sensitive and while the consistency is thick, it is non greasy and absorbs quickly - absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li>this should be your new night/day cream.</li>
            <li>I have normal-to-dry skin and applying this product on my face in the mornings or nights did not leave my face particularly moisturized or soft or anything.</li>
            <li>Underneath the lid of jar can show a leftover LIGHT wax film, so rinsing off w/some water at end of day, would probably help people with dry skin issues, then reapply next morning.     </li>
            <li>natural ingredients are a plus as well.  </li>
            <li>but I guess my skin was just too sensitive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a complete wow product, organic products at this price is unimaginable.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, but have not had one reaction with this product.</li>
            <li>I was very grateful when the store gave me a sample to take home, but when I tried it out, immediately my face turned red and blochy.  </li>
            <li>It is not a heavy cream, but still penetrates into my skin and keeps is well moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel young.  </li>
            <li>It is not at all greasy and leaves your face feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I needed a night cream for my sensitive skin and use goji berry hydrating mask from Freeman and my skin loves that.</li>
            <li>This cream is velvety and smooth going on but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li>and there is no harsh ordor.</li>
            <li>All natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Its a thick cream so better used before going to bed or during the morning hours only if you plan staying at home the whole day.</li>
            <li>This is the best face cream and doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of crap I can&#x27;t pronounce.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and this lotion is very moisturizing!  </li>
            <li>, you will get a small amount of redness in those spots though, Normal for ANY lotion pretty much.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft, with no icky residue left over.  </li>
            <li>Not great on a hot day but fantastic as a night cream.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this cream for the above mentioned skin types.</li>
            <li>However, I can normally tell from several uses if it is going to work for me.</li>
            <li>This product has totally outdone the other one and at a much lower price!!</li>
            <li>I supposed I expected too much.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to see this product, Home Health&#x27;s \\&quot;Goji Berry facial cream\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Not only do I use it, but my husband and 18 year old daughter use it every day.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a natural and nourishing facial cream, look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;Please</li>
            <li>, it has that typical smell of something i don&#x27;t know what exactly, to get rid of that</li>
            <li>I also like to blend this cream with Acure Organics Seriously Firming Serum, an Argan Oil blend, at night or when my skin if feeling a bit more dry.</li>
            <li>I have normal/combo (sometimes a bit oily, sometimes a bit dry) skin, which can also be sensitive and prone to breakouts.</li>

            <li> But Gogi Berry is very mild and moisturizes the driest skin without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> This is the most AMAZING facial cream I&#x27;ve ever tried-with all the same ingredients as many $$$$ creams!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in the texture of my skin, hydration, and reduced look of fine lines.</li>
            <li> but I am glad I don&#x27;t have to pay for a pretty container!</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin either which is a huge deal for me.</li>
            <li> This fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> it was very creamy and felt nice when I rubbed it between my fingers</li>
            <li> I love this facial cream, my sensitive skin loves it and the pricing here is the best around.</li>
            <li> I have tried to go more natural in all aspects of my life in the last year and finding the perfect face cream was like the holy grail for me.  </li>
            <li> the price was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> A truly fragrance free lotion.  </li>
            <li> Overall, good sized bottle (I purchased the 4 oz.) and no scent, which is great for people with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> so it is very economical to use.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly for easy makeup application.</li>
            <li> A wonderful creamy lotion, that really helps if you get dry spots on your face, ears, etc.</li>
            <li> This is a rich and moisturizing cream that does not feel or look greasy.</li>
            <li> This also contains oils which may or may not be friendly for oily skin.</li>
            <li> For the price, it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> If you have psoriasis etc, because it really does make most of it disappear.</li>
            <li> And this stuff is so much more creamy &amp; gentle than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This cream is excellent for dry, irritated, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It would have been great if the product had worked as it is inexpensive compared to the other organic paraben-free face moisturizers with retinols out there.</li>
            <li> It may not have the retinols and may be more expensive, but it is organic and paraben-free, works wonders for my skin and smells just awesome!</li>
            <li> smooth, nice, lasting mosturizer</li>
            <li> This is a great all-around facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It goes on without any tackiness, absorbs easily and makes my mid-40&#x27;s skin positively glow.  </li>
            <li> When I first started using it, people remarked at how young I looked and how nice my skin looked.</li>
            <li> I was very dissappointed as I learned of so many positive results on this website and</li>
            <li> Lightweight, fragrance free, and moisturizes very well.  </li>
            <li> Hmmm, it was worth a try</li>
            <li> This product suits those with dry/mature skin far better.</li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive skin and eyes to even vaseline.  </li>
            <li> other thing that made me want to buy this was that it is a good anti-aging cream.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle since it doesn&#x27;t contain parabens and fragrance.</li>
            <li> A couple of minutes after putting this cream on my face, my skin began to burn and I got many red patches.</li>
            <li> I immediately washed my face and within a couple of minutes most of the red went away.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much I love this facial cream!  </li>
            <li> i will buy more later !!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Works very well together!</li>
            <li> There are also other great ingredients in this cream, such as: Grapeseed Oil (a skin protectant &amp; an antioxidant) and Evening Primose Oil (an anti-inflammatory agent that revitalizes aging skin).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very particular about ingredients, which is why I use this product.</li>
            <li> It has some smart ingredients like goji berry antioxidants, hyaluronic acid, retinol, and ECGC, amongst others.</li>
            <li> For only $10 you get 4 ounces of this fantastic, certified organic cream that gives my skin a glow like never before</li>
            <li> I have used origins my whole life and then started using acid peels and retin-A</li>
            <li> Priced reasonably as well.</li>
            <li> I have also been drinking Glgi Berry Juice for arthritis and it is very helpful to me.</li>
            <li> A rare find for the chemically sensitive household.  </li>
            <li> I have used a very popular age defying facial cream for several years, but was concerned at the production outside of the U.S and the chemicals used in it.  </li>
            <li> I have used much higher priced products and prefer this one by far.</li>
            <li> The cream also is totally fragrance free, another plus for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff,&lt;br /&gt;great  for aging  skin,&lt;br /&gt; keeps skin tight  and not sagging&lt;br</li>
            <li> It might be the high percentage of ispropyl myristate, which is a known pore clogger.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> , retinol has a High Hazard score of 8 on the EWG&#x27;s skindeep</li>
            <li> and although I started to rash up, it does feel non-greasy, and very moisturizing for someone like me who has super dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, but never have I had such a quick reaction to any product.  </li>
            <li> I saw this for the great price and was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy like some creams, but when you put it on any part of your skin, it is absorbed instantly.    </li>
            <li> They have become more supple and soft and less scaly dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is also sensitive and while the consistency is thick, it is non greasy and absorbs quickly - absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li> this should be your new night/day cream.</li>
            <li> I have normal-to-dry skin and applying this product on my face in the mornings or nights did not leave my face particularly moisturized or soft or anything.</li>
            <li> Underneath the lid of jar can show a leftover LIGHT wax film, so rinsing off w/some water at end of day, would probably help people with dry skin issues, then reapply next morning.     </li>
            <li> natural ingredients are a plus as well.  </li>
            <li> but I guess my skin was just too sensitive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete wow product, organic products at this price is unimaginable.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, but have not had one reaction with this product.</li>
            <li> I was very grateful when the store gave me a sample to take home, but when I tried it out, immediately my face turned red and blochy.  </li>
            <li> It is not a heavy cream, but still penetrates into my skin and keeps is well moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel young.  </li>
            <li> It is not at all greasy and leaves your face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I needed a night cream for my sensitive skin and use goji berry hydrating mask from Freeman and my skin loves that.</li>
            <li> This cream is velvety and smooth going on but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li> and there is no harsh ordor.</li>
            <li> All natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Its a thick cream so better used before going to bed or during the morning hours only if you plan staying at home the whole day.</li>
            <li> This is the best face cream and doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of crap I can&#x27;t pronounce.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this lotion is very moisturizing!  </li>
            <li> , you will get a small amount of redness in those spots though, Normal for ANY lotion pretty much.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft, with no icky residue left over.  </li>
            <li> Not great on a hot day but fantastic as a night cream.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this cream for the above mentioned skin types.</li>
            <li> However, I can normally tell from several uses if it is going to work for me.</li>
            <li> This product has totally outdone the other one and at a much lower price!!</li>
            <li> I supposed I expected too much.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see this product, Home Health&#x27;s \\&quot;Goji Berry facial cream\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Not only do I use it, but my husband and 18 year old daughter use it every day.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a natural and nourishing facial cream, look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;Please</li>
            <li> , it has that typical smell of something i don&#x27;t know what exactly, to get rid of that</li>
            <li> I also like to blend this cream with Acure Organics Seriously Firming Serum, an Argan Oil blend, at night or when my skin if feeling a bit more dry.</li>
            <li> I have normal/combo (sometimes a bit oily, sometimes a bit dry) skin, which can also be sensitive and prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> The only reason it looses one star is because it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long....</li>
            <li> Can only recommend for skin that isn&#x27;t oily or dry.</li>
            <li> though).One container will go a long way mebbe for 1.5 months if you apply generously.</li>
            <li> I began using the other Home Health facial cream six months ago.</li>
            <li> But it might not be 100% G.F (due to possible contamination during the process etc.).</li>
            <li> It was a little too dense overall for my skin type (combo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a few drops of essential oil with it ( not everytime</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients aside, I found this cream to be too heavy for day use, and used it only at night.</li>
            <li> I think It&#x27;s particularly helpful for those with dry skin who are tired of products that create a layer of oiliness on the skin and</li>
            <li> The facial cream arrived in a jar that looked dirty, was not sealed nor boxed , and was less than half full.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t hydrate my face as well as other creams I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I have tried the other cream that the brand \\&quot;Home</li>
            <li> , so I went online (on this site) and searched for other products that \\&quot;Home</li>
            <li> I have an extreme sensitivity to fragrance, so thank you Home Health Company.  </li>
            <li> I will have to look to see if you have any other fragrance-free products.</li>
            <li> But, I got this, applied it, and it makes my skin tingle just like the mega expensive brand I first tried.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small amount</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a couple other ingredients that I find to be of concern as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my face usually starts feeling dry again after only a few hours.</li>
            <li> The only thing which is a bit annoying sometimes is the raw smell of the cream ( please note it is fragrance free!)</li>
            <li> Less smell less chemicals added for it, and it doesnt get on a way of other fragnances that I wear.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and even the expensive creams did not leave my face as soft.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the same result happened again, red blochy skin.  </li>
            <li> If used every day, over time skin becomes supple and tight and gains a clarity to it.</li>
            <li> I have been using everyday</li>
            <li> If you have raw areas you&#x27;re applying it to</li>
            <li> I purchased a small jar of this at a health food store and was hooked.  </li>
            <li> The price is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> That is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying the product is not good, as a matter of fact</li>
            <li> Gonna stock up before the word gets out and the price goes up....or worse....</li>
            <li> Every time I used it, it unfortunately broke me out.</li>
            <li> That was very disappointing for me at least!</li>
            <li> I have found that this cream works just as well, if not better, than a lot of the high-end department store brands that I have tried but without the insane pricetag.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> I got bloody diarrhea with minutes of application.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t hydrate my face as well as other creams I&#x27;ve used but it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin either which is a huge deal for me. So good enough for summer not so good in winter.</li>
            <li> I bought this after hearing how the Goji berries are filled with antioxidants and thought I would give this cream a try after reading all the great reviews and let me tell you, I am SO glad I did!!! This is the most AMAZING facial cream I&#x27;ve ever tried-with all the same ingredients as many $$$$ creams!!!! For only $10 you get 4 ounces of this fantastic, certified organic cream that gives my skin a glow like never before and I can tell it works-I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments already!!! I hope Home Heath makes this products forever cause it truly works!!! I can&#x27;t wait to try the eye cream as well!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good inexpensive face cream just as a skin moisturizer.  This fit the bill.  For a 4oz jar, the price can&#x27;t be beat.  And the cream works wonders.  Leaves skin feeling soft, with no icky residue left over.  Fragrance free is also great, as I can use it without it interfering with aftershave or cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The natural ingredients are a plus as well.  No parabens.  And also for those who are gluten intolerant, no gluten.</li>
            <li> A couple of minutes after putting this cream on my face, my skin began to burn and I got many red patches. I immediately washed my face and within a couple of minutes most of the red went away. I contacted customer service and they immediately gave me a refund. I was very pleased with that! I&#x27;m not saying the product is not good, as a matter of fact it was very creamy and felt nice when I rubbed it between my fingers but I guess my skin was just too sensitive. That was very disappointing for me at least!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful - a very rich moisturizing cream that goes immediately into your skin and keeps it smooth and beautiful all day.  I highly recommend this product - fragrance free and simply a great product for the price.  I have used much higher priced products and prefer this one by far.</li>
            <li> I got this just last week and I think that it is a great moisturizer! I have been using everyday and I love the way my skin feels after wards.</li>
            <li> I love this facial cream, my sensitive skin loves it and the pricing here is the best around. I wish it were a prettier container but I am glad I don&#x27;t have to pay for a pretty container!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete wow product, organic products at this price is unimaginable. Its an excellent organic facial cream and works wonderful on sensitive skin. Its a thick cream so better used before going to bed or during the morning hours only if you plan staying at home the whole day. I did not notice any breakouts and she&#x27;s very happy &#x27;coz it doesnot leave a greasy layer on the face after each application. The only thing which is a bit annoying sometimes is the raw smell of the cream ( please note it is fragrance free!), it has that typical smell of something i don&#x27;t know what exactly, to get rid of that I use a few drops of essential oil with it ( not everytime though).One container will go a long way mebbe for 1.5 months if you apply generously. It&#x27;s an excellent product by Homehealth, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product. I&#x27;ll rate it a 5 STAR !!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much I love this facial cream!  It goes on without any tackiness, absorbs easily and makes my mid-40&#x27;s skin positively glow.  Perfect alone or under makeup.  Even with the most expensive creams that I have tried, I always felt some dryness around my cheeks and mouth, but not with this cream.  It is paraben free and filled with healthy nutrients.  I could not be any happier with the product or the price.  I have tried to go more natural in all aspects of my life in the last year and finding the perfect face cream was like the holy grail for me.  Now, I&#x27;ve got it!</li>
            <li> I have used it for about two months now.  So far so good.  Smoother skin with no side effect.  It&#x27;s good price.  Give it a shot.</li>
            <li> A wonderful creamy lotion, that really helps if you get dry spots on your face, ears, etc. If you have psoriasis etc, because it really does make most of it disappear. Underneath the lid of jar can show a leftover LIGHT wax film, so rinsing off w/some water at end of day, would probably help people with dry skin issues, then reapply next morning.     If you have raw areas you&#x27;re applying it to, you will get a small amount of redness in those spots though, Normal for ANY lotion pretty much.  Just not the Burning that some end up providing you with!!  And this stuff is so much more creamy &amp; gentle than anything else I&#x27;ve used. PLUS IT WORKS!!!    Dont know about for the under eyes myself cause I dont use it there.</li>
            <li> At the time of writing this review, I can see that I&#x27;m the only one around here who&#x27;s not giving the product the highest rating possible. Ah well.    The thing is - the Goji Berry Facial Cream did nothing for me. Literally, nothing. I have normal-to-dry skin and applying this product on my face in the mornings or nights did not leave my face particularly moisturized or soft or anything. When I tried to apply make-up on top of it, it made my skin flaky.     It would have been great if the product had worked as it is inexpensive compared to the other organic paraben-free face moisturizers with retinols out there. Hmmm, it was worth a try I guess. I will continue to use my all-time favorite moisturizer [[ASIN:B000PILCJU Avalon Organic Botanicals, Oil-Free Moisturizer, Rejuvenating, Vitamin C, 2 oz]]. It may not have the retinols and may be more expensive, but it is organic and paraben-free, works wonders for my skin and smells just awesome!</li>
            <li> This is a good product, feels great, however, I am very sensitive to any scents in creams so I don&#x27;t actually like this one on my face. After I applied it to my face several times, I just didn&#x27;t like how it smelled on my skin. That&#x27;s the only reason I gave it 4 stars. I would still recommend it, I do use it on my hands and body.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for about a month, and am very impressed. I have very dry skin and even the expensive creams did not leave my face as soft. Great product for the cost.</li>
            <li> I supposed I expected too much.  I didn&#x27;t get the results I was expecting.  I&#x27;ll continue using it to see if it lives up to expectation.  However, I can normally tell from several uses if it is going to work for me.</li>
            <li> best face cream I have found that is actually a natural product.</li>
            <li> This is a rich and moisturizing cream that does not feel or look greasy. It has some smart ingredients like goji berry antioxidants, hyaluronic acid, retinol, and ECGC, amongst others. Although this has some wonderful ingredients, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right for oily/acne prone skin. Every time I used it, it unfortunately broke me out. It might be the high percentage of ispropyl myristate, which is a known pore clogger. This also contains oils which may or may not be friendly for oily skin. This facial cream is comedogenic. I would NOT recommend this to those who have oily/acne prone skin. This product suits those with dry/mature skin far better.</li>
            <li> I began using the other Home Health facial cream six months ago. I have extremely sensitive skin, but have not had one reaction with this product. It is very gentle since it doesn&#x27;t contain parabens and fragrance. I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in the texture of my skin, hydration, and reduced look of fine lines. For the price, it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I purchased a small jar of this at a health food store and was hooked.  I have the most sensitive skin and eyes to even vaseline.  But Gogi Berry is very mild and moisturizes the driest skin without being greasy.  I highly recommend this product. I found the best price for this cream on Amazon.Com</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that does not burn my face or my eyes when I use it after using my glycolic acid, lactic acid or salicylic acid.  I have used origins my whole life and then started using acid peels and retin-A and this stuff does not burn my skin at all. I love this stuff and it goes great under my origins foundation or powder.</li>
            <li> I found this product at a local health food store and wanted to try it out as a replacement for my more expensive moisturizer.  I was very grateful when the store gave me a sample to take home, but when I tried it out, immediately my face turned red and blochy.  I have very sensitive skin, but never have I had such a quick reaction to any product.  I was very dissappointed as I learned of so many positive results on this website and the price was fantastic.  I even thought of trying it again just in case it was some type of fluke the night before.  Unfortunately the same result happened again, red blochy skin.  I wish it lived up to the reviews for me as it did others.</li>
            <li> Very good face cream. If used every day, over time skin becomes supple and tight and gains a clarity to it. Not great on a hot day but fantastic as a night cream.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff,&lt;br /&gt;great  for aging  skin,&lt;br /&gt; keeps skin tight  and not sagging&lt;br /&gt;nice  i will buy more later !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you only need a dab&lt;br /&gt;spead all over your face and massage  it in good</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is gentle but very effective.  It has no noticeable scent, which is very important to me.  It is not a heavy cream, but still penetrates into my skin and keeps is well moisturized all day.  I also wear it at night.</li>
            <li> I have tried the other cream that the brand \\&quot;Home Health\\&quot; makes which is the \\&quot;Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing Cream\\&quot; for which I absolutely LOVE and recommend!!! I was very impressed by that product, so I went online (on this site) and searched for other products that \\&quot;Home Health\\&quot; makes...Sufficed to say -- I was pleasantly surprised to see this product, Home Health&#x27;s \\&quot;Goji Berry facial cream\\&quot;. I have very sensitive skin, so I was delighted to see on the product label that it is paraben-free, fragrance-free, and does not contain mineral oil!! It truly is a rarity to find skin care products that don&#x27;t contain those unwanted ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that made me want to buy this was that it is a good anti-aging cream. It contains ingredients such as: Hyaluronic Acid, Retinol, and Organic Goji Berry. There are also other great ingredients in this cream, such as: Grapeseed Oil (a skin protectant &amp; an antioxidant) and Evening Primose Oil (an anti-inflammatory agent that revitalizes aging skin). I got this cream very recently, and yet I&#x27;ve noticed that my facial skin feels firmer and softer. Also, since using this cream, I&#x27;ve noticed that the redness in my cheeks has significantly diminished!! I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> It feels wonderful and lasts long.  It makes my skin feel young.  I recommend it to everyone-man or woman.  No fragrance, so you won&#x27;t smell like a girl.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and don&#x27;t want anything else.</li>
            <li> This feels great on my face and helps to keep it moist and minimizes wrinkles. Priced reasonably as well. I plan to buy more when this gets close to running out.</li>
            <li> A truly fragrance free lotion.  That is hard to find.  I have an extreme sensitivity to fragrance, so thank you Home Health Company.  I will have to look to see if you have any other fragrance-free products.</li>
            <li> smooth, nice, lasting mosturizer-I use it under make up during the day</li>
            <li> The eye cream was great. The facial cream arrived in a jar that looked dirty, was not sealed nor boxed , and was less than half full. It looked like a sample that had been opened</li>
            <li> Lightweight, fragrance free, and moisturizes very well.  Great night time moisturizer or as a moisturizer before applying make-up; and it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li> wife said it was awesome and was vey happy with it. Can only recommend for skin that isn&#x27;t oily or dry.</li>
            <li> This Gogi Berry Face Cream is very nice.  It is not greasy like some creams, but when you put it on any part of your skin, it is absorbed instantly.    I have also been drinking Glgi Berry Juice for arthritis and it is very helpful to me. So , I thought I would use the cream.  Like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I tried a $60 dollar teensy vial of goji berry cream and it did wonders for my skin.  I saw this for the great price and was skeptical.  But, I got this, applied it, and it makes my skin tingle just like the mega expensive brand I first tried.  It goes on smoothly and is not greasy! It covers well and is so luxurious and wonderful!  I have gotten compliments on the lightness of my skin. It is truly a gorgeous product!  I am so happy I tried it.  I will never use anything else on my face and neck again!  I use it on my hands too. They have become more supple and soft and less scaly dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love love love this cream!  Gonna stock up before the word gets out and the price goes up....or worse....they stop selling it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goji berries are the best for skin!  I am also taking goji berry extract capsules daily. I got a bottle on here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get goji berry products!  They&#x27;ll change your life!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this lotion is very moisturizing!  My skin is also sensitive and while the consistency is thick, it is non greasy and absorbs quickly - absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Love it! Great product, absorbs well and makes your skin soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> I have used a very popular age defying facial cream for several years, but was concerned at the production outside of the U.S and the chemicals used in it.  This product has totally outdone the other one and at a much lower price!! It feels amazing and even better it has no perfumes, fragrance, or scent of any kind! A rare find for the chemically sensitive household.  DON&amp;#34;T change anything about the product! LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I got bloody diarrhea with minutes of application. This product did not make me happy nor does it make me want to buy it when it pops on my screen every time I access Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. It is not at all greasy and leaves your face feeling soft. Does not clog pores at all. I would highly suggest this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product! Not only do I use it, but my husband and 18 year old daughter use it every day. We all love the way this lotion makes our face feel and will continue to order it!</li>
            <li> I needed a night cream for my sensitive skin and use goji berry hydrating mask from Freeman and my skin loves that. This cream is excellent for dry, irritated, sensitive skin. It also contains hyaluronic acid which repairs and maintain moisture barrier.&lt;br /&gt;The cream comes in a generous 4oz. jar and priced $13-$15. You only need a small amount so it is very economical to use. The cream also is totally fragrance free, another plus for sensitive skin. It is formulated without parabens.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this cream for the above mentioned skin types.</li>
            <li> This is a great all-around facial moisturizer. The only reason it looses one star is because it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long....my face usually starts feeling dry again after only a few hours.</li>
            <li> saw no improvement from using this product</li>
            <li> But it might not be 100% G.F (due to possible contamination during the process etc.). I have Celiac and one of my symptoms is rashes when I come in contact with products that contain gluten. This product gave me a facial rash so I have to throw it away. :( If it weren&#x27;t for that I would have given it a better rating. Overall, good sized bottle (I purchased the 4 oz.) and no scent, which is great for people with sensitive skin and it&#x27;s at a great price so it&#x27;s affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only tried it once and although I started to rash up, it does feel non-greasy, and very moisturizing for someone like me who has super dry skin. If you don&#x27;t have any gluten allergies then I&#x27;d say go for it, give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this face cream for several years now. When I first started using it, people remarked at how young I looked and how nice my skin looked. I hope this company is always around! This is the best face cream and doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of crap I can&#x27;t pronounce.</li>
            <li> Love it!it is creamy, lasting and the best! ladies this should be your new night/day cream. it also smells wonderful</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and it is very nice, goes on nicely and isn&#x27;t greasy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very particular about ingredients, which is why I use this product. It has all the key ingredients that have any value to skin care. It goes on smooth and has good penetration. I think It&#x27;s particularly helpful for those with dry skin who are tired of products that create a layer of oiliness on the skin and that &#x27;shiny look&#x27;. This is a good product at a great price. Haven&#x27;t found anything to entice me away from it.</li>
            <li> I have found the labeling on this product to be misleading:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;No Animal Products\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Both Sodium Hyaluronate (hyaluronic acid) &amp; Diazolidinyl Urea are from animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, retinol has a High Hazard score of 8 on the EWG&#x27;s skindeep database.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple other ingredients that I find to be of concern as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients aside, I found this cream to be too heavy for day use, and used it only at night. It was a little too dense overall for my skin type (combo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a natural and nourishing facial cream, look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;Please reference the EWG for product/ingredient information, your precious face deserves it :)</li>
            <li> Good cream. I just started using it, but it seems to moisturize very nice. Not greasy and I LOVE the fact that it has no smell. Less smell less chemicals added for it, and it doesnt get on a way of other fragnances that I wear.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about a year and have been very happy with it! I have normal/combo (sometimes a bit oily, sometimes a bit dry) skin, which can also be sensitive and prone to breakouts. This cream is velvety and smooth going on but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. It absorbs quickly for easy makeup application. It doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate or cause breakouts and there is no harsh ordor. I have found that this cream works just as well, if not better, than a lot of the high-end department store brands that I have tried but without the insane pricetag. I also like to blend this cream with Acure Organics Seriously Firming Serum, an Argan Oil blend, at night or when my skin if feeling a bit more dry. Works very well together!</li>
            <li> Love how it goes on. The price is unbelievable.  All natural ingredients.  I am 60 and have experimented with lots of creams.  Fragrance free.  My skin loves it.</li>
