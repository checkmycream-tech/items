            <li>another  wonderful Crew product.</li>
            <li>This is the best product for mens hair, it leaves your hair with alot of hold, but with out the shine of using gel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scent reminds me of my grandfather&#x27;s shaving cream and the results are perfect.</li>

            <li>It is the perfect size for someone who travels quite a bit like I do.</li>

            <li>Great works good..</li>
            <li>Good price and great hold for my hair.  </li>
            <li>It even has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d get my hands damp and scrunch through my hair and was good to go.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be good as an alternative to gel</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>what product is good for what hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Get my hair fairly damp, work the Fiber in, and it would give me good hold...</li>
            <li>And the Fiber is fairly sticky...</li>
            <li>so your hair needs to be fairly damp to work it in, but then it doesn&#x27;t want to stay</li>
            <li>Has a good fragrance to it.</li>
            <li>The product smells nice and has a good thickness to it that works for me.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li>Now I would need some kind of mouse.</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell</li>
            <li>For me, that shinier look is nice if I&#x27;m going to a wedding, or dressing up...that sort of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look like you have a ton of product in your hair but holds the hair very strongly and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Great product for a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li>It was nice to be able to get him some for a descent price.</li>
            <li>or so I comb through the hair to give it a perfect look; it leaves no shine and it appears so as if I had that natural</li>
            <li>The hold is perfect for my hair and the low shine is nice.</li>
            <li>It cost more</li>
            <li>The more I put in the better</li>
            <li>I heard the industry is adding more oil for that slippery hair curtain look.</li>
            <li>I wished for a better product and now I will look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my teenage son and he is very happy using it.</li>
            <li>AND AS YOU CAN SEE, MOST PEOPLE LIKE IT.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite gel.</li>
            <li>like say a boy-cut, it would be better and more beneficial.</li>
            <li>I used it and the rest was magic.</li>
            <li>the product was perfect and I compared it to the salon purchased product and it was literally the same.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair product and this vendor delivered it on-time and  as described.</li>
            <li>Simply the perfect product for every man.</li>
            <li>being said, I found out that you can still achieve the shiny/plastic look with this product, if you&#x27;d like a more &amp;#34;stage&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li>Now the pomade has much more</li>
            <li>The price is more competitive than WalMart or Ulta</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re okay</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my son&#x27;s favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be fairly honest: I originally bought this product just for my bangs.</li>
            <li>Amazon is a decent price, but when costco has it in stock I try to buy a couple of them because they were a great deal.</li>
            <li>HEY MAN, THIS STUFF KEEPS MY HAIR PRETTY GOOD LOOKING.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great because I travel frequently</li>
            <li>The fiber is great for styling and if your trying to go for that natural matte look.</li>
            <li>This product smells great (if you&#x27;re a fan of beeswax like me that is), and leaves my hair feeling soft while also providing the hold I enjoy.</li>
            <li>Its easy to get my hair</li>
            <li>After putting a little paste in my hair it would curl and chunk out perfectly.</li>
            <li>I tried wetting with water to smooth it out, but it still leaves noticeable bits.  </li>
            <li>It goods on smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>SIMPLE FACT IS, IT IS GREAT STUFF.</li>
            <li>Would be great if American Crew would produce that.</li>
            <li>They smell great, and they are relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I purchased the 1.75 ounce jar to fit in my quart size bag for carry-on luggage at the airport.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using American crew for years and have been happy with all their products.</li>
            <li>This great &amp;#34;travel-size&amp;#34; container is smaller than the original size and it was purchased on behalf of my partner.</li>
            <li>For example, you can have your hair fairly damp with the stickier (ie high hold) products, and still be able to work it in really well.</li>
            <li>decided to leave the rest of my original review below.</li>
            <li>I had a lot more hair, and because it&#x27;s a \\&quot;higher hold,\\</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years already, best of its kind that I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>The Fiber is great, and works well with my longer hair (since it&#x27;s winter here in Chicago, I&#x27;m keeping it long).</li>
            <li>Fiber is an excellent matte (not shiny) styling product so that my natural hair color is the only thing people see.</li>
            <li>I have really unmanageable, puffy hair, and after trying so many products, this one is a keeper.</li>
            <li>American Crew Fiber has a nice masculine scent, molds &amp; texturizes hair nicely &amp; washes out easily.</li>
            <li>For not that much more money, I would try Gatsby Wild Shake or American Crews own dfi pliable molding cream for better control and holding power.</li>
            <li>I love the way the defining paste smells, matte looks nice, and it&#x27;s super easy to get that messy but controlled look.</li>
            <li>It is not sticky and washes quickly with water.</li>
            <li>It is the best thing I have found for his hair since it is prone to oiliness, the product doesn&#x27;t make it look shiny and dirty, but it has a nice hold.</li>
            <li>The product does not hold nearly as strong as Alterna concrete and the texture is too smooth and silky for my liking.</li>
            <li>Funny how the process changes over time!</li>
            <li>it is worth</li>
            <li>Experiment and have fun,</li>
            <li>Hopefully my experience will point you in the right direction.</li>
            <li>Liked it until I grew my hair long...</li>
            <li>I wanted a little more spike and \\&quot;verticalness\\&quot; to my hair, so what I had to do was start drying it more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used four different American Crew wax/pomades, and they are all great.</li>
            <li>Its not really the best to use since it makes your hair glossy, rough and smells quite a bit.</li>
            <li>I was leaving my hair fairly damp, and putting the pomade into that didn&#x27;t give it much hold at all (though depending the style you want...like a more traditional mad men kind of look without a lot of spike, then that would be fine).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Crew Fiber for many years now, but I came across the 1.75oz jar, which I&#x27;ve never seen in local retail stores.</li>
            <li>The next day my hair looked even better.</li>
            <li>It looked great after wearing a hat all day, whether my hair was short or long.</li>
            <li>First time user of this product.  </li>
            <li>Only four stars because I thought it would have a better smell.</li>
            <li>They are fleecing folks for $10+ per jar of 1.75oz when the 3oz costs $13+ (almost twice the amount for 33% higher cost).  </li>
            <li>I simply solve this issue by using a touch more of the Fiber than I would a wax.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t used to this at first.</li>
            <li>But before you give up on any one product, vary the dampness of your hair first.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t know how to use it.</li>
            <li>It &#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>If there is a positive, little shine and it smells good.</li>
            <li>This is a great size for traveling, and not so big that the product gets dry and rubbery.</li>
            <li>The best thing about this hair wax is it your hair still looks natural because of the low shine while being firmly hold in</li>
            <li>Small bottles, but good for travel.</li>
            <li>tried using it in damp hair and liked it a little better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trick with this wax is that you have to warm it up a little by rubbing it between your fingers before applying it, otherwise you run the risk of getting chunks.</li>
            <li>That stuff is REALLY sticky...which is fine for short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used all type of product and nothing really beats crew.  </li>
            <li>My bangs still stick up straight with this product as well.</li>
            <li>TOO MUCH EXPENSES</li>
            <li>You really have to rub it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really space-age.</li>
            <li>I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have much of a shine at all.</li>
            <li>The hold becomes even MORE pronounced, but it also becomes harder to work into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I got the hang of it, and now I&#x27;m really digging this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>long worked fine...</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very important decision you&#x27;re making in your life, don&#x27;t mess up.</li>
            <li>The only downside to getting a matte product is that it does not have quite as much hold as many of the waxes out there, but I felt it was worth it to not have that oily, dark look.</li>
            <li>just remember, less is more</li>
            <li>The smell is great and a small amount of the product goes a long way.</li>
            <li>and he feels the product gives greater quality since he can go through a smaller container faster than a larger one thereby reducing the chance that the product will be overly exposed to air or otherwise change.</li>
            <li>So i highly recommend</li>
            <li>For shorthair, use the high hold products with damp hair.</li>
            <li>I love American Crew&#x27;s Fiber, have used it for a year now, and will continue using it for as long as the product continues being made.</li>
            <li>Now, I blow dry my hair bone dry, and then use the defining paste (matte, and holds good with just a tiny spritz of hairspray).</li>
            <li>About a year ago I bought a new puck.</li>
            <li>They said \\&quot;no\\&quot; and apologized and sent me new puck in the mail.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Forming Cream for the longest time, but now wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>Leaves a very natural looking finish</li>
            <li>but I personally think the Defining Paste is awesome for matte, and forming cream if you want a little bit of shine (but it&#x27;s harder to work into your bone dry hair, and doesn&#x27;t smell as good).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very light colored hair and most of the other hair products out there leave my hair looking too oily, wet, or dark.</li>
            <li>I started trying their Fiber product on that short hair, and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>Not to shiny with a natural feel on his hair.</li>
            <li>so I ended up having to mix it with some of my old stuff.</li>
            <li>Those are my business instincts talking, but admittedly complete speculation.  </li>
            <li>I also have some left over forming cream, and it works really well too, just gives the hair a shinier look.</li>
            <li>blow dry the hair in the front up, blow dry the rest totally dry, put some defining paste in my palm, rub my hands together vigorously and warm it up, and then work it into my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You will probably have to try a couple different products until you find the one you really like.</li>
            <li>I been using this product for nearly a decade now from the advice of a friend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before I move onto the Pomade, the other thing to consider is...varying the dampness of your hair prior to the product will have a HUGE effect on how it works.</li>
            <li>personally feel that the seller is pricing these higher to intentionally and accidentally get orders for people making the same mistake that I made.  </li>
            <li>my hair really short, I was using their \\&quot;classic wax,\\&quot; which they no longer make.</li>
            <li>High hold, low shine.</li>
            <li>For longer hair, use the low hold products with drier hair.hair, use the high hold products with damp hair.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend American crew products.</li>
            <li>&quot; my hair in the direction I want, and to get it much drier (not 100% dry, but maybe 75%).</li>
            <li>I have to agree with the other positive reviewers.  </li>
            <li>Generally good.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Japanese brand wax and this one can both keep your hair styled whole day long, but that one is cheaper and won&#x27;t make your hand sweat</li>
            <li>I have tried different waxes, gel and i finalyy found the product that controls my sstyle and looks natural like i am not using anyth</li>
            <li>Granted that was my own doing because I failed to appreciate the 1.75 ounce detail on the product labeling.</li>
            <li>I have thick wavy hair, and it&#x27;s been hard for me to find some good hair product.</li>
            <li>First off, I was surprised how small the product was.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and this is the only product really strong enough to hold everything in place.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It keeps my hair mostly in place using only a small amount (about less than a dime), and leaves no shine whatsoever, so my hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy.</li>
            <li>Also, a little goes a long way, so while it is a little more pricey than some of its alternatives</li>
            <li>I have slightly wavy hair, not stick straight or curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Non-greasy non-shiny natural look and long lasting.</li>
            <li>After using Alterna stlying products for years, I had to change due to their discontinuing of their styling concrete.</li>
            <li>No matter how good the hair product is, I am not going to use it if it smells bad.</li>

            <li> Would be great if American Crew would produce that.</li>
            <li> They smell great, and they are relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 1.75 ounce jar to fit in my quart size bag for carry-on luggage at the airport.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using American crew for years and have been happy with all their products.</li>
            <li> This great &amp;#34;travel-size&amp;#34; container is smaller than the original size and it was purchased on behalf of my partner.</li>
            <li> For example, you can have your hair fairly damp with the stickier (ie high hold) products, and still be able to work it in really well.</li>
            <li> decided to leave the rest of my original review below.</li>
            <li> I had a lot more hair, and because it&#x27;s a \\&quot;higher hold,\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years already, best of its kind that I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> The Fiber is great, and works well with my longer hair (since it&#x27;s winter here in Chicago, I&#x27;m keeping it long).</li>
            <li> Fiber is an excellent matte (not shiny) styling product so that my natural hair color is the only thing people see.</li>
            <li> I have really unmanageable, puffy hair, and after trying so many products, this one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> American Crew Fiber has a nice masculine scent, molds &amp; texturizes hair nicely &amp; washes out easily.</li>
            <li> For not that much more money, I would try Gatsby Wild Shake or American Crews own dfi pliable molding cream for better control and holding power.</li>
            <li> I love the way the defining paste smells, matte looks nice, and it&#x27;s super easy to get that messy but controlled look.</li>
            <li> It is not sticky and washes quickly with water.</li>
            <li> It is the best thing I have found for his hair since it is prone to oiliness, the product doesn&#x27;t make it look shiny and dirty, but it has a nice hold.</li>
            <li> The product does not hold nearly as strong as Alterna concrete and the texture is too smooth and silky for my liking.</li>
            <li> Funny how the process changes over time!</li>
            <li> it is worth</li>
            <li> Experiment and have fun,</li>
            <li> Hopefully my experience will point you in the right direction.</li>
            <li> Liked it until I grew my hair long...</li>
            <li> I wanted a little more spike and \\&quot;verticalness\\&quot; to my hair, so what I had to do was start drying it more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used four different American Crew wax/pomades, and they are all great.</li>
            <li> Its not really the best to use since it makes your hair glossy, rough and smells quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I was leaving my hair fairly damp, and putting the pomade into that didn&#x27;t give it much hold at all (though depending the style you want...like a more traditional mad men kind of look without a lot of spike, then that would be fine).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Crew Fiber for many years now, but I came across the 1.75oz jar, which I&#x27;ve never seen in local retail stores.</li>
            <li> The next day my hair looked even better.</li>
            <li> It looked great after wearing a hat all day, whether my hair was short or long.</li>
            <li> First time user of this product.  </li>
            <li> Only four stars because I thought it would have a better smell.</li>
            <li> They are fleecing folks for $10+ per jar of 1.75oz when the 3oz costs $13+ (almost twice the amount for 33% higher cost).  </li>
            <li> I simply solve this issue by using a touch more of the Fiber than I would a wax.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t used to this at first.</li>
            <li> But before you give up on any one product, vary the dampness of your hair first.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know how to use it.</li>
            <li> It &#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> If there is a positive, little shine and it smells good.</li>
            <li> This is a great size for traveling, and not so big that the product gets dry and rubbery.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this hair wax is it your hair still looks natural because of the low shine while being firmly hold in</li>
            <li> Small bottles, but good for travel.</li>
            <li> tried using it in damp hair and liked it a little better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trick with this wax is that you have to warm it up a little by rubbing it between your fingers before applying it, otherwise you run the risk of getting chunks.</li>
            <li> That stuff is REALLY sticky...which is fine for short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used all type of product and nothing really beats crew.  </li>
            <li> My bangs still stick up straight with this product as well.</li>
            <li> TOO MUCH EXPENSES</li>
            <li> You really have to rub it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really space-age.</li>
            <li> I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have much of a shine at all.</li>
            <li> The hold becomes even MORE pronounced, but it also becomes harder to work into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I got the hang of it, and now I&#x27;m really digging this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> long worked fine...</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very important decision you&#x27;re making in your life, don&#x27;t mess up.</li>
            <li> The only downside to getting a matte product is that it does not have quite as much hold as many of the waxes out there, but I felt it was worth it to not have that oily, dark look.</li>
            <li> just remember, less is more</li>
            <li> The smell is great and a small amount of the product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and he feels the product gives greater quality since he can go through a smaller container faster than a larger one thereby reducing the chance that the product will be overly exposed to air or otherwise change.</li>
            <li> So i highly recommend</li>
            <li> For shorthair, use the high hold products with damp hair.</li>
            <li> I love American Crew&#x27;s Fiber, have used it for a year now, and will continue using it for as long as the product continues being made.</li>
            <li> Now, I blow dry my hair bone dry, and then use the defining paste (matte, and holds good with just a tiny spritz of hairspray).</li>
            <li> About a year ago I bought a new puck.</li>
            <li> They said \\&quot;no\\&quot; and apologized and sent me new puck in the mail.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Forming Cream for the longest time, but now wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> Leaves a very natural looking finish</li>
            <li> but I personally think the Defining Paste is awesome for matte, and forming cream if you want a little bit of shine (but it&#x27;s harder to work into your bone dry hair, and doesn&#x27;t smell as good).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very light colored hair and most of the other hair products out there leave my hair looking too oily, wet, or dark.</li>
            <li> I started trying their Fiber product on that short hair, and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> Not to shiny with a natural feel on his hair.</li>
            <li> so I ended up having to mix it with some of my old stuff.</li>
            <li> Those are my business instincts talking, but admittedly complete speculation.  </li>
            <li> I also have some left over forming cream, and it works really well too, just gives the hair a shinier look.</li>
            <li> blow dry the hair in the front up, blow dry the rest totally dry, put some defining paste in my palm, rub my hands together vigorously and warm it up, and then work it into my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will probably have to try a couple different products until you find the one you really like.</li>
            <li> I been using this product for nearly a decade now from the advice of a friend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I move onto the Pomade, the other thing to consider is...varying the dampness of your hair prior to the product will have a HUGE effect on how it works.</li>
            <li> personally feel that the seller is pricing these higher to intentionally and accidentally get orders for people making the same mistake that I made.  </li>
            <li> my hair really short, I was using their \\&quot;classic wax,\\&quot; which they no longer make.</li>
            <li> High hold, low shine.</li>
            <li> For longer hair, use the low hold products with drier hair.hair, use the high hold products with damp hair.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend American crew products.</li>
            <li> &quot; my hair in the direction I want, and to get it much drier (not 100% dry, but maybe 75%).</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the other positive reviewers.  </li>
            <li> Generally good.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Japanese brand wax and this one can both keep your hair styled whole day long, but that one is cheaper and won&#x27;t make your hand sweat</li>
            <li> I have tried different waxes, gel and i finalyy found the product that controls my sstyle and looks natural like i am not using anyth</li>
            <li> Granted that was my own doing because I failed to appreciate the 1.75 ounce detail on the product labeling.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair, and it&#x27;s been hard for me to find some good hair product.</li>
            <li> First off, I was surprised how small the product was.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this is the only product really strong enough to hold everything in place.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It keeps my hair mostly in place using only a small amount (about less than a dime), and leaves no shine whatsoever, so my hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy.</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way, so while it is a little more pricey than some of its alternatives</li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy hair, not stick straight or curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Non-greasy non-shiny natural look and long lasting.</li>
            <li> After using Alterna stlying products for years, I had to change due to their discontinuing of their styling concrete.</li>
            <li> No matter how good the hair product is, I am not going to use it if it smells bad.</li>
            <li> I recommend the smaller size, the larger one seems to get dry before you finish and the product is not the same consistency when you try to re-hydrate it.</li>
            <li> Also, just a dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Hope AC make this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I went out on a limb and tried something new when I couldn&#x27;t shake the nagging feeling that my previous product left a little something to be desired.</li>
            <li> Just apply larger amount of it while the hair is very wet.</li>
            <li> used this product on my dry hair and did not like it at all.</li>
            <li> and I have not regretted it a single time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now the I use American Crew fiber I get all day hold without the crusty or wet look that I used to get with other products.</li>
            <li> I have found it to be only average in its ability to hold.</li>
            <li> &quot; it actually started to weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> its really dry when u put it in your hair, and if your hair is too wet</li>
            <li> and this takes up much less space, especially if I&#x27;m just taking carry on and need to get it through security.</li>
            <li> I tried this several times, applying it to slightly damp hair, and damp hair, and wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> you get stuck with a somewhat crusty wet look.</li>
            <li> other product I&#x27;ve been using is the Forming Cream.</li>
            <li> I used to use Got2B Glued for the longest time, but in recent years I&#x27;ve let my hair grow longer than usual, and that product doesn&#x27;t do well with longer</li>
            <li> ; I just wanted to see how AC&#x27;s other stuff worked.</li>
            <li> The contents were creamy, it felt like a thick body lotion, I returned it for another puck, same thing.</li>
            <li> but you use less of it</li>
            <li> What I use now is Murray&#x27;s black bees wax.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for his birthday, I ordered it online since the only ones i could find in the store were RIDICULOUSLY priced.</li>
            <li> the Fiber began to work less well.</li>
            <li> but a little less shiny.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding a product that can tame my hair as it just won&#x27;t stay in shape for long.</li>
            <li> little spike in the front.</li>
            <li> A little bit overpriced though.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product for a few years now</li>
            <li> Use everyday.</li>
            <li> I use this to give it a little style and to tame fly-aways.</li>
            <li> I mean I would still use it, but it didn&#x27;t come out as expected.</li>
            <li> Impossible to find this size at the store, so this was very convenient!</li>
            <li> The biggest issue I have with it is that it doesn&#x27;t hold my dark thick hair well at all.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and slightly curly.</li>
            <li> I got the small jar of this product because I didn&#x27;t want to commit to something I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Just be cautious and use a small amount.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s patriotic name achieves a scale of masculinity unapproachable by any ordinary hair &amp;#34;product&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Holds hair (style) in place without being greasy or tacky or hard and flaky.</li>
            <li> The hard part is figuring out...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can&#x27;t be happier and have been recommending it to my friends (at least the ones that have hair...)</li>
            <li> I have thick hair.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair thick, chunky with no greasy or oily feel.</li>
            <li> I have a thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> Slow shopping but</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell like a lot of other ones</li>
            <li> you put the product on your hand, your hand is very likely to sweat in one minute, which is bad for styling your hair.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> Guys with thin hair the &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; gives the appearance hair is thicker.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like, so hard and bad smell</li>
            <li> Fake product??</li>
            <li> I ordered this item on a blind buy based on the reviews of others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always seen them at the barber, but never tried them because I thought they were too expensive and</li>
            <li> However, it smells soooo bad.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my bad and hence why a 2-star review and not a 1.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I saw what was inside because of the texture.</li>
            <li> but the hold is horrible -</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I went out on a limb and tried something new when I couldn&#x27;t shake the nagging feeling that my previous product left a little something to be desired. Now the I use American Crew fiber I get all day hold without the crusty or wet look that I used to get with other products. Also, a little goes a long way, so while it is a little more pricey than some of its alternatives it is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t be happier and have been recommending it to my friends (at least the ones that have hair...)</li>
            <li> This product smells great (if you&#x27;re a fan of beeswax like me that is), and leaves my hair feeling soft while also providing the hold I enjoy. I have purchased this product for a few years now and I have not regretted it a single time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very important decision you&#x27;re making in your life, don&#x27;t mess up.</li>
            <li> I have used all type of product and nothing really beats crew.  It cost more but you use less of it and it doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell like a lot of other ones do.  Amazon is a decent price, but when costco has it in stock I try to buy a couple of them because they were a great deal.</li>
            <li> ive always been a fan of america crew products but this stuff is just alright. its really dry when u put it in your hair, and if your hair is too wet you get stuck with a somewhat crusty wet look. i would suggest trying something else. i tried to use it to style a side part comb over.</li>
            <li> I tried this several times, applying it to slightly damp hair, and damp hair, and wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;It always left my hair looking frizzy.  I have thick hair.  What I use now is Murray&#x27;s black bees wax.  It&#x27;s about 10 times cheaper, and I look like Tom Cruise.</li>
            <li> very good. Will buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Crew Fiber for many years now, but I came across the 1.75oz jar, which I&#x27;ve never seen in local retail stores. It&#x27;s great because I travel frequently and this takes up much less space, especially if I&#x27;m just taking carry on and need to get it through security.</li>
            <li> I used this product for years. It made my hair thick, chunky with no greasy or oily feel. The next day my hair looked even better. I&#x27;d get my hands damp and scrunch through my hair and was good to go. It looked great after wearing a hat all day, whether my hair was short or long. My hair is naturally straight and limp with no body. After putting a little paste in my hair it would curl and chunk out perfectly. Wind, rain, sun didn&#x27;t change the texture. The more I put in the better it looked. About a year ago I bought a new puck. The contents were creamy, it felt like a thick body lotion, I returned it for another puck, same thing. I asked American Crew if they changed the formula. They said \\&quot;no\\&quot; and apologized and sent me new puck in the mail. Same thing, creamy/lotiony feel with no stick. Unfortunetly I gave it up! Anybody know what happened to the product?? I heard the industry is adding more oil for that slippery hair curtain look. It&#x27;s not a look I want. There are plenty of products that make your hair do that. American Crew -- why did you change your formula and then lie about it????</li>
            <li> First time user of this product.  I don&#x27;t like it because it leases white unused bits/chunks in hair.  I tried wetting with water to smooth it out, but it still leaves noticeable bits.  I wished for a better product and now I will look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage son and he is very happy using it. It goods on smooth and silky. Not to shiny with a natural feel on his hair.</li>
            <li> First off, I was surprised how small the product was. Granted that was my own doing because I failed to appreciate the 1.75 ounce detail on the product labeling. The biggest issue I have with it is that it doesn&#x27;t hold my dark thick hair well at all. If I put it in, I can notice almost immediately that its not going to give me what I need so I ended up having to mix it with some of my old stuff.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS STUFF FOR OVER 10 YEARS NOW. AND AS YOU CAN SEE, MOST PEOPLE LIKE IT. SIMPLE FACT IS, IT IS GREAT STUFF. BUT NOTHING IS FOR EVERYONE. I BUY 4 AT A TIME SO I AM NEVER WITHOUT. LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> Small bottles, but good for travel. My BF loves this stuff to spike his hair with. It was nice to be able to get him some for a descent price.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite gel. It is not sticky and washes quickly with water.</li>
            <li> I have a thick hair so my recommendation is before you apply the product make your hair &amp;#34;half dry/half wet&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the other positive reviewers.  The product smells nice and has a good thickness to it that works for me.</li>
            <li> I got the small jar of this product because I didn&#x27;t want to commit to something I didn&#x27;t like. The smell is great and a small amount of the product goes a long way. I have been using it daily for three weeks and still have about 3/4 of the jar remaining. The hold is perfect for my hair and the low shine is nice.</li>
            <li> Fake product?? Consistency way different than store bought product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be fairly honest: I originally bought this product just for my bangs. I have unruly bangs and I wanted something simple that make it stay and hold all day.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product on my dry hair and did not like it at all. My hair felt sticky and I couldn&#x27;t move my fingers through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I tried using it in damp hair and liked it a little better.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if I had short hair. like say a boy-cut, it would be better and more beneficial. However, for just my bangs, I would not recommend it. My bangs still stick up straight with this product as well. I mean I would still use it, but it didn&#x27;t come out as expected.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be good as an alternative to gel but the hold is horrible - I have thick hair. By the end of the day it looks like I have no product in my hair and I have fly aways within minutes after applying it.</li>
            <li> Never tried this stuff before and my intent was to find something like the regular American Crew pomade. I had never heard of the fiber either so I gave it a try. I was disappointed when I saw what was inside because of the texture. I used it and the rest was magic.</li>
            <li> HEY MAN, THIS STUFF KEEPS MY HAIR PRETTY GOOD LOOKING. I PUT IT ON ONE DAY AND THEN GO TO SLEEP AND I DON&#x27;T DO ANYTHING TO IT FOR DAYZ AND IT STILL BE LOOKING GREAT. TOO MUCH EXPENSES THOUGH YA FEEL ME</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like, so hard and bad smell</li>
            <li> Nothing else works this well for styling my hair. Just be cautious and use a small amount.</li>
            <li> Liked it until I grew my hair long... Now I would need some kind of mouse. Would be great if American Crew would produce that.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great. Matte finish and lasts for about 4-5 hours. However, it smells soooo bad. No matter how good the hair product is, I am not going to use it if it smells bad. I bought a 1.7 oz box and I threw it out after a week.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for his birthday, I ordered it online since the only ones i could find in the store were RIDICULOUSLY priced. It is the best thing I have found for his hair since it is prone to oiliness, the product doesn&#x27;t make it look shiny and dirty, but it has a nice hold.</li>
            <li> I know some people swear by this product. I have found it to be only average in its ability to hold. For not that much more money, I would try Gatsby Wild Shake or American Crews own dfi pliable molding cream for better control and holding power.</li>
            <li> Slow shopping but the product was perfect and I compared it to the salon purchased product and it was literally the same. So i highly recommend</li>
            <li> After using Alterna stlying products for years, I had to change due to their discontinuing of their styling concrete. I ordered this item on a blind buy based on the reviews of others. The product does not hold nearly as strong as Alterna concrete and the texture is too smooth and silky for my liking. If there is a positive, little shine and it smells good. Simply not what I was hoping for for my shorter hair.</li>
            <li> Great ! another  wonderful Crew product.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for mens hair, it leaves your hair with alot of hold, but with out the shine of using gel. Leaves a very natural looking finish</li>
            <li> Works well. You really have to rub it. Only four stars because I thought it would have a better smell.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of purchasing these, thinking they were of the 3oz variety.  The product IS as advertised, but I thought I was purchasing the 3oz jar for a cheaper price.  That&#x27;s my bad and hence why a 2-star review and not a 1.  They are fleecing folks for $10+ per jar of 1.75oz when the 3oz costs $13+ (almost twice the amount for 33% higher cost).  This rating is also to reflect the cost/value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally feel that the seller is pricing these higher to intentionally and accidentally get orders for people making the same mistake that I made.  Those are my business instincts talking, but admittedly complete speculation.  Let my loss be your lesson.  Don&#x27;t buy these and get the 3oz jar.</li>
            <li> I have really unmanageable, puffy hair, and after trying so many products, this one is a keeper. Also, just a dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years now. I have short, course and wavy hair. I use this to give it a little style and to tame fly-aways. It&#x27;s like a mixture between crisco and the glue in a glue stick. You just want to run it through your hair, don&#x27;t massage it in. And don&#x27;t use a lot, or your hair will just turn greasy. It&#x27;s really space-age.</li>
            <li> Works well. Its easy to get my hair how I want it with this product. It even has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I have tried different waxes, gel and i finalyy found the product that controls my sstyle and looks natural like i am not using anyth</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Holds hair (style) in place without being greasy or tacky or hard and flaky. Has a nice smell and I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product and this vendor delivered it on-time and  as described. This is a great size for traveling, and not so big that the product gets dry and rubbery.</li>
            <li> Generally good.&lt;br /&gt;When you put the product on your hand, your hand is very likely to sweat in one minute, which is bad for styling your hair.&lt;br /&gt;A Japanese brand wax and this one can both keep your hair styled whole day long, but that one is cheaper and won&#x27;t make your hand sweat</li>
            <li> Simply the perfect product for every man. It&#x27;s patriotic name achieves a scale of masculinity unapproachable by any ordinary hair &amp;#34;product&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s scent reminds me of my grandfather&#x27;s shaving cream and the results are perfect. just remember, less is more and you don&#x27;t have to use it on every part of your hair, just the parts that you want to control. I recommend the smaller size, the larger one seems to get dry before you finish and the product is not the same consistency when you try to re-hydrate it. The trick with this wax is that you have to warm it up a little by rubbing it between your fingers before applying it, otherwise you run the risk of getting chunks.</li>
            <li> I have very light colored hair and most of the other hair products out there leave my hair looking too oily, wet, or dark. Fiber is an excellent matte (not shiny) styling product so that my natural hair color is the only thing people see. The only downside to getting a matte product is that it does not have quite as much hold as many of the waxes out there, but I felt it was worth it to not have that oily, dark look. I simply solve this issue by using a touch more of the Fiber than I would a wax. I love American Crew&#x27;s Fiber, have used it for a year now, and will continue using it for as long as the product continues being made.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and slightly curly. I had a hard time finding a product that can tame my hair as it just won&#x27;t stay in shape for long. I tried hair gels and sprays but they make your hair look plastic. The best thing about this hair wax is it your hair still looks natural because of the low shine while being firmly hold in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I found out that you can still achieve the shiny/plastic look with this product, if you&#x27;d like a more &amp;#34;stage&amp;#34; look. Just apply larger amount of it while the hair is very wet.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described. High hold, low shine. Doesn&#x27;t look like you have a ton of product in your hair but holds the hair very strongly and lasts all day. Will be purchasing a bigger jar soon.</li>
            <li> Best hair product for what I need. I have thick hair and this is the only product really strong enough to hold everything in place. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have much of a shine at all.</li>
            <li> Update: Since I wrote this, I&#x27;ve changed how I do things. Now, I blow dry my hair bone dry, and then use the defining paste (matte, and holds good with just a tiny spritz of hairspray). I also have some left over forming cream, and it works really well too, just gives the hair a shinier look. For me, that shinier look is nice if I&#x27;m going to a wedding, or dressing up...that sort of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I blow dry the hair in the front up, blow dry the rest totally dry, put some defining paste in my palm, rub my hands together vigorously and warm it up, and then work it into my hair. I love the way the defining paste smells, matte looks nice, and it&#x27;s super easy to get that messy but controlled look. I have slightly wavy hair, not stick straight or curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to leave the rest of my original review below. Funny how the process changes over time! Experiment and have fun, but I personally think the Defining Paste is awesome for matte, and forming cream if you want a little bit of shine (but it&#x27;s harder to work into your bone dry hair, and doesn&#x27;t smell as good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;********************************************&lt;br /&gt;Original Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Copy and pasted from my Pomade review...hope it helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*********&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used four different American Crew wax/pomades, and they are all great. They smell great, and they are relatively inexpensive. The hard part is figuring out...what product is good for what hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone from very short guy hair, to longer guy hair...and as I&#x27;ve done that, the American Crew product that I prefer has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my hair really short, I was using their \\&quot;classic wax,\\&quot; which they no longer make. I started trying their Fiber product on that short hair, and it worked pretty well. Get my hair fairly damp, work the Fiber in, and it would give me good hold...little spike in the front. Another product I was using with my short hair was TIGI Bed Head Men Matte Separation Wax. That stuff is REALLY sticky...which is fine for short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I move onto the Pomade, the other thing to consider is...varying the dampness of your hair prior to the product will have a HUGE effect on how it works. For example, you can have your hair fairly damp with the stickier (ie high hold) products, and still be able to work it in really well. As your hair gets drier though, two things happen. The hold becomes even MORE pronounced, but it also becomes harder to work into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as I grew my hair out...the Fiber began to work less well. I had a lot more hair, and because it&#x27;s a \\&quot;higher hold,\\&quot; it actually started to weigh my hair down. Spiking up hair that&#x27;s only an inch or two long worked fine...but as my hair got to 3+ inches, it would start to fall over. And the Fiber is fairly sticky...so your hair needs to be fairly damp to work it in, but then it doesn&#x27;t want to stay up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to move to a \\&quot;lower hold\\&quot; product (the Pomade)...and I wasn&#x27;t used to this at first. I was leaving my hair fairly damp, and putting the pomade into that didn&#x27;t give it much hold at all (though depending the style you want...like a more traditional mad men kind of look without a lot of spike, then that would be fine). I wanted a little more spike and \\&quot;verticalness\\&quot; to my hair, so what I had to do was start drying it more. I&#x27;ve started using a blow dryer to \\&quot;train\\&quot; my hair in the direction I want, and to get it much drier (not 100% dry, but maybe 75%). Now the pomade has much more hold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other product I&#x27;ve been using is the Forming Cream. It&#x27;s similar to the pomade...but a little less shiny. It has worked well in my longer hair, and like I said before...to get any hold, I need my hair drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will probably have to try a couple different products until you find the one you really like. But before you give up on any one product, vary the dampness of your hair first. Hopefully my experience will point you in the right direction. For shorthair, use the high hold products with damp hair. For longer hair, use the low hold products with drier hair.hair, use the high hold products with damp hair. For longer hair, use the low hold products with drier hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Fiber for years and it is my go-to hair product, so I purchased the 1.75 ounce jar to fit in my quart size bag for carry-on luggage at the airport. It is the perfect size for someone who travels quite a bit like I do. Impossible to find this size at the store, so this was very convenient!</li>
            <li> Its not really the best to use since it makes your hair glossy, rough and smells quite a bit. I&#x27;d say 3.5 out of 5.</li>
            <li> This great &amp;#34;travel-size&amp;#34; container is smaller than the original size and it was purchased on behalf of my partner. The price is more competitive than WalMart or Ulta and he feels the product gives greater quality since he can go through a smaller container faster than a larger one thereby reducing the chance that the product will be overly exposed to air or otherwise change. Plus, it&#x27;s a smaller size that&#x27;s a lot easier for traveling as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using American crew for years and have been happy with all their products. The fiber is great for styling and if your trying to go for that natural matte look. i highly recommend American crew products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years already, best of its kind that I&#x27;ve tried so far. A little bit overpriced though.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair, and it&#x27;s been hard for me to find some good hair product. I used to use Got2B Glued for the longest time, but in recent years I&#x27;ve let my hair grow longer than usual, and that product doesn&#x27;t do well with longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing some research, I finally purchased American Crew&#x27;s products. I&#x27;ve always seen them at the barber, but never tried them because I thought they were too expensive and just another brand barbers tried to push for sales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Forming Cream for the longest time, but now wanted to try something new. I like Forming Cream a lot, actually; I just wanted to see how AC&#x27;s other stuff worked. The Fiber is great, and works well with my longer hair (since it&#x27;s winter here in Chicago, I&#x27;m keeping it long). At first I didn&#x27;t know how to use it. It \\&quot;broke\\&quot; and crumbled when I tried handling it, but after reading another reviewer&#x27;s suggestions, as well as the instructions (who knew?!), I got the hang of it, and now I&#x27;m really digging this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my hair mostly in place using only a small amount (about less than a dime), and leaves no shine whatsoever, so my hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy.</li>
            <li> Great works good.. A+ A+ A+ A A A a aa a a a a a aa aaaa  aaa  a</li>
            <li> Bought this product cause it was cheaper than at the barber&#x27;s.  Good price and great hold for my hair.  Recommend</li>
            <li> It &#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. Keep my curly short hair molded. Not an oily product!. Excellent. I wold buy it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent hold. Matte finish. Great texture. I apply while moist and in 10 minutes or so I comb through the hair to give it a perfect look; it leaves no shine and it appears so as if I had that natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend. Great product for a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I been using this product for nearly a decade now from the advice of a friend. Guys with thin hair the &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; gives the appearance hair is thicker. Non-greasy non-shiny natural look and long lasting. Use everyday. Wish it was cheaper tho. Have tried the knock-offs and they&#x27;re okay but nothing like this product. Hope AC make this for a long time. Has a good fragrance to it. Best price I found was on Amazon.</li>
            <li> American Crew Fiber has a nice masculine scent, molds &amp; texturizes hair nicely &amp; washes out easily. It&#x27;s my son&#x27;s favorite hair product.</li>
