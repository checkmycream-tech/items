            <li>oh and the smell is pleasant too.</li>
            <li>I think I would&#x27;ve loved it</li>
            <li>etude house lip tints are my favorite!</li>
            <li>Amazing korean product.</li>
            <li>I just put some lip balm on top to seal it in.</li>
            <li>Was hoping to kinda see a peachy orange color and its more like a lip gloss than a tint</li>
            <li>I love this lip tint.</li>
            <li>Really cute color,,, smells amaaazing.</li>
            <li>also got some free samples with my order!</li>
            <li>and I love them ALL.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I realy really love them.</li>
            <li>First of all this smells so good</li>
            <li>The color is a beautiful soft orange.</li>
            <li>Its creamy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>but the scent isn&#x27;t strong at all and the color is a milky peach</li>
            <li>The color shows up but lightly.</li>
            <li>wore the tint and honestly you can&#x27;t really see a color.</li>
            <li>but it adds a softer peachy look on top of other stains that may be to bright</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad either.</li>
            <li>Really pretty color with moisturizing effect!</li>
            <li>Its kind sheer</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I bought all four of the Étude house fresh lip tint but the consistency was unwearable.</li>
            <li>I thought this would give a more peachy color appearance to the lips, but it looks light pink on mine.</li>
            <li>It has a bitter taste but it stays on amazing.</li>
            <li>It looks super natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite liquidy but it stains your lips very well.</li>
            <li>Not very moisturising, but if I use a lip balm on top, it rubs off even after I let it set.</li>
            <li>prefer the light pink one, but the two other are really nice too.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>This is by far my favourite tint of the whole &amp;#34;Etude House Cherry Tint&amp;#34; line.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just light pink.</li>
            <li>As someone who licks their lips a lot out of habit this tint has a pretty gross taste ^^;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really natural and adds a lot of life.</li>
            <li>it looks so natural on my lips</li>
            <li>is pretty decent (it a bit matched my plain old lips)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last long, but it doesn&#x27;t take much to reapply</li>
            <li>Really warms up my pale complexion, very natural and gives a bit of sheen.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a bit drying later on but the color lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have a dark yellow skin</li>
            <li> if you have dark lips you should go for the brighter red colors they offer.</li>
            <li> After it dries its impossible to take off. :)</li>

            <li> the title says it all - received an empty liptint box...</li>
            <li> longer than my other lip products</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this products for those of you who have dark skin tone.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with the amount I pay compared to $30+ for the really moisturizing lip tints from YSL.</li>

            <li> I wear it everyday.</li>

            <li> it felt drying and had a weird taste on the lips.</li>

            <li> The color shows up but lightly. As someone who licks their lips a lot out of habit this tint has a pretty gross taste ^^;</li>
            <li> First of all this smells so good but the scent isn&#x27;t strong at all and the color is a milky peach it&#x27;s beautiful</li>
            <li> This is by far my favourite tint of the whole &amp;#34;Etude House Cherry Tint&amp;#34; line. It looks super natural. It is not orange, but rather a peachy pink. I wear it everyday. It does a great job holding up and is not drying. I just put some lip balm on top to seal it in. Did I mention the smell is just to die for?!</li>
            <li> wore the tint and honestly you can&#x27;t really see a color. Was hoping to kinda see a peachy orange color and its more like a lip gloss than a tint</li>
            <li> I have a dark yellow skin so I like to wear orangish coral lip products. I was expecting this lip tint to be a bit orange but it&#x27;s just light pink. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this products for those of you who have dark skin tone.</li>
            <li> I love this lip tint. Its creamy and easy to apply. The color is a bit lighter than I anticipated, so if you have dark lips you should go for the brighter red colors they offer.</li>
            <li> Really pretty color with moisturizing effect!</li>
            <li> etude house lip tints are my favorite! doesn&#x27;t dry my lips like the other tints.</li>
            <li> Very very friendly customer service!! 10/10</li>
            <li> the title says it all - received an empty liptint box... oh well, i guess that happens once in a while</li>
            <li> Its kind sheer but it adds a softer peachy look on top of other stains that may be to bright</li>
            <li> Really cute color,,, smells amaaazing. And I thank the seller for the samples.</li>
            <li> The color is a beautiful soft orange. It&#x27;s quite liquidy but it stains your lips very well. Color pay off is pretty decent (it a bit matched my plain old lips) and it tints your lip for about 4 hours including eating and drinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got some free samples with my order! Amazing korean product. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought the #PK001 #PK002 and #OR201 and I love them ALL.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the light pink one, but the two other are really nice too.&lt;br /&gt;For the coverage, you can do as you want. Subtle or not, you decide!&lt;br /&gt;And the sensation is like wearing nothing on the lips. I realy really love them.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! This lasts for hours. It has a bitter taste but it stays on amazing. After it dries its impossible to take off. :)</li>
            <li> It adds a beautiful color tint. It&#x27;s not as orange as I like but it&#x27;s not bad either. It&#x27;s really natural and adds a lot of life. It&#x27;s a bit drying later on but the color lasts a very long time. For the price, it&#x27;s definitely 5 stars. Can&#x27;t go wrong with the amount I pay compared to $30+ for the really moisturizing lip tints from YSL.</li>
            <li> I bought all four of the Étude house fresh lip tint but the consistency was unwearable. it felt drying and had a weird taste on the lips.</li>
            <li> I thought this would give a more peachy color appearance to the lips, but it looks light pink on mine. Nonetheless, I like how it looks on me, and application is dummy proof. It doesn&#x27;t last long, but it doesn&#x27;t take much to reapply</li>
            <li> Really warms up my pale complexion, very natural and gives a bit of sheen. Not very moisturising, but if I use a lip balm on top, it rubs off even after I let it set. But still a very good product, oh and the smell is pleasant too.</li>
            <li> i like that it looks so natural on my lips&lt;br /&gt;stays longer than my other lip products</li>
            <li> this was a huge disappointment.  It took forever to receive because of customs, ( which made it pricey for the small size) and then it arrived.  I was so let down that it is neither cherry colored or even peachy colored.  I thought the color of the bottle was reflective of the color it would be.  But it is sticky, gloopy gloss with literally zero color pay off.  It tastes like childrens cough syrup and leaves my mouth feeling like I have food that needs to be wiped off.  Yuck!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I think I would&#x27;ve loved it</li>
