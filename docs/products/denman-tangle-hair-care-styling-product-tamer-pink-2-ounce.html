            <li>the best&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you can&#x27;t believe how happy I was to get this</li>
            <li>I ordered from Amazon based on reviews; however, I would have been just as happy to get a brush at Wal-Mart or Target.</li>
            <li>We love it!!</li>
            <li>Love this brush, it&#x27;s perfect for my waist length hair!</li>
            <li>She is happily brushing her own hair now every day, and it looks beautiful.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve combined this with a good conditioner at bath time.)</li>
            <li>I bought it for my daughter after reading a lot of good review about it.</li>
            <li>We own 3 of these brushes now as they are so good.</li>
            <li>It has become my favorite brushes ever!</li>
            <li>I already bought three more!</li>
            <li>Great scalp brush for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This brush is amazing.</li>
            <li>This amazing brush does not pull the hair</li>
            <li>I also own a Denman and now will not purchase anything else.  </li>
            <li>Looks nice</li>
            <li>This brush helps get all of the good oils from the top of the hair to the bottom and</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this brush unless you don&#x27;t already own one.</li>
            <li>As a result, the Tamer kind of massages the knots in our daughter&#x27;s hair rather than catching on them.  </li>
            <li>This brush does help with the tangles - it is effective.  </li>
            <li>Our daughter brushes her own hair with it and then goes around to do everyone else too.</li>
            <li>It would prob be best for a very yound child with finer hair.</li>
            <li>just nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>Their mom loves the brush because it doesn&#x27;t break their fine hair and is a good detangler.</li>
            <li>This is easily the best brush I&#x27;ve bought for very tangled hair.</li>
            <li>it removes the tangles easily!</li>
            <li>easily!..</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very smooth.</li>
            <li>Ok - so there might be a placebo effect in</li>
            <li>With the Denman Tangle Tamer, she doesn&#x27;t cry, squint or duck and doge the brush!! :-)</li>
            <li>The gradiated bristles of this brush seem to do magic.</li>
            <li>After a day in playing or in her car seat her curly would look more like Don King then</li>
            <li>I do recommend it to everyone :)</li>
            <li>I was able to pull some of the bristles out</li>
            <li>well it doesn&#x27;t really detangle hair great...</li>
            <li>and I love that it gets the tangles out with no tears.  </li>
            <li>It works better than any brush I&#x27;ve ever owned so definately deserves the 5 star rating.</li>
            <li>It satisfied my need to find a brush that won&#x27;t hurt my daughters tangled hair.</li>
            <li>I will probably order a couple more to have on hand.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair brush.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Love this brush...does what it says.</li>
            <li>Putting a cotton pillowcase across the shoulders helps to prevent static when brushing, too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as magical as some of the reviews I read.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I got this brush.</li>
            <li>ha, ha, ha, ha, ha :)))))</li>
            <li>but b/c the top is smoothed</li>
            <li>This brush was okay.</li>
            <li>It is okay...</li>
            <li>, they are great &amp; I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Best hairbrush we have tried for our daughter&#x27;s long locks!</li>
            <li>This one is the best for her to use by herself without tears or problems on dry hair.</li>
            <li>All I can say is make sure the hair is wet while brushing, and it&#x27;ll do great!</li>
            <li>The seller shipped fast, a good shopping experience.</li>
            <li>Whatever helps to makes morning before school less stressful is very welcome in my house :-))</li>
            <li>With that being said it does take the tangles out with easy.</li>
            <li>The brush works well with my daughters fine hair.</li>
            <li>She has really fine curly hair, and it always ends up in knots.</li>
            <li>and my daughter (3y10m) stills does not like getting her fine</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it works the knots out as well as others, so it takes longer, but as long as she will use it without  a meltdown, than this is a good brush for us!</li>
            <li>It gets the tangles out and leaves her hair smooth and shiny without the fussing and tears.</li>
            <li>They get daily use at their homes and seem to work great</li>
            <li>, I use cheap shampoo (currently a cheap 2-in-1)</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair tangle free.</li>
            <li>I have two daughters with two different hair textures and this brush works great on both of them...</li>
            <li>I also like it is light weight too.</li>
            <li>greaaaat smooth, shining , no hurt , detangler ,</li>
            <li>Shiny, smooth, and groomed.  </li>
            <li>Simple yet very effective brush.</li>
            <li>Kind of cheaply made, but it&#x27;s not real expensive anyway.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, but nothing special in our case.</li>
            <li>This brush works pretty good on my daughters very curly hair.</li>
            <li>What once was a chore and a negative experience (her hair gets tangled/matted easily) is now very pleasant!</li>
            <li>Now their hair is so soft and pretty - I just love it!!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Original Sprout Leave In Conditioner - 12 oz.]</li>
            <li>B002B8BCA6 Original Sprout 12 oz Miracle Detangler]]</li>
            <li>We use it in conjunction with Original Sprout Miracle Detangler.  </li>
            <li>I have reordered this brush for myself, my daughter, friends and relatives - it is an amazing brush that has allowed by 10 year old to begin to detangle her very curly hair on her own.</li>
            <li>The handle is perfect for her small hands to hold onto, and yes it does help with tangles.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter has fine hair and this does a great job brushing out her wet hair after shampoo.</li>
            <li>that Miss 6 knew we had bought a special brush that wasn&#x27;t going to hurt.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for detangling my little one&#x27;s hair and the size is great for her little head...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true, this brush is durable and tear-free, but it doesn&#x27;t get the tangles out.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>In fact her and my son like getting their hair brushed now because they say it feels good...</li>
            <li>but they came almost a month before expected, very nice.</li>
            <li>old fashioned conditioner/tangle tamer with a wide tooth comb still works best.</li>
            <li>This one is made differently; the bristles have more give and bend more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult with fine hair that gets knotted easily.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to tug too much when brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair or hurt her, and it easily brushes out the tangles.  </li>
            <li>This product really works - knots comb out easily and my daughter isn&#x27;t screaming for the hills every time I comb her hair.</li>
            <li>It gets through the tangles and knots gently and easily.</li>
            <li>and she is very tender headed!!</li>
            <li>I have tried many de-tangling brushes for my tender headed girls and the &amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34; seems to be the clear winner!</li>
            <li>I have a biracial child and this brush works great through her tightly curled hair.</li>
            <li>This brush will get through any tangle and leave your little one happy.  </li>
            <li>And she loves the bright pink.</li>
            <li>This brush really does get the tangles out tear free.  </li>
            <li>All the Denman brushes are worth the money.</li>
            <li>It does seem to smooth the top layer of her hair, but doesn&#x27;t come close to untangling the entire head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricy but totally worth it</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad we bought it, but unless I have a lot of time, I still use our old brush.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is very kinky and thick and this brush smooths her hair wonderfully.</li>
            <li>The girls loved this brush because it&#x27;s pink.</li>
            <li>This brush works great, it brushes her hair out quickly and there are is no more screaming.</li>
            <li>Denman brushes are high quality and will last many many years.</li>
            <li>This brush works just as good as the other Denman brush I bought..</li>
            <li>One child has sensory issues so brushing her very long hair was always a problem, not any more!  </li>
            <li>thicker and it barely gets the top layer...</li>
            <li>(make sure you&#x27;re not pulling the hair, just gripping it tight).</li>
            <li>My 2yr old has fine hair and rarely sits still.  </li>
            <li>There are less child complaints now, so that&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>Especially great for my grand daughter who has long hairs and lots of tangles dry or wet hair.</li>
            <li>my wife has tried all types of creams and brushes and nothing has worked as good as this little brush.</li>
            <li>the best brush ever for my multiracial child with long hair down to her ankles, this brush has been a gift from God!</li>
            <li>So I tend to use the &amp;#34;Tangle Teezer&amp;#34; first then use this comb to brush it into a pony tail.</li>
            <li>is the first brush that can comb her hair without damaging or breaking it.  </li>
            <li>This brush works really well on her type of hair!</li>
            <li>I imagine this would be a great brush for baby-fine hair, but for my daughter&#x27;s thick mane, it&#x27;s a bit lightweight.  </li>
            <li>but the more I use it the easier her hair gets to brush on a twice daily basis.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter thanks you!</li>
            <li>For us, the Tangle Tamer is sometimes useful, but isn&#x27;t really our go-to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes through painlessly, but it only gets the top layer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several brushes and this has been her favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m taking away one star because I feel like it actually takes out more of your hair than just gritting your teeth and combing it through.</li>
            <li>Right away this brush combed through supposidly tangled hair without much pulling.</li>
            <li>it does make my 3 year old&#x27;s fine straight hair a bit &amp;#34;frizzy&amp;#34; afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It can even get through the tangles when my hair is wet and no other product has been successful at that.</li>
            <li>I hope the new one lasts as long, it feels good and sturdy just like the old one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter is very particular about her brushes.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m less patient with my own hair.</li>
            <li>but this is her favorite brush when her hair is dry.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this brush based on all of the positive reviews and it has been an absolute life changer.</li>
            <li>Great on dry hair, but not so much on wet.  </li>
            <li>The individual strands of hair is fine, but she has a lot of it</li>
            <li>This is nice little brush, it does the job.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend any of their products!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My hair is very curly and this brush doesn&#x27;t work well on my hair -</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li>This brush makes my life so much easier and the brushing is not painfull time for me anymore.  </li>
            <li>My daughter really like using it.</li>
            <li>I have a 2 year biracial child with very curly hair.</li>
            <li>Her hair gets so tangled, and she&#x27;s very tender-headed.</li>
            <li>Would have saved us all a lot of tears and stressful mornings getting ready.</li>
            <li>She loves it and wants to use it herself.</li>
            <li>Both of my girls have curly hair and the bristles on this brush are very pokey.  </li>
            <li>Detangles very well and don&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>it is really a struggle...</li>
            <li>thanks..</li>
            <li>thanks..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically, the secret to the Tangle Tamer is that the bristles are softer than most brushes, have varying length, and don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; on the end that most brushes have.  </li>
            <li>I bought this brush after reading the reviews, and it is by far the best brush I have used in my dtr&#x27;s hair.she is mixed race and her hair has different textures that have made it hard to brush and full of tangles.</li>
            <li>Even in the morning when Dad has to get her ready for school, he has loved the new brush.&lt;br /&gt;Takes a little longer to brush through (because it just doesn&#x27;t rip through her hair) but that extra two minutes is so worth having a child sit there patiently talking to you</li>
            <li>As with the other reviewers, I love this.  </li>
            <li>After reading reviews thought I would try this one and sure enough it does actually work.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>just wish they had more choices in color, I am over 30 years old and would like to have other color besides pink&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to spray a little detangler on and with this brush can just come through with ease.</li>
            <li>Her hair gets extremely knotted up easily</li>
            <li>Bristles are kind of hard.</li>
            <li>Thinking about getting a few more just to keep around the house.</li>
            <li>While this brush does not completely stop all the pulling, it is 100% better than anything we have used, and they no longer cry while their hair is being brushed.  </li>
            <li>I dread the battle in the morning and after a bath because of dealing with long hair full of tangles.  </li>
            <li>, waist long hair brushed, but this brush makes it more manageable.</li>
            <li>but my 5 year old daughter loves it!</li>
            <li>It seems better than the ordinary brush I was using, but you still need to take time and brush in sections to prevent it from hurting.  </li>
            <li>girl\\&quot;, now it&#x27;s all nice and smooth, no more crying and fighting!</li>
            <li>This is a great little brush for combing her hair and she can use it herself because the size is small.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing special about this brush other then the name of it.</li>
            <li>Starting 2&amp;#34; from the bottom, brushing down until there are no knots then moving up 2&amp;#34; at a time might take 10-15  minutes (or more if we&#x27;ve missed brushing in the evening).</li>
            <li>it looks smooth but the little tangles and knots are still there</li>
            <li>If your child has fine or fragile hair like one of mine does - be careful -</li>
            <li>I gave 4 instead of 5 only because I notice a little more hair in the brush</li>
            <li>Does a great job and no more pulling and tugging or screaming and crying!</li>
            <li>I bought this brush for my 5 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li>Lately, she has had the most tangled hair even with using conditioner.  </li>
            <li>One for each of my five year old granddaughters and one for my house.  </li>
            <li>7 yr old tangles-</li>
            <li>I like the way it detangles my hair, it does wonders for natural hair.</li>
            <li>(I bought the adult version of this brush for my hair.)</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going to have to get one for my niece for Christmas because she has an extremely sensitive head</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my almost 3 year old.  </li>
            <li>I use this for my 11 month old twin girls</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really the only thing that makes combing their hair painfree.</li>
            <li>(I have a 4 year old girl).</li>
            <li>We have a finicky daughter with frequently tangled hair, so when it&#x27;s time to brush, we sometimes end up in a battle.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my 3 year old.</li>
            <li>My seven year old has tons of curly hair.</li>
            <li>As it turns out after using the Tangle Tamer for 3 months I had forgotten how much she cries and screams when using a regular brush.</li>
            <li>My 2 year old doesn&#x27;t make a peep now when I brush her hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this for our three year old as well as another detangler brush.</li>
            <li>My 10 yr old&#x27;s hair is shorter, but</li>
            <li>She always has knots in her hair, so this is a frequent battle.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m an adult using it and didn&#x27;t pay a lot of attention to the details.</li>
            <li>I love this brush for my 4 year old&#x27;s hair, which is thick and wavy/curly.  </li>
            <li>It brushes all the way through her thick hair--not just the top layer like some brushes.</li>
            <li>I used to use the original Denman (modified), but it was breaking my hair no matter how gently and slowly I detangled.</li>
            <li>My seven year old granddaughter hates to brush her hair, yet she wants to grow her hair long.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 3 year old who has very long hair that is straight with curls at the ends.</li>
            <li>Her hair is long and straight, and it&#x27;s a struggle to comb her hair after shower.</li>
            <li>It used to take so long to brush and she would scream and cry the whole time.</li>
            <li>it would probably be fine for mostly straight hair, my daughter has 4c hair and this is not great for that.</li>
            <li>Our daughter has very curly thick hair and have found that by keeping her hair very wet during and after bath time that it&#x27;s very easy to comb her hair with a regular old brush,</li>
            <li>happy with Denman products, I&#x27;ve used them for 25 years and have not been disappointed, I just now reordered a new brush to replace my 25yr old one as it was showing signs of wear.</li>
            <li>The teeth do not bend in our daughter&#x27;s fine but thick long straight hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter has a very sensitive head and hates having her hair brushed.  </li>
            <li>This is the only brush that works in my daughters natural curly hair!</li>
            <li>hence it is thick and fine.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very dry curly hair and this brush makes combing her hair so much easier and the curls are so defined.  </li>
            <li>I have only tried it on one granddaughter so far</li>
            <li>We were about to give up and cut our sensory sensitive daughter&#x27;s hair, as she cried every time we brushed her hair.</li>
            <li>Also, you need to follow it up with regular bristle brush, as the tangle tamer does not pull any natural oils through the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We bought one about 3 months ago because my 5 yr old daughter constantly cried and screamed while brushing her hair.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old daughter has a very tender head and brushing her hair everyday has always been a tear-filled chore.</li>
            <li>This really works and especially when your hair is wet and after washing.</li>
            <li>I purchased it for my 7 yr old with medium/fine curly hair that is fairly long.</li>
            <li>Brushing my 9-year-old daughter&#x27;s long, thick, fine hair has always been a headache for both of us.</li>
            <li>It gently mats the hair down so</li>
            <li>Her hair is thin, but it gets tangled easily because of her being a toddler and constantly getting stuff stuck in it.</li>
            <li>Time will tell if this is actually true but it does do the job in half the time of a comb or other vented brushes I have used!</li>
            <li>It is the only thing I have found that gets through the fine, very thick tangles of my semi-curly hair.</li>
            <li>The tips don&#x27;t have that coating that makes the ends have a rounded feel to it which could be both good and bad.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s great because I haven&#x27;t seen any breakage since using it.</li>
            <li> the best&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you can&#x27;t believe how happy I was to get this</li>
            <li> I ordered from Amazon based on reviews; however, I would have been just as happy to get a brush at Wal-Mart or Target.</li>
            <li> We love it!!</li>
            <li> Love this brush, it&#x27;s perfect for my waist length hair!</li>
            <li> She is happily brushing her own hair now every day, and it looks beautiful.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve combined this with a good conditioner at bath time.)</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter after reading a lot of good review about it.</li>
            <li> We own 3 of these brushes now as they are so good.</li>
            <li> It has become my favorite brushes ever!</li>
            <li> I already bought three more!</li>
            <li> Great scalp brush for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> This brush is amazing.</li>
            <li> This amazing brush does not pull the hair</li>
            <li> I also own a Denman and now will not purchase anything else.  </li>
            <li> Looks nice</li>
            <li> This brush helps get all of the good oils from the top of the hair to the bottom and</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this brush unless you don&#x27;t already own one.</li>
            <li> As a result, the Tamer kind of massages the knots in our daughter&#x27;s hair rather than catching on them.  </li>
            <li> This brush does help with the tangles - it is effective.  </li>
            <li> Our daughter brushes her own hair with it and then goes around to do everyone else too.</li>
            <li> It would prob be best for a very yound child with finer hair.</li>
            <li> just nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> Their mom loves the brush because it doesn&#x27;t break their fine hair and is a good detangler.</li>
            <li> This is easily the best brush I&#x27;ve bought for very tangled hair.</li>
            <li> it removes the tangles easily!</li>
            <li> easily!..</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very smooth.</li>
            <li> Ok - so there might be a placebo effect in</li>
            <li> With the Denman Tangle Tamer, she doesn&#x27;t cry, squint or duck and doge the brush!! :-)</li>
            <li> The gradiated bristles of this brush seem to do magic.</li>
            <li> After a day in playing or in her car seat her curly would look more like Don King then</li>
            <li> I do recommend it to everyone :)</li>
            <li> I was able to pull some of the bristles out</li>
            <li> well it doesn&#x27;t really detangle hair great...</li>
            <li> and I love that it gets the tangles out with no tears.  </li>
            <li> It works better than any brush I&#x27;ve ever owned so definately deserves the 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> It satisfied my need to find a brush that won&#x27;t hurt my daughters tangled hair.</li>
            <li> I will probably order a couple more to have on hand.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair brush.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Love this brush...does what it says.</li>
            <li> Putting a cotton pillowcase across the shoulders helps to prevent static when brushing, too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as magical as some of the reviews I read.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I got this brush.</li>
            <li> ha, ha, ha, ha, ha :)))))</li>
            <li> but b/c the top is smoothed</li>
            <li> This brush was okay.</li>
            <li> It is okay...</li>
            <li> , they are great &amp; I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Best hairbrush we have tried for our daughter&#x27;s long locks!</li>
            <li> This one is the best for her to use by herself without tears or problems on dry hair.</li>
            <li> All I can say is make sure the hair is wet while brushing, and it&#x27;ll do great!</li>
            <li> The seller shipped fast, a good shopping experience.</li>
            <li> Whatever helps to makes morning before school less stressful is very welcome in my house :-))</li>
            <li> With that being said it does take the tangles out with easy.</li>
            <li> The brush works well with my daughters fine hair.</li>
            <li> She has really fine curly hair, and it always ends up in knots.</li>
            <li> and my daughter (3y10m) stills does not like getting her fine</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it works the knots out as well as others, so it takes longer, but as long as she will use it without  a meltdown, than this is a good brush for us!</li>
            <li> It gets the tangles out and leaves her hair smooth and shiny without the fussing and tears.</li>
            <li> They get daily use at their homes and seem to work great</li>
            <li> , I use cheap shampoo (currently a cheap 2-in-1)</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair tangle free.</li>
            <li> I have two daughters with two different hair textures and this brush works great on both of them...</li>
            <li> I also like it is light weight too.</li>
            <li> greaaaat smooth, shining , no hurt , detangler ,</li>
            <li> Shiny, smooth, and groomed.  </li>
            <li> Simple yet very effective brush.</li>
            <li> Kind of cheaply made, but it&#x27;s not real expensive anyway.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, but nothing special in our case.</li>
            <li> This brush works pretty good on my daughters very curly hair.</li>
            <li> What once was a chore and a negative experience (her hair gets tangled/matted easily) is now very pleasant!</li>
            <li> Now their hair is so soft and pretty - I just love it!!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Original Sprout Leave In Conditioner - 12 oz.]</li>
            <li> B002B8BCA6 Original Sprout 12 oz Miracle Detangler]]</li>
            <li> We use it in conjunction with Original Sprout Miracle Detangler.  </li>
            <li> I have reordered this brush for myself, my daughter, friends and relatives - it is an amazing brush that has allowed by 10 year old to begin to detangle her very curly hair on her own.</li>
            <li> The handle is perfect for her small hands to hold onto, and yes it does help with tangles.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has fine hair and this does a great job brushing out her wet hair after shampoo.</li>
            <li> that Miss 6 knew we had bought a special brush that wasn&#x27;t going to hurt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for detangling my little one&#x27;s hair and the size is great for her little head...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, this brush is durable and tear-free, but it doesn&#x27;t get the tangles out.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> In fact her and my son like getting their hair brushed now because they say it feels good...</li>
            <li> but they came almost a month before expected, very nice.</li>
            <li> old fashioned conditioner/tangle tamer with a wide tooth comb still works best.</li>
            <li> This one is made differently; the bristles have more give and bend more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult with fine hair that gets knotted easily.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to tug too much when brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair or hurt her, and it easily brushes out the tangles.  </li>
            <li> This product really works - knots comb out easily and my daughter isn&#x27;t screaming for the hills every time I comb her hair.</li>
            <li> It gets through the tangles and knots gently and easily.</li>
            <li> and she is very tender headed!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many de-tangling brushes for my tender headed girls and the &amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34; seems to be the clear winner!</li>
            <li> I have a biracial child and this brush works great through her tightly curled hair.</li>
            <li> This brush will get through any tangle and leave your little one happy.  </li>
            <li> And she loves the bright pink.</li>
            <li> This brush really does get the tangles out tear free.  </li>
            <li> All the Denman brushes are worth the money.</li>
            <li> It does seem to smooth the top layer of her hair, but doesn&#x27;t come close to untangling the entire head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricy but totally worth it</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad we bought it, but unless I have a lot of time, I still use our old brush.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is very kinky and thick and this brush smooths her hair wonderfully.</li>
            <li> The girls loved this brush because it&#x27;s pink.</li>
            <li> This brush works great, it brushes her hair out quickly and there are is no more screaming.</li>
            <li> Denman brushes are high quality and will last many many years.</li>
            <li> This brush works just as good as the other Denman brush I bought..</li>
            <li> One child has sensory issues so brushing her very long hair was always a problem, not any more!  </li>
            <li> thicker and it barely gets the top layer...</li>
            <li> (make sure you&#x27;re not pulling the hair, just gripping it tight).</li>
            <li> My 2yr old has fine hair and rarely sits still.  </li>
            <li> There are less child complaints now, so that&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li> Especially great for my grand daughter who has long hairs and lots of tangles dry or wet hair.</li>
            <li> my wife has tried all types of creams and brushes and nothing has worked as good as this little brush.</li>
            <li> the best brush ever for my multiracial child with long hair down to her ankles, this brush has been a gift from God!</li>
            <li> So I tend to use the &amp;#34;Tangle Teezer&amp;#34; first then use this comb to brush it into a pony tail.</li>
            <li> is the first brush that can comb her hair without damaging or breaking it.  </li>
            <li> This brush works really well on her type of hair!</li>
            <li> I imagine this would be a great brush for baby-fine hair, but for my daughter&#x27;s thick mane, it&#x27;s a bit lightweight.  </li>
            <li> but the more I use it the easier her hair gets to brush on a twice daily basis.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter thanks you!</li>
            <li> For us, the Tangle Tamer is sometimes useful, but isn&#x27;t really our go-to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes through painlessly, but it only gets the top layer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brushes and this has been her favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking away one star because I feel like it actually takes out more of your hair than just gritting your teeth and combing it through.</li>
            <li> Right away this brush combed through supposidly tangled hair without much pulling.</li>
            <li> it does make my 3 year old&#x27;s fine straight hair a bit &amp;#34;frizzy&amp;#34; afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It can even get through the tangles when my hair is wet and no other product has been successful at that.</li>
            <li> I hope the new one lasts as long, it feels good and sturdy just like the old one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter is very particular about her brushes.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m less patient with my own hair.</li>
            <li> but this is her favorite brush when her hair is dry.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this brush based on all of the positive reviews and it has been an absolute life changer.</li>
            <li> Great on dry hair, but not so much on wet.  </li>
            <li> The individual strands of hair is fine, but she has a lot of it</li>
            <li> This is nice little brush, it does the job.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend any of their products!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly and this brush doesn&#x27;t work well on my hair -</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> This brush makes my life so much easier and the brushing is not painfull time for me anymore.  </li>
            <li> My daughter really like using it.</li>
            <li> I have a 2 year biracial child with very curly hair.</li>
            <li> Her hair gets so tangled, and she&#x27;s very tender-headed.</li>
            <li> Would have saved us all a lot of tears and stressful mornings getting ready.</li>
            <li> She loves it and wants to use it herself.</li>
            <li> Both of my girls have curly hair and the bristles on this brush are very pokey.  </li>
            <li> Detangles very well and don&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> it is really a struggle...</li>
            <li> thanks..</li>
            <li> thanks..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, the secret to the Tangle Tamer is that the bristles are softer than most brushes, have varying length, and don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; on the end that most brushes have.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brush after reading the reviews, and it is by far the best brush I have used in my dtr&#x27;s hair.she is mixed race and her hair has different textures that have made it hard to brush and full of tangles.</li>
            <li> Even in the morning when Dad has to get her ready for school, he has loved the new brush.&lt;br /&gt;Takes a little longer to brush through (because it just doesn&#x27;t rip through her hair) but that extra two minutes is so worth having a child sit there patiently talking to you</li>
            <li> As with the other reviewers, I love this.  </li>
            <li> After reading reviews thought I would try this one and sure enough it does actually work.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> just wish they had more choices in color, I am over 30 years old and would like to have other color besides pink&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to spray a little detangler on and with this brush can just come through with ease.</li>
            <li> Her hair gets extremely knotted up easily</li>
            <li> Bristles are kind of hard.</li>
            <li> Thinking about getting a few more just to keep around the house.</li>
            <li> While this brush does not completely stop all the pulling, it is 100% better than anything we have used, and they no longer cry while their hair is being brushed.  </li>
            <li> I dread the battle in the morning and after a bath because of dealing with long hair full of tangles.  </li>
            <li> , waist long hair brushed, but this brush makes it more manageable.</li>
            <li> but my 5 year old daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> It seems better than the ordinary brush I was using, but you still need to take time and brush in sections to prevent it from hurting.  </li>
            <li> girl\\&quot;, now it&#x27;s all nice and smooth, no more crying and fighting!</li>
            <li> This is a great little brush for combing her hair and she can use it herself because the size is small.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing special about this brush other then the name of it.</li>
            <li> Starting 2&amp;#34; from the bottom, brushing down until there are no knots then moving up 2&amp;#34; at a time might take 10-15  minutes (or more if we&#x27;ve missed brushing in the evening).</li>
            <li> it looks smooth but the little tangles and knots are still there</li>
            <li> If your child has fine or fragile hair like one of mine does - be careful -</li>
            <li> I gave 4 instead of 5 only because I notice a little more hair in the brush</li>
            <li> Does a great job and no more pulling and tugging or screaming and crying!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my 5 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li> Lately, she has had the most tangled hair even with using conditioner.  </li>
            <li> One for each of my five year old granddaughters and one for my house.  </li>
            <li> 7 yr old tangles-</li>
            <li> I like the way it detangles my hair, it does wonders for natural hair.</li>
            <li> (I bought the adult version of this brush for my hair.)</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to have to get one for my niece for Christmas because she has an extremely sensitive head</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my almost 3 year old.  </li>
            <li> I use this for my 11 month old twin girls</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really the only thing that makes combing their hair painfree.</li>
            <li> (I have a 4 year old girl).</li>
            <li> We have a finicky daughter with frequently tangled hair, so when it&#x27;s time to brush, we sometimes end up in a battle.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my 3 year old.</li>
            <li> My seven year old has tons of curly hair.</li>
            <li> As it turns out after using the Tangle Tamer for 3 months I had forgotten how much she cries and screams when using a regular brush.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old doesn&#x27;t make a peep now when I brush her hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for our three year old as well as another detangler brush.</li>
            <li> My 10 yr old&#x27;s hair is shorter, but</li>
            <li> She always has knots in her hair, so this is a frequent battle.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m an adult using it and didn&#x27;t pay a lot of attention to the details.</li>
            <li> I love this brush for my 4 year old&#x27;s hair, which is thick and wavy/curly.  </li>
            <li> It brushes all the way through her thick hair--not just the top layer like some brushes.</li>
            <li> I used to use the original Denman (modified), but it was breaking my hair no matter how gently and slowly I detangled.</li>
            <li> My seven year old granddaughter hates to brush her hair, yet she wants to grow her hair long.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 3 year old who has very long hair that is straight with curls at the ends.</li>
            <li> Her hair is long and straight, and it&#x27;s a struggle to comb her hair after shower.</li>
            <li> It used to take so long to brush and she would scream and cry the whole time.</li>
            <li> it would probably be fine for mostly straight hair, my daughter has 4c hair and this is not great for that.</li>
            <li> Our daughter has very curly thick hair and have found that by keeping her hair very wet during and after bath time that it&#x27;s very easy to comb her hair with a regular old brush,</li>
            <li> happy with Denman products, I&#x27;ve used them for 25 years and have not been disappointed, I just now reordered a new brush to replace my 25yr old one as it was showing signs of wear.</li>
            <li> The teeth do not bend in our daughter&#x27;s fine but thick long straight hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a very sensitive head and hates having her hair brushed.  </li>
            <li> This is the only brush that works in my daughters natural curly hair!</li>
            <li> hence it is thick and fine.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very dry curly hair and this brush makes combing her hair so much easier and the curls are so defined.  </li>
            <li> I have only tried it on one granddaughter so far</li>
            <li> We were about to give up and cut our sensory sensitive daughter&#x27;s hair, as she cried every time we brushed her hair.</li>
            <li> Also, you need to follow it up with regular bristle brush, as the tangle tamer does not pull any natural oils through the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We bought one about 3 months ago because my 5 yr old daughter constantly cried and screamed while brushing her hair.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter has a very tender head and brushing her hair everyday has always been a tear-filled chore.</li>
            <li> This really works and especially when your hair is wet and after washing.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my 7 yr old with medium/fine curly hair that is fairly long.</li>
            <li> Brushing my 9-year-old daughter&#x27;s long, thick, fine hair has always been a headache for both of us.</li>
            <li> It gently mats the hair down so</li>
            <li> Her hair is thin, but it gets tangled easily because of her being a toddler and constantly getting stuff stuck in it.</li>
            <li> Time will tell if this is actually true but it does do the job in half the time of a comb or other vented brushes I have used!</li>
            <li> It is the only thing I have found that gets through the fine, very thick tangles of my semi-curly hair.</li>
            <li> The tips don&#x27;t have that coating that makes the ends have a rounded feel to it which could be both good and bad.</li>
            <li> Most brushes are made with stiff bristles, this brush is made of bendable bristles; it is like a thick nylon</li>
            <li> It should work most little girls with long thick hair that is constantly getting so snarled it becomes a total rat&#x27;s nest.</li>
            <li> She would run screaming when I would get near her with other brushes and combs.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s big enough for my long hair but small enough to through in my travel bag and not take up much space.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 8 y.o. daughter&#x27;s hair is very soft and thin, however, she has a lot of it - therefore the hair tangles really fast</li>
            <li> then other brushes,  and I don&#x27;t really like using it on damp hair for her because it seems to straighten it a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Native American with very long thick hair &amp; this brush really helps detangle my hair with ease..</li>
            <li> , just wish it was bigger and a little heavy dutier for older kids!</li>
            <li> BTW--I dyed my brush black, pink just didn&#x27;t work for this old biker!  </li>
            <li> Ordered these for my Granddaughters, I was prepared to wait a long time to receive these</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I do have long hair and it used to take me a long time to brush all the tangles out, but not anymore.  </li>
            <li> I have long curly hair and nothing else I&#x27;ve used works as well as this brush.</li>
            <li> My 6yo loves this brush for her long hair.  </li>
            <li> We bought a few detangling brushes for our 4 year old as she has long wavy hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is rather thick and straight.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this product, no more pain!</li>
            <li> This Denman Tangle Tamer is EXACTLY what any little girl need!!!</li>
            <li> This brush seemed no different than other brushes I have used.  </li>
            <li> Since then we have been improvising daily with other brushes at home with no relief.</li>
            <li> Then when it&#x27;s dry, if I need it, I put on some [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> We can brush it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Both donate to Locks of Love, so their hair gets down to their waistline before cutting.  </li>
            <li> Please also note that this is a tiny brush not a full sized brush.</li>
            <li> One has very thick, straight hair and a tender head and one has wavy, fast-growing, often tangled/matted hair.  </li>
            <li> It is also soft against her scalp, but tough enough not to bend.</li>
            <li> I can finally brush my daughter&#x27;s hair without her trying to run away or crying while I work the tangles out.</li>
            <li> We like the sharkk detangling brush for wet hair.</li>
            <li> She likes that it is pink, I like that she doesn&#x27;t mind brushing her hair now.</li>
            <li> Although she never wants to have anything in her hair.</li>
            <li> Worked for us just like any other brush.</li>
            <li> Reading the other reviews, I was hoping for a miracle.  </li>
            <li> My daughter does not care for this because the bristles are awfully sharp.</li>
            <li> I was shocked and how easy it is to brush her hair.</li>
            <li> I have had  a hard time all my life with brushing my hair especially after washing them.  </li>
            <li> however I find it difficult to brush really curly hair to get tangles out.</li>
            <li> HAND&#x27;S DOWN</li>
            <li> Before this brush I had to literally hold my daughter down</li>
            <li> I have very long fine hair that tangles something terrible, especially after washing, even with conditioner.</li>
            <li> so well it was like night and day from my previous toddler hair brush.  </li>
            <li> The brushing experience is much less traumatic, but takes forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter has long, curly thick hair</li>
            <li> I hated this brush at first for my daughters thin long dry hair with a sensitive head</li>
            <li> : When untangling stubborn hair knots, grab a handful of hair where the tangled area is located and hold it tightly away from the scalp</li>
            <li> But with a little water smoothed over it</li>
            <li> This brush plus a little time and patience and we have tear-free mornings (and evenings) with our daughters&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li> Still takes work, but doesn&#x27;t hurt our little girl while brushing out the tangles.  </li>
            <li> It untangles with little pain involved.</li>
            <li> I do the CG method, but sometimes I miss some knots and this little miracle gets them out with ease.</li>
            <li> I used to call her my \\&quot;little cave</li>
            <li> but she is still like a little girl when it comes to combing out her mangled mane...</li>
            <li> and before I even got through one section of her hair she was crying.  </li>
            <li> The bristles would get pushed into the brush after a few strokes.  </li>
            <li> but my daughter loves it and uses it everyday...</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> No more complaining and crying, and it gets the tangles out.</li>
            <li> But we have no more tears or fights about brushing her hair.</li>
            <li> Gotta use it slow in my kiddos hair but has def noticed a change in hair after a few uses.</li>
            <li> No more rat&#x27;s nests, no more arguing for the possibility of a shorter style, no more morning drama.)</li>
            <li> This is one of the very few brushes that my daughters will use with no complaints.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS A WINNER FOR ANY LITTLE GIRL&#x27;S SCALP AND HAIR!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked this little brush actually works.</li>
            <li> I was rather skeptical and still think that the pink color has helped make it a fav</li>
            <li> I have thick 3a-3c hair.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t brush to the bottom of mine or my daughter&#x27;s thick hair.</li>
            <li> But if we comb slowly, shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> No more split ends with the tangle brush!  </li>
            <li> No more tears when brushing her hair!</li>
            <li> Tangles seem to be a thing of the past, thank goodness!</li>
            <li> My kids like it because although the bristles get the tangles out, they have enough bend not to cause painful</li>
            <li> About a week ago we misplaced the brush and have been unable to find it.</li>
            <li> This brush is part of a secret formula that I&#x27;ve discovered works for my kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as to whether or not it would truly detangle and not hurt.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of cutting knots out of my three-year-old&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> They hated it</li>
            <li> and I hated it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this brush for my 4 year old&#x27;s hair, which is thick and wavy/curly.  It is the best brush for removing tangles that I have found.  I bought a second one so that we always have one for traveling too!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my 5 year old granddaughter. It gets the tangles out and leaves her hair smooth and shiny without the fussing and tears. And she loves the bright pink.</li>
            <li> This brush works just as good as the other Denman brush I bought..It&#x27;s perfect for detangling my little one&#x27;s hair and the size is great for her little head...I highly recommend any of their products!</li>
            <li> Finally, a brush that my daughter doesn&#x27;t run away from when it&#x27;s time to brush her hair.  Kind of cheaply made, but it&#x27;s not real expensive anyway.  All the Denman brushes are worth the money.</li>
            <li> Ok - so there might be a placebo effect in that Miss 6 knew we had bought a special brush that wasn&#x27;t going to hurt. But we have no more tears or fights about brushing her hair. Even in the morning when Dad has to get her ready for school, he has loved the new brush.&lt;br /&gt;Takes a little longer to brush through (because it just doesn&#x27;t rip through her hair) but that extra two minutes is so worth having a child sit there patiently talking to you then someone squirming and crying.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Ordered these for my Granddaughters, I was prepared to wait a long time to receive these but they came almost a month before expected, very nice. They get daily use at their homes and seem to work great (I haven&#x27;t used them).&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with Denman products, I&#x27;ve used them for 25 years and have not been disappointed, I just now reordered a new brush to replace my 25yr old one as it was showing signs of wear. I hope the new one lasts as long, it feels good and sturdy just like the old one.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend Denman!</li>
            <li> My daughter has long, curly thick hair and she is very tender headed!! With the Denman Tangle Tamer, she doesn&#x27;t cry, squint or duck and doge the brush!! :-) This Denman Tangle Tamer is EXACTLY what any little girl need!!! It detangle and even remove the lint balls that are in the hair that causes the tangling!! I must say THANK YOU DENMAN!! THIS IS A WINNER FOR ANY LITTLE GIRL&#x27;S SCALP AND HAIR!! HAND&#x27;S DOWN THIS IS HAIR&#x27;S ANGEL!!</li>
            <li> It works! I bought this brush to try on my daughter&#x27;s curly, tangle-prone hair. It gets out even knotted tangles, and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m pulling/stretching/damaging her hair. I wish I would have bought this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> My daughter is very particular about her brushes.  Lately, she has had the most tangled hair even with using conditioner.  I purchased some generic detangler spray from the ole brick and mortar and this brush.  I was rather skeptical and still think that the pink color has helped make it a fav but no longer do I have to deal with hair drama every morning.</li>
            <li> I purchased three of these hairbrushes.  One for each of my five year old granddaughters and one for my house.  I was skeptical as to whether or not it would truly detangle and not hurt.  I have only tried it on one granddaughter so far but I was amazed that she did not give me one \\&quot;ouch.\\&quot;  I also purchased a brush elsewhere that was supposed to be a detangler and before I even got through one section of her hair she was crying.  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> We were about to give up and cut our sensory sensitive daughter&#x27;s hair, as she cried every time we brushed her hair. This brush does amazingingly well for her, and she no longer cries. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The gradiated bristles of this brush seem to do magic. It is the only thing I have found that gets through the fine, very thick tangles of my semi-curly hair. It can even get through the tangles when my hair is wet and no other product has been successful at that.</li>
            <li> hair brushing used to be a battle w/ 7 yr old tangles- she loves the brush and her hair looks great.</li>
            <li> This brush does well to do pony tails however I find it difficult to brush really curly hair to get tangles out. So I tend to use the &amp;#34;Tangle Teezer&amp;#34; first then use this comb to brush it into a pony tail.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these brushes (I have 3 girls) and they are wonderful! One child has sensory issues so brushing her very long hair was always a problem, not any more!  I wish I would have found these brushes sooner, they are great &amp; I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> This is nice little brush, it does the job. I like the way it detangles my hair, it does wonders for natural hair. In my opinion the best brand brush on the market. The seller shipped fast, a good shopping experience. I will recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair gets tangled a lot. It is a daily battle that includes a lot of tears - and she cries too sometimes. Ha ha. Anyway, this brush is excellent. To get through her hair, I have to make a few passes, but it is much easier on her hair. (I&#x27;ve combined this with a good conditioner at bath time.) My daughter&#x27;s hair is rather thick and straight. My hair is very curly and this brush doesn&#x27;t work well on my hair - but I&#x27;m less patient with my own hair. (I bought the adult version of this brush for my hair.)</li>
            <li> I can finally brush my daughter&#x27;s hair without her trying to run away or crying while I work the tangles out. Her hair is thin, but it gets tangled easily because of her being a toddler and constantly getting stuff stuck in it. I think I&#x27;m going to have to get one for my niece for Christmas because she has an extremely sensitive head and I truly believe that this could end her tears.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, it&#x27;s perfect for my waist length hair!</li>
            <li> My kids don&#x27;t run away from me brushing their hair anymore. This brush is part of a secret formula that I&#x27;ve discovered works for my kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the bath, I use cheap shampoo (currently a cheap 2-in-1) and then after they get out, I put [[ASIN:B002J6YCBQ Original Sprout Leave In Conditioner - 12 oz.]] in their hair. Then when it&#x27;s dry, if I need it, I put on some [[ASIN:B002B8BCA6 Original Sprout 12 oz Miracle Detangler]] and then use this brush. I always start brushing at the bottom, just in case. But now my kids like having their hair brushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was always the parent with the knotty-haired kid because they wouldn&#x27;t sit still. Now their hair is so soft and pretty - I just love it!! Highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> This brush works pretty good on my daughters very curly hair. However, I do wish it was larger.</li>
            <li> My daughther has Shirly Temple curly hair.  She would run screaming when I would get near her with other brushes and combs.  After a day in playing or in her car seat her curly would look more like Don King then Shirly Temple.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first brush that can comb her hair without damaging or breaking it.  We use it in conjunction with Original Sprout Miracle Detangler.  We can brush it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> the best brush ever for my multiracial child with long hair down to her ankles, this brush has been a gift from God!</li>
            <li> I have reordered this brush for myself, my daughter, friends and relatives - it is an amazing brush that has allowed by 10 year old to begin to detangle her very curly hair on her own.</li>
            <li> I have had  a hard time all my life with brushing my hair especially after washing them.  This brush makes my life so much easier and the brushing is not painfull time for me anymore.  I do have long hair and it used to take me a long time to brush all the tangles out, but not anymore.  I do like that it is not big and bulky and it&#x27;s big enough for my long hair but small enough to through in my travel bag and not take up much space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish they had more choices in color, I am over 30 years old and would like to have other color besides pink&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but overalll I do recommend it to everyone :)</li>
            <li> My 2yr old has fine hair and rarely sits still.  This is a great little brush for combing her hair and she can use it herself because the size is small.</li>
            <li> This brush fooled me.  When my hair was short it worked so well.  My curls were always detangled after I used it.  But once my hair started growing, the brush just couldn&#x27;t handle my hair anymore.  The bristles would get pushed into the brush after a few strokes.  I was able to pull some of the bristles out but others were so ingrained into the brush that they could not be retrieved.  I have thick 3a-3c hair.  If you have 3a-3b hair then this brush is for you.  This brush cannot support a mixture of hair textures beyond 3b.</li>
            <li> well it doesn&#x27;t really detangle hair great...but my daughter loves it and uses it everyday...and she hates combing her hair, so hey I&#x27;m all for it.</li>
            <li> My 8 y.o. daughter&#x27;s hair is very soft and thin, however, she has a lot of it - therefore the hair tangles really fast no matter what you do, especially if she wears it just with hairband, without putting it into ponytail or braid. This brush works really well on her type of hair! Whatever helps to makes morning before school less stressful is very welcome in my house :-)) My daughter really like using it.</li>
            <li> I imagine this would be a great brush for baby-fine hair, but for my daughter&#x27;s thick mane, it&#x27;s a bit lightweight.  It does seem to smooth the top layer of her hair, but doesn&#x27;t come close to untangling the entire head.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my almost 3 year old.  I also own a Denman and now will not purchase anything else.  My daughter would always borrow my brush and I could never find it, so I bought this for her.  She loves the color and I love that it gets the tangles out with no tears.  This brush doesn&#x27;t have the balls on the end of the bristles that eventually break off and then scratch the scalp.  Denman brushes are high quality and will last many many years.</li>
            <li> No more split ends with the tangle brush!  This really works and especially when your hair is wet and after washing. You can brush your hair with any pulling or breaking of the ends.  Especially great for my grand daughter who has long hairs and lots of tangles dry or wet hair. No more tears when brushing her hair!</li>
            <li> My daughter hates her hair being brushed to the point where she cries because of all the tangles she has. my wife has tried all types of creams and brushes and nothing has worked as good as this little brush. Thinking about getting a few more just to keep around the house.</li>
            <li> Not just for children! I&#x27;m an adult with fine hair that gets knotted easily. Right away this brush combed through supposidly tangled hair without much pulling. It works better than any brush I&#x27;ve ever owned so definately deserves the 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> The only difference between this brush and the one you buy at your local drugstore is that this one is 3x the price!</li>
            <li> The brush works well with my daughters fine hair. It satisfied my need to find a brush that won&#x27;t hurt my daughters tangled hair.</li>
            <li> Everytime I use this brush - my hair tangles in the bristles. Looks nice but I lose a lot of hair with this product.</li>
            <li> I have a biracial child and this brush works great through her tightly curled hair. What once was a chore and a negative experience (her hair gets tangled/matted easily) is now very pleasant! All I can say is make sure the hair is wet while brushing, and it&#x27;ll do great!</li>
            <li> I have very long fine hair that tangles something terrible, especially after washing, even with conditioner. I was truly amazed how well this brush worked! It has become my favorite brushes ever! I will probably order a couple more to have on hand.</li>
            <li> Detangles without pain. My daughter loves this brush!!</li>
            <li> I have a 2 year biracial child with very curly hair. I&#x27;m able to spray a little detangler on and with this brush can just come through with ease. I was shocked and how easy it is to brush her hair. I recommend this brush 100%!!!!</li>
            <li> Brushing my 9-year-old daughter&#x27;s long, thick, fine hair has always been a headache for both of us. Her hair gets so tangled, and she&#x27;s very tender-headed. This brush works wonderfully! No more complaining and crying, and it gets the tangles out. It brushes all the way through her thick hair--not just the top layer like some brushes. It&#x27;s lightweight, but my daughter mentioned that she likes that about the brush. I&#x27;m buying a second one. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My seven year old granddaughter hates to brush her hair, yet she wants to grow her hair long.  This brush is wonderful. I now have one for her home, one for my home, and one for her bookbag.</li>
            <li> i have used several detangling brushes.  I prefer the tangle teezer and the denman brush to this one.  it would probably be fine for mostly straight hair, my daughter has 4c hair and this is not great for that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, this brush is durable and tear-free, but it doesn&#x27;t get the tangles out. It gently mats the hair down so it looks smooth but the little tangles and knots are still there and it doesn&#x27;t brush to the bottom of mine or my daughter&#x27;s thick hair.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter after reading a lot of good review about it. And it&#x27;s true. Her hair is long and straight, and it&#x27;s a struggle to comb her hair after shower. Thanks to this product, no more pain! But I do see a bit of hair shed after using it, though. But if we comb slowly, shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> I hated this brush at first for my daughters thin long dry hair with a sensitive head but the more I use it the easier her hair gets to brush on a twice daily basis. This brush helps get all of the good oils from the top of the hair to the bottom and my three year olds hair is now to her butt because the hair is getting the nourishment it needs.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair brush.  I have long curly hair and nothing else I&#x27;ve used works as well as this brush.</li>
            <li> This Tangle Tamer works so well it was like night and day from my previous toddler hair brush.  My granddaughter thanks you!</li>
            <li> Love this. Gotta use it slow in my kiddos hair but has def noticed a change in hair after a few uses. Would recommend to anyone who struggles with knots in hair.</li>
            <li> This brush really does get the tangles out tear free.  I gave it 4 stars only b/c it does make my 3 year old&#x27;s fine straight hair a bit &amp;#34;frizzy&amp;#34; afterwards.  But with a little water smoothed over it it looks great again!</li>
            <li> Wish I would have bought years ago. Would have saved us all a lot of tears and stressful mornings getting ready.</li>
            <li> I use this for my 11 month old twin girls and it&#x27;s really the only thing that makes combing their hair painfree. I always brush with this before using an afro comb for them. It&#x27;s a bit pricy but totally worth it</li>
            <li> We own 3 of these brushes now as they are so good. Brushing my daughters here was a chore every day before these brushes.  Now we won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing special about this brush other then the name of it. Our daughter has very curly thick hair and have found that by keeping her hair very wet during and after bath time that it&#x27;s very easy to comb her hair with a regular old brush, though also adding hair conditioner from Trader Joe&#x27;s seems to help it out a lot too. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this brush unless you don&#x27;t already own one.</li>
            <li> This brush didn&#x27;t do it for us. Worked for us just like any other brush. It&#x27;s fine, but nothing special in our case.</li>
            <li> Love this brush...does what it says. A lifesaver for us (I have a 4 year old girl). Bought a second one - one stays upstairs and one downstairs. Probably could use a third!</li>
            <li> This works wonders on my 3c-4b hair.</li>
            <li> We bought a few detangling brushes for our 4 year old as she has long wavy hair. This one is the best for her to use by herself without tears or problems on dry hair. We like the sharkk detangling brush for wet hair. She likes that it is pink, I like that she doesn&#x27;t mind brushing her hair now.</li>
            <li> Great scalp brush for my fine hair.  Leaves my hair tangle free.</li>
            <li> We have a finicky daughter with frequently tangled hair, so when it&#x27;s time to brush, we sometimes end up in a battle.  Reading the other reviews, I was hoping for a miracle.  For us, the Tangle Tamer is sometimes useful, but isn&#x27;t really our go-to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, the secret to the Tangle Tamer is that the bristles are softer than most brushes, have varying length, and don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; on the end that most brushes have.  As a result, the Tamer kind of massages the knots in our daughter&#x27;s hair rather than catching on them.  The brushing experience is much less traumatic, but takes forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad we bought it, but unless I have a lot of time, I still use our old brush.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has fine hair and this does a great job brushing out her wet hair after shampoo. She likes it.</li>
            <li> This brush seemed no different than other brushes I have used.  It stuck in my child&#x27;s hair and puller her hair.  We only used it once and never used it again.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great investment!! I have two daughters with two different hair textures and this brush works great on both of them...Wish I would have known about this brush years ago</li>
            <li> This brush plus a little time and patience and we have tear-free mornings (and evenings) with our daughters&#x27; hair.  One has very thick, straight hair and a tender head and one has wavy, fast-growing, often tangled/matted hair.  Both donate to Locks of Love, so their hair gets down to their waistline before cutting.  Starting 2&amp;#34; from the bottom, brushing down until there are no knots then moving up 2&amp;#34; at a time might take 10-15  minutes (or more if we&#x27;ve missed brushing in the evening). Putting a cotton pillowcase across the shoulders helps to prevent static when brushing, too.</li>
            <li> Works so well! Leaves my hair very smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect sized brush.  Great on dry hair, but not so much on wet.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to tug too much when brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair or hurt her, and it easily brushes out the tangles.  I&#x27;m considering buying another brush to keep in her bag.</li>
            <li> My daughter does not care for this because the bristles are awfully sharp. It does get knots out well though.</li>
            <li> This brush does help with the tangles - it is effective.  I would not say it is painless though.  There are less child complaints now, so that&#x27;s good.  If your child has fine or fragile hair like one of mine does - be careful - I&#x27;ve noticed that it can rip hair.  Also, you need to follow it up with regular bristle brush, as the tangle tamer does not pull any natural oils through the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good old fashioned conditioner/tangle tamer with a wide tooth comb still works best.</li>
            <li> This is easily the best brush I&#x27;ve bought for very tangled hair. My kids like it because although the bristles get the tangles out, they have enough bend not to cause painful pulling.&lt;br /&gt;Love this brush!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 3 year old. She has really fine curly hair, and it always ends up in knots. This is the only brush I&#x27;ve used that she seems to like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Most brushes are made with stiff bristles, this brush is made of bendable bristles; it is like a thick nylon material.&lt;br /&gt;~ The bristles have a height variation; some bristles are regular size and some are shorter.&lt;br /&gt;~ The tips don&#x27;t have that coating that makes the ends have a rounded feel to it which could be both good and bad. I personally don&#x27;t like the feel of it, but my daughter doesn&#x27;t seem to mind. But I do also make it a point to not have the brush rake her scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: When untangling stubborn hair knots, grab a handful of hair where the tangled area is located and hold it tightly away from the scalp (make sure you&#x27;re not pulling the hair, just gripping it tight). This way, you can brush those tangles off over and over again without the pain, your grip serves as a faux scalp.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull hair out and works to untangle as you brush.  Still takes work, but doesn&#x27;t hurt our little girl while brushing out the tangles.  She loves it and wants to use it herself.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush after reading the reviews, and it is by far the best brush I have used in my dtr&#x27;s hair.she is mixed race and her hair has different textures that have made it hard to brush and full of tangles. This brushes thru knots and tangles without pain, my dtr no longer complains when I brush her hair. I gave 4 instead of 5 only because I notice a little more hair in the brush then other brushes,  and I don&#x27;t really like using it on damp hair for her because it seems to straighten it a little.</li>
            <li> As with the other reviewers, I love this.  I have two daughters and brushing their hair was a chore at best and a nightmare at worst in trying to get all the tangles out.  They hated it and I hated it.  While this brush does not completely stop all the pulling, it is 100% better than anything we have used, and they no longer cry while their hair is being brushed.  Will be ordering a second so we will have a back-up.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 3 year old who has very long hair that is straight with curls at the ends. Her hair gets extremely knotted up easily and she hates to have it brushed. It used to take so long to brush and she would scream and cry the whole time. This brush works great, it brushes her hair out quickly and there are is no more screaming. She just sits there watching her shows while I brush it. I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone who has hair that needs brushed.</li>
            <li> Simple yet very effective brush. My girl friend kept using the one I bought her  daughter so I bought her one too.  Sometimes I buy gifts like this that work and feel like a hero for a day.</li>
            <li> This is the only detangling style brush I have ever bought but my 5 year old daughter loves it! Does a great job and no more pulling and tugging or screaming and crying! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing. My seven year old has tons of curly hair. She cried every time I had to brush her hair. This brush works so great she can even do it herself.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter has a very tender head and brushing her hair everyday has always been a tear-filled chore. I ordered this brush based on all of the positive reviews and it has been an absolute life changer. My daughter is now walking around the house brushing her hair like a teenager. She insists upon &amp;#34;trying it out&amp;#34; in front of guests and showing them how she can now brush her hair with ease. I would recommend this brush to anyone! will order multiple to have around the house.</li>
            <li> This is the only brush that works in my daughters natural curly hair! This amazing brush does not pull the hair it removes the tangles easily! I already bought three more!</li>
            <li> This brush seems to do the trick.  It&#x27;s not as magical as some of the reviews I read.  Both of my girls have curly hair and the bristles on this brush are very pokey.  It seems better than the ordinary brush I was using, but you still need to take time and brush in sections to prevent it from hurting.  I ordered 2 and think I might try a different brand next time.  They seem pricey for what you get.</li>
            <li> I give this four stars only because it only get 80% of tangles out. With that being said it does take the tangles out with easy. Before this brush I had to literally hold my daughter down but now I brush it and she never even moves.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got this brush. My daughter&#x27;s hair is very kinky and thick and this brush smooths her hair wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I was tired of cutting knots out of my three-year-old&#x27;s hair. This product really works - knots comb out easily and my daughter isn&#x27;t screaming for the hills every time I comb her hair.</li>
            <li> I just purchased a second Tangle Tamer! We bought one about 3 months ago because my 5 yr old daughter constantly cried and screamed while brushing her hair. After the first Tangle Tamer use there were no more tears. About a week ago we misplaced the brush and have been unable to find it. Since then we have been improvising daily with other brushes at home with no relief. As it turns out after using the Tangle Tamer for 3 months I had forgotten how much she cries and screams when using a regular brush. She has been in agony. I have given up on finding our lost Tangle Tamer and am having a replacement shipped ASAP. I know my daughter will be happy to get it!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very dry curly hair and this brush makes combing her hair so much easier and the curls are so defined.  We love it!!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews thought I would try this one and sure enough it does actually work. My 2 year old doesn&#x27;t make a peep now when I brush her hair. In fact her and my son like getting their hair brushed now because they say it feels good...go figure.</li>
            <li> The girls loved this brush because it&#x27;s pink. Their mom loves the brush because it doesn&#x27;t break their fine hair and is a good detangler.</li>
            <li> This brush will get through any tangle and leave your little one happy.  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Best hairbrush we have tried for our daughter&#x27;s long locks! Tangles seem to be a thing of the past, thank goodness!</li>
            <li> This is one of the very few brushes that my daughters will use with no complaints.  It gets through the tangles and knots gently and easily.</li>
            <li> This brush is excellent for anyone that has problems with hair that tangles easily!..I&#x27;m Native American with very long thick hair &amp; this brush really helps detangle my hair with ease..I would recommend this prodduct to anyone out there!..BTW--I dyed my brush black, pink just didn&#x27;t work for this old biker!  ha, ha, ha, ha, ha :)))))</li>
            <li> My 6yo loves this brush for her long hair.  I use a regular brush after she showers but this is her favorite brush when her hair is dry.  It untangles with little pain involved.</li>
            <li> I used to use the original Denman (modified), but it was breaking my hair no matter how gently and slowly I detangled. This one is made differently; the bristles have more give and bend more. It&#x27;s made for children&#x27;s hair and it&#x27;s great because I haven&#x27;t seen any breakage since using it. If you&#x27;re having breakage issue with the regular you might want to try this one instead. I do the CG method, but sometimes I miss some knots and this little miracle gets them out with ease.</li>
            <li> I bought this for our three year old as well as another detangler brush. Out of those two, she likes this one best as do I. The teeth do not bend in our daughter&#x27;s fine but thick long straight hair. The individual strands of hair is fine, but she has a lot of it hence it is thick and fine. It is also soft against her scalp, but tough enough not to bend. Our daughter brushes her own hair with it and then goes around to do everyone else too. The handle is perfect for her small hands to hold onto, and yes it does help with tangles.</li>
            <li> It would prob be best for a very yound child with finer hair. I purchased it for my 7 yr old with medium/fine curly hair that is fairly long. It goes through painlessly, but it only gets the top layer. My 10 yr old&#x27;s hair is shorter, but thicker and it barely gets the top layer...all the knots underneath stay put but b/c the top is smoothed she is convinced it is brushed!  I like the idea and design, just wish it was bigger and a little heavy dutier for older kids!</li>
            <li> My daughter has a very sensitive head and hates having her hair brushed.  She always has knots in her hair, so this is a frequent battle.  I&#x27;ve tried several brushes and this has been her favorite. I don&#x27;t think it works the knots out as well as others, so it takes longer, but as long as she will use it without  a meltdown, than this is a good brush for us!</li>
            <li> I dread the battle in the morning and after a bath because of dealing with long hair full of tangles.  This brush worked great and no tears!</li>
            <li> The only brush I use now for my daughter&#x27;s and myself&#x27;s hair. Detangles very well and don&#x27;t hurt. A total life saver. I also like it is light weight too. We just bought a second one to keep in the car.</li>
            <li> It should work most little girls with long thick hair that is constantly getting so snarled it becomes a total rat&#x27;s nest. I used to call her my \\&quot;little cave girl\\&quot;, now it&#x27;s all nice and smooth, no more crying and fighting!</li>
            <li> This brush was okay. Bristles are kind of hard. I have tried many de-tangling brushes for my tender headed girls and the &amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34; seems to be the clear winner!</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for 8m and my daughter (3y10m) stills does not like getting her fine, waist long hair brushed, but this brush makes it more manageable. Although she never wants to have anything in her hair. Ponytails, clips, nothing! Not because of the brushing, that&#x27;s just her.&lt;br /&gt;No, it won&#x27;t detangle bubble gum, or erase pudding \\&quot;baths\\&quot;, but if something stickey is in her hair during the day, I can rub it out with some water and brush it through.&lt;br /&gt;I chose this over a Smoobee for the Denman reputation.&lt;br /&gt;She knows this is her brush, but 5y9m brother and Dad prefer to use it on their short hair too.</li>
            <li> Get the tangles out of my daughters curly hair with no tears! This brush has lasted for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked this little brush actually works. But it does what it says. It gets the tangles out! Please also note that this is a tiny brush not a full sized brush. I guess it makes sense for kids but I&#x27;m an adult using it and didn&#x27;t pay a lot of attention to the details. Its not a problem just something to note. I&#x27;m taking away one star because I feel like it actually takes out more of your hair than just gritting your teeth and combing it through. Time will tell if this is actually true but it does do the job in half the time of a comb or other vented brushes I have used!</li>
            <li> I have bought quite a number of brushes that claims to detangle hair but to no avail.  Then I just come across this when I was searching for yet...another...detangler brush for my daughter...eventhough she is 22 but she is still like a little girl when it comes to combing out her mangled mane...tears...screams...pushing my hands away when I try to help her..it is really a struggle...UNTIL NOW!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves this and she carries this everywhere and is telling all her friends about this wonderful invention!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks..thanks..thanks..DENMAN!!!</li>
            <li> greaaaat smooth, shining , no hurt , detangler , the best&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you can&#x27;t believe how happy I was to get this brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note from mom:  She is happily brushing her own hair now every day, and it looks beautiful.  Shiny, smooth, and groomed.  No more rat&#x27;s nests, no more arguing for the possibility of a shorter style, no more morning drama.)</li>
            <li> I ordered from Amazon based on reviews; however, I would have been just as happy to get a brush at Wal-Mart or Target. It is okay...just nothing spectacular.</li>
