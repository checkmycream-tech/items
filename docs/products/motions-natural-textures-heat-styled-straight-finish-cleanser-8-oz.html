    <ol>
            <li>it&#x27;s best condition.</li>
            <li>Followed up with the leave in conditioner and helped my hair look and smell great!</li>
            <li>This is an especially good product if you use a flatiron a lot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy I purchased this!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Motions is an excellent line of hair care.</li>
            <li>Excellent, but needs some work</li>
            <li>Love this product!!!</li>
            <li>This cleanser works great on straightened hair and helps keep it in manageable condition.</li>
            <li>I can sleep on them and they still look great.</li>
            <li>It smells great like all of the Motions line.</li>
            <li>For anyone who has curly hair this is a great product and one</li>
            <li>This product is a great in-between formula.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>shampoo has a pleasant fragrance, but virtually no lather.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that problem, this is a good product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this cleanser, it smells good</li>
            <li>So this is good for thicker hair types.</li>
            <li>I guess this is a good thing</li>
            <li>The tubes are fairly large.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a problem with shampoos drying my hair, but this did a good job.  </li>
            <li>They make really good products, and this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li>This good smelling product feel like it wraps moisture around your hair.</li>
            <li>Beyond that, I didn&#x27;t see any lingering positives that I would&#x27;ve liked to have seen.</li>
            <li>It was also smoother to the touch, which was nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice scent which is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>This cleanser smells nice.  </li>
            <li>I felt like it didn&#x27;t leave my hair as moisturized as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you will love!</li>
            <li>The Motions line of products, so far, has been the best and this cleanser is no exception.  </li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;ve been trying to find the best shampoos and conditioners in order to keep my natural hair strong and manageable.  </li>
            <li>But I tried using it differently and it was awesome.</li>
            <li>Then magic happens.</li>
            <li>The curls are so healthy and bouncy</li>
            <li>But this is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It sort of worked in the sense that my hair felt smooth and it felt nice coming out of the shower on days where I&#x27;d otherwise not rinse my mane.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t always sure that I&#x27;d gotten everything washed</li>
            <li>price is outstanding for the amount of product you get.</li>
            <li>It left the hair tamed, flowing, and wonderful!  </li>
            <li>cleanser looks and feels more like conditioner.</li>
            <li>Straight hair with NO PERMANENT CHEMICALS!!!!  </li>
            <li>but it made me think my hair wasn&#x27;t getting very clean.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt very clean after use, but it was also quite tangled afterward.</li>
            <li>I rated Motions Straight finish cleanser 4 stars because it does contain some good ingredients like PARKII (SHEA) BUTTE &amp; HYDROLYZED KERATIN.</li>
            <li>It suds good without much effort.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth paying for a product that keeps your hair looking nice for days at a time, rather than a product that requires you to intensively style every day.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t lather much, but I felt that it did a good job cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li>It cleans hair, but doesn&#x27;t have any kind of elegant scent or texture, and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling like I&#x27;d done much cleansing, either.</li>
            <li>Using a good leave-in conditioner afterwards is highly recommended for keeping your hair in</li>
            <li>This seems like a very nice cleanser, it does a good job without being excessively harsh.</li>
            <li>Motions Straight Finish Cleanser in this 8 ounce size is a great value at this price and a product that does exactly what you want it to.</li>
            <li>and it was fine for me.  </li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Motions products and the Motions Straight Finish Cleanser is really a good product for getting hair really clean and leaving my hair great looking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really loving the Motions Straight Finish</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s the conditioner that is really important</li>
            <li>It lathered up nicely and felt rich and very moisturizing in my hair</li>
            <li>This hair product is actually very effective, especially on African-American hair.</li>
            <li>I originally gave this product 2 stars.</li>
            <li>but then it didn&#x27;t rinse cleanly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s light on the lather, which is actually a good thing (sudsing doesn&#x27;t actually do anything to clean hair),</li>
            <li>I have no problems with this scent - it just smells clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I can keep from touching my hair (its so so so soft) my hair dries in gorgeous soft waves and curls.</li>
            <li>Once you use the Motions Straight finish you will be glad that you brought it.</li>
            <li>If you squeeze, you will quickly have a handful of shampoo in your hand.</li>
            <li>Using this with other Motions products, you can achieve nice smooth straight hair like the salons are able to get.</li>
            <li>and I would say that they are worth a try.</li>
            <li>hair felt soft, smooth and clean after one use.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant fragrance, though it could stand to be toned down a bit.</li>
            <li>right? -</li>
            <li>It just wasn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair Natural and this products cleans the hair and scalp while leaving the hair soft and smooth while leaving the curl even more manageable..</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using this product (along with the conditioner) for the last several weeks and hair is noticeably smoother, smells great with no adverse affects.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a gentle, nonfoamy, mild shampoo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my one Asian daughter and two African daughters, though, this is great.</li>
            <li>and I found that my hair looked very nicely styled after it air dried!  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed with this shampoo is how runny it is.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve given four stars to</li>
            <li>I enjoy my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>The Motions Straight Finish Cleanser is, as its name states, a mild cleanser as opposed to a real shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve mentioned in other reviews of Motions products, the fragrance is amazing.</li>
            <li>I will say to my ladies that are natural that its not curly girl friendly...</li>
            <li>But my scalp just didn&#x27;t feel clean, so eventually I started alternating this with another shampoo, and after a while I phased this out completely.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser is quite thick and smells pleasant.</li>
            <li>and this certainly helped with that.</li>
            <li>First, let me be clear: the Motions product line is NOT for most white folks.</li>
            <li>straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is light and it has a very low amount of lather.  </li>
            <li>Works very well with the Conditioner and Finish.</li>
            <li>When I heard that this was a rehydrating shampoo, I decided to give it a shot, especially if it could help smooth and prep my hair for straightening.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the Motions Straight Finish Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Those looking for a gentle wave in their hair will like this product, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleanser really cleans my hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s reasonably priced and works reasonably well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different methods since I went natural to try and straighten my hair without chemicals and nothing worked for me.</li>
            <li>Her curls  also dried nicely.</li>
            <li>I have to say that it left my hair clean.</li>
            <li>But, for those of you who hate overpowering or strong scents in their beauty products, this sulfate-free cleanser might be ideal for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding I am pretty sensitive to strong scents, especially in the early AM.  </li>
            <li>used only the cleanser a few times, without the leave in conditioner or the sealer (both also good products)</li>
            <li>The result is, again, very soft, very fragrant, manageable</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m white, but my hair is more coarse than most, so I sometimes use a teeny bit of this to tame my hair, but it was really designed for ethnic hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Original dumb review-&lt;br /&gt;I have loved almost all the Motions products I have tried.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick shampoo</li>
            <li>Not as harsh as a shampoo but better at getting dirt and buildup out than conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first wash after I used this product, my hair actually remained at a manageable state, whereas before, when I would wash my hair, I had to use detangler.</li>
            <li>After using the Motions Straight Finish Cleanser my hair was not only soft to the touch but also very manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair tends to dry out in the heat and since this is a heat activated product, I hoped for some success.</li>
            <li>Unless your hair is very dry, this cleanser may not leave your hair feeling as clean and fresh as other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of the nice things is it doesn&#x27;t feel like it strips all of the natural oils out of the hair, which makes following up with the flat iron less damaging.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is a bit thin, and I didn&#x27;t find it all that amazing to use.</li>
            <li>I really hope Motions will keep this around as an alternative for those of us who refuse to go back to chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can&#x27;t keep this in your hair and skip shampooing your hair the next day, it makes your hair very sticky (unlike Nexxus and Redken</li>
            <li>I was surprised.  </li>
            <li>I have color treated natural hair (the relaxer is growing out).</li>
            <li>The products seems to really work well when it comes to doing heat related things with your hair.</li>
            <li>product is rich and creamy with little to no smell.</li>
            <li>When I used the whole 3 step process, cleanser, conditioner, and sealer and them flat ironed my hair, I could not believe the results.</li>
            <li>But over the years I felt relaxers weakened my hair, especially as I got older.  </li>
            <li>Too bad I cannot find this product in my local stores, but I am glad I was able to get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>After a long day ,my hair is very sweaty .</li>
            <li>Before using Motions Heat Styled, my hair would be straight for about 20 mins before it would revert back to a big fro.  </li>
            <li>A little bit of this product goes a long way for my fine,</li>
            <li>It really works well if you want to flat iron your hair properly.  </li>
            <li>I conditioned my hair with this after shampooing it and it had a decent effect, didn&#x27;t straighten it out entirely but helped immensely especially with the frizzing.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t using anywhere near enough.</li>
            <li>I distribute this through my hair being careful not to get much at the roots.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that expensive, but also not that effective.</li>
            <li>After using it, my hair feels light, unburdened by heavy creme as is sometimes the case with other foamy</li>
            <li>Then I comb my hair straight down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pretty hard on Motions products because they cater to women with natural hair</li>
            <li>I normally co-wash and clarify every other month.</li>
            <li>Not great, but fine.  </li>
            <li>My hair comes out shiny and manageable and ready to be styled with relative ease and little to no tangles.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> When I heard that this was a rehydrating shampoo, I decided to give it a shot, especially if it could help smooth and prep my hair for straightening.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the Motions Straight Finish Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Those looking for a gentle wave in their hair will like this product, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleanser really cleans my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s reasonably priced and works reasonably well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different methods since I went natural to try and straighten my hair without chemicals and nothing worked for me.</li>
            <li> Her curls  also dried nicely.</li>
            <li> I have to say that it left my hair clean.</li>
            <li> But, for those of you who hate overpowering or strong scents in their beauty products, this sulfate-free cleanser might be ideal for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding I am pretty sensitive to strong scents, especially in the early AM.  </li>
            <li> used only the cleanser a few times, without the leave in conditioner or the sealer (both also good products)</li>
            <li> The result is, again, very soft, very fragrant, manageable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white, but my hair is more coarse than most, so I sometimes use a teeny bit of this to tame my hair, but it was really designed for ethnic hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Original dumb review-&lt;br /&gt;I have loved almost all the Motions products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick shampoo</li>
            <li> Not as harsh as a shampoo but better at getting dirt and buildup out than conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first wash after I used this product, my hair actually remained at a manageable state, whereas before, when I would wash my hair, I had to use detangler.</li>
            <li> After using the Motions Straight Finish Cleanser my hair was not only soft to the touch but also very manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to dry out in the heat and since this is a heat activated product, I hoped for some success.</li>
            <li> Unless your hair is very dry, this cleanser may not leave your hair feeling as clean and fresh as other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of the nice things is it doesn&#x27;t feel like it strips all of the natural oils out of the hair, which makes following up with the flat iron less damaging.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a bit thin, and I didn&#x27;t find it all that amazing to use.</li>
            <li> I really hope Motions will keep this around as an alternative for those of us who refuse to go back to chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can&#x27;t keep this in your hair and skip shampooing your hair the next day, it makes your hair very sticky (unlike Nexxus and Redken</li>
            <li> I was surprised.  </li>
            <li> I have color treated natural hair (the relaxer is growing out).</li>
            <li> The products seems to really work well when it comes to doing heat related things with your hair.</li>
            <li> product is rich and creamy with little to no smell.</li>
            <li> When I used the whole 3 step process, cleanser, conditioner, and sealer and them flat ironed my hair, I could not believe the results.</li>
            <li> But over the years I felt relaxers weakened my hair, especially as I got older.  </li>
            <li> Too bad I cannot find this product in my local stores, but I am glad I was able to get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> After a long day ,my hair is very sweaty .</li>
            <li> Before using Motions Heat Styled, my hair would be straight for about 20 mins before it would revert back to a big fro.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of this product goes a long way for my fine,</li>
            <li> It really works well if you want to flat iron your hair properly.  </li>
            <li> I conditioned my hair with this after shampooing it and it had a decent effect, didn&#x27;t straighten it out entirely but helped immensely especially with the frizzing.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t using anywhere near enough.</li>
            <li> I distribute this through my hair being careful not to get much at the roots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that expensive, but also not that effective.</li>
            <li> After using it, my hair feels light, unburdened by heavy creme as is sometimes the case with other foamy</li>
            <li> Then I comb my hair straight down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty hard on Motions products because they cater to women with natural hair</li>
            <li> I normally co-wash and clarify every other month.</li>
            <li> Not great, but fine.  </li>
            <li> My hair comes out shiny and manageable and ready to be styled with relative ease and little to no tangles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it really did all that much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I re-read the instructions and flat</li>
            <li> so it doesnt last long</li>
            <li> several weeks, I did notice that my hair tended to curl less - on the curly spectrum it was definitely moving into \\&quot;sorta wavy\\&quot; territory.  </li>
            <li> I blot dry with a towel.</li>
            <li> and so thats the only down fall for this</li>
            <li> It left my hair tacky and a little sticky.</li>
            <li> It worked, but only for a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This seems like a very nice cleanser, it does a good job without being excessively harsh. It has a pleasant fragrance, though it could stand to be toned down a bit. This cleanser works great on straightened hair and helps keep it in manageable condition. One of the nice things is it doesn&#x27;t feel like it strips all of the natural oils out of the hair, which makes following up with the flat iron less damaging. Using a good leave-in conditioner afterwards is highly recommended for keeping your hair in it&#x27;s best condition.</li>
            <li> I originally gave this product 2 stars. But I tried using it differently and it was awesome. I get lots of shampoos and conditioners to try. But I came back and bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the shampoo and then rinse with cold water. Lots of rinsing. I blot dry with a towel. Then I use the matching leave in conditioner. I wasn&#x27;t using anywhere near enough. Now I use a squirt a little bigger than a half dollar. I distribute this through my hair being careful not to get much at the roots. Then I comb my hair straight down. Then magic happens. If I can keep from touching my hair (its so so so soft) my hair dries in gorgeous soft waves and curls. I do nothing. The curls are so healthy and bouncy I can sleep on them and they still look great. My hair is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original dumb review-&lt;br /&gt;I have loved almost all the Motions products I have tried. We use them daily at this house. But this is not my favorite. It smells great like all of the Motions line. It lathered up nicely and felt rich and very moisturizing in my hair but then it didn&#x27;t rinse cleanly. It left my hair tacky and a little sticky. That promotes snarls and that is the last thing I want.</li>
            <li> Motions Straight Finish Cleanser in this 8 ounce size is a great value at this price and a product that does exactly what you want it to.</li>
            <li> I have coarse hair, so I thought that I&#x27;d give this a try to see if it could tame my mane. My hair tends to dry out in the heat and since this is a heat activated product, I hoped for some success. I&#x27;m not sure if it really did all that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sort of worked in the sense that my hair felt smooth and it felt nice coming out of the shower on days where I&#x27;d otherwise not rinse my mane. Beyond that, I didn&#x27;t see any lingering positives that I would&#x27;ve liked to have seen. It worked, but only for a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People with thicker or coarser hair might see things differently. I wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to purchase this product. It&#x27;s not that expensive, but also not that effective.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed with this shampoo is how runny it is. I expect a thicker product when using a tube type container like the one this comes in. You usually squeeze out products that come in a tube. This product is so runny it literally pours out. If you squeeze, you will quickly have a handful of shampoo in your hand. They should have either made this product thicker or put it in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that problem, this is a good product. The shampoo cleanses well. It has a very subtle scent.&lt;br /&gt;I did not really feel that it moisturized my hair, but at least it did not dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cleanser, it smells good and I like how it felt on my hair and scalp. When I used the whole 3 step process, cleanser, conditioner, and sealer and them flat ironed my hair, I could not believe the results. My hair does NOT retain heat. I have tried so many different methods since I went natural to try and straighten my hair without chemicals and nothing worked for me. Before using Motions Heat Styled, my hair would be straight for about 20 mins before it would revert back to a big fro.  The first wash after I used this product, my hair actually remained at a manageable state, whereas before, when I would wash my hair, I had to use detangler. Too bad I cannot find this product in my local stores, but I am glad I was able to get it through Amazon. I really hope Motions will keep this around as an alternative for those of us who refuse to go back to chemically treated hair. Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I rated Motions Straight finish cleanser 4 stars because it does contain some good ingredients like PARKII (SHEA) BUTTE &amp; HYDROLYZED KERATIN. A little bit of this product goes a long way for my fine, straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not give it 5 stars because some of the ingredients are questionable? EG-14M, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, SODIUM LAURATE, SODIUM ISETHIONATE, STEARIC ACID, TALLOW ACID OR PALMITIC ACID, ETIDRONIC ACID, TETRASODIUM EDTA, DMDM HYDANTOIN, IODOPROPYNYL BUTYLCARBAMATE, METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE, BUTYLPHENYL METHYLPROPIONAL, HEXYL CINNAMA.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this shampoo/ It left my hair feeling as though I washed it in hard water. I also found when detangling my hair that the comb stuck slightly, when it normally glides through my thin, tight curls. This shampoo did work on my daughter.She has 4A hair, very tight, kinky, thick curls. It actually helped make it easier to detangle her otherwise hard to comb through hair. Her curls  also dried nicely. So this is good for thicker hair types.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this product (along with the conditioner) for the last several weeks and hair is noticeably smoother, smells great with no adverse affects. Works as promised. 4 stars because of the cost. It&#x27;s pretty expensive compared to other products that seem to work just as well that you can get at any retailer.</li>
            <li> The Motions Straight Finish Cleanser is, as its name states, a mild cleanser as opposed to a real shampoo.  The scent is light and it has a very low amount of lather.  It does leave your hair moisturized since it has petrolatum, oils, and shea butter.  Unfortunately it makes my hair look frizzy if I don&#x27;t follow up with the other products in the line such the leave in conditioner and the sealer.</li>
            <li> After using the Motions Straight Finish Cleanser my hair was not only soft to the touch but also very manageable. For anyone who has curly hair this is a great product and one I&#x27;m sure you will love!</li>
            <li> Once you use the Motions Straight finish you will be glad that you brought it. I have to say that it left my hair clean. After a long day ,my hair is very sweaty . This cleans the hair as well as takes out the sweat. This worked wonders on my thin curly ethnic hair. I can get the style that I want and the shine all by using Motions. A little bit goes a very long way.This will last for awhile.</li>
            <li> I will say to my ladies that are natural that its not curly girl friendly... but I will say that it does gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I conditioned my hair with this after shampooing it and it had a decent effect, didn&#x27;t straighten it out entirely but helped immensely especially with the frizzing.  Followed up with the leave in conditioner and helped my hair look and smell great!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Motions products and the Motions Straight Finish Cleanser is really a good product for getting hair really clean and leaving my hair great looking. I wear my hair Natural and this products cleans the hair and scalp while leaving the hair soft and smooth while leaving the curl even more manageable.. Works very well with the Conditioner and Finish.</li>
            <li> I am not an African American woman, but I do have thick, wavy-to-curly hair that is often in needs of moisture.  When I heard that this was a rehydrating shampoo, I decided to give it a shot, especially if it could help smooth and prep my hair for straightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has a pleasant fragrance, but virtually no lather.  I guess this is a good thing - hopefully there&#x27;s no lather because this is so jam-packed with oils and butters for my hair, right? - but it made me think my hair wasn&#x27;t getting very clean.  I wasn&#x27;t always sure that I&#x27;d gotten everything washed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over several weeks, I did notice that my hair tended to curl less - on the curly spectrum it was definitely moving into \\&quot;sorta wavy\\&quot; territory.  It was also smoother to the touch, which was nice.  But my scalp just didn&#x27;t feel clean, so eventually I started alternating this with another shampoo, and after a while I phased this out completely.  It just wasn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
            <li> Helps me detangle my wet, knotty hair in the shower. I like to run a comb through while I&#x27;m in the shower and this certainly helped with that. In fact, there was little effort involved with the comb through after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve mentioned in other reviews of Motions products, the fragrance is amazing. This cleanser, in combination with the conditioner, makes my hair almost (almost) not need the flatiron. My hair comes out shiny and manageable and ready to be styled with relative ease and little to no tangles. This is an especially good product if you use a flatiron a lot. The result is, again, very soft, very fragrant, manageable hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is outstanding for the amount of product you get. The tubes are fairly large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li> This hair product is actually very effective, especially on African-American hair. It left the hair tamed, flowing, and wonderful!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I TOTALLY DIDN&#x27;T expect this product to work!  Especially on my hair type!  I used the entire system.  Shampoo, conditioner and oil.  I was a little concerned because my hair was still a little curly on the ends.  I re-read the instructions and flat ironed my hair.........Joila!!!!!  Straight hair with NO PERMANENT CHEMICALS!!!!  I&#x27;m very happy I purchased this!!  I highlt recommend women try this product!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a bit thin, and I didn&#x27;t find it all that amazing to use. It cleans hair, but doesn&#x27;t have any kind of elegant scent or texture, and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling like I&#x27;d done much cleansing, either. My hair felt a bit heavy and limp, somehow, after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light on the lather, which is actually a good thing (sudsing doesn&#x27;t actually do anything to clean hair), but since I&#x27;m used to lather, it did feel a bit odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used the conditioner and oil in this line, and none of these products left me impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I have dark brown Causasian hair of medium texture and thickness. I don&#x27;t think my hair is the target market for what this product is about.</li>
            <li> I like the Motions Straight Finish Cleanser.  It suds good without much effort.  It cut through any grime and product residue that you might have without making your hair feel stripped.  I have a problem with shampoos drying my hair, but this did a good job.  I did use it with the Motions leave in conditioner and sealer. All together they worked well and I would say that they are worth a try.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this is just marketed to African-Americans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Asian (Indian), and it was fine for me.  Not great, but fine.  This product adds a curl to hair, which I personally find very unpleasant, as I mostly like to straighten my hair.  Those looking for a gentle wave in their hair will like this product, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t keep this in your hair and skip shampooing your hair the next day, it makes your hair very sticky (unlike Nexxus and Redken products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;d give this product a pass, I didn&#x27;t like the feel of my hair the next day and to me it&#x27;s worth paying for a product that keeps your hair looking nice for days at a time, rather than a product that requires you to intensively style every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving the Motions Straight Finish products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cleanser really cleans my hair.  It&#x27;s a little on the runny side so I&#x27;ve learned to tip the container backwards before I open it.  If I don&#x27;t do that, it tends to spills out without my even having to squeeze the bottle and I ended up wasting some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice scent which is not overpowering.  I&#x27;m finding I am pretty sensitive to strong scents, especially in the early AM.  I have no problems with this scent - it just smells clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used only the cleanser a few times, without the leave in conditioner or the sealer (both also good products) and I found that my hair looked very nicely styled after it air dried!  I was surprised.  The cleanser was enough to keep a lot of my frizz away, all on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty hard on Motions products because they cater to women with natural hair and I need them to come correct. This is the first product I&#x27;ve given four stars to and it would have been five if the scent had been stronger. But, for those of you who hate overpowering or strong scents in their beauty products, this sulfate-free cleanser might be ideal for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt soft, smooth and clean after one use. I normally co-wash and clarify every other month. This product is a great in-between formula. Not as harsh as a shampoo but better at getting dirt and buildup out than conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is rich and creamy with little to no smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shampoo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a gentle, nonfoamy, mild shampoo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me it is indistinguishable from John Frieda products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the conditioner that is really important</li>
            <li> the container is really small so it doesnt last long and so thats the only down fall for this they don&#x27;t seem to sell larger ones. or in stores for some odd reason so i order it on here</li>
            <li> Unless your hair is very dry, this cleanser may not leave your hair feeling as clean and fresh as other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Motions is an excellent line of hair care. This shampoo works for some and not for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser looks and feels more like conditioner. It&#x27;s not thick shampoo texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several weeks of using it, I realize it doesn&#x27;t work for my hair type. My hair felt weighted down and heavy.</li>
            <li> This cleanser smells nice.  Using this with other Motions products, you can achieve nice smooth straight hair like the salons are able to get. Also you do not need to use a lot of this product because it lathers well.  I don&#x27;t use a chemical straightener in my hair so using this product line allows me to achieve the same results.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is quite thick and smells pleasant. It didn&#x27;t lather much, but I felt that it did a good job cleaning my hair. My hair felt very clean after use, but it was also quite tangled afterward. I felt like it didn&#x27;t leave my hair as moisturized as I would have liked. I have color treated natural hair (the relaxer is growing out).</li>
            <li> First, let me be clear: the Motions product line is NOT for most white folks. I&#x27;m white, but my hair is more coarse than most, so I sometimes use a teeny bit of this to tame my hair, but it was really designed for ethnic hair care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my one Asian daughter and two African daughters, though, this is great. I also use it sometimes for my African son.</li>
            <li> They make really good products, and this one is no exception.  It really works well if you want to flat iron your hair properly.  The products seems to really work well when it comes to doing heat related things with your hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent, but needs some work</li>
            <li> I enjoy my natural hair.  For years I went to a salon and had my hair relaxed.  But over the years I felt relaxers weakened my hair, especially as I got older.  So six years ago I stopped having it relaxed.  Since then I&#x27;ve been trying to find the best shampoos and conditioners in order to keep my natural hair strong and manageable.  The Motions line of products, so far, has been the best and this cleanser is no exception.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> This good smelling product feel like it wraps moisture around your hair. After using it, my hair feels light, unburdened by heavy creme as is sometimes the case with other foamy cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s reasonably priced and works reasonably well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen it at the local Target too -- if anyone&#x27;s looking for it on the store shelves.</li>
