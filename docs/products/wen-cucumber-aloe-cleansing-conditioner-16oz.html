    <ol>
            <li>, awesome!  </li>
            <li>awesome stuff 5 stars</li>
            <li>My hair was wonderful while on vacation.  </li>
            <li>WEN works wonderfully as a leave-in conditioner that helps prevent tangles.</li>
            <li>Wen is AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li>&quot; hair however, my hair is in the best shape</li>
            <li>Amazon was perfect.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>It has a wonderful scent and gives me a cooling sensation.</li>
            <li>I tried WEN and in the beginning I thought it was the greatest hair product ever.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful shampoo!</li>
            <li>Of all the Wen cleansing scents I&#x27;ve tried, I like this one the best!  </li>
            <li>it works great!  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions perfectly &#x27;30-40 pumps, massage in for a minute, let stand 3-5 minutes, rinse thoroughly&#x27; and when I got out my hair had waxy build up.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really awesome.</li>
            <li>BUT...I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month, and I am VERY happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Perfect, fits.</li>
            <li>Amazon is your best bet in case you don&#x27;t want the pesky auto shipments and the charge that comes with them.</li>
            <li>Probably best I&#x27;ve found after 51 years!</li>
            <li>Best shampoo, not the best smell.  </li>
            <li>All of the WEN Products are totally excellent.  </li>

            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>It is beautiful I must admit.  </li>
            <li>My hair looked beautiful and shiny, and I already had really great hair.</li>
            <li>Great for my son&#x27;s cradle cap,</li>
            <li>Both are great.</li>
            <li>I missed that sale this year and found it on Amazon at a great price.</li>
            <li>It has helped the fly away look that my hair had.</li>
            <li>The product is great, but the container didn&#x27;t come with a pump.</li>
            <li>This really is a great conditioner.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s great, I just bought another bottle.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not so great.  </li>
            <li>Great formula if you have hair that tends to be greasy.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked better !!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!!</li>
            <li>I love wen!!</li>
            <li>Very pleasant fragrance, nice change from all the fruity products out there.  </li>
            <li>Amazing results!</li>
            <li>This is one of the best haircare products available!</li>
            <li>I am ordering more for sure!!!!</li>
            <li>So there you go--a happy wife means a happy me:)</li>
            <li>Smells so good but for me, I need suds.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had my hair looking so good in years.  </li>
            <li>GOOD CLEANSING CONDITIONER.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know my hair could look that good.  </li>
            <li>but it works  faily good on the rest of the hair.</li>
            <li>But, it never looks as good as when I leave the salon</li>
            <li>and she loved it.  </li>
            <li>and she loved it.  </li>
            <li>a good break from shampoo.</li>
            <li>Not as good as had hoped.  </li>
            <li>and I no longer have to straighten it, just a good blowdry</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t having the good hair days.   </li>
            <li>This was a gift to my sister, who had heard good things about</li>
            <li>I had used the WEN almond mint before and loved it.</li>
            <li>Am finally able to let my hair grow out and it is looking beautiful.</li>
            <li>my thin/fine hair is full, shiny, and looking the best it has ever looked in my life ..</li>
            <li>AND I&#x27;ve never seen her hair look more beautiful.</li>
            <li>The cucumber sloe is the best shapoo I have ever used , was glad to be able to order it from amazon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>WEN makes me happy:) I have been using it for three weeks</li>
            <li>Then, on top of that, I got fly aways now, which I have not ever had in my life.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the product was authentic, because neither bottle had the great effect on my hair.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s a great conditioner - and you don&#x27;t have to use as many pumps as they say -  </li>
            <li>Anyway, after my first use, I am very happy with the results!  </li>
            <li>I used to be able to floss with my hair - no joke!</li>
            <li>Love WEN!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It is so healthy and manageable, and no tangles!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>works great on fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Wen is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>, it is nice, but definately I will not go for it again.</li>
            <li>Nice smelling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However...the upside is that for a day or two after I use it, my hair DOES feel really nice.</li>
            <li>I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting anything.  </li>
            <li>I had nice hair before</li>
            <li>It had a nice smell.</li>
            <li>I use L&#x27;anza hair products which I really love, and try to get it shiny with the InStyler which does a good job.</li>
            <li>I will need to use a ton of additional styling products in order to have any kind of control over my hair.</li>
            <li>Nice smell....</li>
            <li>Honestly I think is just the smell</li>
            <li>You will need to add water after application so it will kind of lather upâ€¦..</li>
            <li>I thought it was a great product and was excited to try the cucumber mint variety.</li>
            <li>While the product was easy to use, smelled great and did eliminate the need for shampoo and conditioner, it did not make my hair look significantly better or shinier.  </li>
            <li>Pros: tangle free after washing it, no frizzy hair, looks healthy and smell great.  </li>
            <li>A lot softer, easy to handle and comb,and it smells good, too, without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it!  </li>
            <li>If this stuff gets better with use I&#x27;m in for some amazing hair experiences.</li>
            <li>I bought WEN in November, used it for a month, and loved the effect it had on my hair--shiny, smooth, manageable.</li>
            <li>directly from WEN, and it works great!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that gets oily</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and oily scalp.</li>
            <li>agree with many of the reviewer comments - the smell is very strong when you are applying it</li>
            <li>Follow the easy instructions, and enjoy how your hair feels!!  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this was great.  </li>
            <li>Worked great at first, then seemed to irritate scalp.</li>
            <li>Tons of flyaways, even though I used to have very smooth hair.</li>
            <li>smell is very settle, not the best one but not bad.</li>
            <li>When I combed through it and dried it, my hair felt great and best of all clean!</li>
            <li>If I use the Wen about every three to four days, it does make my hair feel healthy.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and silky and NOT frizzy!  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>but I have been using it for over two weeks and love it.</li>
            <li>After I apply it to all sections I apply a couple more pumps to the ends and then clip it up for the rest of my shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so enjoyable to use too.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching it and running my hands through it.</li>
            <li>ok..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works for some people but not my hair type.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>I love the product and have used it before.  </li>
            <li>top of it all, it did nothing to improve the smoothness or texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>Sincerely, Your biggest East Coast fan</li>
            <li>Perhaps if you already have healthy hair...</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>Everyone asks me how my hair looks so healthy now.</li>
            <li>Try it, you will love it. :)</li>
            <li>With that description of my hair, you can now imagine how \\&quot;more than normal\\&quot; hair loss that lasts over a year can affect your hair part, length and fullness.  </li>
            <li>I am now able to grow out my hair and it is not falling out by the hand fulls anymore.  </li>
            <li>After using the WEN cleansing conditioner for about 2-3 weeks, the condition of my hair is much better and the color has stayed truer too.  </li>
            <li>Ok, just got my cucumber aloe on March 5 , tried it today,</li>
            <li>its ok...</li>
            <li>I truly think Suave shampoo is a better product than this.</li>
            <li>Since I remembered three weeks ago that I had used Wen on my hair which is what made it so healthy</li>
            <li>absolutely LOVE Wen...</li>
            <li>my hair has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I will keep trying and hope it works better...</li>
            <li>Most people complain it leaves your hair greasy</li>
            <li>It does everything it claims and much more.  </li>
            <li>Also, you need to use the product more often ...</li>
            <li>I am glad I tried the cleansing conditioner again.</li>
            <li>Combing it through is important too!</li>
            <li>I love the Wen products - my husband now uses it as well.  </li>
            <li>I tried twice more just to see if I had messed up, but no each time my hair came out with grease and wax.</li>
            <li>5-10 pumps (more if you need) and put on the top part of your hair, massage in&lt;br</li>
            <li>rise thoroughly making sure you don&#x27;t feel anything in your hair&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they all got a good laugh.  </li>
            <li>They did say my hair looked better though</li>
            <li>Many times, thinking I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore</li>
            <li>It looks better now than it did when I had extensions.  </li>
            <li>I am sure this will vary from person to person.  </li>
            <li>but every time I washed my hair more hair would appear in my hands.</li>
            <li>I love Wen and what this product does for my hair, just love it.</li>
            <li>and I love this product.</li>
            <li>I usually love all Wen hair products.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting the best with all the mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, my hair hasn&#x27;t fallen out.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite but its ok.</li>
            <li>I love the mint volume spray, conditioner and leave in treatment.</li>
            <li>This product was just ok for me.</li>
            <li>Love Wen.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>WEN makes it look healthier and shinier and seems to give it more body.  </li>
            <li>My curls also revive much better day after day, so I&#x27;m wearing fewer pony tails and buns.  </li>
            <li>I have used it now three times and am in love ..</li>
            <li>though - more like 3-4.  </li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll use more.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work best if I use regular shampoo and then this.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>If your hair is thicker or longer you will need to use more product.</li>
            <li>If you go to the website it will give you more info and show more products.</li>
            <li>I also love this hair product and will order it from you again.&lt;br /&gt;Marlene</li>
            <li>The trick is to not think of this as shampoo but more like a &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; that you work through your scalp and hair.  </li>
            <li>I prefer a more floral smell.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li>I prefer the pomegranate one the most.  </li>
            <li>and that is much better.</li>
            <li>I do believe its better for my hair and its soothing when it touches the scalp</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hooked on Wen but since my hair isn&#x27;t greasy/oily anymore (another lifetime first!!!)</li>
            <li>Hair looked brighter and bouncier and very clean.  </li>
            <li>I just used the Wen Cucumber Aloe for the first time and yes my hair feels good.  </li>
            <li>I can say that if my hair style was loose and wavy, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>I have medium length oily hair (a lot of fine hair) and absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I like this product, it is rich and soothing, leaving a nice and comfortable feeling after using.</li>
            <li>For some reason, my scalp always gets itchy in the summer and this felt very cool.  </li>
            <li>nice fresh fragrance.  </li>
            <li>You have to get used to the no foaming thing at first, but after you do you&#x27;ll love how your hair feels!  </li>
            <li>Compared to the other Wen products not as impressed.</li>
            <li>Tends to make my hair overly oily...never smells or feels clean for more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li>I love that my hair still feels so clean, even without the suds.</li>
            <li>My hair is also breaking really easily now, and it never did that when I was using the Wen I got from QVC.  </li>
            <li>It now is much better conditioned, and feels clean, not oily.</li>
            <li>Wen is amazing; I&#x27;ve used MANY products over the years for my brittle and tempermental hair, including high end organic products and Wen beats them all!  </li>
            <li>Shine is like doll&#x27;s hair, and soooo strong now.  </li>
            <li>It would help get rid of the smell of the strong shampoos I have to use and not hurt</li>
            <li>where it&#x27;s close to the bottom of the list you wouldn&#x27;t think it would be that strong.  </li>
            <li>I thought Wen products were amazing when I first started to use it.</li>
            <li>The results I had with it were that the first 1-2 days my hair felt AMAZING.</li>
            <li>In fact I feel a bit funny because people kind of stare.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and has a wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is fine</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t fine</li>
            <li>My sister in law bought Wen and gave me the cucumber aloe cleansing conditioner because she didn&#x27;t have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Lavender and Mint for awhile but decided to try this because it is recommended for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that gets oily looking.</li>
            <li>I have fine oily hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, feel cool on application and my hair is soooo soft.</li>
            <li>This works fine for me.</li>
            <li>My baby fine hair literally melted after a botched coloring.  </li>
            <li>my hair is fine and touches my shoulders.</li>
            <li>I think that this product is just not designed for people with fine hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>bought this conditioner because I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>my fine limpless hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine how quickly I would go through a bottle using the recommended amount!  </li>
            <li>I am a professionally licensed hair dresser, I have access to the best stuff available but after getting sucked into a infomercial i wanted to try it, wen turned my high end purology shampoo and conditioner into the products that get stuck under the sink.</li>
            <li>Thanks Wen, I look forward to trying out more of your products!</li>
            <li>In fact, my hair feels BETTER than it did when I first got the keratin treatment done!  </li>
            <li>I can get the salon size (huge) of the Dove with a pump for $12 each at Sam&#x27;s Club (wholesale club) and it lasts 3-4 months.</li>
            <li>Now my huge jug is gone- something I&#x27;ve been looking forward to for a year.  </li>
            <li>and I was sold after the second great hair day.</li>
            <li>Since it was free I used what she gave me.  </li>
            <li>I used it again after 3 days and had the same great results.  </li>
            <li>I have always had to shampoo my hair daily, with the Cucumber Aloe line I can skip a day and my hair still looks great.</li>
            <li>I only use 6 or 8 and get these great results.</li>
            <li>Last year my hair was in great condition even though I did color and straighten it</li>
            <li>Its important people learn how to use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The extra pump as a leave-in conditioner is also a great idea.</li>
            <li>you see how detailed that is?</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have over-processed hair like mine and just want light conditioning, this will work for you.  </li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>It is a great conditioner for damaged hair but it didn&#x27;t rinse well and left an oily residue in my hair and my daughters.</li>
            <li>I enjoy WEN but will stick to one type, unless they give samples of others.</li>
            <li>I had to find one that fit from my lotion bottles.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>My hair is not as fabulous as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>What you really need to do is use your best judgment and just use enough to saturate the hair from root to tip.   </li>
            <li>but this was NOT a subtle change, it was striking!  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed WEN products, but am still trying to find the one that&#x27;s right for my hair.</li>
            <li>once i have blown it dry it comes out just beautiful ..</li>
            <li>Oh, and the great hair days continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>According to Chaz Dean, in one of his informercials, he said that cucumber aloe cleansing conditioner was specially design for fine hair because it has aloe.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Plus, it is pretty pricey, I would expect to see more for this price.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference with my hair after the first wash - it felt softer and had more body.</li>
            <li>(normally you feel that kind of minty sensation on the scale or even the smell</li>
            <li>pretty sure it&#x27;s all about getting you to go through it faster</li>
            <li>Silky, curly, shiny, clean and conditioned.  </li>
            <li>was that it wouldn&#x27;t really clean my hair.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it gets clean at all.</li>
            <li>It comes out squeaky clean and just so shiny.  </li>
            <li>Smells so clean.  </li>
            <li>It does give you a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I find that the Wen C-C does a great job and my hair is no longer dry in the morning.  </li>
            <li>it was truly clean.  </li>
            <li>After washing with it, your scalp has a tingling clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>But it does leave a waxy buildup in your hair, and you have to use another shampoo to clean your hair.  </li>
            <li>But they all require using lots and for me I have to use another shampoo to clean wax out of hair.</li>
            <li>My hair does not feel clean.  </li>
            <li>Great product for dry hair and split ends.</li>
            <li>I had seen Chaz on QVC a couple of times, but never quite believed this stuff would get your hair clean.  </li>
            <li>My hair is more on the oily side, so I&#x27;m sure people with dry hair would probably like this product more.</li>
            <li>I had the stuff in for just about two minutes and my scalp was bright red.  </li>
            <li>I rinse it out in cool water but that is already a habit for me so no biggie.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about these products.  </li>
            <li>It smells so sweet and fruity.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t believe one product can work for everyone, but this one sure blew me away.</li>
            <li>It does leave my hair soft but kind of oily.  </li>
            <li>I had no idea what to attribute my hair loss to as I am only 25 and in good health.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I realized how cool Wen felt on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I used Wen for about 5 months and then quit since I was receiving too many bottles of the Cleansing Conditioner from the auto-shipment program while being charged when I don&#x27;t use as much as recommended and</li>
            <li>it really makes a difference :)</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel softer, but it really made it more greasy.   </li>
            <li>I would never be able to make my hair straight after using this as it&#x27;s just too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is nothing more than straight up conditioner.</li>
            <li>It gave my scalp a tingle which was unexpected but nice.</li>
            <li>good size rather than the one that comes with entire set.</li>
            <li>I loved the way it left my hair</li>
            <li>but I could tell a huge difference in the texture right away.</li>
            <li>I found using it every other day was great....</li>
            <li>Also, it takes a lot of time (not for a quick wash) and I have to do a lot of pumps and rub it into my sculp -</li>
            <li>It goes quickly.</li>
            <li>It gets used up quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I only bought the $40.00 bottle rather than wasting a greater amount of money.</li>
            <li>and she went through a bottle fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I spend less using Wen than I did with the multiple salon products and even if Wen would cost more, I would pay to continue to use Wen for my hair to be healthy and look great</li>
            <li>I am not a short-hair girl and look much better with longer hair and when my hair looks great, I feel great and hate feeling self-conscious about my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one I use these days, and I will more than likely not switch - great body, softness and shine.</li>
            <li>I really liked how it made my hair look and feel..just like other scents better..</li>
            <li>and I find that normal shampoo cleans my hair and scalp so much better.</li>
            <li>I tried using a normal or oily scalp shampoo and conditioning with WEN (avoiding contact with the scalp) and found that to work so much better.</li>
            <li>My color looks brassy, the ends are dry, it&#x27;s full of fly aways, and I am certain it will look greasy tomorrow.</li>
            <li>It was great on my hair, but the smell was a bit odd.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be going back for any more Keratin treatments!  </li>
            <li>This is the only scent of Wen that I use &amp; I Absolutly love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using WEN for about three weeks, but I already LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>It grew back healthy and strong.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine straight hair</li>
            <li>My very fine, straight (limp) hair now has more body and is in better shape.  </li>
            <li>Since the FAQs said more is more, I tried the next morning and used about 4 pumps more than the recommended 12 pumps on each of the four sections and my hair wasn&#x27;t oily, but it also wasn&#x27;t easier to comb through, wasn&#x27;t any softer or more managable than my normal shampoo and conditioner (Dove Daily Moisture).  </li>
            <li>I have seen so many products claim to make a huge difference in your hair but have yet to find one that actually backed it up, until now.</li>
            <li>Ever after 8 months after not using Wen my hair was not as vibrant and strong as it used to be.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seriously worth a try if you haven&#x27;t found anything else that works.</li>
            <li>worth the money...</li>
            <li>I really liked the idea of a sulfate-free wash because I have to wash my hair daily</li>
            <li>Does that make it worth purchasing?</li>
            <li>However, it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>I of course heard about Wen, but didn&#x27;t ever intend to buy it because I couldn&#x27;t see how it was worth the price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell</li>
            <li>but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>You have to stop using it for a couple of weeks to be able to color your hair light blonde.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>My bottle clearly states using &amp;#34;10 to 15 pumps more if hair is longer&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>After researching this product more I found that there was a class action lawsuit against them for hair loss please do the research your self before ordering this product I stopped using this almost a year ago</li>
            <li>it was my favorite so far</li>
            <li>I will say that I love the moisture that WEN gives my hair when I style it or even leave it naturally wavy</li>
            <li>I read all of the reviews here before purchasing but figured that it was worth a shot -</li>
            <li>I purchased the Sweet Almond Mint scent first (which is supposed to be for all hair types).</li>
            <li>I have used WEN products for nearly a year and love them all.  </li>
            <li>favorite is the orange blossom so far.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use anything else - you will have to use a monthly clairiying shampoo to keep it all fresh.</li>
            <li>Back to loving Wen.</li>
            <li>You will kind of have to experiment to see what the proper amount of water is.</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and flowery.</li>
            <li>it felt soft, and light, and clean.</li>
            <li>Just light and soft and clean with a lot of volume.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like it as much as the original mint.</li>
            <li>ago(the reason I am on Amazon right now is because I have to reorder my Wen).</li>
            <li>The bottom line is that I could not be happier with the condition of my hair right now.</li>
            <li>Once you find the right formula for your hair type you will like it.</li>
            <li>5-10 pumps on the right side</li>
            <li>I dove right in and bought the GALLON size from them which has lasted me over a year.  </li>
            <li>Just had to find the right one for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The Cucumber Aloe has a nice fragrance, it washes out easily, and I like the way my hair feels silky soft even the next day.</li>
            <li>but it leaves my hair feeling very soft and clean and full of volume.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference in my hair being softer and smoother but you have to use a very large amount.  </li>
            <li>I remain on the hunt for a good shampoo that would not make me loose so much hair.</li>
            <li>I have bright pink/magenta and black hair</li>
            <li>As many reviewers have said, it does not take near as much product as the directions recommend.  </li>
            <li>i use only about six (6) pumps and when rinsing this product off my hair is truly smooth and tangle free ..</li>
            <li>March 8, it is very nice, but on the back, the 3rd and 4th listed ingredient is CETYL ALCOHOL AND CETEARYL ALCOHOL.</li>
            <li>rinsed very very well - sometimes even sticking head under bathtub</li>
            <li>I have oily fine (naturally) curly hair and every shampoo I&#x27;ve used seemed to require me to use some type of gel as well as a blow dryer</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly fine hair and Wen</li>
            <li>I used this shampoo according to directions (which I thought were lacking) and it was nice the first few times but after 2 weeks I felt like my hair wasn&#x27;t staying clean</li>
            <li>I would be interested to see if others find this strategy to give the benefits of this novel shampoo formulation without the downsides of hair loss.</li>
            <li>that first usage was 1/5 of the 16 ounce bottle) to the letter, combed it through with a widetoothed comb and rinsed and rinsed and rinsed with cool/warm water</li>
            <li>I love what it does for my hair, especially as a leave in conditioner on the ends.</li>
            <li>but I did do my research first.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, though, I did not have the best experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would recommend trying to get a week&#x27;s worth of samples of this before buying, as it seems like the experiences really do vary from person to person.</li>
            <li>It left my hair with a gross-feeling build-up and, what upset me even more</li>
            <li>This is my first time writing an online review for a product</li>
            <li>but I definitely noticed A LOT more hair coming out in the shower, on my hairbrush, on my clothes, all over my house and car.</li>
            <li>I am fully aware that I will never have \\&quot;Goldielocks\\</li>
            <li>I have healthy, uncolored, short hair.</li>
            <li>Now I have both tons of flyaways for the first time in my life, and I cannot color my hair.</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>When I first tried WEN</li>
            <li>I saw the difference in my hair with the first use.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried Wen Cleansing Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have to say that as I use Wen more and more, I am starting to not like traditional shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I can really feel a difference in my hair when I use Wen!</li>
            <li>any extra pumps on the bottom or top, just fill in</li>
            <li>I only wash my hair with WEN and it is not greasy, no waxy build up and my hair looks really healthy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m back for more.  </li>
            <li>First time in my almost 50 years I can say that.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather actually wash my hair than just add more gunk to it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking my hair now, which is quite a statement to make!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking about trying this product, I would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the WEN products, especially the Cucumber Aloe.  </li>
            <li>I have it makes my hair so silky smooth and soft</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>it actually made my hair more oily and grease.</li>
            <li>We all love it so much because it makes our hair soft and it really looks fuller.  </li>
            <li>Very shipping just as it looks in the picture!</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how it goes as I use this first bottle.      </li>
            <li>The company is fully aware of these many cases, and still seems to peddle their &amp;#34;varnish remover&amp;#34; wherever possible.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instruction exactly.  </li>
            <li>The first time I just this</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know, perhaps the instructions were for someone interested in shampooing their horse?</li>
            <li>It helped much more than the traditional shampoos.</li>
            <li>your hair is dry, damaged, brittle or needs help and you want it to be healthy, Wen is definitely worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>really think they should have a disclaimer on products like this that have a strong chemical in them for people who have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten relaxers and Keratin treatments (which I loved) all in an effort to \\&quot;tame the frizz\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>From the first my hair was soft and clean with tons of volume.</li>
            <li>Natural stuff, feels &amp; smells fresh!</li>
            <li>When rinsing, it&#x27;s so soft and squeaky clean, NOT tangled.  </li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t have to use nearly the suggested amount on the bottle to clean it</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Then, I started to notice my light blonde hair changing to golden, then brassy to the point that the darker roots turned almost brassy orange.</li>
            <li>and I feel better about using 2 products, as opposed to four or five different products that I had to use to get my hair somewhat straight, but</li>
            <li>hair is still wet as I write this, but I believe the product to be quite good at cleaning and my hair feels quite soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite scent, but the formula works really well for my type of hair - a little oily and fine.</li>
            <li>I heard such great things about this cleansing conditioner, so I spent this much money, used it 3 times and each time I used it, my hair came out in wads.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product in order to supplement a QVC auto-shipment because I tend to go through a bottle of Wen pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>have been using this stuff for so long , love it</li>
            <li>This product surprised me by really, truly getting my hair clean but still leaving the ends conditioned.  </li>
            <li>are coming back soft and bouncy!!&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>but honestly it was less work than using a separate shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting to see much after the first use</li>
            <li>After using hair vitamins and some oil treatments, I&#x27;ve got my shine back, but my hair is still not as strong as it used to be.  </li>
            <li>smelled good and it worked ok for first few times, but hair seemed greasy after a few washes.</li>
            <li>You have to wash your hair first because alone doesn&#x27;t make it clean enough, so</li>
            <li>but... my hair only feels clean the first day.</li>
            <li>However I do like it very much and so far it seems to be doing exactly as the infomercial states.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very medicinal smelling.  </li>
            <li>I really felt (after pouring over reveiws before I took the plunge and ordered the product) that I should also write a reveiw to help that person who is undecided to go ahead and take the plunge too.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too much of a coincidence</li>
            <li>It seems to really build up</li>
            <li>Chaz Dean should get real recognition for developing these products.  </li>
            <li>I toweled the ends gently and wrapped my hair in the towel.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot and just don&#x27;t think it does that much.</li>
            <li>I really like wen cleansing,,, My beutition notice the difference in my hair when she cut it..</li>
            <li>(after gently blow drying and finger</li>
            <li>Cleans hair very well but don&#x27;t believe there is any difference in my hair</li>
            <li>I really like how well it conditions my hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t enjoy the smell, it smells a bit medicine-y, so I would recommend a different one.</li>
            <li>I will recommend WEN to absolutely anyone.  </li>
            <li>Later that day I got a trim and the stylist told me how healthy my hair looked and how soft and asked how much I shampooed.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Wen Products.</li>
            <li>Wen is also really gentle on color</li>
            <li>The scent is very medicinal.</li>
            <li>but it was damaged from swimming and from coloring it light blonde.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t spend as much time straightening it repeatedly as I did before with the salon products and my hair doesn&#x27;t look damaged and brittle as it did two weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>This is not the real Wen.</li>
            <li>It does not smell like, look like, or feel like the real Wen.</li>
            <li>WHAT could be in the ingredients that cost so much....?.</li>
            <li>I really like the Wen products.  </li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>Purchasing my Wen from Amazon is fast</li>
            <li>Packaged well, arrived promptly, very cooling formula..nice for summer</li>
            <li>I have heard so much about WEN that I had to buy it.</li>
            <li>embrace your real hair</li>
            <li>Really like Wen Products.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t believe I have so much for a product that didn&#x27;t even work</li>
            <li>I use a lot because I have so much hair but follow the instructions</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not buying the whole 10 pumps to use.  </li>
            <li>That said, I used 5 pumps, which still felt like I was wasting it, and really like how it felt on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>You have to use so much of the product.</li>
            <li>and it really makes it look fuller and thinker.</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>She has been using it since December 2012, and it has really helped her psoriasis</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need to use as much as they suggested.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really care that it does not sudz up.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fantastic on my kids&#x27; hair, especially after a day of sweating or swimming.  </li>
            <li>rinse rinse really well . . .</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a foaming action that gives you a similar effect, but it&#x27;s better for your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>I only use 4 pumps in each section of hair (top, bottom, left, right) and leave it in for 10 min.</li>
            <li>The aloe helps fine hair by adding volume so it doesn&#x27;t lay flat.</li>
            <li>Also, I live in a hot and humid climate, and it still works well.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair so soft and smooth, and actually reduces the time it takes to get ready in the morning!</li>
            <li>One bottle of WEN replaces both other products and it does a better job.</li>
            <li>I finally remembered that last year I had ordered Wen and had used the Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner (I don&#x27;t remember them having the Cucumber Aloe or Fig Cleansing Conditioners available at the time).  </li>
            <li>It may have been due to &amp;#34;coatings&amp;#34; but my uber healthy hair is there underneath.  </li>
            <li>I had the mint originally and if I order WEN again that will be the only one I will get.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been particularly fond of my hair, but I didn&#x27;t figure there was much I could do about it</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I am a long time user of Wen I do like the cucumber the best for the thin hair i Have.</li>
            <li>Im using  the cucumber aloe, I  section my hair into 4 sections, use 6-8 quick pumps for each section, I make sure to really focus on getting the product on my scalp and massage each section separately for at least a minute.</li>
            <li>I do think the price is high because I need to use alot more of the product due to the length of my hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but this specific one makes my hair AMAZING - not too oily, not too dry.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and it is easy to comb, also it gives extra volume.</li>
            <li>well.. the feeling while I was in the shower with this thing on my hair was different, I liked the way my hair felt in the shower, but as soon as you wash it off and dry your hair, there is no difference at all...</li>
            <li>My hair is a little longer than shoulder length and very fine, but beginning to thicken up (Postpartum hair loss).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how this 16 oz bottle will last a full 30 days..</li>
            <li>She became interested in Wen after someone suggested that she try it because it was all natural.  </li>
            <li>I massaged scalp and first 2&amp;#34; of hair near scalp with it and rinsed immediately and c)</li>
            <li>and I was able to wear it down again instead of having to hide a texture or oily problem.  </li>
            <li>I have very frizzy, dry hair and usually use another high-end brand of shampoo, but wanted to give WEN a try after seeing the informercials and hearing how great it</li>
            <li>Slowly it&#x27;s regaining its youth and best of all curls!!!My little locks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten blood tests to rule out thyroid and hormone problems, and I am healthy, not pregnant, etc.</li>
            <li>I honestly use regular shampoo on the bottom half of my hair and use Wen only the top half (mainly because this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap).</li>
            <li>My hair is healthier, and has more moisture and less breakage.</li>
            <li>I used half of each bottle to make sure I was giving the product a chance, but here are the differences</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an older person, have been coloring my hair for decades</li>
            <li>I tried many different variations in amount and hairsprays with similar results.  </li>
            <li>It will only make your hair super oily and gunked up feeling no matter</li>
            <li>, it really does leave your hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered the Fig Cleansing Conditioner since I&#x27;m anxious to try that next since it wasn&#x27;t available a year ago and want to see if it works even better than the Cucumber Aloe.  </li>
            <li>I am 42 years old, with very fine brown hair (just above my shoulders cut in a layered bob) that I have colored blonde.</li>
            <li>But the Methylisothiazolinone is highly toxic and could be correlated with shampoos that cause hair loss.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this stuff based on postivie reviews I read.  </li>
            <li>I have medium length hair, pretty fine, colored, and tends to get a little oily every 24 hrs.</li>
            <li>I use it for getting all the extras left by the other kind of shampoos.</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I found that you need to experiment with the quantity you use and be sure to completely wash it out of your hair, otherwise it does make my hair greasy after styling</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget, it is normal to lose 100-200 hairs a day, and brunettes have more hair than other natural colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once you apply and massage, add a little bit of water and the product seems more prevalent.  </li>
            <li>I decided to just blow dry my hair with no other products to better judge the results and seriously, WOW!</li>
            <li>My neighbor have me two big bottles of WEN for free because she said it broke her skin out, so I used it as a leave in, and sure enough, I tried to highlight my hair the other day, and it would not take at all.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other expensive shampoos and conditioners, so when you figure in trying other products, and the fact your hair looks great with WEN,  the time and cost are worth it!</li>
            <li>but it is not thick...</li>
            <li>If you really want hair that is soft and shiny and bouncey, this is the ticket.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft, but I don&#x27;t need as much as is recommended.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect but over all I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li>My hair is very shiny and soft and I could see immediately when I took the towel off my head to style it that there was a difference.    </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal frizzy self.  </li>
            <li>My hair has been falling out more than usual and my scalp has become very itchy and irritated.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll alternate between the two of them until the Wen is gone, but I don&#x27;t see this as worth the price.</li>
            <li>This product smells good and has decreased the amount of detangler that I require</li>
            <li>So much so, that there&#x27;s quite a few web sites that are more or less devoted to people&#x27;s justified criticisms and in some cases, horror stories of their experiences with WEN.  </li>
            <li>I have dry, thick, curly hair and this works so great on my hair.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m ready to blow dry, the comb goes right through, not one knot.  </li>
            <li>hair is super soft and shinier than usual, and it feels clean but a bit greasy.</li>
            <li>makes it friz free shiney and manageable without having to use any other products.</li>
            <li>I have wanted to get my hair back to being soft, healthy and where it will grow long again.  </li>
            <li>Chaz Dean also made a new \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; called Pomegranate.  </li>
            <li>It also stripped my hair color to such an extent that my grays not only came through, they actually seemed a more vibrant silver, forcing me to re-color my hair.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>I had tried it TWICE before in the past several years, but didn&#x27;t like the time and cost involved, but am very glad I tried it again.</li>
            <li>But right now I&#x27;m only using it once a week along with my old shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I feel lucky I only used this product for a few months (see original review below), and I figure the FDA investigation warrants me knocking this product from three stars to one.  </li>
            <li>The only one that didn&#x27;t smell so hot was Tea Tree.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thinning on top but about 3 inches past my shoulders in length.</li>
            <li>So, this was my first and my last purchase of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I use much less and achieve fine results.</li>
            <li>(their use half the pumps for the first wash and the other half for the second wash and half a pump for a leave in treatment) and my hair has never been more beautiful.</li>
            <li>Then I used a few more pumps for the ends and worked it through with my fingers first for a minute, then used a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li>At this time, many shampoos/conditioners made me itchy, but Wen was one of the only ones that did not and gave me long lasting results.</li>
            <li>This product has not only saved me money, but also cut my hair routine time in half since I don&#x27;t have many split ends anymore.</li>
            <li>Right away I noticed that it took less time to blow it dry, the color was brighter and it was so smooth, but not heavy or greasy looking at all.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it made it my feel greasy and heavy.  </li>
            <li>I saw a few comparable products that sell for quite a bit less - we may try those also and see what the difference is; but overall if you can spend the money your hair will look great and you will notice the difference.</li>
            <li>This product works great with smoothing out my hair, although its a little hard to get used to.</li>
            <li>Did not keep my hair clean as long as it says in the advertisements, Hair was actually heavier and looked oily after 6-8 hours.</li>
            <li>It is expensive but I have found that I can use about 2/3 of what they say (I have shoulder length thick but fine hair) and it still works great.</li>
            <li>Then, I tried getting the color out by coloring with a very light pale blonde color.</li>
            <li>I used TWO pumps, and even that was a little more than was necessary to completely treat my two- to three-inch length hair.</li>
            <li>There seems to be a bit too much hype and not enough performance for the price</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and creamy when you&#x27;re shampooing.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny</li>
            <li>Soft</li>
            <li>She said it was soft not frizzy and shinny...</li>
            <li>B003HFEGBY WEN Cucumber Aloe Cleansing Conditioner 16 oz]], followed the directions (wow-</li>
            <li>so it will last much longer.</li>
            <li>especially when you had to use so much etc.</li>
            <li>, it completely stripped my hair color after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>During the year of my intense hair loss, I definitely noticed my part getting wider and it made me devastated.</li>
            <li>I thought this is suppose to be all natural????</li>
            <li>When you add how much money I spent on various salon products, it was more than I would have spent on the Wen Cleansing Conditioner and the remoist cream</li>
            <li>It is shiny, looks healthier and isn&#x27;t frizzy and is soft.</li>
            <li>My hair wasn&#x27;t just soft</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft all the time now.</li>
            <li>, I really really like the Cucumber Aloe and just bought a bigger bottle</li>
            <li>I guess, given that it&#x27;s basically just a fancy 2-in-1 shampoo (which don&#x27;t moisturize nearly as well as stand-alone conditioners), it makes sense.  </li>
            <li>My hair has a natural wave to it.</li>
            <li>But, in my case, it&#x27;s almost TOO SOFT.</li>
            <li>the Cucumber Aloe works wonders, makes my curly hair soft &amp; manageable</li>
            <li>i am 62 yrs old but do not look or act my age; where has this product been all my life ????  </li>
            <li>After one application, the body increased by nearly 75%.</li>
            <li>This is a product I&#x27;ve used for years with complete satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>so I studied the instructions and even found a few videos on the net that gave more info.</li>
            <li>WEN products make my hair look thick and healthy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, having average size human male hands, I am not even certain I could fit 16-30 pumps of this product into my palm.</li>
            <li>I also liked the idea of less weighed down hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little strange because it doesn&#x27;t lather, but it doesn&#x27;t strip my color and my hair has stayed soft and healthy after repeated bleaching and coloring every 8 weeks for 3 1/2 years.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin, fine, curly hair, which tends toward being very dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I have medium length fine wavy hair that is usually lifeless.</li>
            <li>I looked up some of the ingredients in Wen&#x27;s products and then looked for other shampoos that had the same ingredients which were also getting reviews of significant hair loss.  </li>
            <li>I use much less than the recommended dose because, as I mentioned earlier, my hair is of fine texture and 1 Wen bottle has lasted me about 4 months.</li>
            <li>After I used the last bottle, I switched back to regular shampoo and conditioner thinking that my hair was healthy enough after using Wen that I could continue forward with regular salon and store purchased shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I bought the exact same formulation (Cucumber Aloe) that I got from QVC, however this stuff is different.  </li>
            <li>I have fine blonde hair that I dye so it is slightly damaged, but I have a ton of it</li>
            <li>I just used the free little tube because it was sitting there!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect Wen to fix my hair overnight since I had months of bad experience with the salon products, however, my hair feels better and almost like it was a year ago when it was healthy from using Wen for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I found a website where I can order the regular 5 piece 30 day supply kit as needed instead of having to purchase directly from Wen through their auto-shipment program since the purchased 30 day bottle actually lasts me longer than 30 days since I don&#x27;t use as much as the bottle recommends and the price was affordable compared to ordering through Wen&#x27;s website with the auto-shipment and automatic billing set-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, as long as she wants to use it, I will purchase it.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say much for the long term use.</li>
            <li>I normally use several products from leave-in conditioners to thickening foams and none of those combined come close to the results I achieved after one use of Wen.     </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and thin</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t live together, have different diets.</li>
            <li>Finally, I rinsed with a half gallon of room temperature distilled water just for an added clean.</li>
            <li>Not only has my hair kept its brightness much longer than before, but I can actually skip a day of \\&quot;washing\\&quot; if I want to.</li>
            <li>I am waiting to see how long it does last as this is my first bottle.</li>
            <li>Ended up washing my hair out with my regular shampoo three times and then conditioning so that I might be able to at least not have my hair suffer too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be interested to see how it retains color since I have not used it long enough to have coincided with a hair color treatment.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser suggested something mild like Wen, because I was using harsh cleanser for my oily scalp.</li>
            <li>I do like this product a lot, and it might take some time to get the process down right.  </li>
            <li>When this was very heavy and made my hair feel greasy and too soft (beleve it or not, that is possible), I decided to try to Cucumber since it was designed for people with Fine</li>
            <li>Cannot use it every day as it makes my fine hair heavy and flat.  </li>
            <li>I was starting to get frustrated with Wen hair products, I was using the sweet almond mint but found my hair looked amazing, but my roots were always greasy.</li>
            <li>There were major differences on this packaging than the Guther packaging.</li>
            <li>I just used this product for the first time and, thankfully, had read other reviews cautioning about the amount to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the fig is a little better for the dry ends, so will get that one next.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s usually such a pain to comb my hair out after washing, even after deep conditioning, because my hair is so thick and curly, but Wen makes it SO easy!  </li>
            <li>I think that this product is just not designed for people with fine hair.eet Almond Mint bottle, I gave this to a coworker with longer, thick hair</li>
            <li>Makes my very thin, fine hair look like it has a little more body.</li>
            <li>tried this for several weeks, and I tried it with less product, more product, washing twice in one shower, pairing it with the styling product, and even tried using it every other day.</li>
            <li>I am a natural blonde, but I go a shade lighter.  </li>
            <li>and so far using the volumnizing Pantene conditioner was the only thing that seemed to help.  </li>
            <li>It is designed to do the complete opposite.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair daily and color my hair and my hair is natural .</li>
            <li>Wen is the only product whcih makes my hair looks silk, soft.</li>
            <li>I did not use the \\&quot;one to two pumps\\&quot; as a \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot; conditioner because, if I had, my hair would be completely gooey until the next time I washed it.</li>
            <li>For approximately a year I tried many different kinds of shampoos and conditioners from the cheapest brands to the most expensive and I am terrified of calculating how much it cost me.  </li>
            <li>For long hair I would say don&#x27;t put it on your scalp, shampoo with something else close to your scalp if you have normal to oily hair...</li>
            <li>The menthol is so strong in this product, it&#x27;s ridiculous.  </li>
            <li>three stars because it&#x27;s still more convenient than shampoo and conditioner separately, and I like that it has fewer unnecessary ingredients.</li>
            <li>As far as my hair type, I have color-treated blonde hair, normally frizzy, wavy, dry, damaged and brittle.  </li>
            <li>Works great for my hair, wish it would be less expensive.</li>
            <li>Right now my hair reaches down my back to the bottom of the shoulder blades</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling heavy even though it felt clean enough.</li>
            <li>And just so you know I don&#x27;t usually have any problems with mild exposure to methol or mints but</li>
            <li>Made my fine, thin, sparse hair shiney, soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>My hair is color treated, very fried BUT extremely oily at the roots.</li>
            <li>I was spending so much money on conditioner and styling products and was desperate to try anything if it would help my hair become healthy again so it would grow longer and not break.  </li>
            <li>Today, I will touch up the roots again and see how long my color lasts, using Wen vs my old shampoo.</li>
            <li>stuff went in the trash, and while it apparently works for some people, it definitely did not work for me.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s shoulder length, about 8 pumps the first cleanse, let it sit a few minutes, rinse, and then add another 4 or 5 pumps.  </li>
            <li>I did with the Sweet Almond Mint bottle, I gave this to a coworker with longer, thick hair</li>
            <li>My guess is that the reason people are feeling like their hair is weighed down and greasy is because they&#x27;re using too much product.    </li>
            <li>Bought for Granddaughter, have to put a lot of it in your hair and rub it in let it sit 5 min then comb it thru, not sure she did it right because she&#x27;s 11 and needs to hurry in the mornings.  </li>
            <li>After the first use, my hair took forever to air dry (4 times as long for some reason) and when dry it looked as though I had not washed my hair in 5 days.  </li>
            <li>For the past few months I couldn&#x27;t remember what I had used a year ago that made my hair so healthy and grow.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Divide hair in half when wet, use about 2-3 tablespoons per half, rub with hands and then go straight to the scalp and scrub/cover all scalp, where most of the oil is on our head, do the second half of head also, then rub the cream through to the ends&lt;br /&gt;then, comb through.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old and grey, but have finally found the ultimate hair product!</li>
            <li>Really liked the feel of the product, but the results do not last long and it is too expensive to use.</li>
            <li>Much to her dismay (and outrage), she discovered that WEN products have been a subject of countless complaints and frustration.  </li>
            <li>Now, 4 months later, my hair part is starting to grow in, my hair is longer than I remember it being in about 10 years and my hair is not dry, brittle or damaged and thereforeI don&#x27;t have to get it trimmed every 2 months.</li>
            <li>I used less than the recommended number of pumps for my hair length due to how fine my hair is (I typically use less styling product, as well, due to my fine hair) - total of 15 pumps which sufficiently covered my hair with no issues.</li>
            <li>I use much less of the product than directed, but it is important spend several minutes massaging of the product into the scalp, and leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing.  </li>
            <li>But around Day 3, it started feeling really greasy and weighed down...and not clean.</li>
            <li>however, i do have thin and fine hair; it runs in our family ..</li>
            <li>I have really thin fine hair</li>
            <li>I really hope this helps someone else make their decision a little easier.  </li>
            <li>how much you rinse or how little you use.</li>

            <li> Wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> It has a wonderful scent and gives me a cooling sensation.</li>
            <li> I tried WEN and in the beginning I thought it was the greatest hair product ever.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful shampoo!</li>
            <li> Of all the Wen cleansing scents I&#x27;ve tried, I like this one the best!  </li>
            <li> it works great!  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions perfectly &#x27;30-40 pumps, massage in for a minute, let stand 3-5 minutes, rinse thoroughly&#x27; and when I got out my hair had waxy build up.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really awesome.</li>
            <li> BUT...I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month, and I am VERY happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Perfect, fits.</li>
            <li> Amazon is your best bet in case you don&#x27;t want the pesky auto shipments and the charge that comes with them.</li>
            <li> Probably best I&#x27;ve found after 51 years!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo, not the best smell.  </li>
            <li> All of the WEN Products are totally excellent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great!!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s priceless if you ask me.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else now, this is the best!</li>
            <li> WEN products are great!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wonderful !!!  </li>
            <li> My wife swears her greatest asset is her hair.  </li>
            <li> It was packaged perfectly and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I am one very happy customer!</li>
            <li> Great product!  </li>
            <li> Wonderful tingling sensation for my scalp.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I feel it is also very good for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and feels great too!</li>
            <li> Good luck!</li>
            <li> It is beautiful I must admit.  </li>
            <li> My hair looked beautiful and shiny, and I already had really great hair.</li>
            <li> Great for my son&#x27;s cradle cap,</li>
            <li> Both are great.</li>
            <li> I missed that sale this year and found it on Amazon at a great price.</li>
            <li> It has helped the fly away look that my hair had.</li>
            <li> The product is great, but the container didn&#x27;t come with a pump.</li>
            <li> This really is a great conditioner.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s great, I just bought another bottle.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not so great.  </li>
            <li> Great formula if you have hair that tends to be greasy.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked better !!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!!</li>
            <li> I love wen!!</li>
            <li> Very pleasant fragrance, nice change from all the fruity products out there.  </li>
            <li> Amazing results!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best haircare products available!</li>
            <li> I am ordering more for sure!!!!</li>
            <li> So there you go--a happy wife means a happy me:)</li>
            <li> Smells so good but for me, I need suds.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had my hair looking so good in years.  </li>
            <li> GOOD CLEANSING CONDITIONER.</li>
            <li> and I loved it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know my hair could look that good.  </li>
            <li> but it works  faily good on the rest of the hair.</li>
            <li> But, it never looks as good as when I leave the salon</li>
            <li> and she loved it.  </li>
            <li> and she loved it.  </li>
            <li> a good break from shampoo.</li>
            <li> Not as good as had hoped.  </li>
            <li> and I no longer have to straighten it, just a good blowdry</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t having the good hair days.   </li>
            <li> This was a gift to my sister, who had heard good things about</li>
            <li> I had used the WEN almond mint before and loved it.</li>
            <li> Am finally able to let my hair grow out and it is looking beautiful.</li>
            <li> my thin/fine hair is full, shiny, and looking the best it has ever looked in my life ..</li>
            <li> AND I&#x27;ve never seen her hair look more beautiful.</li>
            <li> The cucumber sloe is the best shapoo I have ever used , was glad to be able to order it from amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> WEN makes me happy:) I have been using it for three weeks</li>
            <li> Then, on top of that, I got fly aways now, which I have not ever had in my life.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the product was authentic, because neither bottle had the great effect on my hair.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a great conditioner - and you don&#x27;t have to use as many pumps as they say -  </li>
            <li> Anyway, after my first use, I am very happy with the results!  </li>
            <li> I used to be able to floss with my hair - no joke!</li>
            <li> Love WEN!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It is so healthy and manageable, and no tangles!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> works great on fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Wen is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> , it is nice, but definately I will not go for it again.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However...the upside is that for a day or two after I use it, my hair DOES feel really nice.</li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting anything.  </li>
            <li> I had nice hair before</li>
            <li> It had a nice smell.</li>
            <li> I use L&#x27;anza hair products which I really love, and try to get it shiny with the InStyler which does a good job.</li>
            <li> I will need to use a ton of additional styling products in order to have any kind of control over my hair.</li>
            <li> Nice smell....</li>
            <li> Honestly I think is just the smell</li>
            <li> You will need to add water after application so it will kind of lather upâ€¦..</li>
            <li> I thought it was a great product and was excited to try the cucumber mint variety.</li>
            <li> While the product was easy to use, smelled great and did eliminate the need for shampoo and conditioner, it did not make my hair look significantly better or shinier.  </li>
            <li> Pros: tangle free after washing it, no frizzy hair, looks healthy and smell great.  </li>
            <li> A lot softer, easy to handle and comb,and it smells good, too, without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it!  </li>
            <li> If this stuff gets better with use I&#x27;m in for some amazing hair experiences.</li>
            <li> I bought WEN in November, used it for a month, and loved the effect it had on my hair--shiny, smooth, manageable.</li>
            <li> directly from WEN, and it works great!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that gets oily</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and oily scalp.</li>
            <li> agree with many of the reviewer comments - the smell is very strong when you are applying it</li>
            <li> Follow the easy instructions, and enjoy how your hair feels!!  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this was great.  </li>
            <li> Worked great at first, then seemed to irritate scalp.</li>
            <li> Tons of flyaways, even though I used to have very smooth hair.</li>
            <li> smell is very settle, not the best one but not bad.</li>
            <li> When I combed through it and dried it, my hair felt great and best of all clean!</li>
            <li> If I use the Wen about every three to four days, it does make my hair feel healthy.</li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and silky and NOT frizzy!  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> but I have been using it for over two weeks and love it.</li>
            <li> After I apply it to all sections I apply a couple more pumps to the ends and then clip it up for the rest of my shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so enjoyable to use too.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching it and running my hands through it.</li>
            <li> ok..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works for some people but not my hair type.</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> I love the product and have used it before.  </li>
            <li> top of it all, it did nothing to improve the smoothness or texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> Sincerely, Your biggest East Coast fan</li>
            <li> Perhaps if you already have healthy hair...</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Everyone asks me how my hair looks so healthy now.</li>
            <li> Try it, you will love it. :)</li>
            <li> With that description of my hair, you can now imagine how \\&quot;more than normal\\&quot; hair loss that lasts over a year can affect your hair part, length and fullness.  </li>
            <li> I am now able to grow out my hair and it is not falling out by the hand fulls anymore.  </li>
            <li> After using the WEN cleansing conditioner for about 2-3 weeks, the condition of my hair is much better and the color has stayed truer too.  </li>
            <li> Ok, just got my cucumber aloe on March 5 , tried it today,</li>
            <li> its ok...</li>
            <li> I truly think Suave shampoo is a better product than this.</li>
            <li> Since I remembered three weeks ago that I had used Wen on my hair which is what made it so healthy</li>
            <li> absolutely LOVE Wen...</li>
            <li> my hair has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I will keep trying and hope it works better...</li>
            <li> Most people complain it leaves your hair greasy</li>
            <li> It does everything it claims and much more.  </li>
            <li> Also, you need to use the product more often ...</li>
            <li> I am glad I tried the cleansing conditioner again.</li>
            <li> Combing it through is important too!</li>
            <li> I love the Wen products - my husband now uses it as well.  </li>
            <li> I tried twice more just to see if I had messed up, but no each time my hair came out with grease and wax.</li>
            <li> 5-10 pumps (more if you need) and put on the top part of your hair, massage in&lt;br</li>
            <li> rise thoroughly making sure you don&#x27;t feel anything in your hair&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they all got a good laugh.  </li>
            <li> They did say my hair looked better though</li>
            <li> Many times, thinking I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore</li>
            <li> It looks better now than it did when I had extensions.  </li>
            <li> I am sure this will vary from person to person.  </li>
            <li> but every time I washed my hair more hair would appear in my hands.</li>
            <li> I love Wen and what this product does for my hair, just love it.</li>
            <li> and I love this product.</li>
            <li> I usually love all Wen hair products.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting the best with all the mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, my hair hasn&#x27;t fallen out.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite but its ok.</li>
            <li> I love the mint volume spray, conditioner and leave in treatment.</li>
            <li> This product was just ok for me.</li>
            <li> Love Wen.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> WEN makes it look healthier and shinier and seems to give it more body.  </li>
            <li> My curls also revive much better day after day, so I&#x27;m wearing fewer pony tails and buns.  </li>
            <li> I have used it now three times and am in love ..</li>
            <li> though - more like 3-4.  </li>
            <li> so you&#x27;ll use more.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work best if I use regular shampoo and then this.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> If your hair is thicker or longer you will need to use more product.</li>
            <li> If you go to the website it will give you more info and show more products.</li>
            <li> I also love this hair product and will order it from you again.&lt;br /&gt;Marlene</li>
            <li> The trick is to not think of this as shampoo but more like a &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; that you work through your scalp and hair.  </li>
            <li> I prefer a more floral smell.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> I prefer the pomegranate one the most.  </li>
            <li> and that is much better.</li>
            <li> I do believe its better for my hair and its soothing when it touches the scalp</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on Wen but since my hair isn&#x27;t greasy/oily anymore (another lifetime first!!!)</li>
            <li> Hair looked brighter and bouncier and very clean.  </li>
            <li> I just used the Wen Cucumber Aloe for the first time and yes my hair feels good.  </li>
            <li> I can say that if my hair style was loose and wavy, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I have medium length oily hair (a lot of fine hair) and absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I like this product, it is rich and soothing, leaving a nice and comfortable feeling after using.</li>
            <li> For some reason, my scalp always gets itchy in the summer and this felt very cool.  </li>
            <li> nice fresh fragrance.  </li>
            <li> You have to get used to the no foaming thing at first, but after you do you&#x27;ll love how your hair feels!  </li>
            <li> Compared to the other Wen products not as impressed.</li>
            <li> Tends to make my hair overly oily...never smells or feels clean for more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li> I love that my hair still feels so clean, even without the suds.</li>
            <li> My hair is also breaking really easily now, and it never did that when I was using the Wen I got from QVC.  </li>
            <li> It now is much better conditioned, and feels clean, not oily.</li>
            <li> Wen is amazing; I&#x27;ve used MANY products over the years for my brittle and tempermental hair, including high end organic products and Wen beats them all!  </li>
            <li> Shine is like doll&#x27;s hair, and soooo strong now.  </li>
            <li> It would help get rid of the smell of the strong shampoos I have to use and not hurt</li>
            <li> where it&#x27;s close to the bottom of the list you wouldn&#x27;t think it would be that strong.  </li>
            <li> I thought Wen products were amazing when I first started to use it.</li>
            <li> The results I had with it were that the first 1-2 days my hair felt AMAZING.</li>
            <li> In fact I feel a bit funny because people kind of stare.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and has a wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is fine</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t fine</li>
            <li> My sister in law bought Wen and gave me the cucumber aloe cleansing conditioner because she didn&#x27;t have fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Lavender and Mint for awhile but decided to try this because it is recommended for fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair that gets oily looking.</li>
            <li> I have fine oily hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, feel cool on application and my hair is soooo soft.</li>
            <li> This works fine for me.</li>
            <li> My baby fine hair literally melted after a botched coloring.  </li>
            <li> my hair is fine and touches my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I think that this product is just not designed for people with fine hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> bought this conditioner because I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> my fine limpless hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how quickly I would go through a bottle using the recommended amount!  </li>
            <li> I am a professionally licensed hair dresser, I have access to the best stuff available but after getting sucked into a infomercial i wanted to try it, wen turned my high end purology shampoo and conditioner into the products that get stuck under the sink.</li>
            <li> Thanks Wen, I look forward to trying out more of your products!</li>
            <li> In fact, my hair feels BETTER than it did when I first got the keratin treatment done!  </li>
            <li> I can get the salon size (huge) of the Dove with a pump for $12 each at Sam&#x27;s Club (wholesale club) and it lasts 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> Now my huge jug is gone- something I&#x27;ve been looking forward to for a year.  </li>
            <li> and I was sold after the second great hair day.</li>
            <li> Since it was free I used what she gave me.  </li>
            <li> I used it again after 3 days and had the same great results.  </li>
            <li> I have always had to shampoo my hair daily, with the Cucumber Aloe line I can skip a day and my hair still looks great.</li>
            <li> I only use 6 or 8 and get these great results.</li>
            <li> Last year my hair was in great condition even though I did color and straighten it</li>
            <li> Its important people learn how to use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The extra pump as a leave-in conditioner is also a great idea.</li>
            <li> you see how detailed that is?</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have over-processed hair like mine and just want light conditioning, this will work for you.  </li>
            <li> Overall great product.</li>
            <li> It is a great conditioner for damaged hair but it didn&#x27;t rinse well and left an oily residue in my hair and my daughters.</li>
            <li> I enjoy WEN but will stick to one type, unless they give samples of others.</li>
            <li> I had to find one that fit from my lotion bottles.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> My hair is not as fabulous as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> What you really need to do is use your best judgment and just use enough to saturate the hair from root to tip.   </li>
            <li> but this was NOT a subtle change, it was striking!  </li>
            <li> I have enjoyed WEN products, but am still trying to find the one that&#x27;s right for my hair.</li>
            <li> once i have blown it dry it comes out just beautiful ..</li>
            <li> Oh, and the great hair days continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> According to Chaz Dean, in one of his informercials, he said that cucumber aloe cleansing conditioner was specially design for fine hair because it has aloe.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Plus, it is pretty pricey, I would expect to see more for this price.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference with my hair after the first wash - it felt softer and had more body.</li>
            <li> (normally you feel that kind of minty sensation on the scale or even the smell</li>
            <li> pretty sure it&#x27;s all about getting you to go through it faster</li>
            <li> Silky, curly, shiny, clean and conditioned.  </li>
            <li> was that it wouldn&#x27;t really clean my hair.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it gets clean at all.</li>
            <li> It comes out squeaky clean and just so shiny.  </li>
            <li> Smells so clean.  </li>
            <li> It does give you a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I find that the Wen C-C does a great job and my hair is no longer dry in the morning.  </li>
            <li> it was truly clean.  </li>
            <li> After washing with it, your scalp has a tingling clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> But it does leave a waxy buildup in your hair, and you have to use another shampoo to clean your hair.  </li>
            <li> But they all require using lots and for me I have to use another shampoo to clean wax out of hair.</li>
            <li> My hair does not feel clean.  </li>
            <li> Great product for dry hair and split ends.</li>
            <li> I had seen Chaz on QVC a couple of times, but never quite believed this stuff would get your hair clean.  </li>
            <li> My hair is more on the oily side, so I&#x27;m sure people with dry hair would probably like this product more.</li>
            <li> I had the stuff in for just about two minutes and my scalp was bright red.  </li>
            <li> I rinse it out in cool water but that is already a habit for me so no biggie.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about these products.  </li>
            <li> It smells so sweet and fruity.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t believe one product can work for everyone, but this one sure blew me away.</li>
            <li> It does leave my hair soft but kind of oily.  </li>
            <li> I had no idea what to attribute my hair loss to as I am only 25 and in good health.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I realized how cool Wen felt on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I used Wen for about 5 months and then quit since I was receiving too many bottles of the Cleansing Conditioner from the auto-shipment program while being charged when I don&#x27;t use as much as recommended and</li>
            <li> it really makes a difference :)</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel softer, but it really made it more greasy.   </li>
            <li> I would never be able to make my hair straight after using this as it&#x27;s just too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is nothing more than straight up conditioner.</li>
            <li> It gave my scalp a tingle which was unexpected but nice.</li>
            <li> good size rather than the one that comes with entire set.</li>
            <li> I loved the way it left my hair</li>
            <li> but I could tell a huge difference in the texture right away.</li>
            <li> I found using it every other day was great....</li>
            <li> Also, it takes a lot of time (not for a quick wash) and I have to do a lot of pumps and rub it into my sculp -</li>
            <li> It goes quickly.</li>
            <li> It gets used up quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I only bought the $40.00 bottle rather than wasting a greater amount of money.</li>
            <li> and she went through a bottle fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I spend less using Wen than I did with the multiple salon products and even if Wen would cost more, I would pay to continue to use Wen for my hair to be healthy and look great</li>
            <li> I am not a short-hair girl and look much better with longer hair and when my hair looks great, I feel great and hate feeling self-conscious about my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one I use these days, and I will more than likely not switch - great body, softness and shine.</li>
            <li> I really liked how it made my hair look and feel..just like other scents better..</li>
            <li> and I find that normal shampoo cleans my hair and scalp so much better.</li>
            <li> I tried using a normal or oily scalp shampoo and conditioning with WEN (avoiding contact with the scalp) and found that to work so much better.</li>
            <li> My color looks brassy, the ends are dry, it&#x27;s full of fly aways, and I am certain it will look greasy tomorrow.</li>
            <li> It was great on my hair, but the smell was a bit odd.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be going back for any more Keratin treatments!  </li>
            <li> This is the only scent of Wen that I use &amp; I Absolutly love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using WEN for about three weeks, but I already LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> It grew back healthy and strong.  </li>
            <li> I have baby fine straight hair</li>
            <li> My very fine, straight (limp) hair now has more body and is in better shape.  </li>
            <li> Since the FAQs said more is more, I tried the next morning and used about 4 pumps more than the recommended 12 pumps on each of the four sections and my hair wasn&#x27;t oily, but it also wasn&#x27;t easier to comb through, wasn&#x27;t any softer or more managable than my normal shampoo and conditioner (Dove Daily Moisture).  </li>
            <li> I have seen so many products claim to make a huge difference in your hair but have yet to find one that actually backed it up, until now.</li>
            <li> Ever after 8 months after not using Wen my hair was not as vibrant and strong as it used to be.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously worth a try if you haven&#x27;t found anything else that works.</li>
            <li> worth the money...</li>
            <li> I really liked the idea of a sulfate-free wash because I have to wash my hair daily</li>
            <li> Does that make it worth purchasing?</li>
            <li> However, it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> I of course heard about Wen, but didn&#x27;t ever intend to buy it because I couldn&#x27;t see how it was worth the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell</li>
            <li> but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> You have to stop using it for a couple of weeks to be able to color your hair light blonde.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> My bottle clearly states using &amp;#34;10 to 15 pumps more if hair is longer&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> After researching this product more I found that there was a class action lawsuit against them for hair loss please do the research your self before ordering this product I stopped using this almost a year ago</li>
            <li> it was my favorite so far</li>
            <li> I will say that I love the moisture that WEN gives my hair when I style it or even leave it naturally wavy</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews here before purchasing but figured that it was worth a shot -</li>
            <li> I purchased the Sweet Almond Mint scent first (which is supposed to be for all hair types).</li>
            <li> I have used WEN products for nearly a year and love them all.  </li>
            <li> favorite is the orange blossom so far.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use anything else - you will have to use a monthly clairiying shampoo to keep it all fresh.</li>
            <li> Back to loving Wen.</li>
            <li> You will kind of have to experiment to see what the proper amount of water is.</li>
            <li> The smell is fresh and flowery.</li>
            <li> it felt soft, and light, and clean.</li>
            <li> Just light and soft and clean with a lot of volume.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it as much as the original mint.</li>
            <li> ago(the reason I am on Amazon right now is because I have to reorder my Wen).</li>
            <li> The bottom line is that I could not be happier with the condition of my hair right now.</li>
            <li> Once you find the right formula for your hair type you will like it.</li>
            <li> 5-10 pumps on the right side</li>
            <li> I dove right in and bought the GALLON size from them which has lasted me over a year.  </li>
            <li> Just had to find the right one for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Cucumber Aloe has a nice fragrance, it washes out easily, and I like the way my hair feels silky soft even the next day.</li>
            <li> but it leaves my hair feeling very soft and clean and full of volume.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in my hair being softer and smoother but you have to use a very large amount.  </li>
            <li> I remain on the hunt for a good shampoo that would not make me loose so much hair.</li>
            <li> I have bright pink/magenta and black hair</li>
            <li> As many reviewers have said, it does not take near as much product as the directions recommend.  </li>
            <li> i use only about six (6) pumps and when rinsing this product off my hair is truly smooth and tangle free ..</li>
            <li> March 8, it is very nice, but on the back, the 3rd and 4th listed ingredient is CETYL ALCOHOL AND CETEARYL ALCOHOL.</li>
            <li> rinsed very very well - sometimes even sticking head under bathtub</li>
            <li> I have oily fine (naturally) curly hair and every shampoo I&#x27;ve used seemed to require me to use some type of gel as well as a blow dryer</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly fine hair and Wen</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo according to directions (which I thought were lacking) and it was nice the first few times but after 2 weeks I felt like my hair wasn&#x27;t staying clean</li>
            <li> I would be interested to see if others find this strategy to give the benefits of this novel shampoo formulation without the downsides of hair loss.</li>
            <li> that first usage was 1/5 of the 16 ounce bottle) to the letter, combed it through with a widetoothed comb and rinsed and rinsed and rinsed with cool/warm water</li>
            <li> I love what it does for my hair, especially as a leave in conditioner on the ends.</li>
            <li> but I did do my research first.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, though, I did not have the best experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would recommend trying to get a week&#x27;s worth of samples of this before buying, as it seems like the experiences really do vary from person to person.</li>
            <li> It left my hair with a gross-feeling build-up and, what upset me even more</li>
            <li> This is my first time writing an online review for a product</li>
            <li> but I definitely noticed A LOT more hair coming out in the shower, on my hairbrush, on my clothes, all over my house and car.</li>
            <li> I am fully aware that I will never have \\&quot;Goldielocks\\</li>
            <li> I have healthy, uncolored, short hair.</li>
            <li> Now I have both tons of flyaways for the first time in my life, and I cannot color my hair.</li>
            <li> It really works!  </li>
            <li> When I first tried WEN</li>
            <li> I saw the difference in my hair with the first use.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried Wen Cleansing Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have to say that as I use Wen more and more, I am starting to not like traditional shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I can really feel a difference in my hair when I use Wen!</li>
            <li> any extra pumps on the bottom or top, just fill in</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair with WEN and it is not greasy, no waxy build up and my hair looks really healthy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m back for more.  </li>
            <li> First time in my almost 50 years I can say that.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather actually wash my hair than just add more gunk to it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking my hair now, which is quite a statement to make!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about trying this product, I would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the WEN products, especially the Cucumber Aloe.  </li>
            <li> I have it makes my hair so silky smooth and soft</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> it actually made my hair more oily and grease.</li>
            <li> We all love it so much because it makes our hair soft and it really looks fuller.  </li>
            <li> Very shipping just as it looks in the picture!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how it goes as I use this first bottle.      </li>
            <li> The company is fully aware of these many cases, and still seems to peddle their &amp;#34;varnish remover&amp;#34; wherever possible.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instruction exactly.  </li>
            <li> The first time I just this</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know, perhaps the instructions were for someone interested in shampooing their horse?</li>
            <li> It helped much more than the traditional shampoos.</li>
            <li> your hair is dry, damaged, brittle or needs help and you want it to be healthy, Wen is definitely worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> really think they should have a disclaimer on products like this that have a strong chemical in them for people who have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten relaxers and Keratin treatments (which I loved) all in an effort to \\&quot;tame the frizz\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> From the first my hair was soft and clean with tons of volume.</li>
            <li> Natural stuff, feels &amp; smells fresh!</li>
            <li> When rinsing, it&#x27;s so soft and squeaky clean, NOT tangled.  </li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t have to use nearly the suggested amount on the bottle to clean it</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Then, I started to notice my light blonde hair changing to golden, then brassy to the point that the darker roots turned almost brassy orange.</li>
            <li> and I feel better about using 2 products, as opposed to four or five different products that I had to use to get my hair somewhat straight, but</li>
            <li> hair is still wet as I write this, but I believe the product to be quite good at cleaning and my hair feels quite soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite scent, but the formula works really well for my type of hair - a little oily and fine.</li>
            <li> I heard such great things about this cleansing conditioner, so I spent this much money, used it 3 times and each time I used it, my hair came out in wads.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product in order to supplement a QVC auto-shipment because I tend to go through a bottle of Wen pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> have been using this stuff for so long , love it</li>
            <li> This product surprised me by really, truly getting my hair clean but still leaving the ends conditioned.  </li>
            <li> are coming back soft and bouncy!!&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> but honestly it was less work than using a separate shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting to see much after the first use</li>
            <li> After using hair vitamins and some oil treatments, I&#x27;ve got my shine back, but my hair is still not as strong as it used to be.  </li>
            <li> smelled good and it worked ok for first few times, but hair seemed greasy after a few washes.</li>
            <li> You have to wash your hair first because alone doesn&#x27;t make it clean enough, so</li>
            <li> but... my hair only feels clean the first day.</li>
            <li> However I do like it very much and so far it seems to be doing exactly as the infomercial states.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very medicinal smelling.  </li>
            <li> I really felt (after pouring over reveiws before I took the plunge and ordered the product) that I should also write a reveiw to help that person who is undecided to go ahead and take the plunge too.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too much of a coincidence</li>
            <li> It seems to really build up</li>
            <li> Chaz Dean should get real recognition for developing these products.  </li>
            <li> I toweled the ends gently and wrapped my hair in the towel.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot and just don&#x27;t think it does that much.</li>
            <li> I really like wen cleansing,,, My beutition notice the difference in my hair when she cut it..</li>
            <li> (after gently blow drying and finger</li>
            <li> Cleans hair very well but don&#x27;t believe there is any difference in my hair</li>
            <li> I really like how well it conditions my hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t enjoy the smell, it smells a bit medicine-y, so I would recommend a different one.</li>
            <li> I will recommend WEN to absolutely anyone.  </li>
            <li> Later that day I got a trim and the stylist told me how healthy my hair looked and how soft and asked how much I shampooed.  </li>
            <li> I really like the Wen Products.</li>
            <li> Wen is also really gentle on color</li>
            <li> The scent is very medicinal.</li>
            <li> but it was damaged from swimming and from coloring it light blonde.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t spend as much time straightening it repeatedly as I did before with the salon products and my hair doesn&#x27;t look damaged and brittle as it did two weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> This is not the real Wen.</li>
            <li> It does not smell like, look like, or feel like the real Wen.</li>
            <li> WHAT could be in the ingredients that cost so much....?.</li>
            <li> I really like the Wen products.  </li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> Purchasing my Wen from Amazon is fast</li>
            <li> Packaged well, arrived promptly, very cooling formula..nice for summer</li>
            <li> I have heard so much about WEN that I had to buy it.</li>
            <li> embrace your real hair</li>
            <li> Really like Wen Products.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t believe I have so much for a product that didn&#x27;t even work</li>
            <li> I use a lot because I have so much hair but follow the instructions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not buying the whole 10 pumps to use.  </li>
            <li> That said, I used 5 pumps, which still felt like I was wasting it, and really like how it felt on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> You have to use so much of the product.</li>
            <li> and it really makes it look fuller and thinker.</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> She has been using it since December 2012, and it has really helped her psoriasis</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need to use as much as they suggested.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really care that it does not sudz up.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fantastic on my kids&#x27; hair, especially after a day of sweating or swimming.  </li>
            <li> rinse rinse really well . . .</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a foaming action that gives you a similar effect, but it&#x27;s better for your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I only use 4 pumps in each section of hair (top, bottom, left, right) and leave it in for 10 min.</li>
            <li> The aloe helps fine hair by adding volume so it doesn&#x27;t lay flat.</li>
            <li> Also, I live in a hot and humid climate, and it still works well.  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair so soft and smooth, and actually reduces the time it takes to get ready in the morning!</li>
            <li> One bottle of WEN replaces both other products and it does a better job.</li>
            <li> I finally remembered that last year I had ordered Wen and had used the Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner (I don&#x27;t remember them having the Cucumber Aloe or Fig Cleansing Conditioners available at the time).  </li>
            <li> It may have been due to &amp;#34;coatings&amp;#34; but my uber healthy hair is there underneath.  </li>
            <li> I had the mint originally and if I order WEN again that will be the only one I will get.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been particularly fond of my hair, but I didn&#x27;t figure there was much I could do about it</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Wen I do like the cucumber the best for the thin hair i Have.</li>
            <li> Im using  the cucumber aloe, I  section my hair into 4 sections, use 6-8 quick pumps for each section, I make sure to really focus on getting the product on my scalp and massage each section separately for at least a minute.</li>
            <li> I do think the price is high because I need to use alot more of the product due to the length of my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but this specific one makes my hair AMAZING - not too oily, not too dry.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and it is easy to comb, also it gives extra volume.</li>
            <li> well.. the feeling while I was in the shower with this thing on my hair was different, I liked the way my hair felt in the shower, but as soon as you wash it off and dry your hair, there is no difference at all...</li>
            <li> My hair is a little longer than shoulder length and very fine, but beginning to thicken up (Postpartum hair loss).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how this 16 oz bottle will last a full 30 days..</li>
            <li> She became interested in Wen after someone suggested that she try it because it was all natural.  </li>
            <li> I massaged scalp and first 2&amp;#34; of hair near scalp with it and rinsed immediately and c)</li>
            <li> and I was able to wear it down again instead of having to hide a texture or oily problem.  </li>
            <li> I have very frizzy, dry hair and usually use another high-end brand of shampoo, but wanted to give WEN a try after seeing the informercials and hearing how great it</li>
            <li> Slowly it&#x27;s regaining its youth and best of all curls!!!My little locks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten blood tests to rule out thyroid and hormone problems, and I am healthy, not pregnant, etc.</li>
            <li> I honestly use regular shampoo on the bottom half of my hair and use Wen only the top half (mainly because this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap).</li>
            <li> My hair is healthier, and has more moisture and less breakage.</li>
            <li> I used half of each bottle to make sure I was giving the product a chance, but here are the differences</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an older person, have been coloring my hair for decades</li>
            <li> I tried many different variations in amount and hairsprays with similar results.  </li>
            <li> It will only make your hair super oily and gunked up feeling no matter</li>
            <li> , it really does leave your hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered the Fig Cleansing Conditioner since I&#x27;m anxious to try that next since it wasn&#x27;t available a year ago and want to see if it works even better than the Cucumber Aloe.  </li>
            <li> I am 42 years old, with very fine brown hair (just above my shoulders cut in a layered bob) that I have colored blonde.</li>
            <li> But the Methylisothiazolinone is highly toxic and could be correlated with shampoos that cause hair loss.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this stuff based on postivie reviews I read.  </li>
            <li> I have medium length hair, pretty fine, colored, and tends to get a little oily every 24 hrs.</li>
            <li> I use it for getting all the extras left by the other kind of shampoos.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I found that you need to experiment with the quantity you use and be sure to completely wash it out of your hair, otherwise it does make my hair greasy after styling</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget, it is normal to lose 100-200 hairs a day, and brunettes have more hair than other natural colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once you apply and massage, add a little bit of water and the product seems more prevalent.  </li>
            <li> I decided to just blow dry my hair with no other products to better judge the results and seriously, WOW!</li>
            <li> My neighbor have me two big bottles of WEN for free because she said it broke her skin out, so I used it as a leave in, and sure enough, I tried to highlight my hair the other day, and it would not take at all.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other expensive shampoos and conditioners, so when you figure in trying other products, and the fact your hair looks great with WEN,  the time and cost are worth it!</li>
            <li> but it is not thick...</li>
            <li> If you really want hair that is soft and shiny and bouncey, this is the ticket.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft, but I don&#x27;t need as much as is recommended.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect but over all I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li> My hair is very shiny and soft and I could see immediately when I took the towel off my head to style it that there was a difference.    </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal frizzy self.  </li>
            <li> My hair has been falling out more than usual and my scalp has become very itchy and irritated.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll alternate between the two of them until the Wen is gone, but I don&#x27;t see this as worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product smells good and has decreased the amount of detangler that I require</li>
            <li> So much so, that there&#x27;s quite a few web sites that are more or less devoted to people&#x27;s justified criticisms and in some cases, horror stories of their experiences with WEN.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, thick, curly hair and this works so great on my hair.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m ready to blow dry, the comb goes right through, not one knot.  </li>
            <li> hair is super soft and shinier than usual, and it feels clean but a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> makes it friz free shiney and manageable without having to use any other products.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to get my hair back to being soft, healthy and where it will grow long again.  </li>
            <li> Chaz Dean also made a new \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; called Pomegranate.  </li>
            <li> It also stripped my hair color to such an extent that my grays not only came through, they actually seemed a more vibrant silver, forcing me to re-color my hair.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> I had tried it TWICE before in the past several years, but didn&#x27;t like the time and cost involved, but am very glad I tried it again.</li>
            <li> But right now I&#x27;m only using it once a week along with my old shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I feel lucky I only used this product for a few months (see original review below), and I figure the FDA investigation warrants me knocking this product from three stars to one.  </li>
            <li> The only one that didn&#x27;t smell so hot was Tea Tree.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thinning on top but about 3 inches past my shoulders in length.</li>
            <li> So, this was my first and my last purchase of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I use much less and achieve fine results.</li>
            <li> (their use half the pumps for the first wash and the other half for the second wash and half a pump for a leave in treatment) and my hair has never been more beautiful.</li>
            <li> Then I used a few more pumps for the ends and worked it through with my fingers first for a minute, then used a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> At this time, many shampoos/conditioners made me itchy, but Wen was one of the only ones that did not and gave me long lasting results.</li>
            <li> This product has not only saved me money, but also cut my hair routine time in half since I don&#x27;t have many split ends anymore.</li>
            <li> Right away I noticed that it took less time to blow it dry, the color was brighter and it was so smooth, but not heavy or greasy looking at all.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it made it my feel greasy and heavy.  </li>
            <li> I saw a few comparable products that sell for quite a bit less - we may try those also and see what the difference is; but overall if you can spend the money your hair will look great and you will notice the difference.</li>
            <li> This product works great with smoothing out my hair, although its a little hard to get used to.</li>
            <li> Did not keep my hair clean as long as it says in the advertisements, Hair was actually heavier and looked oily after 6-8 hours.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but I have found that I can use about 2/3 of what they say (I have shoulder length thick but fine hair) and it still works great.</li>
            <li> Then, I tried getting the color out by coloring with a very light pale blonde color.</li>
            <li> I used TWO pumps, and even that was a little more than was necessary to completely treat my two- to three-inch length hair.</li>
            <li> There seems to be a bit too much hype and not enough performance for the price</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and creamy when you&#x27;re shampooing.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and shiny</li>
            <li> Soft</li>
            <li> She said it was soft not frizzy and shinny...</li>
            <li> B003HFEGBY WEN Cucumber Aloe Cleansing Conditioner 16 oz]], followed the directions (wow-</li>
            <li> so it will last much longer.</li>
            <li> especially when you had to use so much etc.</li>
            <li> , it completely stripped my hair color after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> During the year of my intense hair loss, I definitely noticed my part getting wider and it made me devastated.</li>
            <li> I thought this is suppose to be all natural????</li>
            <li> When you add how much money I spent on various salon products, it was more than I would have spent on the Wen Cleansing Conditioner and the remoist cream</li>
            <li> It is shiny, looks healthier and isn&#x27;t frizzy and is soft.</li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t just soft</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft all the time now.</li>
            <li> , I really really like the Cucumber Aloe and just bought a bigger bottle</li>
            <li> I guess, given that it&#x27;s basically just a fancy 2-in-1 shampoo (which don&#x27;t moisturize nearly as well as stand-alone conditioners), it makes sense.  </li>
            <li> My hair has a natural wave to it.</li>
            <li> But, in my case, it&#x27;s almost TOO SOFT.</li>
            <li> the Cucumber Aloe works wonders, makes my curly hair soft &amp; manageable</li>
            <li> i am 62 yrs old but do not look or act my age; where has this product been all my life ????  </li>
            <li> After one application, the body increased by nearly 75%.</li>
            <li> This is a product I&#x27;ve used for years with complete satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> so I studied the instructions and even found a few videos on the net that gave more info.</li>
            <li> WEN products make my hair look thick and healthy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, having average size human male hands, I am not even certain I could fit 16-30 pumps of this product into my palm.</li>
            <li> I also liked the idea of less weighed down hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little strange because it doesn&#x27;t lather, but it doesn&#x27;t strip my color and my hair has stayed soft and healthy after repeated bleaching and coloring every 8 weeks for 3 1/2 years.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin, fine, curly hair, which tends toward being very dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have medium length fine wavy hair that is usually lifeless.</li>
            <li> I looked up some of the ingredients in Wen&#x27;s products and then looked for other shampoos that had the same ingredients which were also getting reviews of significant hair loss.  </li>
            <li> I use much less than the recommended dose because, as I mentioned earlier, my hair is of fine texture and 1 Wen bottle has lasted me about 4 months.</li>
            <li> After I used the last bottle, I switched back to regular shampoo and conditioner thinking that my hair was healthy enough after using Wen that I could continue forward with regular salon and store purchased shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I bought the exact same formulation (Cucumber Aloe) that I got from QVC, however this stuff is different.  </li>
            <li> I have fine blonde hair that I dye so it is slightly damaged, but I have a ton of it</li>
            <li> I just used the free little tube because it was sitting there!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect Wen to fix my hair overnight since I had months of bad experience with the salon products, however, my hair feels better and almost like it was a year ago when it was healthy from using Wen for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I found a website where I can order the regular 5 piece 30 day supply kit as needed instead of having to purchase directly from Wen through their auto-shipment program since the purchased 30 day bottle actually lasts me longer than 30 days since I don&#x27;t use as much as the bottle recommends and the price was affordable compared to ordering through Wen&#x27;s website with the auto-shipment and automatic billing set-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, as long as she wants to use it, I will purchase it.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say much for the long term use.</li>
            <li> I normally use several products from leave-in conditioners to thickening foams and none of those combined come close to the results I achieved after one use of Wen.     </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and thin</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t live together, have different diets.</li>
            <li> Finally, I rinsed with a half gallon of room temperature distilled water just for an added clean.</li>
            <li> Not only has my hair kept its brightness much longer than before, but I can actually skip a day of \\&quot;washing\\&quot; if I want to.</li>
            <li> I am waiting to see how long it does last as this is my first bottle.</li>
            <li> Ended up washing my hair out with my regular shampoo three times and then conditioning so that I might be able to at least not have my hair suffer too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be interested to see how it retains color since I have not used it long enough to have coincided with a hair color treatment.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested something mild like Wen, because I was using harsh cleanser for my oily scalp.</li>
            <li> I do like this product a lot, and it might take some time to get the process down right.  </li>
            <li> When this was very heavy and made my hair feel greasy and too soft (beleve it or not, that is possible), I decided to try to Cucumber since it was designed for people with Fine</li>
            <li> Cannot use it every day as it makes my fine hair heavy and flat.  </li>
            <li> I was starting to get frustrated with Wen hair products, I was using the sweet almond mint but found my hair looked amazing, but my roots were always greasy.</li>
            <li> There were major differences on this packaging than the Guther packaging.</li>
            <li> I just used this product for the first time and, thankfully, had read other reviews cautioning about the amount to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the fig is a little better for the dry ends, so will get that one next.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually such a pain to comb my hair out after washing, even after deep conditioning, because my hair is so thick and curly, but Wen makes it SO easy!  </li>
            <li> I think that this product is just not designed for people with fine hair.eet Almond Mint bottle, I gave this to a coworker with longer, thick hair</li>
            <li> Makes my very thin, fine hair look like it has a little more body.</li>
            <li> tried this for several weeks, and I tried it with less product, more product, washing twice in one shower, pairing it with the styling product, and even tried using it every other day.</li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde, but I go a shade lighter.  </li>
            <li> and so far using the volumnizing Pantene conditioner was the only thing that seemed to help.  </li>
            <li> It is designed to do the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair daily and color my hair and my hair is natural .</li>
            <li> Wen is the only product whcih makes my hair looks silk, soft.</li>
            <li> I did not use the \\&quot;one to two pumps\\&quot; as a \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot; conditioner because, if I had, my hair would be completely gooey until the next time I washed it.</li>
            <li> For approximately a year I tried many different kinds of shampoos and conditioners from the cheapest brands to the most expensive and I am terrified of calculating how much it cost me.  </li>
            <li> For long hair I would say don&#x27;t put it on your scalp, shampoo with something else close to your scalp if you have normal to oily hair...</li>
            <li> The menthol is so strong in this product, it&#x27;s ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> three stars because it&#x27;s still more convenient than shampoo and conditioner separately, and I like that it has fewer unnecessary ingredients.</li>
            <li> As far as my hair type, I have color-treated blonde hair, normally frizzy, wavy, dry, damaged and brittle.  </li>
            <li> Works great for my hair, wish it would be less expensive.</li>
            <li> Right now my hair reaches down my back to the bottom of the shoulder blades</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling heavy even though it felt clean enough.</li>
            <li> And just so you know I don&#x27;t usually have any problems with mild exposure to methol or mints but</li>
            <li> Made my fine, thin, sparse hair shiney, soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is color treated, very fried BUT extremely oily at the roots.</li>
            <li> I was spending so much money on conditioner and styling products and was desperate to try anything if it would help my hair become healthy again so it would grow longer and not break.  </li>
            <li> Today, I will touch up the roots again and see how long my color lasts, using Wen vs my old shampoo.</li>
            <li> stuff went in the trash, and while it apparently works for some people, it definitely did not work for me.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s shoulder length, about 8 pumps the first cleanse, let it sit a few minutes, rinse, and then add another 4 or 5 pumps.  </li>
            <li> I did with the Sweet Almond Mint bottle, I gave this to a coworker with longer, thick hair</li>
            <li> My guess is that the reason people are feeling like their hair is weighed down and greasy is because they&#x27;re using too much product.    </li>
            <li> Bought for Granddaughter, have to put a lot of it in your hair and rub it in let it sit 5 min then comb it thru, not sure she did it right because she&#x27;s 11 and needs to hurry in the mornings.  </li>
            <li> After the first use, my hair took forever to air dry (4 times as long for some reason) and when dry it looked as though I had not washed my hair in 5 days.  </li>
            <li> For the past few months I couldn&#x27;t remember what I had used a year ago that made my hair so healthy and grow.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Divide hair in half when wet, use about 2-3 tablespoons per half, rub with hands and then go straight to the scalp and scrub/cover all scalp, where most of the oil is on our head, do the second half of head also, then rub the cream through to the ends&lt;br /&gt;then, comb through.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old and grey, but have finally found the ultimate hair product!</li>
            <li> Really liked the feel of the product, but the results do not last long and it is too expensive to use.</li>
            <li> Much to her dismay (and outrage), she discovered that WEN products have been a subject of countless complaints and frustration.  </li>
            <li> Now, 4 months later, my hair part is starting to grow in, my hair is longer than I remember it being in about 10 years and my hair is not dry, brittle or damaged and thereforeI don&#x27;t have to get it trimmed every 2 months.</li>
            <li> I used less than the recommended number of pumps for my hair length due to how fine my hair is (I typically use less styling product, as well, due to my fine hair) - total of 15 pumps which sufficiently covered my hair with no issues.</li>
            <li> I use much less of the product than directed, but it is important spend several minutes massaging of the product into the scalp, and leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing.  </li>
            <li> But around Day 3, it started feeling really greasy and weighed down...and not clean.</li>
            <li> however, i do have thin and fine hair; it runs in our family ..</li>
            <li> I have really thin fine hair</li>
            <li> I really hope this helps someone else make their decision a little easier.  </li>
            <li> how much you rinse or how little you use.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my hair was not as dry or brittle after the first few times of using Wen.</li>
            <li> No flat iron necessary after I blow it dry straight with a round brush</li>
            <li> I tried Redkin All Soft and other salon shampoos and conditioners and Redkin, Nexxus and Paul Mitchell styling products and kept trying to find something that would work.  </li>
            <li> Stay busy doing other things: shaving or washing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I searched online for other natural, non sulfate alternatives and switched.  </li>
            <li> The Keratin treatments are nice, however they are temporary, time-consuming and expensive!  </li>
            <li> I was away for the winter and ordered two new bottles of the Cucumber Aloe Cleansing Conditioner when I returned home in March, but I ordered from a vendor called Apple because the price was so much less.</li>
            <li> I used to have to use a round brush to blow dry straight in sections and now just my fingers, but somehow still dries curly with out blow drying.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I used too much as a result.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how the effects could last so long, but they have.</li>
            <li> I still had frizz after using my flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Long story short - I</li>
            <li> I do not use them every day, only 1-2 x a week but as long as you rinse</li>
            <li> and it has taken that long for my hair to grow back...</li>
            <li> I had flat lifeless hair blah .  </li>
            <li> I took the advice of some of the reviewers that had a positive experience and used enough (about 9 pumps of the product), since I have long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> This being so, the pricey bottle doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> It took several weeks, but now seeing results, my hair is wavy with oily scalp and dry ends-color treated.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks different from my other bottles, and ingredients are different.</li>
            <li> I gave WEN a rating of 4 because I think it should cost less; there really is no need to charge so much for a single bottle, and I hope that the execs eventually decide to bring the price of each bottle down so that it&#x27;s affordable, especially since Loreal has just come out with a similar product that retails for about $7.</li>
            <li> My hair is color treated and the ends tend to get dry because I flat Iron my hair almost every day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is that I do recommend the product, just use common sense in the amount applied based on how much hair is on your head.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I found I could not use it every day and had to switch off with another shampoo frequently because the Wen would leave my hair limp.  </li>
            <li> I understood, like him, that after shampooing, my hair was so tangled and knotted that it took a long time to comb out all the tangles and after that, my hair was suffering from breakage and split ends</li>
            <li> I have long hair that was getting damaged from heat processing and ponytail abuse - I heard about this product and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> and it grew long.  </li>
            <li> Im not completely sold on this product yet.</li>
            <li> I have used wen for a long time.  </li>
            <li> (I think for my long length, they recommend 24 pumps), I did have to use six to eight pumps.  </li>
            <li> I massaged it in for 2 minutes, used a wide tooth comb to evenly distribute and left it on for 5 additional minutes.</li>
            <li> Oily residue on long curly hair.</li>
            <li> It took some trial and error and now works well as long as:  a)</li>
            <li> I have really curly, thick, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, frizzy, curly hair that was hard to manage and dull.  </li>
            <li> i see this really helping thick, dry and brittle hair.</li>
            <li> I mean wasn&#x27;t the whole point of this not to have waxy build up?</li>
            <li> I used cold water to rinse the hair first, then used a few pumps and massaged into my scalp first at the crown and then at the nape or back of my head.</li>
            <li> i have fine, colored and thin hair, i need to use it every other day, it would leave my hair too limp if i used it daily  . . .</li>
            <li> I use my regular shampoo all other days.</li>
            <li> And that is the other thing- you have to use a ton of product, and at the price it costs, you will go through it way faster than your traditional shampoo (and this bottle is not big).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other key, is rinsing well--about 2-3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will not go back to using any other Shampoo or Conditioner and I will continue to use Wen.  </li>
            <li> , Im just saying that I don&#x27;t feel that this product could be different or does any differences  on my hair than any other WEN</li>
            <li> I have very thin and fine hair, oily at scalp and very dry, frizzy on ends.  </li>
            <li> the hair is still dry, a lot of flyaways, etc.</li>
            <li> I have dry, frizzy hair</li>
            <li> Depending on how oily or dry your hair is you can use a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that would treat dry scalp (often a cause of hair loss), and add volume.</li>
            <li> I then use the Wen as a leave in conditioner which helps a lot once I start to dry.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair but an oily scalp.  </li>
            <li> so my end don&#x27;t dry out</li>
            <li> My hair felt dry And tangly after using.  </li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re not new hair, it&#x27;s hair that&#x27;s still breaking off.  </li>
            <li> my tub, shower walls, down my back, neck and face.  </li>
            <li> Cons: I have to use it every other day because it will leave my hair oily if I use it everyday, so I alternate with regular shampoo and conditioner and then Wen.</li>
            <li> I use the Cucumber Aloe for an oily scalp and dry ends, and remember to RINSE, RINSE, RINSE!</li>
            <li> and I have seen from other customer reviews on the web that this same thing has happened to other people.</li>
            <li> dye my hair black and my hair turned brownish red after a couple of uses (I suspect it contains Henna although I did not verify this before throwing it out).</li>
            <li> However, I notice less hair loss while drying or combing my hair later on.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels really soft, less frizz even if I don&#x27;t use any other product (I use half a pump as leave in conditioner) and let it dry</li>
            <li> It makes my dyed hair very dry</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has very dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Hair is too flat and weighed down.</li>
            <li> It left my hair dry and stiff.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair every other day</li>
            <li> I rinse it out with warm water until i feel no more product on my hair then give it about 30 secs in cold water so once it&#x27;s dry it&#x27;ll have shine and less oil.</li>
            <li> and I only use my blow dryer every other day now!!</li>
            <li> I have long past the shoulders hi-lited blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but wanted to try something for my colored (red) hair that fades so fast.</li>
            <li> The same thing happened to my mother, who started using it a few days after me</li>
            <li> I was left with this halo-like effect around my head from the short strands of hair left behind from the rest of my hair breaking off.</li>
            <li> Just a few tiny tangles and voila!  </li>
            <li> I had to empty the bottle into another container with a pump.</li>
            <li> It does not really work as a shampoo for me.  </li>
            <li> While not really a &#x27;shampoo&#x27; with the suds, etc.</li>
            <li> My wife has found the opposite--her hair loss, though never really a problem, has declined since using Wen.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, a little on the thin side and my hair never grows past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> and I have very straight hair, and neither of us thought this was any different from other, less expensive conditioners.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look any shinier or less dry at the ends, so I guess I won&#x27;t recommend the product and won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I have the typical oily skin/scalp with dry hair ends.  </li>
            <li> I finally caved in and bought this product and on the first use was panic stricken when my scalp, eyes and nose started burning like crazy.  </li>
            <li> This left my hair increasingly dry and dull.  </li>
            <li> I use very very little each time - like maybe only 6 pumps instead of the 14-16 recommended, b)</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to use any other product.</li>
            <li> the other types are not compatible with my hair...</li>
            <li> I wash my hair with Wen every other day.</li>
            <li> I usually buy it once a year on QVC where I get a gallon size at a low price.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t understand why exactly this stuff is SOOO expensive.</li>
            <li> I understand the pump not working on the last few ounces, but come on!  </li>
            <li> No difference from this product to any of the other WEN conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I shampoo every other day to protect the color, and even with shampoos for color treated hair, I would see hair dye on my towel</li>
            <li> Sometimes it does what it&#x27;s supposed to other times it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Believing this was an allergic, isolated reaction, she looked up some of the other reviews and user comments online.  </li>
            <li> the other hand, if you like that &#x27;head on fire feeling&#x27;, by all means buy it by the gallon.</li>
            <li> This not only works on my hair which is thin and straight, but it also work on my nieces hair which is thick and curly.</li>
            <li> If I use too much, such as what thebottle recommends, my hair will feel a little heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have colored haie and after years of coloring, hair looked  dry , dead.</li>
            <li> Application of WEN does require a large amount and it is expensive.</li>
            <li> and I would budget to use Wen, although since the cost is less than I have spent using 4 or 5 Salon products I am spending less on Wen and using Wen is saving me money and lasts longer than the Salon products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use half of what the directions suggests for my lenth due to the thinness of my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gradually making it shinier, softer, and making me spend less money on other harmful products</li>
            <li> But when we got back to the hard water we have at home</li>
            <li> I would recommend using a different shampoo once a week to rid the build up if you  have hard water.</li>
            <li> Consequently, this product ends ups being super expensive!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not REALLY worth the money.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend at least trying it.</li>
            <li> It left a slimy scum everywhere-</li>
            <li> but this last time I was not thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> I was fascinated that it cleaned my hair, but it actually wasn&#x27;t as moisturizing as the thick, emollient consistency suggested.  </li>
            <li> Slightly tilt your head in the water until it gets a little wet</li>
            <li> : the label on these two bottles was lighter in color, the pumps that came with the bottles not only arrived in a sandwich baggie, but they were smaller than the original pump on the first bottle I ordered, the product burned my scalp, it washed out my hair color, and it damaged my hair so badly that I had to cut off almost three inches of hair last month, which is terrible since I was trying to grow my hair to below my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I used the hair dryer to dry and still had no better results.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling limp, oily and dull.  </li>
            <li> I am playing with it to see if I can get away with using less but</li>
            <li> Even just $10 less, would make a world of difference.</li>
            <li> One tip: use way less than recommended.</li>
            <li> I started experience hair loss about a year and half ago.</li>
            <li> but since I started using this shampoo my hair is shinier, breaks less, and I get fewer hair cuts.</li>
            <li> Less than 4 business days.</li>
            <li> It seemed like I lost half my hair.  </li>
            <li> I do see that my hair is shinier and less frizzy after blow drying.</li>
            <li> this is an update to my previous review after using this product for a while</li>
            <li> And if in doubt, use less.</li>
            <li> I used 12 pumps and still think I could have used less.</li>
            <li> However, I think save rosemary mint conditioner works just as well for a lot less.</li>
            <li> is.&lt;br /&gt;I realize that it not supposed to lather or bubble up like a normal shampoo, but I still found it difficult to work through my hair, even though I followed the label directions to the letter.</li>
            <li> What a mess.</li>
            <li> but that is usually because they have the wrong formula for their hair type or use too much.</li>
            <li> so I (unhappily) will put down the money for the real WEN.  </li>
            <li> One thing I was a little nervous about after reading some reveiws</li>
            <li> I rinsed it out thoroughly and used a little as a leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It is a little pricey</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll make it &#x27;seem&#x27; a little healthier..?  </li>
            <li> Thought all are just a little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wen product since October and my hairdresser was shocked at all the new hair growth I had when I had my last appointment in May.</li>
            <li> I just wish the price could come down!</li>
            <li> Just like anyone else, I don&#x27;t like to waste my money and in this case I don&#x27;t feel like I have.  </li>
            <li> , I dont see any difference after a few weeks of using it at all.</li>
            <li> No breakage or stretching and healed my dead ends.  </li>
            <li> Only problem is that my hair is thin and sparse.</li>
            <li> This made my hair too soft, therefore difficult to style.</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft and shiny, but it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> I figured that it was cheaper on Amazon, so I might as well try to save a few bucks.  </li>
            <li> My hair is medium length and starting to thin now that I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> so I must wash it everyday.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it&#x27;s certainly far too expensive to keep using.</li>
            <li> rinse hair thoroughly, like for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I had told a few friends about what I had done</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> , I am having trouble styling it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> He was on again a few weeks ago, I checked out reviews on here and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just a waste and</li>
            <li> Updated after a few weeks.   </li>
            <li> I got the WEN Almond for Xmas and found that it worked for my hair although was somewhat heavy.  </li>
            <li> Let sit a few minutes and rinse.  </li>
            <li> Just got it,but less hair in the drain!</li>
            <li> Finding products for my hair is difficult due to my serverly mixed ethnicity.</li>
            <li> every other day, because (at least to me)</li>
            <li> what I do know is that it does nothing to tame or correct damaged hair...</li>
            <li> If it requires THAT much to clean your hair, it&#x27;s crap.  </li>
            <li> For those of you who reported having a bad experience with WEN your first time around, take a look at your packing slip and see if you ordered from this alternative vendor.</li>
            <li> (Med to thin long hair</li>
            <li> Probably not a great formula for you if your hair is color-treated and dry.  </li>
            <li> but since it really does replace both a shampoo and a conditioner even that isn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> And no more frizz.  </li>
            <li> After two trips to the dermatologist, trying to figure out what was causing my problem, I threw the bottle away and no more scabs.</li>
            <li> no more flaki skin on his head.  </li>
            <li> However, my review is two fold as at the same time that I decided to order Wen after randomly watching an infomercial on a Saturday morning, I also decided to order the PHYTO &#x27;PhytophanÃ¨re&#x27; Dietary Supplement for Hair &amp; Nails.  </li>
            <li> I had to finally have it trimmed to stop it from breaking and even with the expensive salon products, my hair was still brittle and breaking.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it is supposed to replace both your shampoo and conditioner, but the amount you need to use each time is triple (if not more)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not magical....</li>
            <li> Usually I wash my hair every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it does it</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this product is what it says it is...</li>
            <li> A lot of women say they have \\&quot;thin fine\\&quot; hair when in reality they really do not ...</li>
            <li> Now when I&#x27;m done blow drying my hair there are no more greasy roots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it.</li>
            <li> Older instructions said to do the hair in sections, which was idiotic and wasteful.  </li>
            <li> and it was very limp and hard to style.  </li>
            <li> This one of my favorites, because my hair is thin and it doesn&#x27;t way it down.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s faint when your hair is dry.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t send me a pump with the bottle, so unless you buy it separate you are going to have a hard time getting it</li>
            <li> (I have hard water.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the WEN works for about a year, and then it makes your hair too soft to the point that it starts to break off really badly.</li>
            <li> Wen is what we had in common.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 57, and have never liked my hair.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo seriously sucks.</li>
            <li> have THICK THICK hair</li>
            <li> I mean, lets face it, guys don&#x27;t notice subtle changes every time they happen...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m angry to have spent money and energy on this!!</li>
            <li> shampoo/conditioner is ridiculous-</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> There are less expensive types like Wen that you can buy in stores.  </li>
            <li> I do think it&#x27;s ridiculously  pricey.</li>
            <li> Also, the recommendation for 15-30 pumps is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> my hair became severely damaged with split ends and became so brittle it started breaking so badly that people thought I had cut my long hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair!  </li>
            <li> Turns out this was not an isolated reaction, but a very common occurrence with their products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick to pour out of the bottle and is useless without a pump.</li>
            <li> So frustrating I would have to over condition</li>
            <li> but after two uses I can see dramatic improvement.  </li>
            <li> I hated the fact that the pump quit working when there was well over a quarter of the product left in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Ill not buy another chaz dean product.</li>
            <li> And, I&#x27;ve never been unable to color my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was horribly wrong and my hair paid the price severely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too expensive and not as advertised results...</li>
            <li> I admit I was skeptical that it could do all it claimed.  </li>
            <li> but it is too expensive to continue.</li>
            <li> But without fail someone would say &amp;#34;did</li>
            <li> Before Wen, I was used to seeing lots of hair caught in my drain every time I shampooed, and broken on the bathroom floor every day when I would brush it, but that is not the case anymore!  </li>
            <li> get me wrong</li>
            <li> .. trust me; you want to try this; i was skeptical but am sold now forever ..</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too expensive to buy periodically</li>
            <li> My hair looked dirty and oily.  </li>
            <li> My hair still looked dirty and oily like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in days.  </li>
            <li> Too expensive!</li>
            <li> So expensive!</li>
            <li> and u can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very, very expensive, the price keeps going up too, and it eventually breaks your hair off, it will give you tons of flyaways.</li>
            <li> Very expensive for the results.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they are as bad</li>
            <li> both my daughter and I tried it and were disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to purchase this through the TV website because I hate automated orders and delivery</li>
            <li> I hate the minty smell tho...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5 days into using it, and I hate it.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed that the pump was not included in purchase, as it should have been.</li>
            <li> and it was just so damaged it look awful.  </li>
            <li> I HATED it!!!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it was horrible but probably not something I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This product was terrible!</li>
            <li> The Studio Graphix brand is terrible.</li>
            <li> I opened the bottle and it smelled HORRIBLE like a jar of Vicks mentholated rub.</li>

            <li> Dont like the smell of this one</li>
            <li> Smells so good but for me, I need suds.</li>
            <li> smelled good and it worked ok for first few times, but hair seemed greasy after a few washes. won&#x27;t use again.</li>
            <li> I looked up some of the ingredients in Wen&#x27;s products and then looked for other shampoos that had the same ingredients which were also getting reviews of significant hair loss.  I just used the Wen Cucumber Aloe for the first time and yes my hair feels good.  But the Methylisothiazolinone is highly toxic and could be correlated with shampoos that cause hair loss.  I plan to keep this product just off my scalp when shampooing.  I would be interested to see if others find this strategy to give the benefits of this novel shampoo formulation without the downsides of hair loss.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to the cucumber fragrance but it&#x27;s very medicinal smelling.  My hair is very fine and thin and I found I could not use it every day and had to switch off with another shampoo frequently because the Wen would leave my hair limp.  If I use the Wen about every three to four days, it does make my hair feel healthy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product quite awhile ago and decided to give it a chance before reviewing.  While the product was easy to use, smelled great and did eliminate the need for shampoo and conditioner, it did not make my hair look significantly better or shinier.  There seems to be a bit too much hype and not enough performance for the price</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked better !! Silky, curly, shiny, clean and conditioned.  And no more frizz.  This is all I will ever use for hair.  I really love it.</li>
            <li> I touch up my roots every 3 weeks; suddenly, my gray hair showed up sooner than 3 weeks.  I wondered if my shampoo was washing out the color. I also use heat rollers daily to control the frizz. Between color touch ups and heat rollers, my hair was suffering over-process. After watching the Wen commercials, I decided to try it.  Since using Wen, my hair is softer; it feels healthier.  Today, I will touch up the roots again and see how long my color lasts, using Wen vs my old shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best haircare products available! It makes your hair so soft and smooth, and actually reduces the time it takes to get ready in the morning!</li>
            <li> I really felt (after pouring over reveiws before I took the plunge and ordered the product) that I should also write a reveiw to help that person who is undecided to go ahead and take the plunge too.    I have really curly, thick, color treated hair.  I have gotten relaxers and Keratin treatments (which I loved) all in an effort to \\&quot;tame the frizz\\&quot;.  The Keratin treatments are nice, however they are temporary, time-consuming and expensive!  Well I am about 1 1/2 months in after a Keratin treatment (KeraStraight from Ulta) and I can tell that my hair is starting to return back to it&#x27;s normal frizzy self.  I was dreading having to go in for another 4 to 5 hour Keratin treatment session and after watching one of those Wen infomercials decided to look into this \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; cleansing conditioner.  I ended up purchasing the WEN Cucumber Aloe.  I was going to buy the Lavendar Mint, however some reveiwers said it was too \\&quot;minty\\&quot;.  Maybe I will try it another time.  Anyway, after my first use, I am very happy with the results!  In fact, my hair feels BETTER than it did when I first got the keratin treatment done!  It is smooth and silky and NOT frizzy!  No flat iron necessary after I blow it dry straight with a round brush, awesome!  Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be going back for any more Keratin treatments!  One thing I was a little nervous about after reading some reveiws was that it wouldn&#x27;t really clean my hair.  I took the advice of some of the reviewers that had a positive experience and used enough (about 9 pumps of the product), since I have long thick hair.  I rinsed it out thoroughly and used a little as a leave in conditioner.  When I combed through it and dried it, my hair felt great and best of all clean! :)  I really hope this helps someone else make their decision a little easier.  Just like anyone else, I don&#x27;t like to waste my money and in this case I don&#x27;t feel like I have.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> I thought Wen products were amazing when I first started to use it. My hair looked beautiful and shiny, and I already had really great hair. About a 3-4 weeks into using the product, I noticed clumps and clumps of hair clogging the drain. The same thing happened to my mother, who started using it a few days after me (I used the almond one and used the cucumber one). We&#x27;re both white, she&#x27;s a brunette and I&#x27;m a redhead.  She and I have very different hair types as well.  We don&#x27;t live together, have different diets. etc. Wen is what we had in common.  I lost about 1/3 the thickness of my hair; I was devastated. I was left with this halo-like effect around my head from the short strands of hair left behind from the rest of my hair breaking off. I quit using it and though my hair stopped falling out, my hair is not the same. Ever after 8 months after not using Wen my hair was not as vibrant and strong as it used to be.  After using hair vitamins and some oil treatments, I&#x27;ve got my shine back, but my hair is still not as strong as it used to be.  When I part my hair, I still have the halo affect of short strands of hair sticking up and they&#x27;re not new hair, it&#x27;s hair that&#x27;s still breaking off.  I used to be able to floss with my hair - no joke! Now, it snaps at the lightest pull. Tons of flyaways, even though I used to have very smooth hair. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did. I don&#x27;t know how the effects could last so long, but they have. I&#x27;ve gotten blood tests to rule out thyroid and hormone problems, and I am healthy, not pregnant, etc. It&#x27;s too much of a coincidence and I have seen from other customer reviews on the web that this same thing has happened to other people.</li>
            <li> awesome stuff 5 stars</li>
            <li> My hair was wonderful while on vacation.  Even in humidity my unbraided hair held.  But when we got back to the hard water we have at home it made my hair gunky.  It seems to really build up and they sent me an additional package without me ordering it and I don&#x27;t want it.  If you have a water softener, go for WEN, I think you will like how your hair feels and looks. I would recommend using a different shampoo once a week to rid the build up if you  have hard water.</li>
            <li> I was told this shampoo got rid of dandruff and I have been using it for about 3 weeks now. I still have flakes. I don&#x27;t think they are as bad but they are still there.</li>
            <li> STORE: They didn&#x27;t send me a pump with the bottle, so unless you buy it separate you are going to have a hard time getting it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT: I have been using this about two weeks now, and use it as the directions say, (cleanse twice and use as leave in conditioner) but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it gets clean at all. I have to shampoo my hair every two or three time/days. It&#x27;s nice. It makes my hair soft... but it&#x27;s not REALLY worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am a professionally licensed hair dresser, I have access to the best stuff available but after getting sucked into a infomercial i wanted to try it, wen turned my high end purology shampoo and conditioner into the products that get stuck under the sink. It is a little pricey so I don&#x27;t think I am going to use it in my shop but I have been using it for over two weeks and love it. I have long past the shoulders hi-lited blonde hair. It is fine but it is not thick...it isn&#x27;t fine but I can get it up in one claw clip. It is well cared for but I damage it often. Im using  the cucumber aloe, I  section my hair into 4 sections, use 6-8 quick pumps for each section, I make sure to really focus on getting the product on my scalp and massage each section separately for at least a minute. After I apply it to all sections I apply a couple more pumps to the ends and then clip it up for the rest of my shower. I rinse it out in cool water but that is already a habit for me so no biggie. I am playing with it to see if I can get away with using less but either way I have already ordered my second and third orders. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> This is my only shampoo.  I use nothing else.  This Wen flavor, Cucumber Aloe is for my type of hair.  It comes out squeaky clean and just so shiny.  In the sunlight it is almost like a mirror it&#x27;s so shiny.  In fact I feel a bit funny because people kind of stare.  I haven&#x27;t had my hair looking so good in years.  I&#x27;ll never use traditional shampoo ever again.  I also use the styling creme.  Love it, love it!  I can&#x27;t say enough good about these products.  If you really want hair that is soft and shiny and bouncey, this is the ticket.  Chaz Dean should get real recognition for developing these products.  I understood, like him, that after shampooing, my hair was so tangled and knotted that it took a long time to comb out all the tangles and after that, my hair was suffering from breakage and split ends and it was just so damaged it look awful.  I have no split ends now because of Wen.  It&#x27;s so enjoyable to use too.  It&#x27;s so soft and creamy when you&#x27;re shampooing.  When rinsing, it&#x27;s so soft and squeaky clean, NOT tangled.  When I&#x27;m ready to blow dry, the comb goes right through, not one knot.  How about that?  I love it.  Chaz Dean also made a new \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; called Pomegranate.  It smells so sweet and fruity.  I got that one.  I have all of them.  The only one that didn&#x27;t smell so hot was Tea Tree.  It was great on my hair, but the smell was a bit odd.</li>
            <li> I like this product, it is rich and soothing, leaving a nice and comfortable feeling after using. My hair feels soft and it is easy to comb, also it gives extra volume. But I wouldn&#x27;t say it helps with oily sculp, I dont see any difference after a few weeks of using it at all. Also, it takes a lot of time (not for a quick wash) and I have to do a lot of pumps and rub it into my sculp - so it is not efficient at all. Plus, it is pretty pricey, I would expect to see more for this price. I don&#x27;t regert about ordering this product, it is nice, but definately I will not go for it again.</li>
            <li> I have seen so many products claim to make a huge difference in your hair but have yet to find one that actually backed it up, until now. Wen is amazing. I was worried about using it properly so I studied the instructions and even found a few videos on the net that gave more info. The process sounds like it might be daunting but honestly it was less work than using a separate shampoo and conditioner. My hair is thinning on top but about 3 inches past my shoulders in length. I didn&#x27;t use half of what the directions suggests for my lenth due to the thinness of my hair. What you really need to do is use your best judgment and just use enough to saturate the hair from root to tip.   Here is my process..    I used cold water to rinse the hair first, then used a few pumps and massaged into my scalp first at the crown and then at the nape or back of my head. I massaged it in for a minute or two. Then I used a few more pumps for the ends and worked it through with my fingers first for a minute, then used a wide tooth comb. I clipped it up and let it soak while I finished my shower. Finally, I rinsed with a half gallon of room temperature distilled water just for an added clean. (I have hard water.) I toweled the ends gently and wrapped my hair in the towel.    I wasn&#x27;t really expecting to see much after the first use but I could tell a huge difference in the texture right away. I decided to just blow dry my hair with no other products to better judge the results and seriously, WOW! My hair is so soft and shiny I can&#x27;t stop touching it and running my hands through it. It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s not my hair at all. I normally use several products from leave-in conditioners to thickening foams and none of those combined come close to the results I achieved after one use of Wen.     If this stuff gets better with use I&#x27;m in for some amazing hair experiences. I really don&#x27;t believe one product can work for everyone, but this one sure blew me away. It&#x27;s seriously worth a try if you haven&#x27;t found anything else that works. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is the only product by WEN that I&#x27;ll use. I don&#x27;t know why, but this specific one makes my hair AMAZING - not too oily, not too dry. Soft but can still style it. Smells great and feels great too! Nothing like it. Once you use this you&#x27;ll NEVER want to go back to a store conditioner!</li>
            <li> I have fine, frizzy, curly hair that was hard to manage and dull.  Shine is like doll&#x27;s hair, and soooo strong now.  No breakage or stretching and healed my dead ends.  I was going to get 2 inches cut off and now i dont have to.  I used to have to use a round brush to blow dry straight in sections and now just my fingers, but somehow still dries curly with out blow drying.  LOVE IT!!! Basically it makes your hair do what you tell it to while increasing strength, shine, and volume.</li>
            <li> Smells so clean.  Only problem is that my hair is thin and sparse. It does leave my hair soft but kind of oily.  I would still recommend Wen for people with thicker hair.  It does give you a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product through AMAZON before. I will continue purchasing here because I&#x27;am not locked into a monthly price. GOOD CLEANSING CONDITIONER.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen for about two years and I loved it. Bought a bottle on Amazon, shipped by Wen and the cleansing conditioner caused scabs all over my scalp. After two trips to the dermatologist, trying to figure out what was causing my problem, I threw the bottle away and no more scabs. Is Wen sending an inferior product through Amazon?</li>
            <li> I suffer from Psorasis and the doctor recommended this as my conditioner. It would help get rid of the smell of the strong shampoos I have to use and not hurt my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ok.. It&#x27;s a lot and just don&#x27;t think it does that much. I will continue to shop around.</li>
            <li> I really like wen cleansing,,, My beutition notice the difference in my hair when she cut it..She said it was soft not frizzy and shinny... I found using it every other day was great.... worth the money...</li>
            <li> I have lots of shoulder length hair. I followed the directions but  used about a third of the recommended amount and still could not tolerate how greasy it left my hair. Since it was so expenive I am using a tiny bit as a creme rinse on the ends of my hair. I&#x27;m sure it works for some people but not my hair type.</li>
            <li> After watching all the commercials about this shampoo I decided to spend money and try it...well.. the feeling while I was in the shower with this thing on my hair was different, I liked the way my hair felt in the shower, but as soon as you wash it off and dry your hair, there is no difference at all...the hair is still dry, a lot of flyaways, etc. So, this was my first and my last purchase of this shampoo. I tried this shampoo in different amounts and time but the result was the same.</li>
            <li> I purchased the cucumber aloe [[ASIN:B003HFEGBY WEN Cucumber Aloe Cleansing Conditioner 16 oz]], followed the directions (wow- that first usage was 1/5 of the 16 ounce bottle) to the letter, combed it through with a widetoothed comb and rinsed and rinsed and rinsed with cool/warm water and my hair was oily (after gently blow drying and finger styling- I don&#x27;t use a brush on my hair, ever) and my eyes burned.  The menthol is so strong in this product, it&#x27;s ridiculous.  Since the FAQs said more is more, I tried the next morning and used about 4 pumps more than the recommended 12 pumps on each of the four sections and my hair wasn&#x27;t oily, but it also wasn&#x27;t easier to comb through, wasn&#x27;t any softer or more managable than my normal shampoo and conditioner (Dove Daily Moisture).  $7 a day for shampoo/conditioner is ridiculous- I can get the salon size (huge) of the Dove with a pump for $12 each at Sam&#x27;s Club (wholesale club) and it lasts 3-4 months. HHMM, $7 per day versus a quarter a day... I&#x27;m sticking with Dove.</li>
            <li> I love the product. I love what it does for my hair, especially as a leave in conditioner on the ends. If I could change anything, it would be the cost. Even just $10 less, would make a world of difference. I won&#x27;t buy it again until I cut my hair short so it will last much longer. Right now my hair reaches down my back to the bottom of the shoulder blades and I have to use 30-40 pumps/shower. It goes quickly.</li>
            <li> Tends to make my hair overly oily...never smells or feels clean for more than a couple hours. Hair is too flat and weighed down. I can only use this as a conditioner once or twice a week. Too expensive!</li>
            <li> Cannot use it every day as it makes my fine hair heavy and flat.  Great for my son&#x27;s cradle cap, no more flaki skin on his head.  Nice smelling.</li>
            <li> Cleans hair very well but don&#x27;t believe there is any difference in my hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this cleansing conditioner every day. I use it twice per week. I use my regular shampoo all other days. I really like how well it conditions my hair but if I use it every day my hair gets greasy looking no matter how well I rinse it.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was sucked in by the advertising...but I did do my research first. I really liked the idea of a sulfate-free wash because I have to wash my hair daily and I know doing that damages it. I also liked the idea of less weighed down hair. Unfortunately, though, I did not have the best experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this for several weeks, and I tried it with less product, more product, washing twice in one shower, pairing it with the styling product, and even tried using it every other day. The results I had with it were that the first 1-2 days my hair felt AMAZING. it felt soft, and light, and clean. But around Day 3, it started feeling really greasy and weighed down...and not clean. I even tried doubling the amount I used (the product says there&#x27;s no way to use \\&quot;too much\\&quot;), and that did not help. And that is the other thing- you have to use a ton of product, and at the price it costs, you will go through it way faster than your traditional shampoo (and this bottle is not big).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However...the upside is that for a day or two after I use it, my hair DOES feel really nice. So I ended up finding a use for it by incorporating it into my weekly routine and I use it once a week. Does that make it worth purchasing? Probably not, but I will still do this until the product runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend trying to get a week&#x27;s worth of samples of this before buying, as it seems like the experiences really do vary from person to person.</li>
            <li> I love the product and have used it before.  Very disappointed that the pump was not included in purchase, as it should have been.</li>
            <li> I used the product and I was amazed of the different way the hair feels after using this conditioning cleanser. A lot softer, easy to handle and comb,and it smells good, too, without being overpowering. I will continue using it, especially if I determine that it does have some beneficial effect on the hair with the continuous use.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try after seeing an advertisement. I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does. I noticed a difference with my hair after the first wash - it felt softer and had more body. I don&#x27;t enjoy the smell, it smells a bit medicine-y, so I would recommend a different one.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that was getting damaged from heat processing and ponytail abuse - I heard about this product and decided to give it a try.  After one use I could tell a difference but after two uses I can see dramatic improvement.  I will definitely order this product again and the seller got it to me in only a couple of days.    Thank you!  ritas</li>
            <li> I will recommend WEN to absolutely anyone.  WEN has changed my view of shampoo and conditioner. One bottle of WEN replaces both other products and it does a better job. WEN has made my hair feel softer and look shinier and brighter with each use. WEN makes me happy:) I have been using it for three weeks and I was sold after the second great hair day. Oh, and the great hair days continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long hair that tangles easily. WEN works wonderfully as a leave-in conditioner that helps prevent tangles. I also use WEN for a shaving cream and it soars in that category as well. I will bring my WEN with me whenever I travel so I don&#x27;t have to use any other product. Application of WEN does require a large amount and it is expensive. However, it is so worth it. Seriously. Make the switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the WEN almond mint cleansing conditioner and I prefer the aloe cucumber. Both are great.</li>
            <li> Pros: tangle free after washing it, no frizzy hair, looks healthy and smell great.  Cons: I have to use it every other day because it will leave my hair oily if I use it everyday, so I alternate with regular shampoo and conditioner and then Wen.</li>
            <li> This works well with my hair....the other types are not compatible with my hair...Cucumber is for me.</li>
            <li> This one of my favorites, because my hair is thin and it doesn&#x27;t way it down.</li>
            <li> My sister in law bought Wen and gave me the cucumber aloe cleansing conditioner because she didn&#x27;t have fine hair.  I of course heard about Wen, but didn&#x27;t ever intend to buy it because I couldn&#x27;t see how it was worth the price especially when you had to use so much etc. Since it was free I used what she gave me.  I was amazed. I am a natural blonde, but I go a shade lighter.  My hair is a little longer than shoulder length and very fine, but beginning to thicken up (Postpartum hair loss).  Right away I noticed that it took less time to blow it dry, the color was brighter and it was so smooth, but not heavy or greasy looking at all.  Just light and soft and clean with a lot of volume.  I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting anything.  I just used the free little tube because it was sitting there! Later that day I got a trim and the stylist told me how healthy my hair looked and how soft and asked how much I shampooed.  My second day hair was so managable and I was able to wear it down again instead of having to hide a texture or oily problem.  I used it again after 3 days and had the same great results.  Then I ran out.  Today I used my regular shampoo and conditioner and styled it the same.  Yuck.  My color looks brassy, the ends are dry, it&#x27;s full of fly aways, and I am certain it will look greasy tomorrow. I haven&#x27;t been particularly fond of my hair, but I didn&#x27;t figure there was much I could do about it and so far using the volumnizing Pantene conditioner was the only thing that seemed to help.  I didn&#x27;t know my hair could look that good.  I am so hooked.  Must have.</li>
            <li> I tried  Wen Conditioning Cleanser in the Cucumber Aloe formula after hearing rave reviews. I have very frizzy, dry hair and usually use another high-end brand of shampoo, but wanted to give WEN a try after seeing the informercials and hearing how great it is.&lt;br /&gt;I realize that it not supposed to lather or bubble up like a normal shampoo, but I still found it difficult to work through my hair, even though I followed the label directions to the letter. It left my hair with a gross-feeling build-up and, what upset me even more, it completely stripped my hair color after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;I dye my hair black and my hair turned brownish red after a couple of uses (I suspect it contains Henna although I did not verify this before throwing it out). It also stripped my hair color to such an extent that my grays not only came through, they actually seemed a more vibrant silver, forcing me to re-color my hair.&lt;br /&gt;On top of it all, it did nothing to improve the smoothness or texture of my hair. I still had frizz after using my flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff went in the trash, and while it apparently works for some people, it definitely did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I really like the Wen Products. I have tried this one and the almond mint. I find I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair as often with the almond as I do with the cucumber. Over all, I do recommend the Wen products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old and grey, but have finally found the ultimate hair product! Thank you Mr. Dean. Sincerely, Your biggest East Coast fan</li>
            <li> Perhaps if you already have healthy hair... it&#x27;ll make it &#x27;seem&#x27; a little healthier..?  I don&#x27;t know, but what I do know is that it does nothing to tame or correct damaged hair...nothing at all.  It just simply does not do what they claim. Bottom line.</li>
            <li> Wen is AMAZING!!! My hair has never looked better. I&#x27;m 38 &amp; have colored for 20 years. I have medium length oily hair (a lot of fine hair) and absolutely love this product. My husband bought it for me as a gift. Everyone asks me how my hair looks so healthy now. I&#x27;ll never go back to regular shampoo.   One tip: use way less than recommended. I only use 4 pumps in each section of hair (top, bottom, left, right) and leave it in for 10 min. Amazing results! Try it, you will love it. :)</li>
            <li> This is my first time writing an online review for a product but I thought I would share my story in case it helps anyone else. I started experience hair loss about a year and half ago. My hair loss was not sever but I definitely noticed A LOT more hair coming out in the shower, on my hairbrush, on my clothes, all over my house and car. I had no idea what to attribute my hair loss to as I am only 25 and in good health. For approximately a year I tried many different kinds of shampoos and conditioners from the cheapest brands to the most expensive and I am terrified of calculating how much it cost me.  During the year of my intense hair loss, I definitely noticed my part getting wider and it made me devastated. I have fine hair, a little on the thin side and my hair never grows past my shoulders. With that description of my hair, you can now imagine how \\&quot;more than normal\\&quot; hair loss that lasts over a year can affect your hair part, length and fullness.  The hair loss problem was taking a toll on my self esteem so I finally decided to do something about it as the countless shampoo bottles accumulating under my sink were not doing my hair any justice. However, my review is two fold as at the same time that I decided to order Wen after randomly watching an infomercial on a Saturday morning, I also decided to order the PHYTO &#x27;PhytophanÃ¨re&#x27; Dietary Supplement for Hair &amp; Nails.  I started using PHYTO vitamins along with Wen about 4 months ago(the reason I am on Amazon right now is because I have to reorder my Wen). Anyway, let me describe the difference these two products made in my hair over the last 4 months. I noticed that my hair loss was virtually non-existent after about 3 weeks of using the vitamins. I also noticed that my hair was not as dry or brittle after the first few times of using Wen. Now, 4 months later, my hair part is starting to grow in, my hair is longer than I remember it being in about 10 years and my hair is not dry, brittle or damaged and thereforeI don&#x27;t have to get it trimmed every 2 months. I am now able to grow out my hair and it is not falling out by the hand fulls anymore.  Now which one of these 2 product made a bigger difference in my hair? Well, I will say that they both made an equal difference as the PHYTO vitamins made the difference from the inside, while Wen has made all the difference from the outside!  I wash my hair with Wen every other day. I use much less than the recommended dose because, as I mentioned earlier, my hair is of fine texture and 1 Wen bottle has lasted me about 4 months. I blow dry my hair every other day and I also get highlights every 3 to 4 months. Wen is also really gentle on color and I&#x27;ve noticed that my color has lasted longer with Wen. The bottom line is that I could not be happier with the condition of my hair right now.I am fully aware that I will never have \\&quot;Goldielocks\\&quot; hair however, my hair is in the best shape is has been in about 10 years and I have Wen to thank for it.  If you are experiencing hair loss or want to grow out your hair, I would recommend using these two products together and hopefully it will make the same difference in your hair as it did in mine.</li>
            <li> I read multiple product reviews before purchasing this product.  I didn&#x27;t want to purchase this through the TV website because I hate automated orders and delivery--I&#x27;d rather purchase items when I need them.  Amazon was perfect.  As many reviewers have said, it does not take near as much product as the directions recommend.  I have color treated hair that is cut in a shoulder length bob style, and 2-3 squirts of this product is a BIG plenty.  The other key, is rinsing well--about 2-3 minutes.  After using the WEN cleansing conditioner for about 2-3 weeks, the condition of my hair is much better and the color has stayed truer too.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I find that the Wen C-C does a great job and my hair is no longer dry in the morning.  If I followed the directions, I would be lathering about 1/4 cup per shower into my hair.  I use much less and achieve fine results.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  I have used the Lavender and Mint for awhile but decided to try this because it is recommended for fine hair.  It works well. I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> Ever since Head &amp; Shoulders, I realized that pyrithione zinc was a problem for me. As a dandruff sufferer, my mom passed this cleansing conditioner onto me because she did not like the product. I have dry, frizzy hair but it all went away when I started taking night showers. That&#x27;s when I realized how cool Wen felt on my scalp. It has a wonderful scent and gives me a cooling sensation. Although it thoroughly cleanses my scalp, it does not get rid of dandruff, but does control it. At this time, many shampoos/conditioners made me itchy, but Wen was one of the only ones that did not and gave me long lasting results.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in my hair being softer and smoother but you have to use a very large amount.  This being so, the pricey bottle doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Ok, just got my cucumber aloe on March 5 , tried it today, March 8, it is very nice, but on the back, the 3rd and 4th listed ingredient is CETYL ALCOHOL AND CETEARYL ALCOHOL. I thought this is suppose to be all natural????</li>
            <li> I love that my hair still feels so clean, even without the suds. There&#x27;s a foaming action that gives you a similar effect, but it&#x27;s better for your hair and scalp. ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I have healthy, uncolored, short hair. This made my hair too soft, therefore difficult to style. My sister-in-law recommended it and she loves it! I suppose it just depends on your hair type.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that gets oily looking. NOT with this product! I will always use this. I have always had to shampoo my hair daily, with the Cucumber Aloe line I can skip a day and my hair still looks great. I highly recommend this to anyone with fine hair. Product says to use alot (16 pumps) I only use 6 or 8 and get these great results.</li>
            <li> I didnt like this at all. No problems with purchase or shipping just the product. The scent is very medicinal. It left my hair dry and stiff. I threw it away after the third try. Ive used cranberry mint b4 n its ok...I hate the minty smell tho...yuck. Ill not buy another chaz dean product. Overpriced and overrated. I truly think Suave shampoo is a better product than this.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine straight hair but it was damaged from swimming and from coloring it light blonde. I tried WEN and in the beginning I thought it was the greatest hair product ever. It made my hair soft and shiny, but it is so expensive. Then, I started to notice my light blonde hair changing to golden, then brassy to the point that the darker roots turned almost brassy orange. Then, I tried getting the color out by coloring with a very light pale blonde color. It did not take. I did not do one thing. I&#x27;m an older person, have been coloring my hair for decades and I have never had my hair turn gold. And, I&#x27;ve never been unable to color my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up using 5, FIVE, boxes of white hair color in order to get the brassy gold color out. Then, on top of that, I got fly aways now, which I have not ever had in my life. It&#x27;s like the WEN works for about a year, and then it makes your hair too soft to the point that it starts to break off really badly. Now I have both tons of flyaways for the first time in my life, and I cannot color my hair. My neighbor have me two big bottles of WEN for free because she said it broke her skin out, so I used it as a leave in, and sure enough, I tried to highlight my hair the other day, and it would not take at all. You have to stop using it for a couple of weeks to be able to color your hair light blonde. And, then if you use WEN again, it permanently dies it gold again. What a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very, very expensive, the price keeps going up too, and it eventually breaks your hair off, it will give you tons of flyaways. What a mess. And, all the attempts to get the gold color out ruin the hair. It&#x27;s like a permanent color that you can&#x27;t get out.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Wen Cucumber Aloe Cleansing Conditioner for two weeks now. As far as my hair type, I have color-treated blonde hair, normally frizzy, wavy, dry, damaged and brittle.  Because my hair is frizzy and wavy, I have to straighten it.  I have wanted to get my hair back to being soft, healthy and where it will grow long again.  Last year my hair was in great condition even though I did color and straighten it and it grew long.  For the past few months I couldn&#x27;t remember what I had used a year ago that made my hair so healthy and grow.  I tried Redkin All Soft and other salon shampoos and conditioners and Redkin, Nexxus and Paul Mitchell styling products and kept trying to find something that would work.  I finally remembered that last year I had ordered Wen and had used the Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner (I don&#x27;t remember them having the Cucumber Aloe or Fig Cleansing Conditioners available at the time).  I used Wen for about 5 months and then quit since I was receiving too many bottles of the Cleansing Conditioner from the auto-shipment program while being charged when I don&#x27;t use as much as recommended and therefore the bottles they sent me lasted longer.  After I used the last bottle, I switched back to regular shampoo and conditioner thinking that my hair was healthy enough after using Wen that I could continue forward with regular salon and store purchased shampoo and conditioner.  I was horribly wrong and my hair paid the price severely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I quit using Wen and went back to using Salon and store purchased Shampoo and Conditioners my hair became severely damaged with split ends and became so brittle it started breaking so badly that people thought I had cut my long hair.  I had to finally have it trimmed to stop it from breaking and even with the expensive salon products, my hair was still brittle and breaking.  I was spending so much money on conditioner and styling products and was desperate to try anything if it would help my hair become healthy again so it would grow longer and not break.  I am not a short-hair girl and look much better with longer hair and when my hair looks great, I feel great and hate feeling self-conscious about my hair.  When you add how much money I spent on various salon products, it was more than I would have spent on the Wen Cleansing Conditioner and the remoist cream and I feel better about using 2 products, as opposed to four or five different products that I had to use to get my hair somewhat straight, but these were damaging my hair.  Since I remembered three weeks ago that I had used Wen on my hair which is what made it so healthy so it would grow and not break, I found a website where I can order the regular 5 piece 30 day supply kit as needed instead of having to purchase directly from Wen through their auto-shipment program since the purchased 30 day bottle actually lasts me longer than 30 days since I don&#x27;t use as much as the bottle recommends and the price was affordable compared to ordering through Wen&#x27;s website with the auto-shipment and automatic billing set-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not go back to using any other Shampoo or Conditioner and I will continue to use Wen.  After using Wen and then going back to regular salon shampoo and conditioner and the damage and severe breakage it caused to my hair, I will only use Wen going forward.  Wen is helping to repair my hair and I will not use anything else.  I spend less using Wen than I did with the multiple salon products and even if Wen would cost more, I would pay to continue to use Wen for my hair to be healthy and look great and I would budget to use Wen, although since the cost is less than I have spent using 4 or 5 Salon products I am spending less on Wen and using Wen is saving me money and lasts longer than the Salon products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Cucumber Aloe Cleansing Conditioner.  It makes my hair feel soft, but I don&#x27;t need as much as is recommended.  If I use too much, such as what thebottle recommends, my hair will feel a little heavy.  I do let it set in my hair while I am in the shower for about 5 minutes and massage it through my hair throughout that time.  I just ordered the Fig Cleansing Conditioner since I&#x27;m anxious to try that next since it wasn&#x27;t available a year ago and want to see if it works even better than the Cucumber Aloe.  In two weeks, I can definitely tell a difference with my hair. It is shiny, looks healthier and isn&#x27;t frizzy and is soft. I don&#x27;t spend as much time straightening it repeatedly as I did before with the salon products and my hair doesn&#x27;t look damaged and brittle as it did two weeks ago.  I don&#x27;t expect Wen to fix my hair overnight since I had months of bad experience with the salon products, however, my hair feels better and almost like it was a year ago when it was healthy from using Wen for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is dry, damaged, brittle or needs help and you want it to be healthy, Wen is definitely worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful shampoo! It&#x27;s the only one I use these days, and I will more than likely not switch - great body, softness and shine.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in order to supplement a QVC auto-shipment because I tend to go through a bottle of Wen pretty fast.  I figured that it was cheaper on Amazon, so I might as well try to save a few bucks.  I bought the exact same formulation (Cucumber Aloe) that I got from QVC, however this stuff is different.  It is definitely not as moisturizing, yet at the same time it leaves my hair greasy.  My hair is also breaking really easily now, and it never did that when I was using the Wen I got from QVC.  Long story short - I absolutely LOVE Wen... my hair has never looked better.  This, however, is NOT Wen.</li>
            <li> I read reviews of Wen before I purchased the Cucumber/Aloe. It left my hair feeling heavy even though it felt clean enough. It didn&#x27;t look any shinier or less dry at the ends, so I guess I won&#x27;t recommend the product and won&#x27;t be buying it again. Too expensive and not as advertised results...</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Its important people learn how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Divide hair in half when wet, use about 2-3 tablespoons per half, rub with hands and then go straight to the scalp and scrub/cover all scalp, where most of the oil is on our head, do the second half of head also, then rub the cream through to the ends&lt;br /&gt;then, comb through. Clip up for approx. 4 minutes. Stay busy doing other things: shaving or washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does remove oil/smell. It has a menthol eucalyptus smell and tingles so it is cleaning the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Rinse. Depending on how oily or dry your hair is you can use a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Im not completely sold on this product yet. I have fine oily hair. I was hoping this would cleanse it and help repair. Its just not cleansing it well, I am still needing to use shampoo which is discouraging. I will keep trying and hope it works better... As of now, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Ive been using it about a week.</li>
            <li> I use it for getting all the extras left by the other kind of shampoos. it really makes a difference :)</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed WEN products, but am still trying to find the one that&#x27;s right for my hair. I&#x27;m only a week in, so I haven&#x27;t decided if this is it.</li>
            <li> Bought for Granddaughter, have to put a lot of it in your hair and rub it in let it sit 5 min then comb it thru, not sure she did it right because she&#x27;s 11 and needs to hurry in the mornings.  Did not work for her</li>
            <li> This is not the real Wen. It does not smell like, look like, or feel like the real Wen. Additionally, it does not come sealed and the labeling on the bottle is not correct. It is probably some drugstore knockoff pumped into a similar bottle. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> Love WEN!  I&#x27;m definately a WEN girl!  It really works!  You have to get used to the no foaming thing at first, but after you do you&#x27;ll love how your hair feels!  Love it!</li>
            <li> This IS NOT a wen product!!!! There is nothing about it that resembles a wen product.  I use the Cucumber Aloe from wen and this IS NOT IT!!!!  I&#x27;m angry to have spent money and energy on this!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo has changed my hair. I had nice hair before but since I started using this shampoo my hair is shinier, breaks less, and I get fewer hair cuts. I usually buy it once a year on QVC where I get a gallon size at a low price. I missed that sale this year and found it on Amazon at a great price. Once you find the right formula for your hair type you will like it. Most people complain it leaves your hair greasy but that is usually because they have the wrong formula for their hair type or use too much. Also it is not supposed to strip your hair. It is designed to do the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> When I first tried WEN I admit I was skeptical that it could do all it claimed.  I saw the difference in my hair with the first use.  My hair wasn&#x27;t just soft it was truly clean.  It does everything it claims and much more.  You won&#x27;t need all the extra hair products. I didn&#x27;t have my WEN with me one day and used a regular shampoo and conditioner.  My hair felt like it had a film on it. Now it&#x27;s the only product I will use on my hair--it&#x27;s the only one I need.  Spend the extra and take care of your hair. It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried Wen Cleansing Conditioner. Like other reviewers, I found that you need to experiment with the quantity you use and be sure to completely wash it out of your hair, otherwise it does make my hair greasy after styling (I don&#x27;t use any styling products). My hair is medium length and starting to thin now that I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s. I wanted something that would treat dry scalp (often a cause of hair loss), and add volume. This product seems to do the trick. The Cucumber Aloe has a nice fragrance, it washes out easily, and I like the way my hair feels silky soft even the next day.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested something mild like Wen, because I was using harsh cleanser for my oily scalp. This stuff is great, feel cool on application and my hair is soooo soft.</li>
            <li> Really liked the feel of the product, but the results do not last long and it is too expensive to use. Yes, it is supposed to replace both your shampoo and conditioner, but the amount you need to use each time is triple (if not more) the amount you would use otherwise. Also, you need to use the product more often ... every other day, because (at least to me) it did not have a lasting result. Consequently, this product ends ups being super expensive! On a side note, I also noticed that a lost a lot of hair each time ... I though that there was some initial adjustment to the product, but it never changed so I decided to stop using it. I remain on the hunt for a good shampoo that would not make me loose so much hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen the infomercials and I&#x27;ve even met hairdressers that swear by this product, but both my daughter and I tried it and were disappointed.  She has frizzy hair and I have very straight hair, and neither of us thought this was any different from other, less expensive conditioners.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but wanted to try something for my colored (red) hair that fades so fast. I also have oily hair so I must wash it everyday. This product works! Not only has my hair kept its brightness much longer than before, but I can actually skip a day of \\&quot;washing\\&quot; if I want to. It is expensive but I have found that I can use about 2/3 of what they say (I have shoulder length thick but fine hair) and it still works great. The extra pump as a leave-in conditioner is also a great idea. I highly recommend it...if you can afford it.</li>
            <li> This is the only scent of Wen that I use &amp; I Absolutly love it! It has done wonders for my hair. Finding products for my hair is difficult due to my serverly mixed ethnicity. This product has not only saved me money, but also cut my hair routine time in half since I don&#x27;t have many split ends anymore. This also came way faster than I thought. Less than 4 business days.</li>
            <li> I have the typical oily skin/scalp with dry hair ends.  This product surprised me by really, truly getting my hair clean but still leaving the ends conditioned.  The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the price - but since it really does replace both a shampoo and a conditioner even that isn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> This product smells good and has decreased the amount of detangler that I require but it is too expensive to continue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wen product since October and my hairdresser was shocked at all the new hair growth I had when I had my last appointment in May. It is so healthy and manageable, and no tangles! My hair is so soft all the time now. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Of all the Wen cleansing scents I&#x27;ve tried, I like this one the best!  After washing with it, your scalp has a tingling clean feeling.  I use the Wen cleansing conditioner a couple times a week, and use regular shampoo and conditioner on alternating days.  I have to say that as I use Wen more and more, I am starting to not like traditional shampoo and conditioner.  I can really feel a difference in my hair when I use Wen!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t understand why exactly this stuff is SOOO expensive. WHAT could be in the ingredients that cost so much....?. It&#x27;s certainly not magical....it&#x27;s just a hair product.  Oh wait!  It&#x27;s the infomercials we&#x27;re paying for!!!....I like it, but it&#x27;s certainly far too expensive to keep using.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it as much as the original mint. Menthol overpowers cucumber. With my hair type, it also doesn&#x27;t work as well. (Med to thin long hair; Tends to be oily the second day) three stars because it&#x27;s still more convenient than shampoo and conditioner separately, and I like that it has fewer unnecessary ingredients.</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo according to directions (which I thought were lacking) and it was nice the first few times but after 2 weeks I felt like my hair wasn&#x27;t staying clean and it was very limp and hard to style.  Also didn&#x27;t help humid weather friz.</li>
            <li> I am glad I tried the cleansing conditioner again. It took several weeks, but now seeing results, my hair is wavy with oily scalp and dry ends-color treated. It now is much better conditioned, and feels clean, not oily. Don&#x27;t skip the part where you add water and \\&quot;lather\\&quot; through. Combing it through is important too! I had tried it TWICE before in the past several years, but didn&#x27;t like the time and cost involved, but am very glad I tried it again. I think the fig is a little better for the dry ends, so will get that one next. I have tried so many other expensive shampoos and conditioners, so when you figure in trying other products, and the fact your hair looks great with WEN,  the time and cost are worth it!</li>
            <li> I really like the Wen products.  I do not use them every day, only 1-2 x a week but as long as you rinse really well it works great!  I order thru Amazon because I don&#x27;t want to be on Wen&#x27;s automatic delivery.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. My hair is color treated, very fried BUT extremely oily at the roots. This product works great with smoothing out my hair, although its a little hard to get used to. I honestly use regular shampoo on the bottom half of my hair and use Wen only the top half (mainly because this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap). This works fine for me. I then use the Wen as a leave in conditioner which helps a lot once I start to dry. I definitely recommend at least trying it.</li>
            <li> I have used wen for a long time.  This conditioner has the same qualities but I do NOT like the smell.</li>
            <li> I love the Wen products - my husband now uses it as well.  Purchasing my Wen from Amazon is fast and I don&#x27;t have to sign up for an automatic delivery.</li>
            <li> I did not like this styling creme.  It left my hair feeling limp, oily and dull.  I tried many different variations in amount and hairsprays with similar results.  Will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Packaged well, arrived promptly, very cooling formula..nice for summer</li>
            <li> I have heard so much about WEN that I had to buy it. I followed the directions perfectly &#x27;30-40 pumps, massage in for a minute, let stand 3-5 minutes, rinse thoroughly&#x27; and when I got out my hair had waxy build up. I was ticked I mean wasn&#x27;t the whole point of this not to have waxy build up? To have volume? I tried twice more just to see if I had messed up, but no each time my hair came out with grease and wax. Finally I googled &#x27;WEN instructions&#x27; and it came up with a video on YouTube.com Here&#x27;s the proper way that should be on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. rinse hair thoroughly, like for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;2. 5-10 pumps (more if you need) and put on the top part of your hair, massage in&lt;br /&gt;3. 5-10 pumps under your hair massage in&lt;br /&gt;4. 5-10 pumps on the left side&lt;br /&gt;5. 5-10 pumps on the right side&lt;br /&gt;6. any extra pumps on the bottom or top, just fill in&lt;br /&gt;7. Slightly tilt your head in the water until it gets a little wet&lt;br /&gt;8. massage in your scalp for a minute, this should be easier because of the water you added&lt;br /&gt;9. comb through&lt;br /&gt;10. clip it up and let stay for a solid 3-5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;11. rise thoroughly making sure you don&#x27;t feel anything in your hair&lt;br /&gt;optional&lt;br /&gt;12. before you get out use a pump or so to run though the ends of your hair like leave in conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you see how detailed that is? That&#x27;s what should be on the back of the bottle because I can tell you now I only wash my hair with WEN and it is not greasy, no waxy build up and my hair looks really healthy. I have fine blonde hair that I dye so it is slightly damaged, but I have a ton of it so it can be a pain to get the shampoo out from under the layers, I really really like the Cucumber Aloe and just bought a bigger bottle, my hair is mid back and I find I really only need 5-7 pumps per section so don&#x27;t use the 40 plus pumps, saves the product and me money.</li>
            <li> My baby fine hair literally melted after a botched coloring.  It seemed like I lost half my hair.  It broke off in clumps and what was left was stripped to nothing.  My shoulder length hair was see through when I looked at my shadow outside.  When I saw Wen demonstrated on QVC I thought this product might be my salvation.  I dove right in and bought the GALLON size from them which has lasted me over a year.  I HATED it!!!  My scalp felt like it was grimy.  It left a slimy scum everywhere- my tub, shower walls, down my back, neck and face.  Gave me a rash and I was always itching.  I had told a few friends about what I had done and they all got a good laugh.  They did say my hair looked better though so I hung in there.  Many times, thinking I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore I searched online for other natural, non sulfate alternatives and switched.  But without fail someone would say &amp;#34;did you stop using your shampoo?&amp;#34; as they inspected my hair.  Eventually I stopped itching.  My scalp got used to not being washed which is how I think of it.  It&#x27;s just become my routine and I don&#x27;t think about it anymore.  Now my huge jug is gone- something I&#x27;ve been looking forward to for a year.  I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m back for more.  My hair has grown back and it&#x27;s never been like this.  I have thick hair!  It looks better now than it did when I had extensions.  It may have been due to &amp;#34;coatings&amp;#34; but my uber healthy hair is there underneath.  It grew back healthy and strong.  First time in my almost 50 years I can say that.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m hooked on Wen but since my hair isn&#x27;t greasy/oily anymore (another lifetime first!!!) I&#x27;m going to try lavender instead.  Was checking prices here but I&#x27;ll probably go back to QVC for another gallon.</li>
            <li> I have oily fine (naturally) curly hair and every shampoo I&#x27;ve used seemed to require me to use some type of gel as well as a blow dryer but once i saw the infomercial for wen I decided to give it a try to see if it&#x27;d help my hair&#x27;s health. Turns out this product is making my hair go back to life!! It&#x27;s gradually making it shinier, softer, and making me spend less money on other harmful products and I only use my blow dryer every other day now!! I rinse it out with warm water until i feel no more product on my hair then give it about 30 secs in cold water so once it&#x27;s dry it&#x27;ll have shine and less oil. Because of my oily scalp I&#x27;ll use either a clarifying shampoo a couple times a week or apple cider vinegar mixed with chamomile and tea tree. Slowly it&#x27;s regaining its youth and best of all curls!!!My little locks are coming back soft and bouncy!!&#x3D;) It&#x27;s not perfect but over all I&#x27;m happy with it so I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo.   It made my hair feel softer, but it really made it more greasy.   I use it now maybe once a week just because it costed so musch.   I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again...too greasy...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the fence. I started using it as soon as I received it but then stopped because I thought there was a build up on my hair. It does leave your hair manageable and shiney. But right now I&#x27;m only using it once a week along with my old shampoo and conditioner. I do think the price is high because I need to use alot more of the product due to the length of my hair. I will give it another try before I decide to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I was just given this product  (the cucumber aloe) as a gift for Christmas and have used it several times and like it. I don&#x27;t see how this 16 oz bottle will last a full 30 days.. I am waiting to see how long it does last as this is my first bottle. I don&#x27;t know where everyone is getting the 30 to 40 pump instructions.. My bottle clearly states using &amp;#34;10 to 15 pumps more if hair is longer&amp;#34;.  I find that I can get away with about 8 or 9. my hair is fine and touches my shoulders. I do see that my hair is shinier and less frizzy after blow drying. I also find that I can skip a day washing my hair and my scalp at the roots is not greasy. Usually I wash my hair every day. I am sure this will vary from person to person.  My hair is color treated and the ends tend to get dry because I flat Iron my hair almost every day. I do find that this product is costly and at this point I do not know if it is affordable for me. I will have to wait and see.. However I do like it very much and so far it seems to be doing exactly as the infomercial states. March 8, 2016...... this is an update to my previous review after using this product for a while I noticed that my hair started falling out I thought it was my imagination but every time I washed my hair more hair would appear in my hands. After researching this product more I found that there was a class action lawsuit against them for hair loss please do the research your self before ordering this product I stopped using this almost a year ago and it has taken that long for my hair to grow back...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li> 7-26-16 Update. This product is being investigated by the FDA after they received &amp;#34;the largest number of reports ever associated with any cosmetic hair cleansing product,&amp;#34; including hair loss, breakage, balding, itching and rash. I feel lucky I only used this product for a few months (see original review below), and I figure the FDA investigation warrants me knocking this product from three stars to one.  I used WEN Cleansing Conditioner for about four or five months, but moved on to another product when I realized my colored hair was not as conditioned as it needs to be.  Here are my thoughts:  1. I have dry hair but an oily scalp.  While I didn&#x27;t have to use nearly the suggested amount on the bottle to clean it (I think for my long length, they recommend 24 pumps), I did have to use six to eight pumps.  I can&#x27;t imagine how quickly I would go through a bottle using the recommended amount!  2. I was fascinated that it cleaned my hair, but it actually wasn&#x27;t as moisturizing as the thick, emollient consistency suggested.  I guess, given that it&#x27;s basically just a fancy 2-in-1 shampoo (which don&#x27;t moisturize nearly as well as stand-alone conditioners), it makes sense.  This left my hair increasingly dry and dull.  I actually had to use a leave-in conditioner on my hair after washing it with this product.  3. I hated the fact that the pump quit working when there was well over a quarter of the product left in the bottle.  I understand the pump not working on the last few ounces, but come on!  Surprise, surprise... I didn&#x27;t get the results promised in the infomercial (which, by the way, I didn&#x27;t see until after I purchased the product elsewhere).  I don&#x27;t care how conditioner-like the consistency, this is just an over-hyped 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner.  If you don&#x27;t have over-processed hair like mine and just want light conditioning, this will work for you.  But so will the sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners in your corner drugstore.</li>
            <li> embrace your real hair</li>
            <li> I love Wen and what this product does for my hair, just love it.</li>
            <li> You have to wash your hair first because alone doesn&#x27;t make it clean enough, so what&#x27;s the point because you might as well use conditioner.</li>
            <li> This cucumber aloe cleansing conditioner is just like the one I ordered from Wen of which I&#x27;ve been using for a couple of months and I love this product. I wash my hair daily and color my hair and my hair is natural . I have been trying to find a product line to meet my needs and I finally have. My hair is healthier, and has more moisture and less breakage.</li>
            <li> I really liked how it made my hair look and feel..just like other scents better..like the peach..it was my favorite so far</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff. I&#x27;d rather actually wash my hair than just add more gunk to it</li>
            <li> Makes my very thin, fine hair look like it has a little more body. It has helped the fly away look that my hair had. Overall great product.</li>
            <li> Wen is amazing; I&#x27;ve used MANY products over the years for my brittle and tempermental hair, including high end organic products and Wen beats them all!  I&#x27;m recommending this to all my friends and family; after just two uses my hair has never felt stronger!  It&#x27;s usually such a pain to comb my hair out after washing, even after deep conditioning, because my hair is so thick and curly, but Wen makes it SO easy!  Just a few tiny tangles and voila!  I&#x27;m done.  Thanks Wen, I look forward to trying out more of your products!</li>
            <li> It had a nice smell. I usually love all Wen hair products. I have to say this cleansing conditioner made my hair oily. Compared to the other Wen products not as impressed.</li>
            <li> I finally caved in and bought this product and on the first use was panic stricken when my scalp, eyes and nose started burning like crazy.  There is menthol in all the wen line and where it&#x27;s close to the bottom of the list you wouldn&#x27;t think it would be that strong.  It was!  I had the stuff in for just about two minutes and my scalp was bright red.  Ended up washing my hair out with my regular shampoo three times and then conditioning so that I might be able to at least not have my hair suffer too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really think they should have a disclaimer on products like this that have a strong chemical in them for people who have sensitive skin.  I never would have given in if I had seen one.  And just so you know I don&#x27;t usually have any problems with mild exposure to methol or mints but this hurt like the dickens.  Please Beware!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting the best with all the mixed reviews. I have very fine hair that gets oily so it seemed like I would have the least chance of success with a product like this. Turns out it&#x27;s really awesome. I&#x27;m not sure how it does it but it leaves my hair feeling very soft and clean and full of volume. Maybe people aren&#x27;t using enough of the product so it&#x27;s not cleaning well enough?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the last 5 months now and recently found that my scalp is left with build-up that flakes like dandruff. I&#x27;ve always suffered from having an oily scalp so I tried the Cucumber Aloe, then the Pumpkin, then the Lavender formulas. I will say that I love the moisture that WEN gives my hair when I style it or even leave it naturally wavy but... my hair only feels clean the first day. I wash my hair twice 2-3 times a week so my end don&#x27;t dry out and I find that normal shampoo cleans my hair and scalp so much better. My hair has been falling out more than usual and my scalp has become very itchy and irritated. I tried using a normal or oily scalp shampoo and conditioning with WEN (avoiding contact with the scalp) and found that to work so much better. At least I&#x27;ll get my money&#x27;s worth this way.</li>
            <li> Wen is not the end all be all...It is a great conditioner for damaged hair but it didn&#x27;t rinse well and left an oily residue in my hair and my daughters. For long hair I would say don&#x27;t put it on your scalp, shampoo with something else close to your scalp if you have normal to oily hair... but it works  faily good on the rest of the hair. You do need to leave it on longer than directed, if not the residue, product and oils in your hair, will not be dissolved so you end up with a gummy residue.</li>
            <li> The product is great, but the container didn&#x27;t come with a pump. It should of stated that. I had to empty the bottle into another container with a pump.</li>
            <li> I bought WEN in November, used it for a month, and loved the effect it had on my hair--shiny, smooth, manageable. I was away for the winter and ordered two new bottles of the Cucumber Aloe Cleansing Conditioner when I returned home in March, but I ordered from a vendor called Apple because the price was so much less. What a mistake! I don&#x27;t think the product was authentic, because neither bottle had the great effect on my hair. In fact, the opposite happened. I used half of each bottle to make sure I was giving the product a chance, but here are the differences: the label on these two bottles was lighter in color, the pumps that came with the bottles not only arrived in a sandwich baggie, but they were smaller than the original pump on the first bottle I ordered, the product burned my scalp, it washed out my hair color, and it damaged my hair so badly that I had to cut off almost three inches of hair last month, which is terrible since I was trying to grow my hair to below my shoulders. I recently ordered one bottle of WEN (Cucumber Aloe again) directly from WEN, and it works great! For those of you who reported having a bad experience with WEN your first time around, take a look at your packing slip and see if you ordered from this alternative vendor. I gave WEN a rating of 4 because I think it should cost less; there really is no need to charge so much for a single bottle, and I hope that the execs eventually decide to bring the price of each bottle down so that it&#x27;s affordable, especially since Loreal has just come out with a similar product that retails for about $7.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 57, and have never liked my hair.  BUT...I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month, and I am VERY happy with it.  My very fine, straight (limp) hair now has more body and is in better shape.  Before Wen, I was used to seeing lots of hair caught in my drain every time I shampooed, and broken on the bathroom floor every day when I would brush it, but that is not the case anymore!  Also, I live in a hot and humid climate, and it still works well.  I&#x27;m really liking my hair now, which is quite a statement to make!</li>
            <li> I am 42 years old, with very fine brown hair (just above my shoulders cut in a layered bob) that I have colored blonde. My hair has a natural wave to it. As a result, it&#x27;s never as shiny as I would like for it to be. I use L&#x27;anza hair products which I really love, and try to get it shiny with the InStyler which does a good job. But, it never looks as good as when I leave the salon which is what I am always trying to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the infomercial with Allysa Milano and figured, why not? I read all of the reviews here before purchasing but figured that it was worth a shot - I purchased the Sweet Almond Mint scent first (which is supposed to be for all hair types). When this was very heavy and made my hair feel greasy and too soft (beleve it or not, that is possible), I decided to try to Cucumber since it was designed for people with Fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with many of the reviewer comments - the smell is very strong when you are applying it but it&#x27;s faint when your hair is dry. It looks and feels like you are washing your hair with conditioner. I used less than the recommended number of pumps for my hair length due to how fine my hair is (I typically use less styling product, as well, due to my fine hair) - total of 15 pumps which sufficiently covered my hair with no issues. I massaged it in for 2 minutes, used a wide tooth comb to evenly distribute and left it on for 5 additional minutes. I rinsed it off well and then used 1 pump as a leave-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is super soft and shinier than usual, and it feels clean but a bit greasy. But, in my case, it&#x27;s almost TOO SOFT. I will need to use a ton of additional styling products in order to have any kind of control over my hair. I can say that if my hair style was loose and wavy, it would be perfect. But, my layered bob with bangs does not do as well with this product. I would never be able to make my hair straight after using this as it&#x27;s just too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I did with the Sweet Almond Mint bottle, I gave this to a coworker with longer, thick hair and she loved it.  I think that this product is just not designed for people with fine hair.eet Almond Mint bottle, I gave this to a coworker with longer, thick hair and she loved it.  I think that this product is just not designed for people with fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is nothing more than straight up conditioner. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. It will only make your hair super oily and gunked up feeling no matter how much you rinse or how little you use.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this was great.  Hair looked brighter and bouncier and very clean.  But it does leave a waxy buildup in your hair, and you have to use another shampoo to clean your hair.  There are less expensive types like Wen that you can buy in stores.  But they all require using lots and for me I have to use another shampoo to clean wax out of hair.</li>
            <li> Seen on the news it makes your hair fall out!</li>
            <li> The bottle looks different from my other bottles, and ingredients are different. I am not sure if this product is what it says it is...It smells similar but seems weaker. It&#x27;s ok, my hair hasn&#x27;t fallen out.</li>
            <li> I have bright pink/magenta and black hair and this is the only shampoo I will use. It&#x27;s a little strange because it doesn&#x27;t lather, but it doesn&#x27;t strip my color and my hair has stayed soft and healthy after repeated bleaching and coloring every 8 weeks for 3 1/2 years. I use the Cucumber Aloe for an oily scalp and dry ends, and remember to RINSE, RINSE, RINSE!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I&#x27;ve been using Wen for almost a year and the Cucumber Aloe is the one that I found to be lighter than the others. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and has a wonderful fragrance. If you&#x27;re thinking about trying this product, I would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I prefer the Fig cleanser, the cucumber one makes my hair feel greasy.  I bought two and am planning on exchanging one</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the WEN products, especially the Cucumber Aloe.  I receive monthly WEN products but the Cucumber Aloe works wonders, makes my curly hair soft &amp; manageable</li>
            <li> Perfect, fits. Very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> My hair feels like straw</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get to try it because this cleansing conditioner doesn&#x27;t come with a pump. It&#x27;s too thick to pour out of the bottle and is useless without a pump. Had to return.</li>
            <li> The pump that came with it was not working, had to guess on the amount of product to use since the instructions are given in the number of pumps. Did not keep my hair clean as long as it says in the advertisements, Hair was actually heavier and looked oily after 6-8 hours. Will perhaps use the remaining product as a weekly conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine. In the q&amp;a it says it comes with a pump but I got no pump...ðŸ˜•</li>
            <li> Love it!  works great on fine hair.  Only problem I have it makes my hair so silky smooth and soft, I am having trouble styling it.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite but its ok. I wouldn&#x27;t reorder this brand. I had the mint originally and if I order WEN again that will be the only one I will get. I love the mint volume spray, conditioner and leave in treatment. For the price I wouldn&#x27;t order different one&#x27;s, unless I had money to burn. I enjoy WEN but will stick to one type, unless they give samples of others.</li>
            <li> This product was just ok for me. I don&#x27;t think it was horrible but probably not something I would buy again. I like to feel my hair streaking after I use shampoo, maybe it&#x27;s psychological on my part, but I like the suds in my hair. My hair is more on the oily side, so I&#x27;m sure people with dry hair would probably like this product more. Though I must say....my hair did not feel oily like some of the reviews I read before trying this product.</li>
            <li> NOTE: This listing does not come with a pump! I had to find one that fit from my lotion bottles. With that said, I had been a skeptic of Wen from the beginning. I have medium length hair, pretty fine, colored, and tends to get a little oily every 24 hrs. I did some researching and decided to give the Cucumber Aloe formula a try since its specifically for my hair type. I followed the directions to a T (their use half the pumps for the first wash and the other half for the second wash and half a pump for a leave in treatment) and my hair has never been more beautiful. The product does not lather and feels like conditioner when you are working it in. It gave my scalp a tingle which was unexpected but nice. My hair is shiny and silky and my split ends are basically repaired after a week of use. I don&#x27;t see myself going back to shampoo and conditioner. All-in-all, I&#x27;m a believer now and would recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to buy from their product website. Amazon is your best bet in case you don&#x27;t want the pesky auto shipments and the charge that comes with them.</li>
            <li> I have allergy on sulfa. Almost all shampoos have silfates I have allergy on. Wen is the only product whcih makes my hair looks silk, soft. I have colored haie and after years of coloring, hair looked  dry , dead. After using Wen for about 5 times, it changed. I cannot be without it now.</li>
            <li> This really is a great conditioner.  It does not really work as a shampoo for me.  My hair does not feel clean.  Although it&#x27;s a great conditioner - and you don&#x27;t have to use as many pumps as they say -  I do think it&#x27;s ridiculously  pricey.</li>
            <li> I have used WEN products for nearly a year and love them all.  Great product for dry hair and split ends. I have no need to ever go back to regular hair products again.</li>
            <li> Got this as a Christmas gift for my wife after she read about it.  She absolutely loves it!  Being a guy I don&#x27;t notice that big a difference but shes thrown a bunch of hair care terms my way raving about the stuff.</li>
            <li> Love Wen. I have naturally curly fine hair and Wen makes it friz free shiney and manageable without having to use any other products. It leaves my hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Really like Wen Products.  Thought all are just a little different.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite is the orange blossom so far.</li>
            <li> Nice smell....a good break from shampoo.</li>
            <li> I would never buy this product again. it didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair it actually made my hair more oily and grease. can&#x27;t believe I have so much for a product that didn&#x27;t even work</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Wen I do like the cucumber the best for the thin hair i Have.</li>
            <li> According to Chaz Dean, in one of his informercials, he said that cucumber aloe cleansing conditioner was specially design for fine hair because it has aloe.&lt;br /&gt;I have been buying WEN for a while now , for that reason I have tried different \\&quot;scent\\&quot; conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this conditioner because I have fine hair. The aloe helps fine hair by adding volume so it doesn&#x27;t lay flat. But I didn&#x27;t notice any difference using this conditioner (normally you feel that kind of minty sensation on the scale or even the smell but no. No difference from this product to any of the other WEN conditioners.  Honestly I think is just the smell that changes.&lt;br /&gt;Dont get me wrong I like how my hair feels after using WEN, Im just saying that I don&#x27;t feel that this product could be different or does any differences  on my hair than any other WEN conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very settle, not the best one but not bad.</li>
            <li> Works great for my hair, wish it would be less expensive.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Probably best I&#x27;ve found after 51 years! Am finally able to let my hair grow out and it is looking beautiful.</li>
            <li> While not really a &#x27;shampoo&#x27; with the suds, etc., it really does leave your hair very soft.  I feel it is also very good for my hair.  Recomended to all.</li>
            <li> I heard such great things about this cleansing conditioner, so I spent this much money, used it 3 times and each time I used it, my hair came out in wads.  I have never had a problem with my hair coming out with any product but this one.  I personally will not ever buy any WEN products again.</li>
            <li> Very expensive for the results.  Not as good as had hoped.  Also, the recommendation for 15-30 pumps is ridiculous.  30 pumps would use up 1/3 of the bottle.  Don&#x27;t recommend this product unless given to you as a gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using WEN for about three weeks, but I already LOVE it!  I have fine thin, fine, curly hair, which tends toward being very dry and frizzy.  WEN makes it look healthier and shinier and seems to give it more body.  My curls also revive much better day after day, so I&#x27;m wearing fewer pony tails and buns.  I use much less of the product than directed, but it is important spend several minutes massaging of the product into the scalp, and leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever shampoo again!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo, not the best smell.  The lavender and pumpkin are nicer.</li>
            <li> This product was terrible! You want my advice? Don&#x27;t waste your money. It left my hair greasy and oily just 15 minutes after washing my hair. This shampoo seriously sucks.</li>
            <li> A lot of women say they have \\&quot;thin fine\\&quot; hair when in reality they really do not ... however, i do have thin and fine hair; it runs in our family .. i am 62 yrs old but do not look or act my age; where has this product been all my life ????  I have used it now three times and am in love .. my thin/fine hair is full, shiny, and looking the best it has ever looked in my life .. i use only about six (6) pumps and when rinsing this product off my hair is truly smooth and tangle free .. once i have blown it dry it comes out just beautiful .. i&#x27;m almost speechless .. hoping they never change anything about it and hoping they have a travel size .. trust me; you want to try this; i was skeptical but am sold now forever .. i&#x27;m throwing away all my shampoo and conditioner bottles !!</li>
            <li> I had seen Chaz on QVC a couple of times, but never quite believed this stuff would get your hair clean.  He was on again a few weeks ago, I checked out reviews on here and decided to try it.  I had medium-long hair that is color-treated, but gets oily at the scalp.  I shampoo every other day to protect the color, and even with shampoos for color treated hair, I would see hair dye on my towel even weeks after getting my hair colored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried this, and if you use enough so that your hair is saturated, comb it, and then let it sit during the rest of your shower, you will feel/hear your hair squeak when you rinse it.  I didn&#x27;t use 5-6 pumps per section though - more like 3-4.  My hair feels really soft, less frizz even if I don&#x27;t use any other product (I use half a pump as leave in conditioner) and let it dry curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for hair loss, I notice a lot during the \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; process, probably because you are running your hands and a comb through your hair A LOT.  However, I notice less hair loss while drying or combing my hair later on.  Don&#x27;t forget, it is normal to lose 100-200 hairs a day, and brunettes have more hair than other natural colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be interested to see how it retains color since I have not used it long enough to have coincided with a hair color treatment.  Wanna see if it keeps the red from getting brassy in the sun.  I do like this product a lot, and it might take some time to get the process down right.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner (shampoo), and so does my daughter, and my granddaughter.  We all love it so much because it makes our hair soft and it really looks fuller.  All of the WEN Products are totally excellent.  Follow the easy instructions, and enjoy how your hair feels!!  It&#x27;s great!!</li>
            <li> I have dry, thick, curly hair and this works so great on my hair. I don&#x27;t use anything else - you will have to use a monthly clairiying shampoo to keep it all fresh. I use as a shaving cream also to save money!</li>
            <li> I was amazed at this shampoo.  Made my fine, thin, sparse hair shiney, soft and bouncy.  But - the pump didn&#x27;t work so I had to pour out the shampoo.  Not sure if I used too much as a result.  But it&#x27;s great, I just bought another bottle.  Hopefully this pump will work and the supply will last longer.  So expensive!</li>
            <li> have been using this stuff for so long , love it</li>
            <li> I was starting to get frustrated with Wen hair products, I was using the sweet almond mint but found my hair looked amazing, but my roots were always greasy. I saw an info-merical with Chaz Dean and saw that he had this one for &amp;#34;greasy roots.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it out and it&#x27;s fantastic. Now when I&#x27;m done blow drying my hair there are no more greasy roots. Back to loving Wen. Just had to find the right one for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have THICK THICK hair and I no longer have to straighten it, just a good blowdry and I&#x27;m good to go. That&#x27;s priceless if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Worked great at first, then seemed to irritate scalp.</li>
            <li> Never thought this product would work for me. I have very fine hair and oily scalp. Got a sample and tried it over the weekend in case I needed to re-wash it but there was no need. From the first my hair was soft and clean with tons of volume. I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I won&#x27;t use anything else now, this is the best!</li>
            <li> WEN products are great!  But the company that I purchased this from has not answered my email concerning an additional pump. Bought 2 bottles for 2 different people. Need the pump for using the correct amount.</li>
            <li> My hair would always be in knots after a shower nothing worked it was a rats nest.  So frustrating I would have to over condition it just to get a comb thru then I had flat lifeless hair blah .  This actually works I can feel it cleaning as I massaged it into my scalp it&#x27;s wonderful !!!  Just this and that&#x27;s it no added conditioner.  I use a lot because I have so much hair but follow the instructions and u can&#x27;t go wrong! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!! The cucumber sloe is the best shapoo I have ever used , was glad to be able to order it from amazon</li>
            <li> Very shipping just as it looks in the picture! I am ordering more for sure!!!!</li>
            <li> I just picked up a bottle of this and tried it this morning.  I&#x27;m not buying the whole 10 pumps to use.  That&#x27;s just a waste and pretty sure it&#x27;s all about getting you to go through it faster so you&#x27;ll use more.  If it requires THAT much to clean your hair, it&#x27;s crap.  That said, I used 5 pumps, which still felt like I was wasting it, and really like how it felt on my scalp.  It has sort of a tingly feeling that soothes. For some reason, my scalp always gets itchy in the summer and this felt very cool.  My hair is very shiny and soft and I could see immediately when I took the towel off my head to style it that there was a difference.    My guess is that the reason people are feeling like their hair is weighed down and greasy is because they&#x27;re using too much product.    We&#x27;ll see how it goes as I use this first bottle.      Updated after a few weeks.   It&#x27;s OK.  After a couple weeks of using it, my hair started to look sort of fuzzy and I wasn&#x27;t having the good hair days.   I switched back to my L&#x27;Oreal Everstrong shampoo and conditioner.   I guess I&#x27;ll alternate between the two of them until the Wen is gone, but I don&#x27;t see this as worth the price.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it does what it&#x27;s supposed to other times it doesn&#x27;t. It seems to work best if I use regular shampoo and then this. Or sometimes not use it and then use it next time..</li>
            <li> Follow the directions! Removes hormonal? ? ? Oily residue on long curly hair. Just got it,but less hair in the drain!</li>
            <li> I love wen!! Natural stuff, feels &amp; smells fresh! :) good size rather than the one that comes with entire set. I w</li>
            <li> You have to use so much of the product. It gets used up quickly. My hair is not as fabulous as I thought it would be. Kinda disappointed</li>
            <li> I bought this just to try the product without having to join wen. (to order from the wen website they want you to join so they can auto ship products to you.) I love it! I have really thin fine hair and it really makes it look fuller and thinker. They want you to use a lot, about 10 pumps per use, but I find with my short hair I only need about 4. You will need to add water after application so it will kind of lather upâ€¦.. but it really doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it. You will kind of have to experiment to see what the proper amount of water is. If your hair is thicker or longer you will need to use more product. If you go to the website it will give you more info and show more products. It took me awhile before I finally decided to try this. (the ultimate skepticist) I wish I would of sooner.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my sister, who had heard good things about it&#x27;s effectiveness as a cleanser.  After using the product just once, her head would not stop itching.  She also started to develop a rash around the neck and shoulder area.  Believing this was an allergic, isolated reaction, she looked up some of the other reviews and user comments online.  Much to her dismay (and outrage), she discovered that WEN products have been a subject of countless complaints and frustration.  Turns out this was not an isolated reaction, but a very common occurrence with their products.  So much so, that there&#x27;s quite a few web sites that are more or less devoted to people&#x27;s justified criticisms and in some cases, horror stories of their experiences with WEN.  The company is fully aware of these many cases, and still seems to peddle their &amp;#34;varnish remover&amp;#34; wherever possible.  Do the research for yourselves and check out some of the ingredients and effects (including a plethora of hair loss accounts), before you even consider purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, if you like that &#x27;head on fire feeling&#x27;, by all means buy it by the gallon.</li>
            <li> My wife swears her greatest asset is her hair.  It is beautiful I must admit.  She has psoriasis and her scalp was always itching. She became interested in Wen after someone suggested that she try it because it was all natural.  She has been using it since December 2012, and it has really helped her psoriasis AND I&#x27;ve never seen her hair look more beautiful. She looks like one of those models on TV shampoo commercials. I mean, lets face it, guys don&#x27;t notice subtle changes every time they happen...but this was NOT a subtle change, it was striking!  So, as long as she wants to use it, I will purchase it.  I&#x27;ve read that it has caused hair loss in some women. My wife has found the opposite--her hair loss, though never really a problem, has declined since using Wen. So there you go--a happy wife means a happy me:)</li>
            <li> It was packaged perfectly and arrived on time. I am one very happy customer! I also love this hair product and will order it from you again.&lt;br /&gt;Marlene</li>
            <li> I did not like this product.  I have fine hair and it made it my feel greasy and heavy.  I gave it away.</li>
            <li> This not only works on my hair which is thin and straight, but it also work on my nieces hair which is thick and curly.</li>
            <li> This is the only type of Wen that&#x27;s make my scalp burn. Really disliked this scent, as it was very menthol-y.</li>
            <li> I have very thin and fine hair, oily at scalp and very dry, frizzy on ends.  I got the WEN Almond for Xmas and found that it worked for my hair although was somewhat heavy.  I tried the Sally Beauty store brand of this type of cleansing conditioner and it made my hair feel and look oily so I (unhappily) will put down the money for the real WEN.  The Cucumber Aloe reviews indicated that this was the lightest cleansing conditioner.  It took some trial and error and now works well as long as:  a) I use very very little each time - like maybe only 6 pumps instead of the 14-16 recommended, b) I do not leave it on as recommended - I massaged scalp and first 2&amp;#34; of hair near scalp with it and rinsed immediately and c) rinsed very very well - sometimes even sticking head under bathtub spout to get alot of water to rinse.  The trick is to not think of this as shampoo but more like a &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; that you work through your scalp and hair.  And if in doubt, use less.</li>
            <li> I got hooked on Wen through the infomecial. I thought it was a great product and was excited to try the cucumber mint variety. There were major differences on this packaging than the Guther packaging. For instance, the instructions are different. I have medium length fine wavy hair that is usually lifeless. After one application, the body increased by nearly 75%. I didn&#x27;t need to use as much as they suggested. I used 12 pumps and still think I could have used less. Once you apply and massage, add a little bit of water and the product seems more prevalent.  Love this! However, I think save rosemary mint conditioner works just as well for a lot less. The Studio Graphix brand is terrible.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this stuff based on postivie reviews I read.  I&#x27;m 5 days into using it, and I hate it.  After the first use, my hair took forever to air dry (4 times as long for some reason) and when dry it looked as though I had not washed my hair in 5 days.  My hair looked dirty and oily.  I thought mabe since I let it air sry that might have had something to do with it.  2nd day of use I used the hair dryer to dry and still had no better results.  My hair still looked dirty and oily like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in days.  I&#x27;m glad I only bought the $40.00 bottle rather than wasting a greater amount of money. I followed the instruction exactly.  Also, the directions tell you to use up to 40 pumps for longer hair.  At that rate, you&#x27;ll need a bottle a week! I&#x27;m going back to regular shampoo that actually cleans your hair!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really care that it does not sudz up.  The smell is not so great.  I prefer a more floral smell.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> I like to mix it with another Wen product like the&lt;br /&gt;Fall Ginger or Winter Vanilla Mint.  Works wonders&lt;br /&gt;for my fine limpless hair.</li>
            <li> For 3 yrs I have used no shampoo..Wen only..My hair grows longer and is  healthier than ever before..Cucumber Aloe is the deepest clean,so w/my color treated hair,I only use every couple weeks..I use Tea Tree and Pomegranite the rest of the time</li>
            <li> This formula is a clarifier.  It makes my dyed hair very dry and I cannot use it, but it&#x27;s fantastic on my kids&#x27; hair, especially after a day of sweating or swimming.  Wen no longer advises customers to use an exorbitant amount of pumps on all sides of the head.  For hair that&#x27;s shoulder length, about 8 pumps the first cleanse, let it sit a few minutes, rinse, and then add another 4 or 5 pumps.  Let sit a few minutes and rinse.  Older instructions said to do the hair in sections, which was idiotic and wasteful.  Great formula if you have hair that tends to be greasy.  Probably not a great formula for you if your hair is color-treated and dry.  The smell is fresh and flowery.</li>
            <li> The first time I just this I loved the way it left my hair but this last time I was not thrilled with it.  Maybe because its winter I didn&#x27;t get the same results I don&#x27;t know.  I would have you try it and see.  I have colored treated hair over gray and this may be why it didn&#x27;t work as well this time.</li>
            <li> I just used this product for the first time and, thankfully, had read other reviews cautioning about the amount to use.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, having average size human male hands, I am not even certain I could fit 16-30 pumps of this product into my palm. That would probably be about 15% of the contents of the 16-oz bottle. I used TWO pumps, and even that was a little more than was necessary to completely treat my two- to three-inch length hair. Next time, I will used about 1.5 pumps.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is still wet as I write this, but I believe the product to be quite good at cleaning and my hair feels quite soft. I did not use the \\&quot;one to two pumps\\&quot; as a \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot; conditioner because, if I had, my hair would be completely gooey until the next time I washed it. Next time, I may use a tiny fraction of one pump as a conditioner and will see how that goes.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that I do recommend the product, just use common sense in the amount applied based on how much hair is on your head.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know, perhaps the instructions were for someone interested in shampooing their horse? The amounts might be correct for that purpose.</li>
            <li> nice fresh fragrance.  i have fine, colored and thin hair, i need to use it every other day, it would leave my hair too limp if i used it daily  . . . i see this really helping thick, dry and brittle hair. tip:  rinse rinse really well . . .</li>
            <li> Not as moisturizing as I thought it would be.  My hair felt dry And tangly after using.  I prefer the pomegranate one the most.  I have long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I had used the WEN almond mint before and loved it. I wanted to try another fragrance wo I purchased the Cucumber Aloe. I opened the bottle and it smelled HORRIBLE like a jar of Vicks mentholated rub. I found the Pumpkin spice elsewhere and that is much better.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. I do believe its better for my hair and its soothing when it touches the scalp but it&#x27;s too expensive to buy periodically so I can&#x27;t say much for the long term use.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It&#x27;s not my favorite scent, but the formula works really well for my type of hair - a little oily and fine.</li>
            <li> Great product. I bought this for my daughter who has very dry scalp. It helped much more than the traditional shampoos. It is a bit pricey and she went through a bottle fairly quickly. I saw a few comparable products that sell for quite a bit less - we may try those also and see what the difference is; but overall if you can spend the money your hair will look great and you will notice the difference.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Very pleasant fragrance, nice change from all the fruity products out there.  I just wish the price could come down!</li>
            <li> Love it! Wonderful tingling sensation for my scalp.</li>
            <li> This is a product I&#x27;ve used for years with complete satisfaction.  WEN products make my hair look thick and healthy.  I&#x27;ll never use anything else!</li>
