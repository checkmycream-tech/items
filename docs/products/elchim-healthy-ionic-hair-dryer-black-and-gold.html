            <li>I&#x27;m still kind of on the fence considering the cost.  </li>
            <li>The good thing is that it is ceramic, so you&#x27;re not damaging your hair while still obtaining fabulous results!</li>
            <li>My favorite blow dryer.</li>
            <li>It is probably better for longer hair.</li>
            <li>Love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Quality product, unlike the junk now sold at most stores, and it all lies in the motor.</li>
            <li>I am able to do my hair as well as my hair stylist.</li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;m sold.  </li>
            <li>But for me, the selling point was more how my hair felt and looked afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I decided on this dryer b/c many stylists have used it on me and let me tell you, this hairdryer will not disappoint.</li>
            <li>And please SUBSCRIBE to my channel :)  </li>
            <li>I was concerned because it was more money than some dryers, but worth it all!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly how the science works, but I&#x27;m glad it does!  </li>
            <li>I had my previous Elchim hair dryer for almost 9 years and upgrading to this model was an excellent choice!!!</li>
            <li>bravo Elchim, I always been a huge fan.</li>
            <li>My hair is dried faster and the cooler of the two heat settings is perfect for my medium weight curly hair.</li>
            <li>Light weight.</li>
            <li>Also, it is amazingly light and comfortable to handle.</li>
            <li>They had a limited edition color which was beautiful</li>
            <li>Loved my old Elchim and had to get this new Iconic one of Elchim.</li>
            <li>Specially in here versus Ulta.</li>
            <li>It may have worked great, but for the money I spent on it</li>
            <li>It is quiet and the different heat settings are wonderful.  </li>
            <li>My stylist said it was probably because as I was getting more grey strands, which are more resistant.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair straight and almost frizz free.</li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>and I feel it was well worth the $100-ish price tag.</li>
            <li>I had the old version for more than six years.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I would say to buy it, the quality and results are worth it.</li>
            <li>She likes it very much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d returned an item or two on Amazon and found that they make it pretty easy, so I decided to take the chance on this and just return it if I didn&#x27;t feel it was worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it had too much blowing force (compared to my old cheap dryer).</li>
            <li>It is fast, quiet, and efficient for sure.</li>
            <li>I blow it to a soft curl on most professional days.  </li>
            <li>As a professional stylist I appreciate the quiet yet powerful output,also very light and doesn&#x27;t hurt my neck/shoulder after using it all day.</li>
            <li>When I dry my hair, no frizzies, it comes out smooth!</li>
            <li>It is pretty light and quiet and drys my hair fast</li>
            <li>After using this dryer, and even more so after using it for a week or so, my hair doesn&#x27;t look dry or strawlike anymore, but silkier and much healthier.  </li>
            <li>My son and I fight over it haha.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell that it&#x27;s made a difference in my hair yet.  </li>
            <li>I was however, very upset when it arrived.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels silky and very shinny.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li>BUT it has never let me down even on its last good use of it</li>
            <li>She timed herself using her own regular dryer and it took her 10 min to dry her hair.  </li>
            <li>I want a new product!</li>
            <li>B007RNYX4W Elchim 3900 Healthy Ionic Black &amp; Gold Hair Dryer]]</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t go back to the old cheap dryers anymore.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I chose this hair dryer because of the high ratings.</li>
            <li>Not only dries your hair quick, but also leaves your hair smooth and silky with minimal hair products.</li>
            <li>PLEASE if you would like to see this product in action go to Youtube.com and type in starlette223, I have a video review as well as a blow out tutorial that will give you tons of volume and shine!!</li>
            <li>It does have a super long power cord, which I can see would benefit a professional stylist in walking around the client.  </li>
            <li>the drying time is cut in half, and it makes your hair super shiny!</li>
            <li>If you have thick thick frizzy hair........... this is for sure the hair dryer to own.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but a decent amount of it, so it typically dries fairly quickly anyway, but this did cut down the drying time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time I can straighten my hair without a flat iron.</li>
            <li>I was amazed to see that, with this dryer, the kinks are not there - maybe just slightly here or there, but pretty much gone!  </li>
            <li>She usually has some waves in it that she will flat-iron out, but really didn&#x27;t need to after using this dryer, so her total time to do her hair was only about 5-6 minutes, which she was thrilled</li>
            <li>so if that is your only criteria, it&#x27;s not for you.)(Lightweight dryers tend to be cheap and overheat and go bad much more quickly.)</li>
            <li>Which was fine since I had only spent $20 on it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only owned the \\&quot;basic\\&quot; $30 hairdryer you get from Walmart my whole life, and I just hit 50 years old.  </li>
            <li>I like it so far.  </li>
            <li>It looks healthier and it dries my hair 15 minutes faster than my old blowdryer.</li>
            <li>Hairdressers are often surprised once the dig their hands into it.</li>
            <li>I also haven&#x27;t had to use my flat iron much, some days not at all, with this dryer, which helps keep my hair healthier too.</li>
            <li>Love it like I have never loved another hair dryer.</li>
            <li>hair is very think, and at the time of purchase, very long.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is worth every penny and it cost less here than anywhere else online.</li>
            <li>it was still too hot and not like other s</li>
            <li>It had worked well until recently when it completely stopped working.</li>
            <li>My previous dryer was a CHI and for me, that was only slightly better than your average drugstore, multi purpose store</li>

            <li> It had worked well until recently when it completely stopped working.</li>
            <li> My previous dryer was a CHI and for me, that was only slightly better than your average drugstore, multi purpose store</li>
            <li> Not as loud as other dryers.</li>
            <li> I will buy another one as a gift and do recommend it to everyone looking for a long lasting affordable luxury of a hair dryer that will last you years and years to come!</li>
            <li> I purchased a Chi G2 flat iron and wanted to upgrade my dryer as well.</li>
            <li> with my flat iron from Baby Bliss</li>
            <li> and I wash and dry my very long straight asian hair everyday.</li>
            <li> But, I started reading reviews and got curious - it appeared that different hair dryers might actually do different things.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have had some issues with my hair kinking about 2-3 inches out from theroots on the top of my head that I always had to flat iron out, even though I would use my hair dryer, big round brush, cold shot, etc., with my old dryer.  </li>
            <li> I decided to check Amazon review before buying it and actually found the same dryer in a different color for about half the cost.</li>
            <li> ** cheaper hair dryer that loses its power in less than a year if lucky.</li>
            <li> Note it is a tad smaller than a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; size blowdryer - a bonus, but a bit heavier than I expected.  </li>
            <li> WOW, I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing until I purchased an Elchim.</li>
            <li> It even smoothes out my hair if I use it on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I have to dry my hair in sections and it takes about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> It was loose in a box</li>
            <li> sometimes it could look a little dried out and \\&quot;strawlike,\\&quot; especially in the back.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> And I can completely dry and style my hair in less time too.  </li>
            <li> This dryer does the job and the air blowing out is NOT hot.</li>
            <li> My hair will frizz like crazy, but this dryer has been a true blessing.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s the active, sporty mom-type that hates spending the time doing her hair and often will just pull it up because of that.  </li>
            <li> It makes much less noise than other blow dryers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always thought it was stupid for people to spend more than that on a hairdryer just to get something else that blows air just like the cheaper ones did.  </li>
            <li> broke down in 8 months.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, long, curly hair and this dryer dries my hair faster than other dryers and leaves it smoother and silkier.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;seem&amp;#34; as harsh as other dryers, but the jury is still out on this one.  </li>
            <li> I dried my mop of hair in half the time of any other dryer.</li>
            <li> I had been using a less expensive brand that I purchased several years ago at Walgreens (local drug store).</li>
            <li> Less drying time too.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair that takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> There was no secure interior packaging (like styrofoam, or molded cardboard) to keep it from bouncing around inside the box</li>
            <li> Purchased a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy/curly, long hair.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed because it is very heavy and the slow setting is still too much for my short hair.</li>
            <li> She has very long, very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> and it literally cut it down by at least 50% to 4-5 min.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not confident that this was not one that had been used or refurbished.  </li>

            <li> I have thick, long, curly hair and this dryer dries my hair faster than other dryers and leaves it smoother and silkier.  It even smoothes out my hair if I use it on dry hair.  Expensive but worth the cost.  I was a little disappointed in how Amazon packed it but that&#x27;s not Elchim&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is worth every penny and it cost less here than anywhere else online. My son and I fight over it haha. It&#x27;s the first time I can straighten my hair without a flat iron. I wish my hair dresser had one.</li>
            <li> Been a hairstylist for many years and this blow dryer is the best!!!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife. She likes it very much.</li>
            <li> I like it so far.  It makes much less noise than other blow dryers I&#x27;ve used.  I can&#x27;t really tell that it&#x27;s made a difference in my hair yet.  It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;seem&amp;#34; as harsh as other dryers, but the jury is still out on this one.  I was however, very upset when it arrived.  It was loose in a box and I was afraid that it had been used.  There was no secure interior packaging (like styrofoam, or molded cardboard) to keep it from bouncing around inside the box and I was concerned that the internal motor, parts, etc. may have been damaged.  I&#x27;m still not confident that this was not one that had been used or refurbished.  And it&#x27;s a great deal of money to spend on a dryer.  The reviews are what convinced me to buy this unit.  I&#x27;m still kind of on the fence considering the cost.  It does have a super long power cord, which I can see would benefit a professional stylist in walking around the client.  Also, there was no information page included as to the dryer settings.  It&#x27;s strictly trial and error.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! the drying time is cut in half, and it makes your hair super shiny! The good thing is that it is ceramic, so you&#x27;re not damaging your hair while still obtaining fabulous results!</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer I ever had.... Worth the extra $$&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very think, and at the time of purchase, very long. LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> Love it like I have never loved another hair dryer. When I dry my hair, no frizzies, it comes out smooth! Highly recommend. It&#x27;s quiet, too.</li>
            <li> It does everything it says for your hair. My hair feels silky and very shinny. It looks healthier and it dries my hair 15 minutes faster than my old blowdryer. It&#x27;s totally worsth the price. Specially in here versus Ulta.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how well the hairdryer works because I was very put off by the fact that I received the hair dryer in an open box, missing pieces and obviously used.  It may have worked great, but for the money I spent on it I want a new product!</li>
            <li> Excellent hair dryer! Purchased a few weeks ago and I feel it was well worth the $100-ish price tag. I had been using a less expensive brand that I purchased several years ago at Walgreens (local drug store). It had worked well until recently when it completely stopped working. Which was fine since I had only spent $20 on it. I purchased a Chi G2 flat iron and wanted to upgrade my dryer as well. I went to Ulta (similar to Sephorah, if you haven&#x27;t been to one) and saw this dryer. They had a limited edition color which was beautiful but it was $200 + tax. I decided to check Amazon review before buying it and actually found the same dryer in a different color for about half the cost. I went ahead and purchased it from Amazon after reading the mostly good review and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! At first I thought it had too much blowing force (compared to my old cheap dryer). But once I got used to it I would never go back! My hair is dried faster and the cooler of the two heat settings is perfect for my medium weight curly hair. I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Note it is a tad smaller than a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; size blowdryer - a bonus, but a bit heavier than I expected.  Nevertheless, I love it!</li>
            <li> As a professional stylist I appreciate the quiet yet powerful output,also very light and doesn&#x27;t hurt my neck/shoulder after using it all day. Comparable dryers $250.00 and up. I&#x27;m rec.to all my stylist friends.</li>
            <li> Very nice dryer.  It is pretty light and quiet and drys my hair fast</li>
            <li> My favorite blow dryer. Not as loud as other dryers. Light weight.</li>
            <li> I chose this hair dryer because of the high ratings. I am disappointed because it is very heavy and the slow setting is still too much for my short hair. It is probably better for longer hair.</li>
            <li> I had the old version for more than six years. It overheated last time I used it and I could tell it was time for a newer one. BUT it has never let me down even on its last good use of it it was still too hot and not like other s*** cheaper hair dryer that loses its power in less than a year if lucky. Loved my old Elchim and had to get this new Iconic one of Elchim. And it dries my hair faster and makes my hair feel smoother and silkier and I wash and dry my very long straight asian hair everyday. I will buy another one as a gift and do recommend it to everyone looking for a long lasting affordable luxury of a hair dryer that will last you years and years to come! bravo Elchim, I always been a huge fan.</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer. I have extremely thick hair that takes forever to dry. This dryer does the job and the air blowing out is NOT hot. Less drying time too. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!  It is quiet and the different heat settings are wonderful.  I was concerned because it was more money than some dryers, but worth it all!</li>
            <li> I had my previous Elchim hair dryer for almost 9 years and upgrading to this model was an excellent choice!!! I have had it for a month now and I love it! Not only dries your hair quick, but also leaves your hair smooth and silky with minimal hair products. Very happy with this investment!!</li>
            <li> very small in size very disappointed  being a hairdresser not powerful enough</li>
            <li> ...once I got used to the switches being on the side and found a good way to hold it. Got it on my hairdresser&#x27;s recommendation. Well worth the price. (This is NOT a lightweight hair dryer so if that is your only criteria, it&#x27;s not for you.)(Lightweight dryers tend to be cheap and overheat and go bad much more quickly.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser and this is my 2nd Elchim and i love it! It dries hair to a beautiful shine without burning the customer, always a plus! Also, it is amazingly light and comfortable to handle.</li>
            <li> WOW, I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing until I purchased an Elchim. Nice nice nice! Quality product, unlike the junk now sold at most stores, and it all lies in the motor. Well done, Elchim.</li>
            <li> If you have thick thick frizzy hair........... this is for sure the hair dryer to own. I have tried them all. It is fast, quiet, and efficient for sure. I dried my mop of hair in half the time of any other dryer. I actually look forward now to doing my blowout. !!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Combined with my flat iron from Baby Bliss I am able to do my hair as well as my hair stylist.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m sold.  I have to say I was skeptical.  I&#x27;ve only owned the \\&quot;basic\\&quot; $30 hairdryer you get from Walmart my whole life, and I just hit 50 years old.  I&#x27;ve always thought it was stupid for people to spend more than that on a hairdryer just to get something else that blows air just like the cheaper ones did.  But, I started reading reviews and got curious - it appeared that different hair dryers might actually do different things.  I&#x27;d returned an item or two on Amazon and found that they make it pretty easy, so I decided to take the chance on this and just return it if I didn&#x27;t feel it was worth the extra money.  Well, I&#x27;m keeping it.  In fact, I bought a second one for a friend for Christmas.  I have fine hair, but a decent amount of it, so it typically dries fairly quickly anyway, but this did cut down the drying time.  But for me, the selling point was more how my hair felt and looked afterwards.  I regularly color my hair and have been doing so for years, so sometimes it could look a little dried out and \\&quot;strawlike,\\&quot; especially in the back.  After using this dryer, and even more so after using it for a week or so, my hair doesn&#x27;t look dry or strawlike anymore, but silkier and much healthier.  Then, my friend tried it.  She has very long, very thick hair.  She&#x27;s the active, sporty mom-type that hates spending the time doing her hair and often will just pull it up because of that.  She timed herself using her own regular dryer and it took her 10 min to dry her hair.  The next day, she used mine - the Elchim - and timed it again and it literally cut it down by at least 50% to 4-5 min.  And not only that, her hair looked like a Pantene commercial!  She usually has some waves in it that she will flat-iron out, but really didn&#x27;t need to after using this dryer, so her total time to do her hair was only about 5-6 minutes, which she was thrilled about - hence the Christmas present idea.  Also, I have had some issues with my hair kinking about 2-3 inches out from theroots on the top of my head that I always had to flat iron out, even though I would use my hair dryer, big round brush, cold shot, etc., with my old dryer.  My stylist said it was probably because as I was getting more grey strands, which are more resistant.  I was amazed to see that, with this dryer, the kinks are not there - maybe just slightly here or there, but pretty much gone!  I also haven&#x27;t had to use my flat iron much, some days not at all, with this dryer, which helps keep my hair healthier too. And I can completely dry and style my hair in less time too.  I don&#x27;t know exactly how the science works, but I&#x27;m glad it does!  I won&#x27;t go back to the old cheap dryers anymore.</li>
            <li> I had a chi hairdryer for 9.5 years before it dying on me. I did my research before buying another one. I decided on this dryer b/c many stylists have used it on me and let me tell you, this hairdryer will not disappoint. I have very thick, wavy/curly, long hair. I have to dry my hair in sections and it takes about 30 minutes. It leaves my hair straight and almost frizz free. Use this with the Pearatin gloss and you will be amazed at how good your hair will feel!</li>

            <li> I have very curly hair. Hairdressers are often surprised once the dig their hands into it. I blow it to a soft curl on most professional days.  My hair will frizz like crazy, but this dryer has been a true blessing. My previous dryer was a CHI and for me, that was only slightly better than your average drugstore, multi purpose store brands.&lt;br /&gt;I have a whole system of products I use in conjunction with this wonderful dryer and my results are happiness. I would say to buy it, the quality and results are worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer!</li>
            <li> broke down in 8 months.  I am requesting for a reimbursement.  I use it maybe every three days</li>
