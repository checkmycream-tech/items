            <li> Great cologne for great price. Not over powering. Smells fresh.</li>
            <li> The processing and delivery of the product was quick and professional. However, the cologne (smell) isn&#x27;t what I expected. If you&#x27;re looking for a gentle smelling cologne this is NOT it.  The quality of the cologne is decent though... The smell lasts through most of the day.</li>
            <li> I got my order very very quickly Just in time for my dads birthday and he loved them it is his favorite cologne it smells great I would recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li> Wife got it for the price but ends up being my favorite. Pleasant!</li>
            <li> this scent is no longer on shelves in the US. Jaguar doesn&#x27;t have a deal selling it anymore, but i had first tried this overseas and it became my go-to. so when i found out that it wasn&#x27;t in stores i got on Amazon and was so relieved to find i could continue to smell like myself. if you have a nose and are manly you will love the scent, if you are a woman and you like men then you will love the scent. FACT!.</li>
            <li> excellent fragrance is durable and very special.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend</li>
            <li> This scent is amazing and fabulous! Talk about making a man smell like a man.</li>
            <li> This cologne does smell great... i was running late with a gift for my boyfriend so I took my brothers cologne (yes its new!) and gave it to my bf and he loves it! However i did have to buy my brother another one....lol</li>
            <li> The product is great no doubt about it but the company that sold it to me was the worst. promised me first of all to send me the cologne with my money back. Due to the fact that they were late on sending me the cologne and second of all sent me the wrong one so you can imagine my frustration. I got a phone call a week later from the distributor trying to resolve my issue because I gave them a bad review and wanted me to remove it. I trusted the distributor that he said he would not only reimburse me the money for the cologne but will also send me the cologne I wanted free of charge for the mistake. When I removed it and I removed it on his word that I would get everything he said. He only gave me back the money and didnt send me the cologne. I was so upset with him and felt like this was  double crossed he knew that as soon as i removed the review I couldnt go back in and give them a negative one. I called him back and he denied ever agreeing to the terms that we stated. I ended up buying the cologne at a store near by for a little bit more but I at least got the product I wanted and wasnt lied to. So please when purchasing it please make sure its not only the right product but dont remove any negative reviews till your terms of your agreement are met.</li>
