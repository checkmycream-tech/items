            <li>I hope they come out with more scents!!</li>
            <li>and so glad I did!!</li>
            <li>It seemed very effective at odor control</li>
            <li>very nice smell</li>
            <li>also don&#x27;t find it to be very effective at all.  </li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t believe it was very effective.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed and satisfied with how the deodorant works and lasts.</li>
            <li>Im loving the scent!</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel wonderful - it is very moisturizing and great on shaved armpits!</li>
            <li>Smells pleasant ..slightly lavender and a hint of grapefruit.  </li>
            <li>If you need to smell great at the end of the day, don&#x27;t use this...or be prepared apply it AGAIN right before you need to smell great (applying deodorant at the bus stop probably isn&#x27;t the best look, though).</li>

            <li>It smells good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a good test candidate</li>
            <li>It works and smells good.</li>
            <li>my skin looked good</li>
            <li>I did a good amount of research on aluminum-free deodorants and have tried a number of them</li>
            <li>Good products will purchase again.  </li>
            <li>Still looking for the a good organic antiperpserant.</li>
            <li>I still decided to wear for a week in order to give a good review.</li>
            <li>I saw a blog about another lady who tried this and loved it, so figured what the heck-</li>
            <li>Vegan deodorants are not what you would think of as good deodorants.</li>
            <li>This lasts on my body for a good 12 - 24 hours, depending on my activity.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bee worked fairly well, but it has a manly smell to it.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a successful businessman, and when he&#x27;s not keeping the finances of San Francisco millionaires in line, he&#x27;s a beekeeper, an orchid plant \\&quot;doctor\\&quot;, an oyster diver, and he even grows his own heirloom mushrooms.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells nice and pleasant and clean...not like perfume.  </li>
            <li>It smelled great when I put it on in the morning (mostly like vanilla,</li>
            <li>Love it and smells great.</li>
            <li>It works well and and smells great:)</li>
            <li>Excellent product, helps keep me fresh all day.</li>
            <li>A great deodorant, my favorite scent of all the Lavanila deodorants.</li>
            <li>Wonderful quality, price point is worth it for its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, and for the most part it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li>It glides on very easily and smells really good.  </li>
            <li>It has a very light but pleasant scent even for men.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I smell better with no deodorant at all!</li>
            <li>Love the scent...love the product !</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t work for a hot day, you will sweat and smell in just a couple of hours, so use with caution and best to avoid in formal occasions</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this deodorant!</li>
            <li>I ordered the Vanilla Grapefruit and Im in love!</li>
            <li>so it covers the odor better or what!</li>

            <li>Love the scent!</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this deodorant, and I&#x27;ll purchase it again and again!</li>
            <li>Even better than when I did use aluminum products!</li>
            <li>I love to sweat!).</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>Smells very nice and probably the best natural deodorant out there, but needs to be reapplied throughout the day if you want it to be effective.</li>
            <li>The author took two paragraphs to explain how amazing this product is.</li>
            <li>This deodorant smells great and goes on smooth without residue.</li>
            <li>The sage oil deodorant works amazing applied 2x/day for the prevention of sweating but after 24 hours</li>
            <li>Smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I almost didn&#x27;t buy it because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have recommended to friends and they have also liked it.</li>
            <li>Some reviews really liked the scent, so I thought I&#x27;d try it out.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and works if you just sit around.  </li>
            <li>Who grows their own mushrooms (intentionally)??</li>
            <li>Even when I used it, it wasn&#x27;t effective --</li>
            <li>Honest input from my own experience.</li>
            <li>and this is nice.</li>
            <li>The grapefruit scent is nice, but I don&#x27;t think that it is for everyone.</li>
            <li>smell is nice.  </li>
            <li>It does smells nice</li>
            <li>I must be honest and state that this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, too.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, but the product doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>FINALLY I have found a great product that works and as a bonus smells delightful!</li>
            <li>On the plus side, this smells really nice.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for some kind of scent.  </li>
            <li>After I walked to work it needed reapplying and even with reapplying throughout the day, it wasn&#x27;t effective at covering up the stinky sweaty smell for me.</li>
            <li>Highly reommended, the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Works great, smells great, all natural!</li>
            <li>Great smell and feels soooo cool on the skin.</li>
            <li>He is very attractive, very polite, humorous, and can strike up a conversation with just about anyone and make them feel like they&#x27;ve known him for ages.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best out of the 4 others I have tried.</li>
            <li>Best natural deodorant I have found.</li>
            <li>BEST NATURAL DEODORANT</li>
            <li>The best natural deodorant I have found...</li>
            <li>It is all natural, works great, and doesn&#x27;t poison my body with carcinogens or silver oxide!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best natural one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>But best one so far.</li>
            <li>Best natural deodorant I have tried.  </li>
            <li>It gives you a nice &amp;#34;deodorant smell and feel&amp;#34; that most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants lack.  </li>
            <li>So far, I like it the best.</li>
            <li>best natural deo i&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is really nice but the fragrance was not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have used Fresh deoderant for years and have always been happy with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all, this is the best natural deodorant for me.  </li>
            <li>Not the best natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>The best all natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
            <li>fragrance is a perfect blend and it&#x27;s ALL natural which is most important.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>This is far more superior of a product than any I have used!!!</li>
            <li>Love this deodorant - great coverage - smells yummy with no dangerous chemicals 😊</li>
            <li>The scents are beautiful - pure and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li>Smells really good, but it did wear off quickly.</li>
            <li>It is a powdery/soapy smelling deodorant with kind of like a too strong scented candle for linens or home smelling candles.  </li>
            <li>it smells good at first though!</li>
            <li>I really love this deodrant it does its job and</li>
            <li>Smells lovely, and works well.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this deodorant and it has never caused a rash for me.  </li>
            <li>I would have smelled better wearing nothing.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have the lavender scent and like it much better, but wanted something more &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; smelling - this is not.  </li>
            <li>Love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I finally thought I&#x27;d discovered the perfect nontoxic deodorant.</li>
            <li>So, Mr. Way Too Perfect was sitting next to me</li>
            <li>I love this product , in theory.</li>
            <li>I love all the lavanilla deodorants.</li>
            <li>The grapefruit isn&#x27;t my favorite scent, if you can get the passion fruit, GO FOR THAT.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>like most.</li>
            <li>I did test this Deoderant many times.</li>
            <li>then again it&#x27;s ok to smell.</li>
            <li>This is unquestionably the most efficient deodorant I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Love this line - smells a bit off from perfume but still like it.  </li>
            <li>great product, really works.</li>
            <li>This scent isn&#x27;t my favorite, the blackberry one is better.</li>
            <li>I have tried soooooooooo many kinds, but I think this will be the one for me now.</li>
            <li>The smell was okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so many rave reviews about this deodorant and this scent.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more vanilla.</li>
            <li>I like this better than the Vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li>BUT, I&#x27;d rather be a teeny bit musty at the end of the day, than use products that contain known carcinogens. :)</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll be ordering more for sure</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this deordant.</li>
            <li>it for the fall or winter when I&#x27;m not so stinky :-)</li>
            <li>It keeps me from underarm odor for many hours.</li>
            <li>It lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>Lavender is my favorite.</li>
            <li>If you use this and some unsented over the top, it lasts for 2 days, even if you perspire a lot.</li>
            <li>Pleased with product.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
            <li>The lemon vanilla scent is so much better.</li>
            <li>I love their perfumes but this has turned into my 3 year olds deodorant.</li>
            <li>TOTALLY in love.</li>
            <li>The Healthy Deodorant Grapefruit Deodorant.</li>
            <li>It feels so smooth and amazing when I apply it after a shower.</li>
            <li>The scent is not overpowering, but invigorating and refreshing.</li>
            <li>, I just cannot stop smelling it, I absolutely love this smell.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>but the smell is okay kinda like baby powder.</li>
            <li>Love these products.</li>
            <li>This deodorant smells nice and is smooth going on.  </li>
            <li>I can go most of the day before having to reapply.  </li>
            <li>Tried sooo many and none worked.</li>
            <li>I reapply it when I need to, but that isn&#x27;t often:)</li>
            <li>and I keep repeatedly checking myself to make sure I don&#x27;t stink</li>
            <li>I LOVE the texture here.</li>
            <li>I would love if the sent was a bit stronger though.</li>
            <li>cancer or not stay away from most of the otc stuff out there.</li>
            <li>I do have to say of all the vegan/veggie deodorants Ive tried this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Like many others I also got redness under my armpits after 3 days of use, for that price</li>
            <li>Ladies, men will NOT find you appealing with this thing on your underarms.</li>
            <li>Personally I don&#x27;t love the scent.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would smell fruity, but it had more of a tarte smell.</li>
            <li>BUT this deoderant was recieving so many rave reviews i just had to try it.</li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t just use one swipe of it.</li>
            <li>The best thing is that it does not cause any allergic reaction at all which always happens to me with regular deodorant and antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are safe, I don&#x27;t ever react to this (unlike Schmidt&#x27;s after about a week of use), and the scent is lovely.  </li>
            <li>That matters more to me, so I give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s aluminum free!</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I have also purchased the body wash and shave 2 in 1 and love it.  </li>
            <li>so I immediately bought more in grapefruit.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell of the deodorant and the packaging.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and the feel</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell like what it&#x27;s supposed to....smells more like a man&#x27;s deodorant.  </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking and looking for a safe deodorant for both my health and my baby&#x27;s health while breastfeeding.  </li>
            <li>My favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>It does the job better than most</li>
            <li>I like Pit Putty more</li>
            <li>Maybe toxins leaving the body???...not sure.</li>
            <li>The thing that so many of us are worried about is the amount of aluminum seeping into our bodies through antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li>try drinking more water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also not quite sure if it is working, since eliminating dairy from my diet</li>
            <li>The coconut-vanilla deodorant is very warm and feminine and works very well with my gourmand perfumes.</li>
            <li>This is pretty effective at controlling odor and somewhat effective at minimizing sweat (though it&#x27;s not a antiperspirant).</li>
            <li>Very clean feeling.</li>
            <li>smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>This product has a nice, sweet citrus smell.</li>
            <li>I have a number of natural deodorants I rotate and while others are good as well, this is by far the best for me.</li>
            <li>Deodorant smells nice but wears off quickly.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if I applied the deodorant right before the workout it would be more effective.</li>
            <li>All the scents smell delicious and not over powering while still being effective in keeping me dry and fresh.</li>
            <li>The LAVANILA grapefruit scent has a musky odor that I wasn&#x27;t sure about at first, but have since come to love!  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s one of the best natural deodorants I have tried, because it is very gentle.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the twist top I could smell a hint of grapefruit and it smelled nice, however,  once I put it on</li>
            <li>You may have to apply it more than once during the day, but the fact that it is free of chemicals makes it a keeper for me.</li>
            <li>This is a great smelling natural deoderant.  </li>
            <li>But this is the best all around pretty natural deodorant Ive found.</li>
            <li>healthy is important to you</li>
            <li>I have tried every Al free brand available at drugstores but could never find something that didn&#x27;t make me reek!  </li>
            <li>like that it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum in it and the smell is nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>It still is not as great as the traditional chemical laced anti-perspirants/deodarants, but it is pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also not a fan of the vanilla smell, but it isn&#x27;t strong</li>
            <li>The fragrance is a bit strong for me.</li>
            <li>BUT, it&#x27;s not the strong sting of the stench of BO.</li>
            <li>But it really is unpleasantly strong.</li>
            <li>Just a strong musky baby powder smell.</li>
            <li>Using this product allows you to feel good about what you&#x27;re rubbing directly on your lymph nodes!!</li>
            <li>My favorite and most effective natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>When I first received the deodorant the smell kind of threw me off but after a while I got used to it.</li>
            <li>It lasts for ages, smells beautiful and actually works!</li>
            <li>Good for a normal day use.</li>
            <li>I live in Az and am on my feet a good chunk of the day.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and feels comfortable wearing.</li>
            <li>Fine, I can deal with that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and feels smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li>goes on smooth and easy.</li>
            <li>It felt smooth going on, smelled fine and did not clump.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with this product and highly recommend it to anyone looking to try a healthier deodorant.ier deodorant.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s a huge might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best so far of all natural deodorants that I have tried.</li>
            <li>It is made by Colgate-Palmolive, which PETA lists as cruelty free.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic and trust me</li>
            <li>Because what you eat is just as important as what&#x27;s going on your body.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product from Dermstore because they had free shipping, so it&#x27;s just the $18.00</li>
            <li>i just wish they are available in stores</li>
            <li>I enjoy the scent of the product</li>
            <li>if it keeps me odor free for 5hours, then I use a wipe and re-apply the deo.</li>
            <li>this product worked MUCH better than most natural deodorant products... and I have tried many.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m beginning to think this is primarily a winter deodorant.</li>
            <li>Prefer vanilla and lavender but wasn&#x27;t available at the time.</li>
            <li>Tried a few &amp;#34;hippie deodorants&amp;#34; and ended up liking this best.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, without irritation.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell cheap and even my boyfriend loves it.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with it that I just finished ordering my third one from Amazon</li>
            <li>I was all for  trying out chemical free deodorants</li>
            <li>I had cancer and trying to make sound lifestyle changes.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy running at the gym and group exercise class</li>
            <li>As far as natural type deodorants go, for me, this is the best I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>No stains thus far and works good.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far not so good, I smells of sweat after some hours.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping+Friendly service+FABulous deodorant &#x3D;AAA+++Thank you!!!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very fresh and clean, but I have to admit that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; all day...</li>
            <li>This one is very fresh and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time and is a great product.</li>
            <li>The deodorant smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>This keeps me smelling nice during normal day to day activity but does not help during my workouts.  </li>
            <li>Pretty sure it was an allergic reaction).</li>
            <li>and Im pretty sure that is what I am smelling..</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous natural and aluminum free deodorants, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve come across to date.</li>
            <li>I have changed my choice to the original Johnson&amp;Johnson baby powder.  </li>
            <li>I have used many natural deodorants and this is by far the best smelling, goes on very smooth and lasted all day and into the next morning before my shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m saddened that I can no longer continue to use this deodorant, it was moderately effective and I now have to purchase a new deodorant- saddened.</li>
            <li>My pants were clean, check.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just recently been on a mission to find a good aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li>Smells clean and powdery, not too perfume-y.  </li>
            <li>far I love it!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a non-chemical deodorant and this is by far my favorite!  </li>
            <li>The texture is nice, and the scent is mild and pleasant, but it just doesn&#x27;t last, even for a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>and I have now had it on for a full 24 hours (reapplied once this morning)</li>
            <li>I really like it seems to better than lavanilla</li>
            <li>I used to use the regular clinical strength deodorant and this is almost as good as that.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a natural deodorant with a nice smell, this is for you.</li>
            <li>I will keep using Lavanila it off and on because it does work and smells good, but it also irritates my skin, so it&#x27;s not a solid 5 stars.</li>
            <li>this really works and feels so smooth!</li>
            <li>It rolls on smooth and I feel fresh wearing it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s true, I do.  </li>
            <li>The smell was good and it worked for only 2-3 hours, but after that it was like I hadn&#x27;t put anything on at all.</li>
            <li>I wish I could return this product because I&#x27;ve found deodorant recipes online using coconut oil and corn starch that work better for me and are much, much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be willing to try Tom&#x27;s again, but this brand was recommended by a friend and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I do apply on fresh clean underarms to start of course.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and feels silky on the skin - however, I began to stink after only two hours of the initial application.</li>
            <li>Smells much better, works much better, no white residue.</li>
            <li>For cruelty free &amp;#34;mainstream&amp;#34; antiperspirant (with aluminum which is the only effective antiperspirant, these others are just deodorants)</li>
            <li>Warning: do not use sage oil if pregnant.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and didn&#x27;t have to reapply too often however big HUGE</li>
            <li>The grapefruit vanilla scent is mild.</li>
            <li>I use the LaVanilla grapefruit perfume as well and although it initially smells like vanilla/grapefruit, the strong smell itself kinda fades away quickly which is good because who wants to noticeably smell like deodorant all day?</li>
            <li>This is a way better option and after trying it once came back to order two more.</li>
            <li>absolutely love this deodorant for its effectiveness and scent and no harsh ingredients!!  </li>
            <li>So far this is the best natural deodorant I have found so far.</li>
            <li>I do not expect wonders - like no perspiration, odor free all day in hot temperatures...</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe a natural deodorant actually works - I am delighted!  </li>
            <li>Maybe one of the other scents are more effective?  </li>
            <li>That is not unpleasant, but it is not what a grapefruit or vanilla smells like to me.</li>
            <li>Yes, you do have to reapply it more often, since it doesn&#x27;t have that sealant that most harmful deodorants have, and honestly, the smell actually doesn&#x27;t make me want to vomit either; especially since it wears off after a day&#x27;s application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hands down the best natural deodorant I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many natural deodorants and this is the winner!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think any natural stuff will be as good as the normal stuff, but this one does pretty good and has a better scent than the plain vanilla.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and in the day and age of hidden chemicals that is a wonderful thing.</li>
            <li>but I have realized that you have to get your pits 100% clean before putting deodorant on in the first place.</li>
            <li>Very excited to have found a natural deodorant with perscription-like strength!  </li>
            <li>I think this would be great for some, but was a little manly for me and didn&#x27;t work with my chemistry.</li>
            <li>It does an amazing job for a standard work day (desk job) even in the summer.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, the shipping was fast and everything went smooth.</li>
            <li>It lasts on me all day if it&#x27;s an easy day, but if it&#x27;s been a particularly stressful day</li>
            <li>For an deodorant that is all natural and contains no aluminum, it works OK.  </li>
            <li>Love how this is natural and works.</li>
            <li>But I wanted something more natural.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural, aluminum-free deodorant and this product came up as one of the top recommendations.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a fresh, citrus sell</li>
            <li>It smells like if someone took a powder fresh deodorant and sprinkled vanilla on it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very hesitant to post my review because this seems like such a beloved brand, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>As for the wear of the deodorant, I must say that I like it more than any natural one that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I decided it would be better to reapply using a natural deodorant instead.</li>
            <li>I tried Tom&#x27;s, Nourish, Body Shop natural deodorants before but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>I have wanted to switch to a natural deodorant for ages and I am so glad I bought the LAVANILA</li>
            <li>I would recommend this deodorant if you&#x27;re looking for a natural alternative - works much better than others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Mmmmm.. Stay fresh all day</li>
            <li>If you can manage to reapply mid-day, then you are golden without using harmful chemicals on your body.</li>
            <li>but you know it seems worth it.</li>
            <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t as good as an aluminum filled antiperspirant, but it&#x27;s the best of it&#x27;s kind (and that&#x27;s coming from someone who&#x27;s spent hundreds of dollars throwing away crap that doesn&#x27;t work).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not using it just because I wanted something more natural and vegan.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>applying it leaves a white streak but unlike other sticks this disappears quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed by this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried the other LAVANILA scents and while the passion-fruit is a close second, the grapefruit works the best for me.  </li>
            <li>Application was great, smooth and dried pretty fast.</li>
            <li>it doesnt really smell like vanilla or grapefruit to me but has a clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Great light scent and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Good product that I will buy again unless I find something more long lasting.</li>
            <li>On the right day you MIGHT almost pick up the scent of grapefruit or vanilla.</li>
            <li>right ..</li>
            <li>I could smell myself right away and also started sweating within 1-2 hrs.</li>
            <li>Smells Kind Of Odd but works fine.</li>
            <li>I find that it works great and definitely better than any other natural deodorant I tried by far.  </li>
            <li>It lasts long and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>So after reading many reviews and having tried natural Deoderant before I was a bit eh about spending this much on a stick of deoderant.</li>
            <li>I bought this once before on Sephora and loved it, but found it on Amazon for a lot less $$.  </li>
            <li>I am very bummed because I really hoped I had found a aluminum free deodorant that worked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on a natural deodorant journey for over a year now and decided to try this one since it got such good reviews.</li>
            <li>This one smells nice and keeps body odor away even after a long day at work followed by hot yoga.</li>
            <li>The very first day I put it on, it lasted the whole day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since then, it lasts half a day.&lt;br /&gt;Its been hot here, and so during the day I need to re-apply it, and it will keep good until evening.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t completely keep you dry in summer months, but does better than most.  </li>
            <li>I attribute it&#x27;s success in large part to the scent.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this particular one, as I had read positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I apply crystal deodorant first and then use this</li>
            <li>I like the smell of this, and love the packaging, especially the roundness of the product.  </li>
            <li>First, this smells like baby powder.</li>
            <li>Shoes shined, nails polished, and I sorta even felt hot.</li>
            <li>Problem is, I was literally hot.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is if I use too much of it (more than 2 swipes) or I sweat (workout) in it I sometimes break out because my pores get clogged.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s what I discovered and some recommendations for first time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty bummed</li>
            <li>One of the only healthy women&#x27;s deodorants that works for us.</li>
            <li>At the most I only have to reapply 1x in a day.</li>
            <li>It might not work for everyone or on exceptionally hot days, but I don&#x27;t like to wear aluminum based antiperspirants</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much I spend on this deodorant, but it is really worth the price.  </li>
            <li>i was skeptical about this product, but it is awesome!</li>
            <li>This one has a lovely smell - more &amp;#34;normal.&amp;#34; But it simply does not last.</li>
            <li>She reports that it really worked, and loves the scent and feel!</li>
            <li>My first order of this deodorant was in the lavender vanilla scent</li>
            <li>I think it actually works better then the Lav/van scent.</li>
            <li>I bike to work every day and it holds up pretty well.</li>
            <li>This stuff works pretty well.</li>
            <li>But for the price, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised to find this less-floral than expected; it&#x27;s a lovely scent and appropriate for men and women.</li>
            <li>I still do keep a stick of regular deodorant for the days when I need to keep the sweat in and avoid smelling like a man! :)</li>
            <li>I wear it at home so havent tested it in situations where I really sweat a lot, but it seems to work for me!</li>
            <li>Within hours, it never fails, I always start to smell.  </li>
            <li>(I should note that most regular antiperspirants don&#x27;t work for me either.)  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend wearing during the summer or extremely hot days.</li>
            <li>I have tried nearly EVERY product on the market that is pareben and aluminum free and nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely order this product from this seller again.</li>
            <li>I put on a lot (more than I would use for regular deodorant) and while I still sweated I didn&#x27;t stink.  </li>
            <li>But, I spent some time looking up recipes for making my own deodorant because the Lavanila price was just so bothersome.  </li>
            <li>I keep one in my purse and one at home as its good to reapply a few times during the day.</li>
            <li>And most importantly, it does not irritate my skin like typical deodorants do.  </li>
            <li>Amazing deodorant - the only natural product of found that always works.</li>
            <li>The bottle is smaller than I thought it would be, but it seems to be lasting fairly well.</li>
            <li>So far my favorite has been T&#x27;eo from LUSH.</li>
            <li>I tried the pure vanilla first, but decided to branch out and try another scent.</li>
            <li>Maybe something in my chemical makeup doesn&#x27;t play nicely with this, but that doesn&#x27;t make sense either as the ingredients in all the natural deodorants are pretty similar straight across the board.</li>
            <li>I also notice it&#x27;s slightly cooling during application, which is pretty nice, in case you have to reapply at some point.</li>
            <li>But... it didn&#x27;t do anything positive for me deodorant-wise.  </li>
            <li>It has a ton of positive reviews...</li>
            <li>It handles workouts and hot summer really well.</li>
            <li>first, it worked really well.  </li>
            <li>First day of using this, it was a very hot busy day.</li>
            <li>I switched back and fourth with naturally fresh roll-on which kinda worked, but not the best still would smell, needed to be reapplied and air dried because that deodorant is wet(annoying).</li>
            <li>LaVanilla smells nice once applied but does not keep me dry the entire day and the scent fades quickly.  </li>
            <li>The regular size does not have this problem and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I would be pretty smelly by the end of a light work day, but it wasn&#x27;t necessarily a body odor smell.</li>
            <li>I love how dry I stay</li>
            <li>This product applies nicely, but lasts maybe half the day before another application is needed.  </li>
            <li>Its not as &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; as i would like however it has such a familiar texture of that nice powdered dry feeling like normal deodorants.</li>
            <li>It keeps me feeling fresh and clean and no other 100% natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>the scent was nice, but if I sweat even a little, it just smelled like perfumed sweat.</li>
            <li>After reading blogs and reviews, this one seemed pretty highly recommended</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying so hard to find a natural deodorant, and this one came up with all these great reviews, so I thought it would be a hit...</li>
            <li>After doing much research on a deodorant that won&#x27;t stain light clothes and work properly - I found this one and decided to try it - even with the hefty price tag.  </li>
            <li>Another huge plus is that this deodorant will last you a while.</li>
            <li>Smells really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Stinked, really.</li>
            <li>though - sort of a flowery vanilla with just a tiny hint of citrus) and went on really smooth.</li>
            <li>and it really works.  </li>
            <li>they are very</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really smell like vanilla OR grapefruit, though...</li>
            <li>, I expected much better.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t smell anything 5 minutes after you apply it anyhow</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>I am a very sweaty Pearson and I have never had a stick that has done the job</li>
            <li>It works really well for me</li>
            <li>EWG database gives it a toxicity rating of 4, mostly for the unknown fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really like the smell</li>
            <li>I gave it a 3 star because I really like the smell</li>
            <li>and it really kept me from sweating</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very musky baby powder smell to me with a hint of vanilla.</li>
            <li>Have seen this in Whole Foods and know I can purchase from there as well.  </li>
            <li>If anything, it smells very powdery to me .  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about every natural deodorant on the market without success.  </li>
            <li>He couldn&#x27;t stand me wasting it after how much it cost me.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s getting ready to throw away her lotion and purchase from them as well.  </li>
            <li>I tried FIVE others (Crystal, Toms, Alba, Jason, and Lavilin) and absolutely none of them worked.</li>
            <li>so I need something that really works.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>I had been using Toms of Maine as a natural deodorant and it was not cutting it.</li>
            <li>I found that for me, a light sweater, with moderate body odor, it DOES work, but will not hold up when stressed or when I have to do a lot of walking/excessive movement.  </li>
            <li>If you are changing from a modern deodorant/antiperspirant don&#x27;t expect immediate results.</li>
            <li>And I wore it during a busy day where I was sweating most of the day and did not notice any odor at the end of the day, with only one application in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed through trial and error that the baby powder scents of most traditional antiperspirants/deodorants don&#x27;t mix well with my body&#x27;s natural odor</li>
            <li>I made my own and used it for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>They should tell you you are going to smell like an old man&#x27;s after shave!!!</li>
            <li>and I have decided I am willing to pay more for products with less chemicals.</li>
            <li>The scent is a little strong but disapates quickly.  </li>
            <li>I decided to take the plunge into natural deodorants - my body will thank me, right?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because it applies so nicely, and is all natural, I will try the other scents.  </li>
            <li>It holds for most of the day; if you have a more physical job or are out in the sun for long periods, you may need a second application.  </li>
            <li>I do high intensity training and it holds up well and for an organic, crap free product its superb!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; as well as antiperspirants, but it does work better than any other deodorant I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m swearing off harmful normal deodorant brands for life after this!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;organic\\&quot; deodorants, and this is this first that has actually worked for me.</li>
            <li>The scent of this one is okay, but there are other options</li>
            <li>I would use this one over most other non-vegan deodorants.</li>
            <li>Works extremely well with the deodorant, much better at controlling the sweaty factor than Shower to Shower.</li>
            <li>This is our new favorite natural deodorant because it actually works! ..</li>
            <li>(the only thing that works), or live with the stink (no one liked that option, especially me).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was looking for an all natural deodorant for a long time and sooooo many of them do not work.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin but never have I had such a strong adverse reaction to a product.</li>
            <li>the fragrance is strong at first but tones down a lot.</li>
            <li>First all natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t give me a rash.</li>
            <li>As far as deodorants goes, this is has been my favorite (out of maybe 6 different natural ones I tried).</li>
            <li>This is the first natural deodorant that I have ever used that worked.  </li>
            <li>so I just suck it up and make sure I don&#x27;t get too close to the other people in my class!</li>
            <li>This one makes you feel a little more like you&#x27;re &amp;#34;pampering&amp;#34; your armpits I guess haha.</li>
            <li>As a previous reviewer stated instead of smelling like Vanilla Grapefruit, it smells more like baby powder.</li>
            <li>decent.  </li>
            <li>I NEVER buy anything suggested out of a magazine but this particular article was something I could relate too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I saw this product had a glowing review in Lucky magazine last month.</li>
            <li>Works decent.</li>
            <li>but I find when I have a quick break out sweat from running after a dog or something simple</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re looking for strong coverage for harder days, you won&#x27;t it here.</li>
            <li>Only on the very hot days do I have to reapply.</li>
            <li>The first couple of days were tricky because I was so conscious of the fact that I was wearing a new deodorant.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this deodorant because of the reviews and the price.  </li>
            <li>Not a complete odor-blocker, but very soft smooth and not sticky.</li>
            <li>I am a Lavanilla freak, so I had high hopes for the deodorant.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Again, it&#x27;s not the sharp repulsive smell of BO, but a softer more natural sweat scent.</li>
            <li>many other &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants do not.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m pretty stoked on finding this natural deodorant!</li>
            <li>I was hoping this deodorant would be the ticket, but it only lasts a few hours for me, half a day at best.</li>
            <li>Smell seemed a bit strong at first but once applied, it was not strong at all.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I am very self conscious about body odor.</li>
            <li>It is definitely working better than my old traditional, chemical-y, store-bought stuff.  </li>
            <li>I have looked for &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants that actually work for a long time and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Most of our bodies are so used to using harsh chemicals to stop sweat or prevent BO.</li>
            <li>The only issue I had was towards the end of the day I had to reapply, it didn&#x27;t keep me fresh all day.</li>
            <li>I bought it at my local Whole Foods store without smelling it first.</li>
            <li>Avoid if you actually like wearing deodorant that keeps you smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of this deodorant and it has worked well at maintaining the scent even through heavy gym workouts.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find a natural deodorant that actually works for more than 2 hours, especially if you are in the heat or exercising.  </li>
            <li>Its fragrance is pleasant but very subtle and does not clash with cologne.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I would like to test their other scent options, but this is fine.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, but you definitely don&#x27;t stay dry, which is the case with all non-antiperspirent because your pores aren&#x27;t being blocked and allowed to breath.  </li>
            <li>this only hides the smell with a really strong fragrance, but doesn&#x27;t actually eliminate it for me.</li>
            <li>all other natural deodorants just make me smell 10x worse except for this brand and those crystal salt water sprays that are also awesome but don&#x27;t smell like anything.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty decent deodorant for not having some key ingredients.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d rely on it while going to my senior prom, wedding or some other ultra important event as I wouldn&#x27;t want to take any chances on it failing to work.  </li>
            <li>This only works for about two hours for me, during light, normal daily activity.  </li>
            <li>That being said I live in AZ and have to re-apply all deoderants.</li>
            <li>have used it 5 days now, and have exercised my heart out (in 70+ degree weather, yes I live in CA)</li>
            <li>I live in 95 degree weather</li>
            <li>It took about two weeks from my new deodorant to work.</li>
            <li>Not very effective, better than some department store brands.</li>
            <li>have also tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorant, which I can pick up at the local WM, for much cheaper, and the unscented has a toxicity rating of 1, but it seems to irritate my skin more than this, though not as much as typical</li>
            <li>there were no other seats on the bus, so he stood up the whole ride home.</li>
            <li>Too Perfect.u there were no other seats on the bus, so he stood up the whole ride home.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve very sensitive to smells, that&#x27;s one of the reason I wanted to try this.</li>
            <li>The smell of the deodorant itself is kind of strong, but not quite unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>or it&#x27;s hot outside</li>
            <li>I prefer handmade ones off Etsy, they last much longer!</li>
            <li>I have fewer odor problems since switching to natural deodorant!</li>
            <li>I will say that it took a couple of weeks for my body to adjust to not having the regular clinical strength deodorant - so stick with it (just reapply during those first two weeks).</li>
            <li>Others have left me smelling like B.O. within hours, this one lasts all day, even during the hot and sweaty summer months.</li>
            <li>I started with the Grapefruit scent and was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>The result is a deodorant with no harsh chemicals (aluminum) and no sweaty underarms - hooray!</li>
            <li>Lavanila only needs one application to make it through a hot and humid day in the nation&#x27;s Capitol swamp, DC.</li>
            <li>When I have a spike in activity or it is too hot outside</li>
            <li>It is not a fresh light</li>
            <li>That being said the coverage and easy application far out weigh the slight smell issue.</li>
            <li>It goes on cool and wet feeling but dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you with a wet pit feeling.</li>
            <li>Because of the price - I only wear with my light colored clothes to prevent staining so it has lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The vanilla grapefruit scent is light and citrusy and smells less like lemon pledge than the vanilla lemon scent.</li>
            <li>I went for a hike with my kids today and also worked in my yard a little bit, and it has stood up to those tests just fine.  </li>
            <li>So most natural deodorants don&#x27;t do the trick, especially in a small room full of people.</li>
            <li>It goes on dry, feels just like the nasty aluminum filled variety (yuck!), but keeps you smelling great!</li>
            <li>Pretty big waste of money in my opinion, which is really unfortunate since I purchased it after it topped a list of best natural deodorants.</li>
            <li>It has a significant scent that fades over the course of 1.5 to 2 hours, but is slightly there at 5 hours.  </li>
            <li>The one star less is because the fragrance that is less citrusy and more like a crisp laundry detergent.</li>
            <li>It has more of a powdery smell, which while it isn&#x27;t bad, is not the smell that I was looking for and it clashes with my more fruity perfumes.</li>
            <li>i am very picky on what i use anymore and want to stay as natural as possible.</li>
            <li>You do have to maintain proper hygiene for it to work (shower every day and reapply the deodorant halfway through your day on CLEAN, DRY armpits).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear and non-sticky however.</li>
            <li>This does not work anywhere near as well as antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>Everyone wants him to sit next to them.</li>
            <li>I guess I really must have smelled for him to have made the decision to stand up instead of sitting next to my stinky self.</li>
            <li>I guess I really must have smelled for him to have made the decision to stand up instead of sitting next to my stinky self.</li>
            <li>Looking for a natural deodorant that works all day.</li>
            <li>I splurged and bought this natural &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; deodorant.</li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a natural sweat smell-</li>
            <li>I bought this because it has all natural ingredients</li>
            <li>Still, I&#x27;ve tried ALOT of natural deodorants lately and so far, this one seems to be holding up better than the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did this for a while until I decided to try Jason purifying tea tree deodorant so far</li>
            <li>I was surprised when after a week of using Lavanila a rash developed.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a natural deodorant</li>
            <li>SO FAR.  </li>
            <li>I used to use Lush&#x27;s Teo</li>
            <li>As far as I have seen, no residue wears off on clothes.</li>
            <li>I keep the smaller size in my backpack in case I need to reapply again during the day (which is very rare).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really seems to last all day.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, I went with this brand because it completely eliminates aluminum from the ingredient list, something</li>
            <li>Only downside with the grapefruit scent, it smells very musky like a mens deodorant.</li>
            <li>I developed a rash under both of my arms.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t smell, but now that I am breastfeeding I want something natural.</li>
            <li>and i am really sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>I smell nothing near a fruity smell.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t bother me too much, but now my under arms are very red and itchy, so that is why I will stop using this deodorant.</li>
            <li>Drug store brand deodorants far surpassed the quality of this product in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I wanted an all natural deodarant...</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant works well for a natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>The search for a natural deodorant THAT WORKS continues.</li>
            <li>but I am conscious of my sweating.</li>
            <li>whether or not they want to go natural.</li>
            <li>The smells compete and it almost smells like an old lady rub.  </li>
            <li>You really have to rub it all around for it to last.</li>
            <li>but this one is much easier to apply especially when you&#x27;re in a hurry in the morning.</li>
            <li>A lot of people try natural deodorants with natural soap.</li>
            <li>They both last all day and are much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I changed from drug store deodorants to natural this summer.</li>
            <li>BUT since then I have no  problems with smelling BO&#x27;ish with natural deodorants and some talc powder (shower to shower).</li>
            <li>I like knowing I am not putting aluminum zirconium under my pits near my mammary glands</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for an all natural deodorant that lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling like B.O.</li>
            <li>I found a different natural deodorant that I absolutely love (Green Tidings).</li>
            <li>I have to reapply it on some days, especially when I&#x27;m going to be doing anything involving sweating, but that&#x27;s still a lot better than all the 20 or so different other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t crazy about Tom&#x27;s, even though I liked the price of Tom&#x27;s over the Healthy of course, but it didn&#x27;t have that powdery-smooth feeling like other deodorants</li>
            <li>Sadly, I don&#x27;t like this &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; deodorant any better than any of the other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried - either for light daily use or for more active pursuits.</li>
            <li>After doing lots of online research mainly based on reviews and recommendations from people who have actually tried the product, I decided to try the Lavanila line.</li>
            <li>I have tried other natural deodorants and did not like them, this is the first natural one that I like.</li>
            <li>If I sweat profusely, I definitely start to smell a little bit like BO mixed with the scent of the deodorant, but its better than if I was not using any deodorant at all.</li>
            <li>This works ok if you aren&#x27;t particularly active, but does not mask odor or wetness if you are even moderately active.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never liked a single grapefruit scented item I&#x27;ve ever gotten, but thought maybe the vanilla would balance it nicely.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, I had remembered to comb my hair and put on lipstick before leaving work, because I know he usually rides my bus on Tuesdays</li>
            <li>I also love the LAVANILA fragrances, which are actually surprisingly complex for only containing natural oils.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been attempting different ones over the years because of all the health issues ingredients in normal deodorants can cause.</li>
            <li>Once my skin was back to normal</li>
            <li>Not only does this smell amazing, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin like almost every other deodorant or make me smell bad like most natural deodorants!</li>
            <li>I actually smell pretty good at the end of the day, but a little less so the next morning which is expected.  </li>
            <li>A girlfriend recommended it and said that she has been using it for a very long time, but again, it didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I needed something better, since I had this icky discolored skin - and I actually found out about this on Sephora, but decided to buy it on Amazon, since it was cheaper.</li>
            <li>This is the only natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The odor is not like most natural deodorants I usually hate the smell of natural deodorants and this one is very very mild.</li>
            <li>For the first week or so after switching from my old deodorant I had to reapply half way through the day else</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever tried a deodorant that I&#x27;ve liked less.</li>
            <li>I used it a few times, and will probably get rid of it, maybe the other LAVANILA scents are better?</li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>A little pricey in my opinion but worth it.</li>
            <li>I have tried dozens of them, with little success until now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really heavy and musky - but it certainly wasn&#x27;t something I couldn&#x27;t live with.</li>
            <li>Only natural deoderant that has worked for me</li>
            <li>This is the only natural deodorant without baking soda (which irritates me) that worked for me.  </li>
            <li>(he needs to get home early to coach urban basketball...</li>
            <li>A natural deodorant that I may come back to.</li>
            <li>Finally I found a natural deod.</li>
            <li>The only natural antiperspirant I found that works for me is sage oil (recipe below).</li>
            <li>natural deordorants for a while and scoured the reviews before chosing Lavanila as one of 6 naturals I bought with my last Amazon order.</li>
            <li>This is the only natural deodorant that works for me.</li>
            <li>such a natural product, its great.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>This is the only natural deodorant I have found that works as well as it does.  </li>
            <li>I have been using natural deoderant for years now and have used several options...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the normal wet feeling natural deodorant that you may be used to it.  </li>
            <li>Within a few minutes I am sweating (and not so fresh).</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t seem effective at all.  </li>
            <li>It makes my underarms smell good at first, but once it wears off, I am left with worse-smelling armpits :(</li>
            <li>Of course, like any white colored deodorant, if you are going to put on a black top, you have to be careful, but that is universal.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m a little more active one day or its simply hotter</li>
            <li>How many times have you tried a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; deodorant for whatever reason, and found it to be seriously lacking effectiveness?!</li>
            <li>Works fine for everyday wear, but not really up to the task of deodorizing during a workout.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and feminine, baby-powderish - calling it grapefruit is inaccurate - it doesn&#x27;t smell like grapefruit at all, which is my only complaint.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product, but it doesn&#x27;t meet my active lifestyle needs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it one more shot before going back to Secret Clinical</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other natural deodorants that did not work near as well as this one.</li>
            <li>It will make your clothes white if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>Meaning: If you use &amp;#34;natural soap&amp;#34; or not strong enough soap and are not getting your pits clean enough - NO natural deodorant is going to cover up that</li>
            <li>The pretty packaging is always a plus, the pleasant smell, and with the nasty rash gone now, I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this as my go-to natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it works wonderfully, but it&#x27;s just not worth the price yet, at least for me.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is I&#x27;m not satisfied with the grapefruit-vanilla scent, but that is just because of my own scent taste/preference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve been through at least a dozen other brands!!</li>

            <li> It works great for me and has for months.  </li>
            <li> I hope they come out with more scents!!</li>
            <li> and so glad I did!!</li>
            <li> It seemed very effective at odor control</li>
            <li> very nice smell</li>
            <li> also don&#x27;t find it to be very effective at all.  </li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t believe it was very effective.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed and satisfied with how the deodorant works and lasts.</li>
            <li> Im loving the scent!</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel wonderful - it is very moisturizing and great on shaved armpits!</li>
            <li> Smells pleasant ..slightly lavender and a hint of grapefruit.  </li>
            <li> If you need to smell great at the end of the day, don&#x27;t use this...or be prepared apply it AGAIN right before you need to smell great (applying deodorant at the bus stop probably isn&#x27;t the best look, though).</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a good test candidate</li>
            <li> It works and smells good.</li>
            <li> my skin looked good</li>
            <li> I did a good amount of research on aluminum-free deodorants and have tried a number of them</li>
            <li> Good products will purchase again.  </li>
            <li> Still looking for the a good organic antiperpserant.</li>
            <li> I still decided to wear for a week in order to give a good review.</li>
            <li> I saw a blog about another lady who tried this and loved it, so figured what the heck-</li>
            <li> Vegan deodorants are not what you would think of as good deodorants.</li>
            <li> This lasts on my body for a good 12 - 24 hours, depending on my activity.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bee worked fairly well, but it has a manly smell to it.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a successful businessman, and when he&#x27;s not keeping the finances of San Francisco millionaires in line, he&#x27;s a beekeeper, an orchid plant \\&quot;doctor\\&quot;, an oyster diver, and he even grows his own heirloom mushrooms.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells nice and pleasant and clean...not like perfume.  </li>
            <li> It smelled great when I put it on in the morning (mostly like vanilla,</li>
            <li> Love it and smells great.</li>
            <li> It works well and and smells great:)</li>
            <li> Excellent product, helps keep me fresh all day.</li>
            <li> A great deodorant, my favorite scent of all the Lavanila deodorants.</li>
            <li> Wonderful quality, price point is worth it for its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> The smell is great, and for the most part it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> It glides on very easily and smells really good.  </li>
            <li> It has a very light but pleasant scent even for men.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I smell better with no deodorant at all!</li>
            <li> Love the scent...love the product !</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work for a hot day, you will sweat and smell in just a couple of hours, so use with caution and best to avoid in formal occasions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this deodorant!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Vanilla Grapefruit and Im in love!</li>
            <li> so it covers the odor better or what!</li>
            <li> love this deodorant!</li>
            <li> Love the scent!</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this deodorant, and I&#x27;ll purchase it again and again!</li>
            <li> Even better than when I did use aluminum products!</li>
            <li> I love to sweat!).</li>
            <li> Love this!  </li>
            <li> Smells very nice and probably the best natural deodorant out there, but needs to be reapplied throughout the day if you want it to be effective.</li>
            <li> The author took two paragraphs to explain how amazing this product is.</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells great and goes on smooth without residue.</li>
            <li> The sage oil deodorant works amazing applied 2x/day for the prevention of sweating but after 24 hours</li>
            <li> Smells amazing.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, I almost didn&#x27;t buy it because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have recommended to friends and they have also liked it.</li>
            <li> Some reviews really liked the scent, so I thought I&#x27;d try it out.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice and works if you just sit around.  </li>
            <li> Who grows their own mushrooms (intentionally)??</li>
            <li> Even when I used it, it wasn&#x27;t effective --</li>
            <li> Honest input from my own experience.</li>
            <li> and this is nice.</li>
            <li> The grapefruit scent is nice, but I don&#x27;t think that it is for everyone.</li>
            <li> smell is nice.  </li>
            <li> It does smells nice</li>
            <li> I must be honest and state that this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, too.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, but the product doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> FINALLY I have found a great product that works and as a bonus smells delightful!</li>
            <li> On the plus side, this smells really nice.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for some kind of scent.  </li>
            <li> After I walked to work it needed reapplying and even with reapplying throughout the day, it wasn&#x27;t effective at covering up the stinky sweaty smell for me.</li>
            <li> Highly reommended, the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells great, all natural!</li>
            <li> Great smell and feels soooo cool on the skin.</li>
            <li> He is very attractive, very polite, humorous, and can strike up a conversation with just about anyone and make them feel like they&#x27;ve known him for ages.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best out of the 4 others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant I have found.</li>
            <li> BEST NATURAL DEODORANT</li>
            <li> The best natural deodorant I have found...</li>
            <li> It is all natural, works great, and doesn&#x27;t poison my body with carcinogens or silver oxide!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best natural one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> But best one so far.</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant I have tried.  </li>
            <li> It gives you a nice &amp;#34;deodorant smell and feel&amp;#34; that most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants lack.  </li>
            <li> So far, I like it the best.</li>
            <li> best natural deo i&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is really nice but the fragrance was not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have used Fresh deoderant for years and have always been happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, this is the best natural deodorant for me.  </li>
            <li> Not the best natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> The best all natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
            <li> fragrance is a perfect blend and it&#x27;s ALL natural which is most important.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> This is far more superior of a product than any I have used!!!</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant - great coverage - smells yummy with no dangerous chemicals 😊</li>
            <li> The scents are beautiful - pure and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li> Smells really good, but it did wear off quickly.</li>
            <li> It is a powdery/soapy smelling deodorant with kind of like a too strong scented candle for linens or home smelling candles.  </li>
            <li> it smells good at first though!</li>
            <li> I really love this deodrant it does its job and</li>
            <li> Smells lovely, and works well.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this deodorant and it has never caused a rash for me.  </li>
            <li> I would have smelled better wearing nothing.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I have the lavender scent and like it much better, but wanted something more &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; smelling - this is not.  </li>
            <li> Love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I finally thought I&#x27;d discovered the perfect nontoxic deodorant.</li>
            <li> So, Mr. Way Too Perfect was sitting next to me</li>
            <li> I love this product , in theory.</li>
            <li> I love all the lavanilla deodorants.</li>
            <li> The grapefruit isn&#x27;t my favorite scent, if you can get the passion fruit, GO FOR THAT.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> like most.</li>
            <li> I did test this Deoderant many times.</li>
            <li> then again it&#x27;s ok to smell.</li>
            <li> This is unquestionably the most efficient deodorant I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Love this line - smells a bit off from perfume but still like it.  </li>
            <li> great product, really works.</li>
            <li> This scent isn&#x27;t my favorite, the blackberry one is better.</li>
            <li> I have tried soooooooooo many kinds, but I think this will be the one for me now.</li>
            <li> The smell was okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many rave reviews about this deodorant and this scent.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more vanilla.</li>
            <li> I like this better than the Vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li> BUT, I&#x27;d rather be a teeny bit musty at the end of the day, than use products that contain known carcinogens. :)</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll be ordering more for sure</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this deordant.</li>
            <li> it for the fall or winter when I&#x27;m not so stinky :-)</li>
            <li> It keeps me from underarm odor for many hours.</li>
            <li> It lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li> Lavender is my favorite.</li>
            <li> If you use this and some unsented over the top, it lasts for 2 days, even if you perspire a lot.</li>
            <li> Pleased with product.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
            <li> The lemon vanilla scent is so much better.</li>
            <li> I love their perfumes but this has turned into my 3 year olds deodorant.</li>
            <li> TOTALLY in love.</li>
            <li> The Healthy Deodorant Grapefruit Deodorant.</li>
            <li> It feels so smooth and amazing when I apply it after a shower.</li>
            <li> The scent is not overpowering, but invigorating and refreshing.</li>
            <li> , I just cannot stop smelling it, I absolutely love this smell.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> but the smell is okay kinda like baby powder.</li>
            <li> Love these products.</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells nice and is smooth going on.  </li>
            <li> I can go most of the day before having to reapply.  </li>
            <li> Tried sooo many and none worked.</li>
            <li> I reapply it when I need to, but that isn&#x27;t often:)</li>
            <li> and I keep repeatedly checking myself to make sure I don&#x27;t stink</li>
            <li> I LOVE the texture here.</li>
            <li> I would love if the sent was a bit stronger though.</li>
            <li> cancer or not stay away from most of the otc stuff out there.</li>
            <li> I do have to say of all the vegan/veggie deodorants Ive tried this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Like many others I also got redness under my armpits after 3 days of use, for that price</li>
            <li> Ladies, men will NOT find you appealing with this thing on your underarms.</li>
            <li> Personally I don&#x27;t love the scent.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would smell fruity, but it had more of a tarte smell.</li>
            <li> BUT this deoderant was recieving so many rave reviews i just had to try it.</li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t just use one swipe of it.</li>
            <li> The best thing is that it does not cause any allergic reaction at all which always happens to me with regular deodorant and antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are safe, I don&#x27;t ever react to this (unlike Schmidt&#x27;s after about a week of use), and the scent is lovely.  </li>
            <li> That matters more to me, so I give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s aluminum free!</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I have also purchased the body wash and shave 2 in 1 and love it.  </li>
            <li> so I immediately bought more in grapefruit.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell of the deodorant and the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell and the feel</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like what it&#x27;s supposed to....smells more like a man&#x27;s deodorant.  </li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking and looking for a safe deodorant for both my health and my baby&#x27;s health while breastfeeding.  </li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li> I love the scent.</li>
            <li> It does the job better than most</li>
            <li> I like Pit Putty more</li>
            <li> Maybe toxins leaving the body???...not sure.</li>
            <li> The thing that so many of us are worried about is the amount of aluminum seeping into our bodies through antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li> try drinking more water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not quite sure if it is working, since eliminating dairy from my diet</li>
            <li> The coconut-vanilla deodorant is very warm and feminine and works very well with my gourmand perfumes.</li>
            <li> This is pretty effective at controlling odor and somewhat effective at minimizing sweat (though it&#x27;s not a antiperspirant).</li>
            <li> Very clean feeling.</li>
            <li> smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice, sweet citrus smell.</li>
            <li> I have a number of natural deodorants I rotate and while others are good as well, this is by far the best for me.</li>
            <li> Deodorant smells nice but wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if I applied the deodorant right before the workout it would be more effective.</li>
            <li> All the scents smell delicious and not over powering while still being effective in keeping me dry and fresh.</li>
            <li> The LAVANILA grapefruit scent has a musky odor that I wasn&#x27;t sure about at first, but have since come to love!  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s one of the best natural deodorants I have tried, because it is very gentle.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the twist top I could smell a hint of grapefruit and it smelled nice, however,  once I put it on</li>
            <li> You may have to apply it more than once during the day, but the fact that it is free of chemicals makes it a keeper for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling natural deoderant.  </li>
            <li> But this is the best all around pretty natural deodorant Ive found.</li>
            <li> healthy is important to you</li>
            <li> I have tried every Al free brand available at drugstores but could never find something that didn&#x27;t make me reek!  </li>
            <li> like that it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum in it and the smell is nice and fresh.</li>
            <li> It still is not as great as the traditional chemical laced anti-perspirants/deodarants, but it is pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not a fan of the vanilla smell, but it isn&#x27;t strong</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a bit strong for me.</li>
            <li> BUT, it&#x27;s not the strong sting of the stench of BO.</li>
            <li> But it really is unpleasantly strong.</li>
            <li> Just a strong musky baby powder smell.</li>
            <li> Using this product allows you to feel good about what you&#x27;re rubbing directly on your lymph nodes!!</li>
            <li> My favorite and most effective natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li> When I first received the deodorant the smell kind of threw me off but after a while I got used to it.</li>
            <li> It lasts for ages, smells beautiful and actually works!</li>
            <li> Good for a normal day use.</li>
            <li> I live in Az and am on my feet a good chunk of the day.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and feels comfortable wearing.</li>
            <li> Fine, I can deal with that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and feels smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li> goes on smooth and easy.</li>
            <li> It felt smooth going on, smelled fine and did not clump.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with this product and highly recommend it to anyone looking to try a healthier deodorant.ier deodorant.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s a huge might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best so far of all natural deodorants that I have tried.</li>
            <li> It is made by Colgate-Palmolive, which PETA lists as cruelty free.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic and trust me</li>
            <li> Because what you eat is just as important as what&#x27;s going on your body.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from Dermstore because they had free shipping, so it&#x27;s just the $18.00</li>
            <li> i just wish they are available in stores</li>
            <li> I enjoy the scent of the product</li>
            <li> if it keeps me odor free for 5hours, then I use a wipe and re-apply the deo.</li>
            <li> this product worked MUCH better than most natural deodorant products... and I have tried many.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beginning to think this is primarily a winter deodorant.</li>
            <li> Prefer vanilla and lavender but wasn&#x27;t available at the time.</li>
            <li> Tried a few &amp;#34;hippie deodorants&amp;#34; and ended up liking this best.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, without irritation.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell cheap and even my boyfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with it that I just finished ordering my third one from Amazon</li>
            <li> I was all for  trying out chemical free deodorants</li>
            <li> I had cancer and trying to make sound lifestyle changes.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy running at the gym and group exercise class</li>
            <li> As far as natural type deodorants go, for me, this is the best I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> No stains thus far and works good.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> So far not so good, I smells of sweat after some hours.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping+Friendly service+FABulous deodorant &#x3D;AAA+++Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very fresh and clean, but I have to admit that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; all day...</li>
            <li> This one is very fresh and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and is a great product.</li>
            <li> The deodorant smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This keeps me smelling nice during normal day to day activity but does not help during my workouts.  </li>
            <li> Pretty sure it was an allergic reaction).</li>
            <li> and Im pretty sure that is what I am smelling..</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous natural and aluminum free deodorants, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve come across to date.</li>
            <li> I have changed my choice to the original Johnson&amp;Johnson baby powder.  </li>
            <li> I have used many natural deodorants and this is by far the best smelling, goes on very smooth and lasted all day and into the next morning before my shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saddened that I can no longer continue to use this deodorant, it was moderately effective and I now have to purchase a new deodorant- saddened.</li>
            <li> My pants were clean, check.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just recently been on a mission to find a good aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li> Smells clean and powdery, not too perfume-y.  </li>
            <li> far I love it!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a non-chemical deodorant and this is by far my favorite!  </li>
            <li> The texture is nice, and the scent is mild and pleasant, but it just doesn&#x27;t last, even for a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> and I have now had it on for a full 24 hours (reapplied once this morning)</li>
            <li> I really like it seems to better than lavanilla</li>
            <li> I used to use the regular clinical strength deodorant and this is almost as good as that.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a natural deodorant with a nice smell, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I will keep using Lavanila it off and on because it does work and smells good, but it also irritates my skin, so it&#x27;s not a solid 5 stars.</li>
            <li> this really works and feels so smooth!</li>
            <li> It rolls on smooth and I feel fresh wearing it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s true, I do.  </li>
            <li> The smell was good and it worked for only 2-3 hours, but after that it was like I hadn&#x27;t put anything on at all.</li>
            <li> I wish I could return this product because I&#x27;ve found deodorant recipes online using coconut oil and corn starch that work better for me and are much, much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be willing to try Tom&#x27;s again, but this brand was recommended by a friend and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I do apply on fresh clean underarms to start of course.  </li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and feels silky on the skin - however, I began to stink after only two hours of the initial application.</li>
            <li> Smells much better, works much better, no white residue.</li>
            <li> For cruelty free &amp;#34;mainstream&amp;#34; antiperspirant (with aluminum which is the only effective antiperspirant, these others are just deodorants)</li>
            <li> Warning: do not use sage oil if pregnant.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and didn&#x27;t have to reapply too often however big HUGE</li>
            <li> The grapefruit vanilla scent is mild.</li>
            <li> I use the LaVanilla grapefruit perfume as well and although it initially smells like vanilla/grapefruit, the strong smell itself kinda fades away quickly which is good because who wants to noticeably smell like deodorant all day?</li>
            <li> This is a way better option and after trying it once came back to order two more.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this deodorant for its effectiveness and scent and no harsh ingredients!!  </li>
            <li> So far this is the best natural deodorant I have found so far.</li>
            <li> I do not expect wonders - like no perspiration, odor free all day in hot temperatures...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe a natural deodorant actually works - I am delighted!  </li>
            <li> Maybe one of the other scents are more effective?  </li>
            <li> That is not unpleasant, but it is not what a grapefruit or vanilla smells like to me.</li>
            <li> Yes, you do have to reapply it more often, since it doesn&#x27;t have that sealant that most harmful deodorants have, and honestly, the smell actually doesn&#x27;t make me want to vomit either; especially since it wears off after a day&#x27;s application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hands down the best natural deodorant I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many natural deodorants and this is the winner!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think any natural stuff will be as good as the normal stuff, but this one does pretty good and has a better scent than the plain vanilla.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and in the day and age of hidden chemicals that is a wonderful thing.</li>
            <li> but I have realized that you have to get your pits 100% clean before putting deodorant on in the first place.</li>
            <li> Very excited to have found a natural deodorant with perscription-like strength!  </li>
            <li> I think this would be great for some, but was a little manly for me and didn&#x27;t work with my chemistry.</li>
            <li> It does an amazing job for a standard work day (desk job) even in the summer.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, the shipping was fast and everything went smooth.</li>
            <li> It lasts on me all day if it&#x27;s an easy day, but if it&#x27;s been a particularly stressful day</li>
            <li> For an deodorant that is all natural and contains no aluminum, it works OK.  </li>
            <li> Love how this is natural and works.</li>
            <li> But I wanted something more natural.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural, aluminum-free deodorant and this product came up as one of the top recommendations.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a fresh, citrus sell</li>
            <li> It smells like if someone took a powder fresh deodorant and sprinkled vanilla on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very hesitant to post my review because this seems like such a beloved brand, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> As for the wear of the deodorant, I must say that I like it more than any natural one that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I decided it would be better to reapply using a natural deodorant instead.</li>
            <li> I tried Tom&#x27;s, Nourish, Body Shop natural deodorants before but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to switch to a natural deodorant for ages and I am so glad I bought the LAVANILA</li>
            <li> I would recommend this deodorant if you&#x27;re looking for a natural alternative - works much better than others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Mmmmm.. Stay fresh all day</li>
            <li> If you can manage to reapply mid-day, then you are golden without using harmful chemicals on your body.</li>
            <li> but you know it seems worth it.</li>
            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t as good as an aluminum filled antiperspirant, but it&#x27;s the best of it&#x27;s kind (and that&#x27;s coming from someone who&#x27;s spent hundreds of dollars throwing away crap that doesn&#x27;t work).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using it just because I wanted something more natural and vegan.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> applying it leaves a white streak but unlike other sticks this disappears quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed by this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried the other LAVANILA scents and while the passion-fruit is a close second, the grapefruit works the best for me.  </li>
            <li> Application was great, smooth and dried pretty fast.</li>
            <li> it doesnt really smell like vanilla or grapefruit to me but has a clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Great light scent and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Good product that I will buy again unless I find something more long lasting.</li>
            <li> On the right day you MIGHT almost pick up the scent of grapefruit or vanilla.</li>
            <li> right ..</li>
            <li> I could smell myself right away and also started sweating within 1-2 hrs.</li>
            <li> Smells Kind Of Odd but works fine.</li>
            <li> I find that it works great and definitely better than any other natural deodorant I tried by far.  </li>
            <li> It lasts long and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> So after reading many reviews and having tried natural Deoderant before I was a bit eh about spending this much on a stick of deoderant.</li>
            <li> I bought this once before on Sephora and loved it, but found it on Amazon for a lot less $$.  </li>
            <li> I am very bummed because I really hoped I had found a aluminum free deodorant that worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a natural deodorant journey for over a year now and decided to try this one since it got such good reviews.</li>
            <li> This one smells nice and keeps body odor away even after a long day at work followed by hot yoga.</li>
            <li> The very first day I put it on, it lasted the whole day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since then, it lasts half a day.&lt;br /&gt;Its been hot here, and so during the day I need to re-apply it, and it will keep good until evening.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t completely keep you dry in summer months, but does better than most.  </li>
            <li> I attribute it&#x27;s success in large part to the scent.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this particular one, as I had read positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I apply crystal deodorant first and then use this</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this, and love the packaging, especially the roundness of the product.  </li>
            <li> First, this smells like baby powder.</li>
            <li> Shoes shined, nails polished, and I sorta even felt hot.</li>
            <li> Problem is, I was literally hot.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is if I use too much of it (more than 2 swipes) or I sweat (workout) in it I sometimes break out because my pores get clogged.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what I discovered and some recommendations for first time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty bummed</li>
            <li> One of the only healthy women&#x27;s deodorants that works for us.</li>
            <li> At the most I only have to reapply 1x in a day.</li>
            <li> It might not work for everyone or on exceptionally hot days, but I don&#x27;t like to wear aluminum based antiperspirants</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much I spend on this deodorant, but it is really worth the price.  </li>
            <li> i was skeptical about this product, but it is awesome!</li>
            <li> This one has a lovely smell - more &amp;#34;normal.&amp;#34; But it simply does not last.</li>
            <li> She reports that it really worked, and loves the scent and feel!</li>
            <li> My first order of this deodorant was in the lavender vanilla scent</li>
            <li> I think it actually works better then the Lav/van scent.</li>
            <li> I bike to work every day and it holds up pretty well.</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well.</li>
            <li> But for the price, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised to find this less-floral than expected; it&#x27;s a lovely scent and appropriate for men and women.</li>
            <li> I still do keep a stick of regular deodorant for the days when I need to keep the sweat in and avoid smelling like a man! :)</li>
            <li> I wear it at home so havent tested it in situations where I really sweat a lot, but it seems to work for me!</li>
            <li> Within hours, it never fails, I always start to smell.  </li>
            <li> (I should note that most regular antiperspirants don&#x27;t work for me either.)  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend wearing during the summer or extremely hot days.</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly EVERY product on the market that is pareben and aluminum free and nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li> I would most definitely order this product from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I put on a lot (more than I would use for regular deodorant) and while I still sweated I didn&#x27;t stink.  </li>
            <li> But, I spent some time looking up recipes for making my own deodorant because the Lavanila price was just so bothersome.  </li>
            <li> I keep one in my purse and one at home as its good to reapply a few times during the day.</li>
            <li> And most importantly, it does not irritate my skin like typical deodorants do.  </li>
            <li> Amazing deodorant - the only natural product of found that always works.</li>
            <li> The bottle is smaller than I thought it would be, but it seems to be lasting fairly well.</li>
            <li> So far my favorite has been T&#x27;eo from LUSH.</li>
            <li> I tried the pure vanilla first, but decided to branch out and try another scent.</li>
            <li> Maybe something in my chemical makeup doesn&#x27;t play nicely with this, but that doesn&#x27;t make sense either as the ingredients in all the natural deodorants are pretty similar straight across the board.</li>
            <li> I also notice it&#x27;s slightly cooling during application, which is pretty nice, in case you have to reapply at some point.</li>
            <li> But... it didn&#x27;t do anything positive for me deodorant-wise.  </li>
            <li> It has a ton of positive reviews...</li>
            <li> It handles workouts and hot summer really well.</li>
            <li> first, it worked really well.  </li>
            <li> First day of using this, it was a very hot busy day.</li>
            <li> I switched back and fourth with naturally fresh roll-on which kinda worked, but not the best still would smell, needed to be reapplied and air dried because that deodorant is wet(annoying).</li>
            <li> LaVanilla smells nice once applied but does not keep me dry the entire day and the scent fades quickly.  </li>
            <li> The regular size does not have this problem and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I would be pretty smelly by the end of a light work day, but it wasn&#x27;t necessarily a body odor smell.</li>
            <li> I love how dry I stay</li>
            <li> This product applies nicely, but lasts maybe half the day before another application is needed.  </li>
            <li> Its not as &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; as i would like however it has such a familiar texture of that nice powdered dry feeling like normal deodorants.</li>
            <li> It keeps me feeling fresh and clean and no other 100% natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> the scent was nice, but if I sweat even a little, it just smelled like perfumed sweat.</li>
            <li> After reading blogs and reviews, this one seemed pretty highly recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying so hard to find a natural deodorant, and this one came up with all these great reviews, so I thought it would be a hit...</li>
            <li> After doing much research on a deodorant that won&#x27;t stain light clothes and work properly - I found this one and decided to try it - even with the hefty price tag.  </li>
            <li> Another huge plus is that this deodorant will last you a while.</li>
            <li> Smells really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stinked, really.</li>
            <li> though - sort of a flowery vanilla with just a tiny hint of citrus) and went on really smooth.</li>
            <li> and it really works.  </li>
            <li> they are very</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really smell like vanilla OR grapefruit, though...</li>
            <li> , I expected much better.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t smell anything 5 minutes after you apply it anyhow</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> I am a very sweaty Pearson and I have never had a stick that has done the job</li>
            <li> It works really well for me</li>
            <li> EWG database gives it a toxicity rating of 4, mostly for the unknown fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really like the smell</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 star because I really like the smell</li>
            <li> and it really kept me from sweating</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very musky baby powder smell to me with a hint of vanilla.</li>
            <li> Have seen this in Whole Foods and know I can purchase from there as well.  </li>
            <li> If anything, it smells very powdery to me .  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every natural deodorant on the market without success.  </li>
            <li> He couldn&#x27;t stand me wasting it after how much it cost me.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s getting ready to throw away her lotion and purchase from them as well.  </li>
            <li> I tried FIVE others (Crystal, Toms, Alba, Jason, and Lavilin) and absolutely none of them worked.</li>
            <li> so I need something that really works.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> works very well.</li>
            <li> I had been using Toms of Maine as a natural deodorant and it was not cutting it.</li>
            <li> I found that for me, a light sweater, with moderate body odor, it DOES work, but will not hold up when stressed or when I have to do a lot of walking/excessive movement.  </li>
            <li> If you are changing from a modern deodorant/antiperspirant don&#x27;t expect immediate results.</li>
            <li> And I wore it during a busy day where I was sweating most of the day and did not notice any odor at the end of the day, with only one application in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed through trial and error that the baby powder scents of most traditional antiperspirants/deodorants don&#x27;t mix well with my body&#x27;s natural odor</li>
            <li> I made my own and used it for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> They should tell you you are going to smell like an old man&#x27;s after shave!!!</li>
            <li> and I have decided I am willing to pay more for products with less chemicals.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little strong but disapates quickly.  </li>
            <li> I decided to take the plunge into natural deodorants - my body will thank me, right?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because it applies so nicely, and is all natural, I will try the other scents.  </li>
            <li> It holds for most of the day; if you have a more physical job or are out in the sun for long periods, you may need a second application.  </li>
            <li> I do high intensity training and it holds up well and for an organic, crap free product its superb!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; as well as antiperspirants, but it does work better than any other deodorant I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m swearing off harmful normal deodorant brands for life after this!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;organic\\&quot; deodorants, and this is this first that has actually worked for me.</li>
            <li> The scent of this one is okay, but there are other options</li>
            <li> I would use this one over most other non-vegan deodorants.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well with the deodorant, much better at controlling the sweaty factor than Shower to Shower.</li>
            <li> This is our new favorite natural deodorant because it actually works! ..</li>
            <li> (the only thing that works), or live with the stink (no one liked that option, especially me).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was looking for an all natural deodorant for a long time and sooooo many of them do not work.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin but never have I had such a strong adverse reaction to a product.</li>
            <li> the fragrance is strong at first but tones down a lot.</li>
            <li> First all natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t give me a rash.</li>
            <li> As far as deodorants goes, this is has been my favorite (out of maybe 6 different natural ones I tried).</li>
            <li> This is the first natural deodorant that I have ever used that worked.  </li>
            <li> so I just suck it up and make sure I don&#x27;t get too close to the other people in my class!</li>
            <li> This one makes you feel a little more like you&#x27;re &amp;#34;pampering&amp;#34; your armpits I guess haha.</li>
            <li> As a previous reviewer stated instead of smelling like Vanilla Grapefruit, it smells more like baby powder.</li>
            <li> decent.  </li>
            <li> I NEVER buy anything suggested out of a magazine but this particular article was something I could relate too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw this product had a glowing review in Lucky magazine last month.</li>
            <li> Works decent.</li>
            <li> but I find when I have a quick break out sweat from running after a dog or something simple</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re looking for strong coverage for harder days, you won&#x27;t it here.</li>
            <li> Only on the very hot days do I have to reapply.</li>
            <li> The first couple of days were tricky because I was so conscious of the fact that I was wearing a new deodorant.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this deodorant because of the reviews and the price.  </li>
            <li> Not a complete odor-blocker, but very soft smooth and not sticky.</li>
            <li> I am a Lavanilla freak, so I had high hopes for the deodorant.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Again, it&#x27;s not the sharp repulsive smell of BO, but a softer more natural sweat scent.</li>
            <li> many other &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants do not.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m pretty stoked on finding this natural deodorant!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this deodorant would be the ticket, but it only lasts a few hours for me, half a day at best.</li>
            <li> Smell seemed a bit strong at first but once applied, it was not strong at all.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I am very self conscious about body odor.</li>
            <li> It is definitely working better than my old traditional, chemical-y, store-bought stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have looked for &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants that actually work for a long time and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Most of our bodies are so used to using harsh chemicals to stop sweat or prevent BO.</li>
            <li> The only issue I had was towards the end of the day I had to reapply, it didn&#x27;t keep me fresh all day.</li>
            <li> I bought it at my local Whole Foods store without smelling it first.</li>
            <li> Avoid if you actually like wearing deodorant that keeps you smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent of this deodorant and it has worked well at maintaining the scent even through heavy gym workouts.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a natural deodorant that actually works for more than 2 hours, especially if you are in the heat or exercising.  </li>
            <li> Its fragrance is pleasant but very subtle and does not clash with cologne.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I would like to test their other scent options, but this is fine.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, but you definitely don&#x27;t stay dry, which is the case with all non-antiperspirent because your pores aren&#x27;t being blocked and allowed to breath.  </li>
            <li> this only hides the smell with a really strong fragrance, but doesn&#x27;t actually eliminate it for me.</li>
            <li> all other natural deodorants just make me smell 10x worse except for this brand and those crystal salt water sprays that are also awesome but don&#x27;t smell like anything.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty decent deodorant for not having some key ingredients.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d rely on it while going to my senior prom, wedding or some other ultra important event as I wouldn&#x27;t want to take any chances on it failing to work.  </li>
            <li> This only works for about two hours for me, during light, normal daily activity.  </li>
            <li> That being said I live in AZ and have to re-apply all deoderants.</li>
            <li> have used it 5 days now, and have exercised my heart out (in 70+ degree weather, yes I live in CA)</li>
            <li> I live in 95 degree weather</li>
            <li> It took about two weeks from my new deodorant to work.</li>
            <li> Not very effective, better than some department store brands.</li>
            <li> have also tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorant, which I can pick up at the local WM, for much cheaper, and the unscented has a toxicity rating of 1, but it seems to irritate my skin more than this, though not as much as typical</li>
            <li> there were no other seats on the bus, so he stood up the whole ride home.</li>
            <li> Too Perfect.u there were no other seats on the bus, so he stood up the whole ride home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve very sensitive to smells, that&#x27;s one of the reason I wanted to try this.</li>
            <li> The smell of the deodorant itself is kind of strong, but not quite unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s hot outside</li>
            <li> I prefer handmade ones off Etsy, they last much longer!</li>
            <li> I have fewer odor problems since switching to natural deodorant!</li>
            <li> I will say that it took a couple of weeks for my body to adjust to not having the regular clinical strength deodorant - so stick with it (just reapply during those first two weeks).</li>
            <li> Others have left me smelling like B.O. within hours, this one lasts all day, even during the hot and sweaty summer months.</li>
            <li> I started with the Grapefruit scent and was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> The result is a deodorant with no harsh chemicals (aluminum) and no sweaty underarms - hooray!</li>
            <li> Lavanila only needs one application to make it through a hot and humid day in the nation&#x27;s Capitol swamp, DC.</li>
            <li> When I have a spike in activity or it is too hot outside</li>
            <li> It is not a fresh light</li>
            <li> That being said the coverage and easy application far out weigh the slight smell issue.</li>
            <li> It goes on cool and wet feeling but dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you with a wet pit feeling.</li>
            <li> Because of the price - I only wear with my light colored clothes to prevent staining so it has lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The vanilla grapefruit scent is light and citrusy and smells less like lemon pledge than the vanilla lemon scent.</li>
            <li> I went for a hike with my kids today and also worked in my yard a little bit, and it has stood up to those tests just fine.  </li>
            <li> So most natural deodorants don&#x27;t do the trick, especially in a small room full of people.</li>
            <li> It goes on dry, feels just like the nasty aluminum filled variety (yuck!), but keeps you smelling great!</li>
            <li> Pretty big waste of money in my opinion, which is really unfortunate since I purchased it after it topped a list of best natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> It has a significant scent that fades over the course of 1.5 to 2 hours, but is slightly there at 5 hours.  </li>
            <li> The one star less is because the fragrance that is less citrusy and more like a crisp laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> It has more of a powdery smell, which while it isn&#x27;t bad, is not the smell that I was looking for and it clashes with my more fruity perfumes.</li>
            <li> i am very picky on what i use anymore and want to stay as natural as possible.</li>
            <li> You do have to maintain proper hygiene for it to work (shower every day and reapply the deodorant halfway through your day on CLEAN, DRY armpits).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear and non-sticky however.</li>
            <li> This does not work anywhere near as well as antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> Everyone wants him to sit next to them.</li>
            <li> I guess I really must have smelled for him to have made the decision to stand up instead of sitting next to my stinky self.</li>
            <li> I guess I really must have smelled for him to have made the decision to stand up instead of sitting next to my stinky self.</li>
            <li> Looking for a natural deodorant that works all day.</li>
            <li> I splurged and bought this natural &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; deodorant.</li>
            <li> WOW.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a natural sweat smell-</li>
            <li> I bought this because it has all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> Still, I&#x27;ve tried ALOT of natural deodorants lately and so far, this one seems to be holding up better than the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did this for a while until I decided to try Jason purifying tea tree deodorant so far</li>
            <li> I was surprised when after a week of using Lavanila a rash developed.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a natural deodorant</li>
            <li> SO FAR.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Lush&#x27;s Teo</li>
            <li> As far as I have seen, no residue wears off on clothes.</li>
            <li> I keep the smaller size in my backpack in case I need to reapply again during the day (which is very rare).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really seems to last all day.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, I went with this brand because it completely eliminates aluminum from the ingredient list, something</li>
            <li> Only downside with the grapefruit scent, it smells very musky like a mens deodorant.</li>
            <li> I developed a rash under both of my arms.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t smell, but now that I am breastfeeding I want something natural.</li>
            <li> and i am really sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> I smell nothing near a fruity smell.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t bother me too much, but now my under arms are very red and itchy, so that is why I will stop using this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Drug store brand deodorants far surpassed the quality of this product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I wanted an all natural deodarant...</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant works well for a natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> The search for a natural deodorant THAT WORKS continues.</li>
            <li> but I am conscious of my sweating.</li>
            <li> whether or not they want to go natural.</li>
            <li> The smells compete and it almost smells like an old lady rub.  </li>
            <li> You really have to rub it all around for it to last.</li>
            <li> but this one is much easier to apply especially when you&#x27;re in a hurry in the morning.</li>
            <li> A lot of people try natural deodorants with natural soap.</li>
            <li> They both last all day and are much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I changed from drug store deodorants to natural this summer.</li>
            <li> BUT since then I have no  problems with smelling BO&#x27;ish with natural deodorants and some talc powder (shower to shower).</li>
            <li> I like knowing I am not putting aluminum zirconium under my pits near my mammary glands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an all natural deodorant that lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling like B.O.</li>
            <li> I found a different natural deodorant that I absolutely love (Green Tidings).</li>
            <li> I have to reapply it on some days, especially when I&#x27;m going to be doing anything involving sweating, but that&#x27;s still a lot better than all the 20 or so different other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about Tom&#x27;s, even though I liked the price of Tom&#x27;s over the Healthy of course, but it didn&#x27;t have that powdery-smooth feeling like other deodorants</li>
            <li> Sadly, I don&#x27;t like this &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; deodorant any better than any of the other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried - either for light daily use or for more active pursuits.</li>
            <li> After doing lots of online research mainly based on reviews and recommendations from people who have actually tried the product, I decided to try the Lavanila line.</li>
            <li> I have tried other natural deodorants and did not like them, this is the first natural one that I like.</li>
            <li> If I sweat profusely, I definitely start to smell a little bit like BO mixed with the scent of the deodorant, but its better than if I was not using any deodorant at all.</li>
            <li> This works ok if you aren&#x27;t particularly active, but does not mask odor or wetness if you are even moderately active.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked a single grapefruit scented item I&#x27;ve ever gotten, but thought maybe the vanilla would balance it nicely.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, I had remembered to comb my hair and put on lipstick before leaving work, because I know he usually rides my bus on Tuesdays</li>
            <li> I also love the LAVANILA fragrances, which are actually surprisingly complex for only containing natural oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been attempting different ones over the years because of all the health issues ingredients in normal deodorants can cause.</li>
            <li> Once my skin was back to normal</li>
            <li> Not only does this smell amazing, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin like almost every other deodorant or make me smell bad like most natural deodorants!</li>
            <li> I actually smell pretty good at the end of the day, but a little less so the next morning which is expected.  </li>
            <li> A girlfriend recommended it and said that she has been using it for a very long time, but again, it didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I needed something better, since I had this icky discolored skin - and I actually found out about this on Sephora, but decided to buy it on Amazon, since it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The odor is not like most natural deodorants I usually hate the smell of natural deodorants and this one is very very mild.</li>
            <li> For the first week or so after switching from my old deodorant I had to reapply half way through the day else</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever tried a deodorant that I&#x27;ve liked less.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times, and will probably get rid of it, maybe the other LAVANILA scents are better?</li>
            <li> A little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> A little pricey in my opinion but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of them, with little success until now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really heavy and musky - but it certainly wasn&#x27;t something I couldn&#x27;t live with.</li>
            <li> Only natural deoderant that has worked for me</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant without baking soda (which irritates me) that worked for me.  </li>
            <li> (he needs to get home early to coach urban basketball...</li>
            <li> A natural deodorant that I may come back to.</li>
            <li> Finally I found a natural deod.</li>
            <li> The only natural antiperspirant I found that works for me is sage oil (recipe below).</li>
            <li> natural deordorants for a while and scoured the reviews before chosing Lavanila as one of 6 naturals I bought with my last Amazon order.</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant that works for me.</li>
            <li> such a natural product, its great.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant I have found that works as well as it does.  </li>
            <li> I have been using natural deoderant for years now and have used several options...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the normal wet feeling natural deodorant that you may be used to it.  </li>
            <li> Within a few minutes I am sweating (and not so fresh).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t seem effective at all.  </li>
            <li> It makes my underarms smell good at first, but once it wears off, I am left with worse-smelling armpits :(</li>
            <li> Of course, like any white colored deodorant, if you are going to put on a black top, you have to be careful, but that is universal.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m a little more active one day or its simply hotter</li>
            <li> How many times have you tried a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; deodorant for whatever reason, and found it to be seriously lacking effectiveness?!</li>
            <li> Works fine for everyday wear, but not really up to the task of deodorizing during a workout.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and feminine, baby-powderish - calling it grapefruit is inaccurate - it doesn&#x27;t smell like grapefruit at all, which is my only complaint.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, but it doesn&#x27;t meet my active lifestyle needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it one more shot before going back to Secret Clinical</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other natural deodorants that did not work near as well as this one.</li>
            <li> It will make your clothes white if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> Meaning: If you use &amp;#34;natural soap&amp;#34; or not strong enough soap and are not getting your pits clean enough - NO natural deodorant is going to cover up that</li>
            <li> The pretty packaging is always a plus, the pleasant smell, and with the nasty rash gone now, I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this as my go-to natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it works wonderfully, but it&#x27;s just not worth the price yet, at least for me.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I&#x27;m not satisfied with the grapefruit-vanilla scent, but that is just because of my own scent taste/preference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve been through at least a dozen other brands!!</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for real life.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like some other natural deodorants.  </li>
            <li> Lavanila is silky smooth, has almost no fragrance when dry, leaves no residue, and works for at least 2 days in the heat!</li>
            <li> I purchase this deoderant because I&#x27;m a Celiac and am very sensitive to both topical gluten (which several deoderants have) and to harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> When I first made the choice to try an organic deodorant, I was super skeptical at how it would go down.</li>
            <li> I had to stop using it and give it a few days to calm down the irritation caused by it.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t realize that rain does not mean the weather is cold; usually it just means the weather is warm enough for it to rain here.</li>
            <li> While the deodorant works and applies less cake-like than other solid deodorants, the scent is very powerful and strong but unpleasant and smells neither like grapefruit or vanilla or any combination thereof.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an odd scent.. kind of musty in a weird way.  </li>
            <li> Generally, I have found that it works extremely well throughout the day, especially if there is not a lot of sweating going on.  </li>
            <li> On me, this only lasts about 4 hours, which is how long my work day is.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s circular, not oval-shaped like most - I find this to be annoying, especially with Tom&#x27;s, because it would run so fast, that the plastic edges would rub against my skin.</li>
            <li> Each time I lifted up my arm, the odor damn near knocked me down.</li>
            <li> This is a lot less messy than some all natural products because it goes on like normal deodorant.</li>
            <li> I get the mix of the musky smell and sweat smell (not good), but it helps if I apply right before working out.  </li>
            <li> This did not last very long.</li>
            <li> Wow, this deodorant was a HUGE disappointment.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work because I want to use a natural deodorant, but there must be something in the ingredients that is irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> It does however turn your clothes white no matter if it&#x27;s dry or not.</li>
            <li> This product definitely works and keeps me dry and smelling goo.</li>
            <li> I wanted to switch to a natural deodorant without anti-perspirant to try and clear up some rough, dry skin patches on my underarms that I&#x27;ve had trouble getting rid of.</li>
            <li> This really works and smells good, but it gives me a terrible rash after a day or two.</li>
            <li> Harsh chemicals and long lasting, or totally natural</li>
            <li> I normally go back to smelling like plain old body order by noon each day while using this.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to review it when I wore 2 other brands (soapwalla and Primal Pit Paste) without any such issue.</li>
            <li> I was always wary of the ingredients in regular deodorant and finally started using this when I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li> Somehow took my natural odor and morphed it into the smell of raw onions after several hours of wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been smelling myself today, and it&#x27;s a rather chilly day in Georgia, and I haven&#x27;t done anything more strenuous than walking around a doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I have never used a natural deodorant before but since getting into using essential oils over the past year</li>
            <li> Would still tell someone to give it a try because you never really know as every body is different.</li>
            <li> which won&#x27;t be for a long while.</li>
            <li> I am a bit sensitive to smells, and for me this one is borderline as to whether or not I enjoy the smell.  </li>
            <li> Now it is far from being heavy duty, if it&#x27;s been a long sweaty day, I might experience a touch of order, but that also seems to tie in to if I&#x27;ve eaten well or not.</li>
            <li> The only down side is I have to reapply several times throughout the day because the smell starts to deteriorate.</li>
            <li> and I get a rash from ingredients from other solid types.  </li>
            <li> I never actually cut the deodorant and have BO (which would happen with traditional deodorants), but I will start to sometimes smell a little funky under my arms by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> The only other downfall is the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the smell is very strange.</li>
            <li> so I kept dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It won&#x27;t keep you dry or avoid smells</li>
            <li> Of course you&#x27;ll still sweat, however the scent does last a few hours without you smelling like a total hoagie</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune on natural deodorants, only to be disappointed time and time again when they aren&#x27;t effective at masking odor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Tom&#x27;s for about a year now, but I&#x27;ve never loved it because the texture is really funky and goops up immediately.</li>
            <li> And it leaves white residue on dark clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s probably true that it might last if reapplied, but that&#x27;s inconvenient.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not a particularly sweaty person.</li>
            <li> Not only does it control odor, it also made me sweat less.</li>
            <li> I had to switch back to my previous deodorant (Tom&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li> Around midday, it would start wearing off, and I don&#x27;t usually need heavy strength or anything unusual.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving it a two star and nothing less is because my husband used it and said it was &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t finish the whole thing, was not happy with this product for long term use.</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first this works for me, I have to use regular and in between showers.</li>
            <li> My husband ended up throwing the last bit away because it kept breaking out of the container and made a mess.</li>
            <li> This is very expensive and I expected more based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> It is hard to stand up when the rickety old bus is traveling at 50 miles over the Bay Bridge.</li>
            <li> It is hard to stand up when the rickety old bus is traveling at 50 miles over the Bay Bridge.</li>
            <li> When you first do the switch to any natural deodorant you will sweat and if you&#x27;re like me probably a lot, but that unpleasant side effect diminishes over time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last me as I put quite a bit on when applying.</li>
            <li> It last a long time although I do usually reapply in the afternoon if I think about it</li>
            <li> I like the smell of the pink</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t last all day for me, but it does seems to work for a few hours before needing to reapply.  </li>
            <li> They are one of the few VEGAN deodorants that can actually last all day even in heat, and yet have some of the safest ingredients.</li>
            <li> i spent the 20 some dollars on this deodorant.</li>
            <li> You will get wet under your arms.</li>
            <li> then I will need to do a few extra swipes towards the end of the day.</li>
            <li> If you are a heavy sweater, you may have to re-apply again before you go to the gym etc., but is that really a big deal?  </li>
            <li> Nothing like I expected.</li>
            <li> There is nothing grapefruit-y or remotely citrusy about it.  </li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t spent $15 on this.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Even if I reapplied the same day after a few hours, it didn&#x27;t carry on.</li>
            <li> It claims not to have any harsh chemicals, but it was too harsh for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> few drops other essential oil of choosing (lavender, lemon, tea tree.....</li>
            <li> I think there is a connection between the fact that women shave their underarms and then apply deodorant containing aluminum and other harmful chemicals to the alarming rate of women who develop breast cancer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I can definitely recommend the product, but don&#x27;t buy this fragrance if you do not enjoy the typical &amp;#34;powder fresh&amp;#34; type of scents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a highly stinky person, and smelled half way through the day.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the scent, which also helps to mask any unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li> The very first day I used this, I broke out in a really painful red rash under both arms.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this after 3 weeks of fighting BO while breast feeding and using other brands of herbal deodorant.</li>
            <li> Cannot wait to try the other scents.</li>
            <li> Other than that, two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for any of the other scents.</li>
            <li> It was for my daughter who is allergic to other deodorants.  </li>
            <li> i cant wait to try other scents too</li>
            <li> For the past 1-2 weeks I&#x27;ve only been applying it after my shower at night and reapplying in the morning before work.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, it smells like baby powder.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried any other scents but if I was to repurchase it would probably be one without fragrance.</li>
            <li> This was one of the first I had tried, and I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try other scents.</li>
            <li> I usually use cheap random deodorants because my issues with smelling are minimal and I usually have no issues staying dry.</li>
            <li> This is a little expensive, but worth the money.</li>
            <li> I smell fine for the rest of the day unless I do a very tough workout late in the day.</li>
            <li> And it is very wet going on, which I don&#x27;t like at all.</li>
            <li> It works all day if I am just at my desk at work, and it works about 4 hours if active.  </li>
            <li> This may sound a little tedious to some, but they make a small travel size that I keep in my handbag/car/desk for touch up.</li>
            <li> More efficient than the nasty chemical stuff but gentle and natural, and the faint fragrance is gender-neutral.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant though, because I couldn&#x27;t find in any of the descriptions online if this product was a liquid roll on, or a solid stick-type deodorant (which usually gives me a rash.)</li>
            <li> The only decent natural deodorant I have found is from Soapwalla but even that has issues for me because sometimes it stings horribly and turns my underarms red.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this because its free of aluminum and all the bad crap</li>
            <li> Not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> not fun.</li>
            <li> I keep an extra in my purse because you do need to reapply throughout the day depending on your level of activity (at least I do).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect and one application doesn&#x27;t always last for 24 hours, but it&#x27;s natural and not pumped with heavy metals.  </li>
            <li> I wear a lot of black and dark colors and you have to be careful when putting them on, but the stains come out with a little water immediately.</li>
            <li> I try to stick with as natural as possible products, but deodorant with antiperspirant is something I&#x27;ve always stuck with until about a year ago, as I&#x27;ve developed a painful skin condition in my armpits that makes wearing drugstore brands very painful and causes more issues.</li>
            <li> I tried it for three days - and I did&#x27;t even go to the gym or do anything other than go to work!</li>
            <li> Some worked &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; than others, but there was still a stink after ANY, and I do mean ANY physical activity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an alternative to deodorants with aluminum and other harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I tried wearing it for a day, and after a few hours, I had noticeable odor (which has been my problem with other brands).  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few other organic products and they were sub-par.  </li>
            <li> , I have to reapply half way through the day.</li>
            <li> This deodorant keeps smell at bay all day on a typical day.</li>
            <li> Throughout my teens I used typical drugstore chemically deodorants and have always had itchy, irritated reactions, but needed to use it</li>
            <li> Before I started using Lavanila, I used a typical drugstore antiperspirant and I had no issues with rashes -</li>
            <li> I was sweating much less than before</li>
            <li> Making the switch from the typical deodorants you find in the grocery store.</li>
            <li> but it holds for like half a day it needs to re-applied.</li>
            <li> My one slight downside for the product is its price, I go through about one tube every 2 months.</li>
            <li> This came up as highly recommended, but unfortunately it did not do the trick.</li>
            <li> I had almost given up on deodorant all together because I refused to use the chemical stuff, but all the natural ones with baking soda gave me horrible rashes, but this one is gentle and I actually see an improvement in the quality of my armpit skin.</li>
            <li> Overall, Lavanila works decently well and doesn&#x27;t cause any bad reactions for me.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but long lasting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but looks like it will last a long time</li>
            <li> The picture is a little misleading.</li>
            <li> , You May Smell (but just a little)....</li>
            <li> or so I notice a little odor start to develop.</li>
            <li> I still do get a little damp throughout the day and sometimes need to reapply.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little musky, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> And like I mentioned before, you may even start to smell a little towards the end of your day after wearing it for a few hours.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job of keeping me smelling fresh, it wouldn&#x27;t be as bad as it would be during a sunny day in August.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this deodorant a few years.  </li>
            <li> probably won&#x27;t work after a heavy workout but for everyday use it does the job.</li>
            <li> If you do everyday activities it doesn&#x27;t prevent odor.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I read an article in a magazine specifically about this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use harsh chemicals on my skin</li>
            <li> and it does have the faintest of faint grapefruit odor, plus it is a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I kept using it for a week to see if it would go away, and it only got worse.</li>
            <li> It seems to smell like baby powder only worse, somehow.</li>
            <li> But you do need to reapply because after a few hours, the product stops working.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> but it does the job for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this so as not to waste it seeing how I paid $18</li>
            <li> Does nothing for odor and leaves behind white marks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is just residual from the use of the homemade deodorant or if the Lavanila contains something that my skin is having trouble with.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work well for me after a few hours</li>
            <li> worked for a few hours but that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li> However, for events or when I am working out, it sadly won&#x27;t cut it, and I will have to keep looking for the holy grail of natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> None of the usual coffee dribble down my sweater, check.</li>
            <li> (not sure how it&#x27;s &amp;#34;vanilla&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;grapefruit,&amp;#34; much less a combo of both),</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly making it work hard.</li>
            <li> At least it doesn&#x27;t clash with other fragrances you may be wearing.</li>
            <li> I prefer the scent of this one over the plain vanilla one.</li>
            <li> The smell is very very strong and underneath the grapefruit and the hint of vanilla is that awful baby-power musk.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to get off the bad for you anti perspirant to only smell and sweat on natural deodorant anyhow...</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is an ingredient in the deodorant or the fragrance that is causing the irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure where he comes from or who put him on this planet, but basically, he&#x27;s considered a demi-god by the women (and some of the men) on my bus.</li>
            <li> however I&#x27;m not totally in love with the combination</li>
            <li> Just terrible, better to just go without deodorant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really expensive, so that&#x27;s why I only gave it four stars...</li>
            <li> I wonder if the aluminum gets into the bloodstream and lymph nodes via the small nicks and cuts that remain after shaving?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind because I usually reapply once or twice a day anyway.</li>
            <li> but I can deal with that vs some of the others that fail by mid day.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s because the smell is stronger</li>
            <li> however, it broke me out in a red angry rash:</li>
            <li> At first it seemed to work like a charm, however after the second week the deodorant scent along with my body oils began to create a terrible smell.</li>
            <li> I bought the Grapefruit scent because it was on sale, but I usually get the Lemon...</li>
            <li> Not sure how well it works.</li>
            <li> The only negative I have with LAVANILA is that it&#x27;s expensive.  </li>
            <li> All I know is, the only stuff not causing a serious reaction is regular full-of-yucky-stuff deodorant :(</li>
            <li> Unless you are a very heavy sweater or are out running and exercising hard, this does the trick.</li>
            <li> Antiperspirants are virtually impossible in natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> Finding a non-toxic deodorant that doesn&#x27;t suck is hard.</li>
            <li> If I touch up in the late afternoon, it helps tons.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> if I need to reapply at least I&#x27;m not walking around with a brick.</li>
            <li> After 4-5 hours I have to reapply (not handy when I am at work!).&lt;br /&gt;Keeping</li>
            <li> This is really not my kind of deodorant.  </li>
            <li> wetness\\&quot; um DUH...</li>
            <li> But there are other times in which it completely fails.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to change to a green deodorant, but after 2 weeks of using this in the summer, I stunk so bad I had to go back to using Secret clinical.</li>
            <li> , so I get a couple of wistfull glances from grandmothers, it&#x27;s a very small stick.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s come down in price since I bought it ($14 vs. $18), but it&#x27;s still too expensive.  </li>
            <li> I was searching for a healthier alternative to traditional deodorants and anti perspirants, however, I still didn&#x27;t want to smell bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I get red sploches as well as painful chafing.  </li>
            <li> But when you&#x27;ve found something to control the odor, it&#x27;s hard to put a price on that!</li>
            <li> Not a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> I think it is because the deodorant is too small for the bottle, so it dries out and is difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but a product has never made me break out this painfully!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product left me with a painful, itchy rash.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even last a few hours on me, and I smell horrible after wearing this overnight.</li>
            <li> I used to reapply my Secret deodorant/antiperspirant twice a day.</li>
            <li> and they always make me smell worse.  </li>
            <li> but I am not happy about it.</li>
            <li> I will have to continue my search alas.</li>
            <li> but I have never had worse b.o.</li>
            <li> but it shouldn&#x27;t cause a person to smell worse, should it?</li>
            <li> It even took my Secret clinical about a week to get rid of my stench after using this...</li>
            <li> However, within a few hours I already had an unpleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not as good as the standard deodorants with those nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to be working so far, but be warned: it smells terrible.</li>
            <li> Waste of money :(</li>
            <li> Sadly, I think that&#x27;s the truth of all deodorants that aren&#x27;t laden with chemicals.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> That way, if I were to start to sweat and the deodorant failed to do</li>
            <li> So needless to say I sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> I threw it away, because it doesn&#x27;t work and stinks worse than bo.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> do (that unfortunately made my underarms break out after I shaved.</li>
            <li> , yes it&#x27;s expensive, but if going natural/</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my skin started reacting to the homemade deodorant (which contains baking soda).  </li>
            <li> Regular anti-persperant stains my clothes and leaves them smelling disgusting, even as I&#x27;m wearing them.</li>
            <li> I like the creamy texture and the smell but is too expensive and is not working for me.</li>
            <li> With Lavanilla, I&#x27;m not impressed at all -</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work to control order but the worst part was I developed a horrible red painful rash.</li>
            <li> I also like that it doesn&#x27;t leave nasty stains on clothes like aluminum-based products do, and it doesn&#x27;t smell nasty like cheap drugstore deodorants.</li>
            <li> Stinks.</li>
            <li> For $14.00 (which is crazy to pay for deodorant, but I didn&#x27;t mind because of the lack of harmful chemicals)</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t keep ME from smelling horrible after a few hours.</li>
            <li> geodeo, and have always be unhappy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but it works!</li>
            <li> We ran out and she tried another brand and was shocked at how lousy the competition is!</li>
            <li> Being pitted out 5-6 hours into my shift is making it impossible for me to do though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to hop into the shower as the b.o. is just too bad.</li>
            <li> I have bad perfume allergies</li>
            <li> But, when I get home, I already smell bad.</li>
            <li> Really bad.</li>
            <li> I was s disappointed when Sephora stopped carrying this brand.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but this really disappointed me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Tom&#x27;s brand before and, to me, the scent they used ended up smelling like BO :(</li>
            <li> Stinks!  </li>
            <li> I got my wife to throw away her aerosol crap and use this.  </li>
            <li> I hate the way this smells.  </li>
            <li> but it smells awful and does not work.  </li>
            <li> This smells awful!</li>
            <li> I used Tom&#x27;s and Soapwalla&#x27;s before and got a horrible rash with both.</li>
            <li> I thought the smell was horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really love this deodrant it does its job and the grapefruit is wonderful, I have used prescription deodrant for years and I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Only natural deoderant that has worked for me</li>
            <li> First all natural deodorant that doesn&#x27;t give me a rash. I had almost given up on deodorant all together because I refused to use the chemical stuff, but all the natural ones with baking soda gave me horrible rashes, but this one is gentle and I actually see an improvement in the quality of my armpit skin. Now it is far from being heavy duty, if it&#x27;s been a long sweaty day, I might experience a touch of order, but that also seems to tie in to if I&#x27;ve eaten well or not. I&#x27;m also not a fan of the vanilla smell, but it isn&#x27;t strong so I don&#x27;t mind. Overall, I adore this product and will repurchase,</li>
            <li> Smells lovely, and works well.</li>
            <li> I was s disappointed when Sephora stopped carrying this brand. It smells good. It also does not have any antiperspirant which I am allergic to. Of course, like any white colored deodorant, if you are going to put on a black top, you have to be careful, but that is universal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this deodorant a few years.  I cannot wear regular antiperspirant.  Something in the ingredients causes me to get lumps in my armpits and I get a rash from ingredients from other solid types.  This does not work anywhere near as well as antiperspirant.  I apply crystal deodorant first and then use this and that does the trick for me.  I love the scent of this deodorant and it has never caused a rash for me.  As far as natural type deodorants go, for me, this is the best I&#x27;ve found.  But, if you can use regular deodorant and antiperspirant, I don&#x27;t know why you would use this.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty decent deodorant for not having some key ingredients. I sit in an air conditioned office all day, so I&#x27;m not exactly making it work hard. It lasts on me all day if it&#x27;s an easy day, but if it&#x27;s been a particularly stressful day or it&#x27;s hot outside, I have to reapply half way through the day. I don&#x27;t know why everyone is raving about the smell. It definitely does not smell of either vanilla or grapefruit, unless you are close to the stick and sniffing out those scents exclusively. It has more of a powdery smell, which while it isn&#x27;t bad, is not the smell that I was looking for and it clashes with my more fruity perfumes. The picture is a little misleading. The bottle is smaller than I thought it would be, but it seems to be lasting fairly well. I&#x27;ll update this again when I&#x27;ve used it all. Also, I took a picture of the ingredients because I couldn&#x27;t find it in the product description. It only said what it didn&#x27;t contain and not what it does. To be honest, I almost didn&#x27;t buy it because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final review it that I would buy it again, but maybe try a different scent. However, if you&#x27;re looking for strong coverage for harder days, you won&#x27;t it here. Sadly, I think that&#x27;s the truth of all deodorants that aren&#x27;t laden with chemicals.</li>
            <li> decent.  nothing great.  smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> Great product! For the first week or so after switching from my old deodorant I had to reapply half way through the day else the dreaded stink would come. However after that my body adjusted and now just applying once in the morning is enough to get me through the day (unless I go jogging or it is a sweltering day).</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this, and love the packaging, especially the roundness of the product.  But... it didn&#x27;t do anything positive for me deodorant-wise.  An hour or two later I would have smelled better wearing nothing.</li>
            <li> After doing much research on a deodorant that won&#x27;t stain light clothes and work properly - I found this one and decided to try it - even with the hefty price tag.  I love it.  No stains thus far and works good.  Goes on easily and feels comfortable wearing. I used in Mexico heat and it seemed to work as well as my regular deodorant.  Because of the price - I only wear with my light colored clothes to prevent staining so it has lasted a long time.  I have not vigorously worked out in this so cannot comment on that.  I like the smell of the pink grapefruit.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended to friends and they have also liked it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work to control order but the worst part was I developed a horrible red painful rash. My dad started using the same deodorant and had the same reaction. Not sure if it is an ingredient in the deodorant or the fragrance that is causing the irritation.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have gotten the lemon scent instead.  I&#x27;ve never liked a single grapefruit scented item I&#x27;ve ever gotten, but thought maybe the vanilla would balance it nicely.  Some reviews really liked the scent, so I thought I&#x27;d try it out.  It&#x27;s an odd scent.. kind of musty in a weird way.  Not a pleasant scent.  I have the lavender scent and like it much better, but wanted something more &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; smelling - this is not.  At all.</li>
            <li> This is great. Smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;It probably won&#x27;t work after a heavy workout but for everyday use it does the job. I have tried other natural deodorants and did not like them, this is the first natural one that I like.</li>
            <li> For an deodorant that is all natural and contains no aluminum, it works OK.  Won&#x27;t last all day for me, but it does seems to work for a few hours before needing to reapply.  Definitely not as good as the standard deodorants with those nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> Need to reapply throughout the day...no bueno...i don&#x27;t stink but carry it with me in my purse and reapply so i dont sweat. Does not meet my sweaty needs fully. Try a french deodarant instead. Smells pleasant ..slightly lavender and a hint of grapefruit.  2 Oz not 1.7 as on site..better for me.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and feels silky on the skin - however, I began to stink after only two hours of the initial application. I could understand if I had been at the gym, walking for several blocks, etc., but I was just sitting at my desk at work. I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll use this product when I&#x27;m not likely to be around people or perhaps after my pre-bedtime shower.</li>
            <li> First, this smells like baby powder. Gross. On the right day you MIGHT almost pick up the scent of grapefruit or vanilla. But that&#x27;s a huge might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, I TRIED to overlook this. Being pitted out 5-6 hours into my shift is making it impossible for me to do though. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever tried a deodorant that I&#x27;ve liked less. Stinks. I stink. And it leaves white residue on dark clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three strikes, this deodorant is OUT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try the HERBAN COWBOY deodorant for her in Blossom. Smells much better, works much better, no white residue. Why did I ever stray?!?</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant.  It works for my body and no smell.  I&#x27;ve tried other natural deodorants that did not work near as well as this one.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and works if you just sit around.  If you do everyday activities it doesn&#x27;t prevent odor.  I tried several times.  Not recommended.</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant without baking soda (which irritates me) that worked for me.  I have to reapply it on some days, especially when I&#x27;m going to be doing anything involving sweating, but that&#x27;s still a lot better than all the 20 or so different other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> So there&#x27;s this man on my bus, let&#x27;s call him Mr. Way Too Perfect. He&#x27;s a successful businessman, and when he&#x27;s not keeping the finances of San Francisco millionaires in line, he&#x27;s a beekeeper, an orchid plant \\&quot;doctor\\&quot;, an oyster diver, and he even grows his own heirloom mushrooms. Who grows their own mushrooms (intentionally)?? He does.  He is very attractive, very polite, humorous, and can strike up a conversation with just about anyone and make them feel like they&#x27;ve known him for ages. I&#x27;m not sure where he comes from or who put him on this planet, but basically, he&#x27;s considered a demi-god by the women (and some of the men) on my bus. Everyone wants him to sit next to them. Anyhow, last week, he finally sat next to me. That&#x27;s never happened before. I&#x27;ve been waiting like a year for this opportunity. Fortunately, I had remembered to comb my hair and put on lipstick before leaving work, because I know he usually rides my bus on Tuesdays (he needs to get home early to coach urban basketball...but of course). My pants were clean, check. None of the usual coffee dribble down my sweater, check. Shoes shined, nails polished, and I sorta even felt hot. Problem is, I was literally hot. Whenever it rains in San Francisco, the bus drivers crank up the heat to like 95 freaking degrees. They don&#x27;t realize that rain does not mean the weather is cold; usually it just means the weather is warm enough for it to rain here. The windows were all fogged up, the bus was steamy, and I had to take my jacket off. Then I noticed that I smelled. Stinked, really. The deodorant I used that morning was the La Vanila Grapefruit. It smelled great when I put it on in the morning (mostly like vanilla, though - sort of a flowery vanilla with just a tiny hint of citrus) and went on really smooth. I finally thought I&#x27;d discovered the perfect nontoxic deodorant. So, Mr. Way Too Perfect was sitting next to me then he sort of made a discreet sort of sniffing noise and he GOT UP and moved away. Mind you there were no other seats on the bus, so he stood up the whole ride home. It is hard to stand up when the rickety old bus is traveling at 50 miles over the Bay Bridge. Lots of bumps. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. I guess I really must have smelled for him to have made the decision to stand up instead of sitting next to my stinky self. I was humiliated. Actually, I didn&#x27;t like the smell of my pits, either, so I would have moved away from myself if I could. Anywho, end of sidetrack story. If you need to smell great at the end of the day, don&#x27;t use this...or be prepared apply it AGAIN right before you need to smell great (applying deodorant at the bus stop probably isn&#x27;t the best look, though). Otherwise, be forever known as \\&quot;the stinker\\&quot; by Mr. Way Too Perfect.u there were no other seats on the bus, so he stood up the whole ride home.

            <li> I love this product , in theory. Looking for a natural deodorant that works all day. The fragrance is overpowering, however. Can&#x27;t use it...</li>
            <li> Sadly, I don&#x27;t like this &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; deodorant any better than any of the other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried - either for light daily use or for more active pursuits. Will keep trying, hope to find one I like eventually...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work to control odor. Caused red skin irritation. I tried on 2 separate trials. I ended up throwing it out. For cruelty free &amp;#34;mainstream&amp;#34; antiperspirant (with aluminum which is the only effective antiperspirant, these others are just deodorants) I am using Lady Speed Stick. It is made by Colgate-Palmolive, which PETA lists as cruelty free. I&#x27;m happy with that and it works.</li>
            <li> This works ok if you aren&#x27;t particularly active, but does not mask odor or wetness if you are even moderately active.  However, it didn&#x27;t cause any rashes.  The fragrance is a bit strong for me.</li>
            <li> I love all the lavanilla deodorants. They are one of the few VEGAN deodorants that can actually last all day even in heat, and yet have some of the safest ingredients. The grapefruit isn&#x27;t my favorite scent, if you can get the passion fruit, GO FOR THAT. It is by far the best out of the 4 others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Love how this is natural and works.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping+Friendly service+FABulous deodorant &#x3D;AAA+++Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I read an article in a magazine specifically about this product. The author took two paragraphs to explain how amazing this product is. I NEVER buy anything suggested out of a magazine but this particular article was something I could relate too.&lt;br /&gt;So i spent the 20 some dollars on this deodorant. And guess What? It IS AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is a perfect blend and it&#x27;s ALL natural which is most important.&lt;br /&gt;Love it. Love it. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it and smells great. Works fantastic and trust me I&#x27;m a good test candidate lol</li>
            <li> I splurged and bought this natural &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; deodorant. It has a ton of positive reviews... I must be a freak. It smells like baby powder and in the texas heat I can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;m wearing deodorant after 2 hours. I&#x27;m a mom of two and have the patience of Job,  but I don&#x27;t have the patience or desire to apply deodorant 4 times a day. I never write reviews, but this really disappointed me.</li>
            <li> WOW.  I have never used a natural deodorant before but since getting into using essential oils over the past year I decided I wanted to give it a try. After reading blogs and reviews, this one seemed pretty highly recommended so I decided to go with it.  I am so impressed!  It arrived yesterday and I have now had it on for a full 24 hours (reapplied once this morning) and it really works.  I went for a hike with my kids today and also worked in my yard a little bit, and it has stood up to those tests just fine.  I keep smelling my armpits and still I smell NOTHING.  Not a deodorant-y scent, not body odor, just nothing at all.  I am totally amazed.  It is definitely working better than my old traditional, chemical-y, store-bought stuff.  Never going back!</li>
            <li> Not very effective, better than some department store brands. I prefer handmade ones off Etsy, they last much longer!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have looked for &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants that actually work for a long time and this one is my favorite. The only drawback is if I use too much of it (more than 2 swipes) or I sweat (workout) in it I sometimes break out because my pores get clogged.</li>
            <li> I actually smell pretty good at the end of the day, but a little less so the next morning which is expected.  It has a significant scent that fades over the course of 1.5 to 2 hours, but is slightly there at 5 hours.  I like the scent so it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells great, all natural!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t work for me. But it may work for different body compositions...it smells good at first though!</li>
            <li> Love it! I have fewer odor problems since switching to natural deodorant!</li>
            <li> It works and it smells good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this deodorant for over a year now. When I first made the choice to try an organic deodorant, I was super skeptical at how it would go down. I was searching for a healthier alternative to traditional deodorants and anti perspirants, however, I still didn&#x27;t want to smell bad. After doing lots of online research mainly based on reviews and recommendations from people who have actually tried the product, I decided to try the Lavanila line. When I tried it, it was January. That way, if I were to start to sweat and the deodorant failed to do it&#x27;s job of keeping me smelling fresh, it wouldn&#x27;t be as bad as it would be during a sunny day in August. The first couple of days were tricky because I was so conscious of the fact that I was wearing a new deodorant. Here&#x27;s what I discovered and some recommendations for first time users:&lt;br /&gt;  -Give It A Couple of Weeks....Most of our bodies are so used to using harsh chemicals to stop sweat or prevent BO. It takes a couple of weeks for everything to balance out. Be patient.&lt;br /&gt;  -Travel With It....This may sound a little tedious to some, but they make a small travel size that I keep in my handbag/car/desk for touch up. I never actually cut the deodorant and have BO (which would happen with traditional deodorants), but I will start to sometimes smell a little funky under my arms by the end of the day. Again, it&#x27;s not the sharp repulsive smell of BO, but a softer more natural sweat scent. If I touch up in the late afternoon, it helps tons.&lt;br /&gt;  -You Will Sweat, You May Smell (but just a little)....This is a deodorant, not an antiperspirant. You will get wet under your arms. And like I mentioned before, you may even start to smell a little towards the end of your day after wearing it for a few hours. BUT, it&#x27;s not the strong sting of the stench of BO. It&#x27;s just a natural sweat smell- they are very different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with this product and highly recommend it to anyone looking to try a healthier deodorant.ier deodorant.</li>
            <li> So I sweat...like most. But I wanted something more natural. Because what you eat is just as important as what&#x27;s going on your body. So after reading many reviews and having tried natural Deoderant before I was a bit eh about spending this much on a stick of deoderant. I did test this Deoderant many times. From walking, running, lifting, going to work, bike riding, cleaning the house, and a night out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results.&lt;br /&gt;Gym eh no go...then again it&#x27;s ok to smell. So no worries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Home...great! Cleaning etc!&lt;br /&gt;No residue or stains on anything yet I have seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going out. Prob not the strongest. I have noticed it last about 4-5 hours. And then I feel I need to reapply it. Granted I don&#x27;t carry it with me. Depending what your doing outside or out that day or night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I love it! Smells good!</li>
            <li> LaVanilla smells nice once applied but does not keep me dry the entire day and the scent fades quickly.  I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like the smell but I smell by end of day</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product left me with a painful, itchy rash. Even when I used it, it wasn&#x27;t effective -- the scent was nice, but if I sweat even a little, it just smelled like perfumed sweat. I ended up going to the dermatologist about my rash then realizing it was caused by this deodorant. I have sensitive skin, but a product has never made me break out this painfully!</li>
            <li> I saw this product had a glowing review in Lucky magazine last month. I don&#x27;t use harsh chemicals on my skin and I wanted to give this deodorant a try. I was a little hesitant though, because I couldn&#x27;t find in any of the descriptions online if this product was a liquid roll on, or a solid stick-type deodorant (which usually gives me a rash.) Awesome, I know. .. Anyway, this product is actually a solid stick-type deodorant on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the smell is very strange. It&#x27;s really heavy and musky - but it certainly wasn&#x27;t something I couldn&#x27;t live with. Didn&#x27;t really smell like vanilla OR grapefruit, though...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me. I tried it for three days - and I did&#x27;t even go to the gym or do anything other than go to work! I&#x27;m about to hop into the shower as the b.o. is just too bad. I&#x27;m pretty bummed this product didn&#x27;t work at all for me. I ordered this product from Dermstore because they had free shipping, so it&#x27;s just the $18.00 I&#x27;m out.... But still...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bummed.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural, aluminum-free deodorant and this product came up as one of the top recommendations. I had an opportunity to test this during a 12 hour flight, part of an 18 hour trip, and was amazed by the result: zero underam smell. This is unquestionably the most efficient deodorant I have ever used. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t leave nasty stains on clothes like aluminum-based products do, and it doesn&#x27;t smell nasty like cheap drugstore deodorants. Its fragrance is pleasant but very subtle and does not clash with cologne.&lt;br /&gt;When applying it leaves a white streak but unlike other sticks this disappears quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed by this product. More efficient than the nasty chemical stuff but gentle and natural, and the faint fragrance is gender-neutral. Highly reommended, the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Love this line - smells a bit off from perfume but still like it.  Why is it being discontinued!  I always get complimented when I use this.</li>
            <li> The grapefruit scent didn&#x27;t work for me as well as the lavender scent worked.</li>
            <li> One of the only healthy women&#x27;s deodorants that works for us.</li>
            <li> Works well! Sometimes needs a second application but it&#x27;s the best &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; deodorant I&#x27;ve found yet... I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve been through at least a dozen other brands!!</li>
            <li> great product, really works. I was looking for a fresh, citrus sell however I&#x27;m not totally in love with the combination vanilla+ grapefruit. I give it 5 stars for ingredients and function but next time I will try different scent combination.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it has all natural ingredients and it&#x27;s smell was supposed to be grapefruit and vanilla. When I first opened the twist top I could smell a hint of grapefruit and it smelled nice, however,  once I put it on I began to smell like my grandfather. I don&#x27;t know what ingredient to attribute that smell to but pee-yuk! They should tell you you are going to smell like an old man&#x27;s after shave!!! I have yet to discover where they are hiding the vanilla smell. I give 2 stars because it does act like a deodorant should and it does have the faintest of faint grapefruit odor, plus it is a natural deodorant. Would I buy it again,  NO! Do I use it, yes because it cost $15 and that is pricey BO in my book, so I get a couple of wistfull glances from grandmothers, it&#x27;s a very small stick.</li>
            <li> This is the *only* deodorant that I have found that is nontoxic that actually works. Everything else (Silver, Crystal stuff) did nothing. This scent isn&#x27;t my favorite, the blackberry one is better. A little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> The smell is very very strong and underneath the grapefruit and the hint of vanilla is that awful baby-power musk. I&#x27;ve very sensitive to smells, that&#x27;s one of the reason I wanted to try this. But it really is unpleasantly strong. I&#x27;m going back to my Mitchum unscented. Yech.</li>
            <li> The very first day I used this, I broke out in a really painful red rash under both arms. I kept using it for a week to see if it would go away, and it only got worse. I will definitely not be using this product again.</li>
            <li> There is no grapefruit scent attached to this deodorant whatsoever. It smells like if someone took a powder fresh deodorant and sprinkled vanilla on it. Not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to be working so far, but be warned: it smells terrible. It seems to smell like baby powder only worse, somehow. I cannot detect any hint of vanilla OR grapefruit. Definitely NOT what I was expecting. Still, I&#x27;ve tried ALOT of natural deodorants lately and so far, this one seems to be holding up better than the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can definitely recommend the product, but don&#x27;t buy this fragrance if you do not enjoy the typical &amp;#34;powder fresh&amp;#34; type of scents.</li>
            <li> A natural deodorant that I may come back to. This deodorant keeps smell at bay all day on a typical day. If I&#x27;m a little more active one day or its simply hotter then I will need to do a few extra swipes towards the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Finally I found a natural deod. that I like .  It glides on very easily and smells really good.  I have tried soooooooooo many kinds, but I think this will be the one for me now.</li>
            <li> Wow, this deodorant was a HUGE disappointment. I&#x27;ve been trying so hard to find a natural deodorant, and this one came up with all these great reviews, so I thought it would be a hit... no way! For $14.00 (which is crazy to pay for deodorant, but I didn&#x27;t mind because of the lack of harmful chemicals), I expected much better. The smell was okay (not sure how it&#x27;s &amp;#34;vanilla&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;grapefruit,&amp;#34; much less a combo of both), but it didn&#x27;t keep ME from smelling horrible after a few hours. I smell better with no deodorant at all! Didn&#x27;t appear to work whatsoever. I am definitely returning this.</li>
            <li> I found this deodorant to smell like baby powder, it worked for three days then stopped. I switched back and fourth with naturally fresh roll-on which kinda worked, but not the best still would smell, needed to be reapplied and air dried because that deodorant is wet(annoying). I did this for a while until I decided to try Jason purifying tea tree deodorant so far I really like it seems to better than lavanilla and it&#x27;s lighter to carry around in the purse, so if I need to reapply at least I&#x27;m not walking around with a brick.</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells great and goes on smooth without residue. As far as deodorants goes, this is has been my favorite (out of maybe 6 different natural ones I tried). It is not antiperspirant, however! Antiperspirants are virtually impossible in natural deodorants. The only natural antiperspirant I found that works for me is sage oil (recipe below). Warning: do not use sage oil if pregnant. The sage oil deodorant works amazing applied 2x/day for the prevention of sweating but after 24 hours or so I notice a little odor start to develop. This is when the Lavanila comes in handy!!! I use the sage oil for antiperspirant, and add the Lavanila as needed. This combination is working great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing folks might be concerned about is that it contains carrageenan. It says it is seaweed based and is not synthetic. Carrageenan has possible GI effects when ingested, but I cannot find any information on negatives in skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sage deodorant recipe:&lt;br /&gt;2T baking soda&lt;br /&gt;2T arrowroot (can&#x27;t recommend any substitutions, I would use arrowroot)&lt;br /&gt;3.5T softened coconut oil (do not melt, just soften or the soda/arrowroot will settle)&lt;br /&gt;3 drops sage&lt;br /&gt;A few drops other essential oil of choosing (lavender, lemon, tea tree.....etc)</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Decided to try this after 3 weeks of fighting BO while breast feeding and using other brands of herbal deodorant. It works the best out of all that I have tried. At the most I only have to reapply 1x in a day. Remember, this is not a antiperspirant, but it doesn&#x27;t have the aluminum that all those antiperspirants have.</li>
            <li> great product!! i just wish they are available in stores</li>
            <li> Happy customer. Love the scent...love the product ! I definitely plan on re-purchasing! Cannot wait to try the other scents.</li>
            <li> Applied before work and smelled BO by the afternoon. I do stairs at work on my two breaks so it&#x27;s probably true that it might last if reapplied, but that&#x27;s inconvenient. It felt smooth going on, smelled fine and did not clump. Honest input from my own experience. This deodorant did have the highest recommendations from the research I did.</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant I have found. Only on the very hot days do I have to reapply. But if I have not been sweating I do not have to reapply at all. The odor is not like most natural deodorants I usually hate the smell of natural deodorants and this one is very very mild.</li>
            <li> Somehow took my natural odor and morphed it into the smell of raw onions after several hours of wear. Just terrible, better to just go without deodorant.</li>
            <li> I will use this for life!  I have tried Tom&#x27;s, Kiss My Face, crystals. geodeo, and have always be unhappy.  Lavanila is silky smooth, has almost no fragrance when dry, leaves no residue, and works for at least 2 days in the heat!</li>
            <li> I was always wary of the ingredients in regular deodorant and finally started using this when I was pregnant.  I find that it works great and definitely better than any other natural deodorant I tried by far.  I used to use the regular clinical strength deodorant and this is almost as good as that.  It does an amazing job for a standard work day (desk job) even in the summer.  It often, but not always, handles a workout as well.  I will say that it took a couple of weeks for my body to adjust to not having the regular clinical strength deodorant - so stick with it (just reapply during those first two weeks).</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an alternative to deodorants with aluminum and other harsh chemicals. I was surprised when after a week of using Lavanila a rash developed. I have sensitive skin but never have I had such a strong adverse reaction to a product. I&#x27;m saddened that I can no longer continue to use this deodorant, it was moderately effective and I now have to purchase a new deodorant- saddened.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a natural deodorant and I found this one, based on the reviews I decided to order it. The smell is great, I don&#x27;t have a problem with underarm sweat so I kept dry. The only issue I had was towards the end of the day I had to reapply, it didn&#x27;t keep me fresh all day.</li>
            <li> I try to stick with as natural as possible products, but deodorant with antiperspirant is something I&#x27;ve always stuck with until about a year ago, as I&#x27;ve developed a painful skin condition in my armpits that makes wearing drugstore brands very painful and causes more issues. I&#x27;ve been wearing Tom&#x27;s for about a year now, but I&#x27;ve never loved it because the texture is really funky and goops up immediately. I researched the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; natural deordorants for a while and scoured the reviews before chosing Lavanila as one of 6 naturals I bought with my last Amazon order. I&#x27;ve been very hesitant to post my review because this seems like such a beloved brand, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve gotten antiperspirant out of my system and I know I&#x27;m not using this incorrectly. It just doesn&#x27;t work for me, at all. I almost wonder if I got a dud but how can deodorant be a dud? As a previous reviewer stated instead of smelling like Vanilla Grapefruit, it smells more like baby powder. Fine, I can deal with that. But it just doesn&#x27;t control odor at all and I&#x27;m not a particularly sweaty person. It doesn&#x27;t even last a few hours on me, and I smell horrible after wearing this overnight. It doesn&#x27;t matter how often I reapply it. I finally decided to review it when I wore 2 other brands (soapwalla and Primal Pit Paste) without any such issue. Maybe something in my chemical makeup doesn&#x27;t play nicely with this, but that doesn&#x27;t make sense either as the ingredients in all the natural deodorants are pretty similar straight across the board.</li>
            <li> Like the product but this scent smells like bug spray.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a non-chemical deodorant and this is by far my favorite!  It works well and and smells great:)</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and is a great product. My wife loves it. We ran out and she tried another brand and was shocked at how lousy the competition is!</li>
            <li> I purchase this deoderant because I&#x27;m a Celiac and am very sensitive to both topical gluten (which several deoderants have) and to harsh chemicals. Lavanila doesn&#x27;t have either of these and it smells wonderful. It&#x27;s really expensive, so that&#x27;s why I only gave it four stars...but the price hasn&#x27;t stopped me from purchasing over and over again.</li>
            <li> I am into world of warcraft and minecraft and Lara Craft. So needless to say I sweat a lot. This solved the problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many rave reviews about this deodorant and this scent. It says Vanilla Grapefruit but to me it smells like a tangy baby powder scent and I do not like wearing anything that smells like baby powder. I was hoping for more vanilla. As for the wear of the deodorant, I must say that I like it more than any natural one that I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve been attempting different ones over the years because of all the health issues ingredients in normal deodorants can cause. Unless you are a very heavy sweater or are out running and exercising hard, this does the trick. It goes on cool and wet feeling but dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you with a wet pit feeling. The only other downfall is the price. I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last me as I put quite a bit on when applying. I would recommend buying and I will purchase it again but next time I&#x27;m going to try the vanilla scent or vanilla lavender. You really can&#x27;t smell anything 5 minutes after you apply it anyhow so it doesn&#x27;t really matter. At least it doesn&#x27;t clash with other fragrances you may be wearing. BEST NATURAL DEODORANT SO FAR.  $$$$$ Priciest one too.</li>
            <li> I like this better than the Vanilla scent.  It seems to last longer on me, and has not irritated me or given me bumps or rashes.  I used to use Lush&#x27;s Teo but after some time I saw darkening and started to itch so I d/c use.  This is a lot less messy than some all natural products because it goes on like normal deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Lavanila deodorants for about 2 years. Not only does this smell amazing, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin like almost every other deodorant or make me smell bad like most natural deodorants! Throughout my teens I used typical drugstore chemically deodorants and have always had itchy, irritated reactions, but needed to use it so I continued. Nothing else worked except this baby powder I tried once and ran out of and never found out what that was... all other natural deodorants just make me smell 10x worse except for this brand and those crystal salt water sprays that are also awesome but don&#x27;t smell like anything. This one makes you feel a little more like you&#x27;re &amp;#34;pampering&amp;#34; your armpits I guess haha.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about aluminum in deodorant so I purchased Lavanila. My daughter likes perfumes that have a vanilla scent. It works well for her and she does like it and uses it every day.</li>
            <li> The best natural deodorant I have found... And I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
            <li> Great product , I was amazed how it managed to keep me from stinking &#x27; . I am a very sweaty Pearson and I have never had a stick that has done the job right .. I&#x27;ve already ordered a second stick.</li>
            <li> I think there is a connection between the fact that women shave their underarms and then apply deodorant containing aluminum and other harmful chemicals to the alarming rate of women who develop breast cancer.  I wonder if the aluminum gets into the bloodstream and lymph nodes via the small nicks and cuts that remain after shaving? And that&#x27;s why I use this Aluminum-free deodorant.  The fragrance is very fresh and clean, but I have to admit that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; all day... BUT, I&#x27;d rather be a teeny bit musty at the end of the day, than use products that contain known carcinogens. :)</li>
            <li> The deodorant smells great and lasts a long time. As far as I have seen, no residue wears off on clothes. The only downside is the price.</li>
            <li> It works and smells good. I&#x27;ve used Tom&#x27;s brand before and, to me, the scent they used ended up smelling like BO :( not fun. I&#x27;d be willing to try Tom&#x27;s again, but this brand was recommended by a friend and so far so good. I keep an extra in my purse because you do need to reapply throughout the day depending on your level of activity (at least I do).</li>
            <li> The scent is a little strong but disapates quickly.  Woks great!</li>
            <li> I bought this once before on Sephora and loved it, but found it on Amazon for a lot less $$.  It works really well for me and it smells great!  It might not work for everyone or on exceptionally hot days, but I don&#x27;t like to wear aluminum based antiperspirants so it&#x27;s great for me!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work for a hot day, you will sweat and smell in just a couple of hours, so use with caution and best to avoid in formal occasions</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much I spend on this deodorant, but it is really worth the price.  I want to avoid antiperspirants but still reduce odor, and this fits the bill.  I enjoy the scent, which also helps to mask any unpleasant odor.  It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; as well as antiperspirants, but it does work better than any other deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that I&#x27;ve bought the travel size as well (twice), and it is not nearly as good as the full size.  I think it is because the deodorant is too small for the bottle, so it dries out and is difficult to apply.  The regular size does not have this problem and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> i would recommend this product for anyone that has or had breast cancer. There are no harmful chemicals in it</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I am very self conscious about body odor. I used to reapply my Secret deodorant/antiperspirant twice a day. I decided it would be better to reapply using a natural deodorant instead. I enjoy the scent of the product and I think it works. But you do need to reapply because after a few hours, the product stops working. I don&#x27;t mind because I usually reapply once or twice a day anyway. If you are looking for a natural deodorant with a nice smell, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months and now purchased second one. This is the only natural deodorant that works for me. I do not expect wonders - like no perspiration, odor free all day in hot temperatures... All I need is if it keeps me odor free for 5hours, then I use a wipe and re-apply the deo. That totally works for me. I am happy about the ingredients. I tried Tom&#x27;s, Nourish, Body Shop natural deodorants before but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is our new favorite natural deodorant because it actually works! .. and the grapefruit scent it very refreshing! We&#x27;ll be ordering more for sure</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Not only does it control odor, it also made me sweat less. I has a very pleasant smell as well. I&#x27;m swearing off harmful normal deodorant brands for life after this!</li>
            <li> I reviewed it in the video below. Check it out! It keeps me feeling fresh and clean and no other 100% natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used has ever worked this well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Smells really good, but it did wear off quickly. I stopped using it after a few weeks. A girlfriend recommended it and said that she has been using it for a very long time, but again, it didn&#x27;t do much for me. On to the next one!</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant.  It is all natural, works great, and doesn&#x27;t poison my body with carcinogens or silver oxide!  I&#x27;m so glad I found this deodorant!</li>
            <li> this product worked MUCH better than most natural deodorant products... and I have tried many. I hope they come out with more scents!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this deordant. It&#x27;s the best natural one I&#x27;ve ever used. The smell is great and  I never stink.</li>
            <li> This really works and smells good, but it gives me a terrible rash after a day or two. Buy a travel or mini size if you can to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> i was skeptical about this product, but it is awesome! the fragrance is strong at first but tones down a lot. i&#x27;ve used this on the hottest and muggiest DC summer days!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite natural deodorant. It definitely doesn&#x27;t work as well as the mainstream alternatives but it does the job for everyday wear. I keep the smaller size in my backpack in case I need to reapply again during the day (which is very rare).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vanilla grapefruit scent is light and citrusy and smells less like lemon pledge than the vanilla lemon scent.</li>
            <li> Great transaction! When I first received the deodorant the smell kind of threw me off but after a while I got used to it. Next time I think I&#x27;m going to purchase the vanilla one. Otherwise, the shipping was fast and everything went smooth.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this because its free of aluminum and all the bad crap but it smells awful and does not work.  The only decent natural deodorant I have found is from Soapwalla but even that has issues for me because sometimes it stings horribly and turns my underarms red.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful deodorant.  The scent is light and feminine, baby-powderish - calling it grapefruit is inaccurate - it doesn&#x27;t smell like grapefruit at all, which is my only complaint.  It leaves my skin feeling moisturized as well.  And I wore it during a busy day where I was sweating most of the day and did not notice any odor at the end of the day, with only one application in the morning.  It really seems to last all day.  And most importantly, it does not irritate my skin like typical deodorants do.  It has lasted several months of daily application.  EWG database gives it a toxicity rating of 4, mostly for the unknown fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine deodorant, which I can pick up at the local WM, for much cheaper, and the unscented has a toxicity rating of 1, but it seems to irritate my skin more than this, though not as much as typical deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this product again and have been recommending it to friends and family.  I will probably try a different scent though.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;organic\\&quot; deodorants, and this is this first that has actually worked for me. Others have left me smelling like B.O. within hours, this one lasts all day, even during the hot and sweaty summer months. My only complaint is I&#x27;m not satisfied with the grapefruit-vanilla scent, but that is just because of my own scent taste/preference. Next time I think I will try the coconut-vanilla or passion fruit-vanilla. I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed and satisfied with how the deodorant works and lasts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Toms of Maine since last fall. Thought I&#x27;d try this brand. This one has a lovely smell - more &amp;#34;normal.&amp;#34; But it simply does not last. After 4-5 hours I have to reapply (not handy when I am at work!).&lt;br /&gt;Keeping it for the fall or winter when I&#x27;m not so stinky :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beginning to think this is primarily a winter deodorant. The smell is great, and for the most part it&#x27;s effective. But there are other times in which it completely fails. Regardless, I went with this brand because it completely eliminates aluminum from the ingredient list, something many other &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants do not.</li>
            <li> This product works great! It keeps me from underarm odor for many hours. Only downside with the grapefruit scent, it smells very musky like a mens deodorant. Prefer vanilla and lavender but wasn&#x27;t available at the time. Other than that, two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I threw it away, because it doesn&#x27;t work and stinks worse than bo.</li>
            <li> Tried a few &amp;#34;hippie deodorants&amp;#34; and ended up liking this best. It handles workouts and hot summer really well.</li>
            <li> I was initially very happy with this product. It seemed very effective at odor control (I hadn&#x27;t run any marathons while using it, but got through the work day without issue) and didn&#x27;t notice and issues with sweat. About two weeks after I started using it I developed a rash under both of my arms. It seems to be linked with one of the ingredients in this product. I am very bummed because I really hoped I had found a aluminum free deodorant that worked.</li>
            <li> Great product. A little pricey in my opinion but worth it. It lasts most of the day. I do apply on fresh clean underarms to start of course.  I do reapply if I&#x27;m going back out later but I can deal with that vs some of the others that fail by mid day. I don&#x27;t care for any of the other scents.</li>
            <li> It was for my daughter who is allergic to other deodorants.  She reports that it really worked, and loves the scent and feel!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Vanilla Grapefruit and Im in love! My first order of this deodorant was in the lavender vanilla scent and I wasn&#x27;t too happy with the sent, so once it was gone I ordered this scent and Im loving the scent! I think it actually works better then the Lav/van scent. Not sure if it&#x27;s because the smell is stronger so it covers the odor better or what! But best one so far.</li>
            <li> I like this healthier option and the scent is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant I have tried.  Very pleasant fragrance without being overpowering.  Lavender is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for 2 years and it&#x27;s great.  It&#x27;s not the normal wet feeling natural deodorant that you may be used to it.  It goes on dry, feels just like the nasty aluminum filled variety (yuck!), but keeps you smelling great! If you are a heavy sweater, you may have to re-apply again before you go to the gym etc., but is that really a big deal?  Using this product allows you to feel good about what you&#x27;re rubbing directly on your lymph nodes!!</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this deodorant because of the reviews and the price.  It gives you a nice &amp;#34;deodorant smell and feel&amp;#34; that most &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants lack.  After a day or two my underarms started to get irritated and by the end of the week I had to switch back to my previous deodorant (Tom&#x27;s).  I will keep using Lavanila it off and on because it does work and smells good, but it also irritates my skin, so it&#x27;s not a solid 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every day (occasionally twice a day - morning and evening) for almost 2 months.  Not only can I smell a BO smell on myself every day, but my armpits are red and irritated. Before I started using Lavanila, I used a typical drugstore antiperspirant and I had no issues with rashes - my skin looked good and I didn&#x27;t smell, but now that I am breastfeeding I want something natural. In desperation I switched to a perfumed deodorant from Macy&#x27;s 2 days ago, and the rash is clearing up, ironically.  I really wanted this to work because I want to use a natural deodorant, but there must be something in the ingredients that is irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a little expensive, but worth the money. If you use this and some unsented over the top, it lasts for 2 days, even if you perspire a lot.</li>
            <li> It will let you stink after a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t keep you dry or avoid smells</li>
            <li> love this deodorant! i am very picky on what i use anymore and want to stay as natural as possible. everything out there from toms of maine to trader joes dont seem to do anything for me. this really works and feels so smooth! it doesnt really smell like vanilla or grapefruit to me but has a clean fresh scent. and i am really sensitive to smells and this is nice. i cant wait to try other scents too</li>
            <li> very nice smell and it works</li>
            <li> really like the smell</li>
            <li> Not a complete odor-blocker, but very soft smooth and not sticky. Love the scent! Especially the &amp;#34;Vanilla Passionfruit&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 star because I really like the smell and it really kept me from sweating but I broke out in a rash after about 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a natural deodorant journey for over a year now and decided to try this one since it got such good reviews. I bought it at my local Whole Foods store without smelling it first. Nothing like I expected. It&#x27;s a very musky baby powder smell to me with a hint of vanilla. I smell nothing near a fruity smell. Application was great, smooth and dried pretty fast. It does however turn your clothes white no matter if it&#x27;s dry or not. For the past 1-2 weeks I&#x27;ve only been applying it after my shower at night and reapplying in the morning before work. I would be pretty smelly by the end of a light work day, but it wasn&#x27;t necessarily a body odor smell. Just a strong musky baby powder smell. It didn&#x27;t bother me too much, but now my under arms are very red and itchy, so that is why I will stop using this deodorant. So far my favorite has been T&#x27;eo from LUSH.</li>
            <li> Amazing deodorant - the only natural product of found that always works. THIS IS NOT ANTIPERSPIRANT, THIS IS DEODORANT. It makes your skin feel wonderful - it is very moisturizing and great on shaved armpits! The scents are beautiful - pure and not overpowering. Very clean feeling. Expensive, but long lasting. Worth it.</li>
            <li> Came as described and on time delivery.  Smell seemed a bit strong at first but once applied, it was not strong at all.  Used for moderate activity and held up well.  Have seen this in Whole Foods and know I can purchase from there as well.  Would purchase again via Amazon/elsewhere.  Pleased with product.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and didn&#x27;t have to reapply too often however big HUGE however, it broke me out in a red angry rash:( I do believe that this is because of the tea tree oil and my sensitivity to that but I can&#x27;t be sure. Would still tell someone to give it a try because you never really know as every body is different.</li>
            <li> Not the best scent. I want to try the vanilla coconut. Of course you&#x27;ll still sweat, however the scent does last a few hours without you smelling like a total hoagie</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, it smells like baby powder.  I don&#x27;t get any notes of vanilla or grapefruit.  It made my underarms burn when I put it on, so that&#x27;s a problem. It claims not to have any harsh chemicals, but it was too harsh for my sensitive skin.  I tried wearing it for a day, and after a few hours, I had noticeable odor (which has been my problem with other brands).  Pretty big waste of money in my opinion, which is really unfortunate since I purchased it after it topped a list of best natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> This is 1 of 4 natural/healthy deodorants I have tried. So far, I like it the best. The grapefruit vanilla scent is mild. I would like to test their other scent options, but this is fine. I bike to work every day and it holds up pretty well. Because of biking I tend to reapply deodorant, but I did that when I used antiperspirants too. It doesn&#x27;t seem to work for nervous sweating, since it didn&#x27;t hold up through a speech I gave. I&#x27;ll likely continue to use this brand for years (and maybe use a traditional antiperspirant for public speaking).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best so far of all natural deodorants that I have tried. And trust me summertime is probably not the best time to be experimenting with deodorants. The scent of this one is okay, but there are other options so I&#x27;ll try the others once I&#x27;m done with this one. It&#x27;s easy to apply and feels smooth on the skin. It does not leave a white residue which I like. So far I&#x27;m pretty stoked on finding this natural deodorant!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out why this product is described as &amp;#34;grapefruit&amp;#34; scented.  There is nothing grapefruit-y or remotely citrusy about it.  If anything, it smells very powdery to me .  Big disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t find it to be very effective at all.  Obviously this is a deodorant and not an anti-persperant, but I still have some level of expectation re: odor control and this did not make the cut.  Drug store brand deodorants far surpassed the quality of this product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> At first it seemed to work like a charm, however after the second week the deodorant scent along with my body oils began to create a terrible smell. The product no longer worked for me. I ended up feeling sweaty and stinky by noon. My search continues.</li>
            <li> This smells awful! It actually smells like a cross between scented baby wipes and BO. I wish I could return this product. The lemon vanilla scent is so much better.</li>
            <li> I love their perfumes but this has turned into my 3 year olds deodorant. Not strong enough for real life.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice, sweet citrus smell. It goes on smooth, without irritation. However, because it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, it needs to be reapplied throughout the day to prevent odor.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant! I tried the pure vanilla first, but decided to branch out and try another scent. This one is very fresh and clean smelling. Great for spring and summer!</li>
            <li> Smells Kind Of Odd but works fine.</li>
            <li> I wanted an all natural deodarant...so this is deodarant and NOT antipersperant.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice and pleasant and clean...not like perfume.  It goes on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;This works for me.  I will order it again!</li>
            <li> TOTALLY in love. My boyfriend started wearing &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; deodorant and it made me want to find one that I could use and would work. This product definitely works and keeps me dry and smelling goo.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to switch to a natural deodorant for ages and I am so glad I bought the LAVANILA The Healthy Deodorant Grapefruit Deodorant. It feels so smooth and amazing when I apply it after a shower. The scent is not overpowering, but invigorating and refreshing. It doesn&#x27;t smell cheap and even my boyfriend loves it. It could be unisex if your man is into it. When you first do the switch to any natural deodorant you will sweat and if you&#x27;re like me probably a lot, but that unpleasant side effect diminishes over time. About two weeks after I began using the Lavanila deodorant I was sweating much less than before and it didn&#x27;t bother me at all. The key is to stick to it no matter what and don&#x27;t go back to using antiperspirants! You do have to maintain proper hygiene for it to work (shower every day and reapply the deodorant halfway through your day on CLEAN, DRY armpits). Another huge plus is that this deodorant will last you a while. I am so happy with it that I just finished ordering my third one from Amazon and I will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I&#x27;ve used this in the heat of the summer and haven&#x27;t stunk! It rolls on smooth and I feel fresh wearing it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, helps keep me fresh all day.</li>
            <li> This is pretty effective at controlling odor and somewhat effective at minimizing sweat (though it&#x27;s not a antiperspirant). I still do get a little damp throughout the day and sometimes need to reapply. But it&#x27;s one of the best natural deodorants I have tried, because it is very gentle. I used Tom&#x27;s and Soapwalla&#x27;s before and got a horrible rash with both. Overall, Lavanila works decently well and doesn&#x27;t cause any bad reactions for me. I bought the Grapefruit scent because it was on sale, but I usually get the Lemon...Lemon smells a lot nicer.</li>
            <li> Not sure how well it works. I like everything about it otherwise. Just doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well. I was quite surprised.  It still is not as great as the traditional chemical laced anti-perspirants/deodarants, but it is pretty darn good. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d rely on it while going to my senior prom, wedding or some other ultra important event as I wouldn&#x27;t want to take any chances on it failing to work.  But for the price, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> The very first day I put it on, it lasted the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;Since then, it lasts half a day.&lt;br /&gt;Its been hot here, and so during the day I need to re-apply it, and it will keep good until evening.&lt;br /&gt;But you do need to have it with you to reapply it during the day, otherwise you will smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the aroma is just great. Everytime I put it on, I just cannot stop smelling it, I absolutely love this smell.&lt;br /&gt;For such a natural product, its great.&lt;br /&gt;Its always a compromise. Harsh chemicals and long lasting, or totally natural and you ll reapply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again and again and again.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product, but unfortunately I was not a fan of the smell. It actually reminds me of BO. Also, I don&#x27;t believe it was very effective. Around midday, it would start wearing off, and I don&#x27;t usually need heavy strength or anything unusual. I used it a few times, and will probably get rid of it, maybe the other LAVANILA scents are better?</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised to find this less-floral than expected; it&#x27;s a lovely scent and appropriate for men and women.</li>
            <li> Product delivered on time.  Deodorant smells nice but wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> does not work you will still sweat</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe a natural deodorant actually works - I am delighted!  Doesn&#x27;t smell like grapefruit at all but the smell is okay kinda like baby powder.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to aluminum-free deo and I LOVE this one!!! I did a good amount of research on aluminum-free deodorants and have tried a number of them but this one impresses me as being the closest to regular deodorants. Glides on like the Dove or Degree, no wetness feeling. It does make you sweat it out when you are sweating (since there is no aluminum to block your sweat glands), but it is definitely healthier. I still do keep a stick of regular deodorant for the days when I need to keep the sweat in and avoid smelling like a man! :)</li>
            <li> Love these products. Great light scent and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I like the ingredients in this deodorant. I don&#x27;t feel like I am putting chemicals on my body. The grapefruit scent is nice, but I don&#x27;t think that it is for everyone. I apply the deodorant in the morning after I get out of the shower. I smell fine for the rest of the day unless I do a very tough workout late in the day. If I sweat profusely, I definitely start to smell a little bit like BO mixed with the scent of the deodorant, but its better than if I was not using any deodorant at all. Perhaps if I applied the deodorant right before the workout it would be more effective.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works well for a natural deodorant.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The smell is a little musky, but not overpowering.  Generally, I have found that it works extremely well throughout the day, especially if there is not a lot of sweating going on.  If I sweat a lot (working out) I get the mix of the musky smell and sweat smell (not good), but it helps if I apply right before working out.  I would recommend this deodorant if you&#x27;re looking for a natural alternative - works much better than others I have tried.  You may have to apply it more than once during the day, but the fact that it is free of chemicals makes it a keeper for me.</li>
            <li> Did not work. After 2 hours on an air conditioned train, I smelled ripe! Each time I lifted up my arm, the odor damn near knocked me down. I wouldn&#x27;t risk trying this again on a day when I am  leaving  the house. The search for a natural deodorant THAT WORKS continues.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling natural deoderant.  It holds for most of the day; if you have a more physical job or are out in the sun for long periods, you may need a second application.  Good product that I will buy again unless I find something more long lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for years and when Sephora stopped selling it bought it via Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum in it and the smell is nice and fresh.</li>
            <li> Mmmmm.. Stay fresh all day</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells nice and is smooth going on.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like some other natural deodorants.  This keeps me smelling nice during normal day to day activity but does not help during my workouts.  I refuse to wear regular deo so I just suck it up and make sure I don&#x27;t get too close to the other people in my class!</li>
            <li> I was all for  trying out chemical free deodorants but this did not cover up one bit of BO. I have never had an issue with body odor and this was on another level I could not believe it. I wish I hadn&#x27;t spent $15 on this.</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deodorant I have found that works as well as it does.  It works all day if I am just at my desk at work, and it works about 4 hours if active.  If you can manage to reapply mid-day, then you are golden without using harmful chemicals on your body.</li>
            <li> Smells great!! A little pricey but you know it seems worth it. Goes on very smooth. I wear it at home so havent tested it in situations where I really sweat a lot, but it seems to work for me!</li>
            <li> best natural deo i&#x27;ve tried.  doesn&#x27;t completely keep you dry in summer months, but does better than most.  smell is nice.  goes on smooth and easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s embarrassing to admit to having a body odor problem but it&#x27;s true, I do.  I sweat a lot and with it comes odor.  I&#x27;ve tried just about every natural deodorant on the market without success.  Within hours, it never fails, I always start to smell.  (I should note that most regular antiperspirants don&#x27;t work for me either.)  So when I discovered LAVANILA I was skeptical, but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try.  I started with the Grapefruit scent and was pleasantly surprised!  I can go most of the day before having to reapply.  I attribute it&#x27;s success in large part to the scent.  I&#x27;ve noticed through trial and error that the baby powder scents of most traditional antiperspirants/deodorants don&#x27;t mix well with my body&#x27;s natural odor and they always make me smell worse.  The LAVANILA grapefruit scent has a musky odor that I wasn&#x27;t sure about at first, but have since come to love!  Like one reviewer wrote, it doesn&#x27;t smell quite like vanilla nor does it smell quite like grapefruit, but somehow the combination works.  I have tried the other LAVANILA scents and while the passion-fruit is a close second, the grapefruit works the best for me.  The only negative I have with LAVANILA is that it&#x27;s expensive.  But when you&#x27;ve found something to control the odor, it&#x27;s hard to put a price on that!</li>
            <li> The best deodorant out there! Tried sooo many and none worked. This is the only one that works for me. The only down side is I have to reapply several times throughout the day because the smell starts to deteriorate.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving it a two star and nothing less is because my husband used it and said it was &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34;. He couldn&#x27;t stand me wasting it after how much it cost me. I thought the smell was horrible! It reminded me of the smell of cat flea dip. My husband ended up throwing the last bit away because it kept breaking out of the container and made a mess. Will never buy again. I&#x27;ll stick to my Jason deodorant!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this deodorant, and I&#x27;ll purchase it again and again!</li>
            <li> The aroma is wonderful.  The result is a deodorant with no harsh chemicals (aluminum) and no sweaty underarms - hooray!</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful. I reapply it when I need to, but that isn&#x27;t often:)</li>
            <li> Making the switch from the typical deodorants you find in the grocery store. I don&#x27;t think I sweat a ton but I am conscious of my sweating. Its been about a week using it and still getting used to it because it is not an antiperspirant. Therefore, you will still sweat. There is no way around that but your putting something on your body that doesn&#x27;t have yuckies like aluminum. But the scent is great and I keep repeatedly checking myself to make sure I don&#x27;t stink and it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> Finding a non-toxic deodorant that doesn&#x27;t suck is hard. This stuff isn&#x27;t as good as an aluminum filled antiperspirant, but it&#x27;s the best of it&#x27;s kind (and that&#x27;s coming from someone who&#x27;s spent hundreds of dollars throwing away crap that doesn&#x27;t work).</li>
            <li> Out of nowhere, the skin on my underarms broke out into this itchy rash that left this horribly gross and darkened pigment on my skin when I was finally cured from it. I wasn&#x27;t crazy about Tom&#x27;s, even though I liked the price of Tom&#x27;s over the Healthy of course, but it didn&#x27;t have that powdery-smooth feeling like other deodorants do (that unfortunately made my underarms break out after I shaved. Pretty sure it was an allergic reaction). Anyway, I needed something better, since I had this icky discolored skin - and I actually found out about this on Sephora, but decided to buy it on Amazon, since it was cheaper. Yes, you do have to reapply it more often, since it doesn&#x27;t have that sealant that most harmful deodorants have, and honestly, the smell actually doesn&#x27;t make me want to vomit either; especially since it wears off after a day&#x27;s application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the formed roll-on it has, it&#x27;s circular, not oval-shaped like most - I find this to be annoying, especially with Tom&#x27;s, because it would run so fast, that the plastic edges would rub against my skin. I don&#x27;t have a problem with this at all, and in fact, I may even try another scent after my Vanilla Grapefruit one runs out - which won&#x27;t be for a long while. The pretty packaging is always a plus, the pleasant smell, and with the nasty rash gone now, I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this as my go-to natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the texture here. Its not as &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; as i would like however it has such a familiar texture of that nice powdered dry feeling like normal deodorants. I would love if the sent was a bit stronger though. I keep one in my purse and one at home as its good to reapply a few times during the day. But this is the best all around pretty natural deodorant Ive found.</li>
            <li> This only works for about two hours for me, during light, normal daily activity.  I can&#x27;t use this for the gym; it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I normally go back to smelling like plain old body order by noon each day while using this.</li>
            <li> Good products will purchase again.  I do high intensity training and it holds up well and for an organic, crap free product its superb!  I got my wife to throw away her aerosol crap and use this.  She&#x27;s getting ready to throw away her lotion and purchase from them as well.  I had cancer and trying to make sound lifestyle changes.  cancer or not stay away from most of the otc stuff out there.</li>
            <li> I do have to say of all the vegan/veggie deodorants Ive tried this one is my favorite. The smell though, its a bit off putting, Im not a lavender fan and Im pretty sure that is what I am smelling.. That being said the coverage and easy application far out weigh the slight smell issue. BUY THIS. I live in Az and am on my feet a good chunk of the day. Ive yet to smell anything besides deodorant while wearing this!</li>
            <li> I have been using natural deoderant for years now and have used several options... This is far more superior of a product than any I have used!!! Even better than when I did use aluminum products! I love the smell. I love how dry I stay and I finally get to end my search for a regular deoderant!!!!!</li>
            <li> Way too perfumy smelling.  Works great, but the scent is overpowering.</li>
            <li> I bought the vanilla and grapefruit scent and it smells like neither of those things. It smells like grandma talcum powder.  It is so hard to get off the bad for you anti perspirant to only smell and sweat on natural deodorant anyhow... I am still on the hunt for something that works. I&#x27;ve done the toms stuff to no avail, .next I am trying weleda.  This is very expensive and I expected more based on other reviews. I&#x27;ve loved the L&#x27;occitane anti perspirant for years and am trying to get off the crack! I&#x27;m using this so as not to waste it seeing how I paid $18 but I am not happy about it.</li>
            <li> I am a Lavanilla freak, so I had high hopes for the deodorant. I usually use cheap random deodorants because my issues with smelling are minimal and I usually have no issues staying dry. First day of using this, it was a very hot busy day. I could smell myself right away and also started sweating within 1-2 hrs. Waste of money :(</li>
            <li> Like many others I also got redness under my armpits after 3 days of use, for that price I think this shouldn&#x27;t happen that often-something is not righ about the ingredients. It does smells nice but it holds for like half a day it needs to re-applied. Still looking for the a good organic antiperpserant.</li>
            <li> A great deodorant, my favorite scent of all the Lavanila deodorants.</li>
            <li> This is a great arm deoderant and I recommend it to anyone whether or not they want to go natural. I just wish that I could go all day without any re-applies. That being said I live in AZ and have to re-apply all deoderants. For the cost I would like to apply once. Great smell and feels soooo cool on the skin. Try it!</li>
            <li> Stinks!  I hate the way this smells.  The smells compete and it almost smells like an old lady rub.  Something one would use for aches and pains.  Ladies, men will NOT find you appealing with this thing on your underarms.</li>
            <li> Personally I don&#x27;t love the scent.  It&#x27;s clear and non-sticky however.</li>
            <li> I must be honest and state that this product did not work for me. The packaging is really nice but the fragrance was not my favorite. I thought it would smell fruity, but it had more of a tarte smell. I still decided to wear for a week in order to give a good review. I would not recommend wearing during the summer or extremely hot days. I gave myself the sniff test throughout the day, and I do not like the smell of perspiration with a tarte fruite smell. I have not tried any other scents but if I was to repurchase it would probably be one without fragrance.</li>
            <li> Probably the best all-natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried. I don&#x27;t think any natural stuff will be as good as the normal stuff, but this one does pretty good and has a better scent than the plain vanilla.</li>
            <li> I have used Fresh deoderant for years and have always been happy with it. BUT this deoderant was recieving so many rave reviews i just had to try it. DID NOT WORK.</li>
            <li> How many times have you tried a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; deodorant for whatever reason, and found it to be seriously lacking effectiveness?! I tried FIVE others (Crystal, Toms, Alba, Jason, and Lavilin) and absolutely none of them worked. Some worked &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; than others, but there was still a stink after ANY, and I do mean ANY physical activity.&lt;br /&gt;So I saw a blog about another lady who tried this and loved it, so figured what the heck- I&#x27;ll give it one more shot before going back to Secret Clinical (the only thing that works), or live with the stink (no one liked that option, especially me).&lt;br /&gt;I have used it 5 days now, and have exercised my heart out (in 70+ degree weather, yes I live in CA) indoors with no ventilation, and outdoors with plenty. Either way, by the end of the day I DON&#x27;T stink- omg. FINALLY!&lt;br /&gt;So, yes it&#x27;s expensive, but if going natural/healthy is important to you then it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> absolutely love this deodorant for its effectiveness and scent and no harsh ingredients!!  All the scents smell delicious and not over powering while still being effective in keeping me dry and fresh.</li>
            <li> does not help with under arm odor</li>
            <li> Vegan deodorants are not what you would think of as good deodorants. However, this one actually is. I&#x27;m not using it just because I wanted something more natural and vegan. I would use this one over most other non-vegan deodorants. Make sure you don&#x27;t just use one swipe of it. You really have to rub it all around for it to last. The smell is nice, too. I do like Schmidtt&#x27;s deodorant but this one is much easier to apply especially when you&#x27;re in a hurry in the morning.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Wonderful quality, price point is worth it for its effectiveness. Would buy again</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, but the product doesn&#x27;t work for me. Within a few minutes I am sweating (and not so fresh). I really wanted to like this product, but it doesn&#x27;t meet my active lifestyle needs.</li>
            <li> So far this is the best natural deodorant I have found so far. I tried Maelin Goetz, Dr Haushka, Dessert Essence Tea Tree oil, Lavilin roll on, Tom&#x27;s of Maine a while back and others I can&#x27;t remember.</li>
            <li> It has a very light but pleasant scent even for men.  The best thing is that it does not cause any allergic reaction at all which always happens to me with regular deodorant and antiperspirant.  Sometimes the protection does fade after a stressful day and requires another application before going out in the evening.</li>
            <li> I tried this, looking for a &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; deodorant.  Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t seem effective at all.  I&#x27;ve been smelling myself today, and it&#x27;s a rather chilly day in Georgia, and I haven&#x27;t done anything more strenuous than walking around a doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> My favorite and most effective natural deodorant.  Smells amazing.  I have a number of natural deodorants I rotate and while others are good as well, this is by far the best for me.</li>
            <li> I like this deodorant. The one star less is because the fragrance that is less citrusy and more like a crisp laundry detergent. That is not unpleasant, but it is not what a grapefruit or vanilla smells like to me. I bought the lavender scented one and found that milder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, this is the best natural deodorant for me.  The ingredients are safe, I don&#x27;t ever react to this (unlike Schmidt&#x27;s after about a week of use), and the scent is lovely.  It&#x27;s not perfect and one application doesn&#x27;t always last for 24 hours, but it&#x27;s natural and not pumped with heavy metals.  That matters more to me, so I give it 5 stars.  My one slight downside for the product is its price, I go through about one tube every 2 months. I&#x27;ve used this for years, still great results.</li>
            <li> Great scent and it&#x27;s aluminum free! This is my second purchase and I will continue to use it in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant.  I bought the vanilla lavender and it smells great.  I have also purchased the body wash and shave 2 in 1 and love it.  I got the body wash in passion fruit and used it all up so I immediately bought more in grapefruit.  I have bad perfume allergies but this stuff doesn&#x27;t bother me. Yay!</li>
            <li> Smells very nice and probably the best natural deodorant out there, but needs to be reapplied throughout the day if you want it to be effective.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s come down in price since I bought it ($14 vs. $18), but it&#x27;s still too expensive.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it works wonderfully, but it&#x27;s just not worth the price yet, at least for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly EVERY product on the market that is pareben and aluminum free and nothing seemed to work. This came up as highly recommended, but unfortunately it did not do the trick. I will have to continue my search alas.</li>
            <li> Avoid if you actually like wearing deodorant that keeps you smelling fresh.  I&#x27;m not a highly stinky person, and smelled half way through the day.</li>
            <li> Not the best natural deodorant. The texture is nice, and the scent is mild and pleasant, but it just doesn&#x27;t last, even for a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Very excited to have found a natural deodorant with perscription-like strength!  I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune on natural deodorants, only to be disappointed time and time again when they aren&#x27;t effective at masking odor.  FINALLY I have found a great product that works and as a bonus smells delightful!</li>
            <li> SMELLS WONDERFUL ! and lasts all day</li>
            <li> Love the smell of the deodorant and the packaging.  However, within a few hours I already had an unpleasant smell.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and it works very well. I use the LaVanilla grapefruit perfume as well and although it initially smells like vanilla/grapefruit, the strong smell itself kinda fades away quickly which is good because who wants to noticeably smell like deodorant all day? It&#x27;s all natural and in the day and age of hidden chemicals that is a wonderful thing. I would most definitely order this product from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the feel but I have never had worse b.o. than when using this deodorant. I understand it&#x27;s not an antiperspirant but it shouldn&#x27;t cause a person to smell worse, should it? I live in 95 degree weather so I need something that really works.</li>
            <li> This product applies nicely, but lasts maybe half the day before another application is needed.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the vanilla grapefruit scent.  It makes my underarms smell good at first, but once it wears off, I am left with worse-smelling armpits :( I really wanted to like this product.  Maybe one of the other scents are more effective?  I prefer the Le Couvent de Minimes deodorant over this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just recently been on a mission to find a good aluminum free deodorant. This was one of the first I had tried, and I was not impressed. The smell was good and it worked for only 2-3 hours, but after that it was like I hadn&#x27;t put anything on at all. Even if I reapplied the same day after a few hours, it didn&#x27;t carry on. I used it for about a month, and no improvement came with time. I didn&#x27;t finish the whole thing, was not happy with this product for long term use.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite natural deodorant. A lot of people try natural deodorants with natural soap. This may seem totally obvious to some but I have realized that you have to get your pits 100% clean before putting deodorant on in the first place. Meaning: If you use &amp;#34;natural soap&amp;#34; or not strong enough soap and are not getting your pits clean enough - NO natural deodorant is going to cover up that stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not like 24 - 48 hour antiperspirants that are clogging your pores and you do not stink for days. This lasts on my body for a good 12 - 24 hours, depending on my activity.</li>
            <li> Does nothing for odor and leaves behind white marks</li>
            <li> AMAZING!  I have tried a few other organic products and they were sub-par.  This deodorant stays on for the entire day and holds up through exercise.</li>
            <li> On me, this only lasts about 4 hours, which is how long my work day is. But, when I get home, I already smell bad. Really bad. On the plus side, this smells really nice. Too bad it doesn&#x27;t last. I recommend EO&#x27;s lavender or Weleda&#x27;s Sage sprays. They both last all day and are much cheaper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but it works!</li>
            <li> This is really not my kind of deodorant.  I was hoping for some kind of scent.  There is none.  And it is very wet going on, which I don&#x27;t like at all.</li>
            <li> I have tried every Al free brand available at drugstores but could never find something that didn&#x27;t make me reek!  I read all the reviews here and on several blogs raving about Lavanila so I decided to try it even though a twelve dollar price tag is a lot for deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, it worked really well.  I put on a lot (more than I would use for regular deodorant) and while I still sweated I didn&#x27;t stink.  Awesome!  But, I spent some time looking up recipes for making my own deodorant because the Lavanila price was just so bothersome.  I made my own and used it for a few weeks.  Unfortunately, my skin started reacting to the homemade deodorant (which contains baking soda).  I had to stop using it and give it a few days to calm down the irritation caused by it.  Once my skin was back to normal I started using Lavanila again, but this time my skin reacted.  I get red sploches as well as painful chafing.  I don&#x27;t know if this is just residual from the use of the homemade deodorant or if the Lavanila contains something that my skin is having trouble with.  All I know is, the only stuff not causing a serious reaction is regular full-of-yucky-stuff deodorant :(</li>
            <li> Hands down the best natural deodorant I have ever tried. It lasts for ages, smells beautiful and actually works! It&#x27;s well worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> I have been using the LAVANILA&#x27;s coconut-vanilla deodorant for about a month and I absolutely love it. I enjoy running at the gym and group exercise class (&#x3D; I love to sweat!). So most natural deodorants don&#x27;t do the trick, especially in a small room full of people. I have tried dozens of them, with little success until now. Burt&#x27;s Bee worked fairly well, but it has a manly smell to it. The coconut-vanilla deodorant is very warm and feminine and works very well with my gourmand perfumes. I also love the LAVANILA fragrances, which are actually surprisingly complex for only containing natural oils.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works. I was looking for an all natural deodorant for a long time and sooooo many of them do not work. This one smells nice and keeps body odor away even after a long day at work followed by hot yoga.</li>
            <li> I prefer the scent of this one over the plain vanilla one. I don&#x27;t sweat except when I work out and this keeps me from getting smelly. It will make your clothes white if you&#x27;re not careful. I wear a lot of black and dark colors and you have to be careful when putting them on, but the stains come out with a little water immediately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the search for the perfect deodorant forever. Regular anti-persperant stains my clothes and leaves them smelling disgusting, even as I&#x27;m wearing them. Tom&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t cut it AT ALL. I was hoping this deodorant would be the ticket, but it only lasts a few hours for me, half a day at best. I wish I could return this product because I&#x27;ve found deodorant recipes online using coconut oil and corn starch that work better for me and are much, much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would pass if I were you.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Smells clean and powdery, not too perfume-y.  I also notice it&#x27;s slightly cooling during application, which is pretty nice, in case you have to reapply at some point. For me though, it lasts through my work day and even after if I decide to grab drinks and dinner with friends.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous natural and aluminum free deodorants, and this is the best one I&#x27;ve come across to date. Lavanila only needs one application to make it through a hot and humid day in the nation&#x27;s Capitol swamp, DC.</li>
            <li> Smells great!  Works decent.</li>
            <li> So far not so good, I smells of sweat after some hours. I like the creamy texture and the smell but is too expensive and is not working for me. I regret to buy it. I will keep using arm and hammer.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work well for me after a few hours</li>
            <li> I decided to take the plunge into natural deodorants - my body will thank me, right? With Lavanilla, I&#x27;m not impressed at all - this only hides the smell with a really strong fragrance, but doesn&#x27;t actually eliminate it for me. I don&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; wearing this and worry about smelling by the end of the day. I found a different natural deodorant that I absolutely love (Green Tidings). So, no - I can&#x27;t recommend this product. I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to change to a green deodorant, but after 2 weeks of using this in the summer, I stunk so bad I had to go back to using Secret clinical. Maybe it has to do with your body&#x27;s chemistry, but this one did not work for me. It even took my Secret clinical about a week to get rid of my stench after using this...</li>
            <li> works very well. I like the scent.</li>
            <li> I wanted to switch to a natural deodorant without anti-perspirant to try and clear up some rough, dry skin patches on my underarms that I&#x27;ve had trouble getting rid of. I love the scent of this deodorant and it has worked well at maintaining the scent even through heavy gym workouts.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Good for a normal day use. Haven&#x27;t tried working out out with it or in the summer time.</li>
            <li> I think this would be great for some, but was a little manly for me and didn&#x27;t work with my chemistry. My daughter loves hers.</li>
            <li> No larga duraci&amp;oacute;n</li>
            <li> I got mine at Sephora.  This is the first natural deodorant that I have ever used that worked.  It last a long time although I do usually reapply in the afternoon if I think about it but I did that with regular deodorants too.  This stuff smells great but isn&#x27;t overpowering.  It&#x27;s expensive but looks like it will last a long time and I have decided I am willing to pay more for products with less chemicals.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good and works well!</li>
            <li> This deodorant did not last longer than a couple hours if outside. Would not recommend if looking for something to wear daily, especially in any type of heat or outdoor activities.</li>
            <li> I tried this on a whim after reading a review on a blog I trust. I had been using Toms of Maine as a natural deodorant and it was not cutting it. This is a way better option and after trying it once came back to order two more. I would definitely recommend it. And the smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like what it&#x27;s supposed to....smells more like a man&#x27;s deodorant.  But it smells okay.  I have yet to find a natural deodorant that actually works for more than 2 hours, especially if you are in the heat or exercising.  This one was in that category....worked for a few hours but that&#x27;s it.  Then I smell like B.O.</li>
            <li> The best all natural deodorant I&#x27;ve used to date. It smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my skin or clothing, and lasts all day. I can&#x27;t wait to try other scents.</li>
            <li> I have been looking and looking for a safe deodorant for both my health and my baby&#x27;s health while breastfeeding.  I was really excited to try this particular one, as I had read positive reviews.  I found that for me, a light sweater, with moderate body odor, it DOES work, but will not hold up when stressed or when I have to do a lot of walking/excessive movement.  If I am at home and in a temperature controlled area, it does seem to prevent body odor.  When I have a spike in activity or it is too hot outside I find that it is similar to using nothing.  The smell of the deodorant itself is kind of strong, but not quite unpleasant.  I am a bit sensitive to smells, and for me this one is borderline as to whether or not I enjoy the smell.  It is a powdery/soapy smelling deodorant with kind of like a too strong scented candle for linens or home smelling candles.  It is not a fresh light scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, I do like that it is a non toxic alternative and I will likely use it for when I am home.  However, for events or when I am working out, it sadly won&#x27;t cut it, and I will have to keep looking for the holy grail of natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> Best Vegan Deodorant I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> Sadly I won&#x27;t be ordering more as my skin doesn&#x27;t respond well. It smells delightful though!</li>
            <li> Works fine for everyday wear, but not really up to the task of deodorizing during a workout.</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant. It lasts long and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> My search is over! This is the only natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. I love the scent.</li>
            <li> It does the job better than most but I find when I have a quick break out sweat from running after a dog or something simple, it does not stop the odor.</li>
            <li> Love this!  I&#x27;d tried a different scent before and didn&#x27;t care for it but gave this one a chance and so glad I did!!</li>
            <li> Love the scent, but you definitely don&#x27;t stay dry, which is the case with all non-antiperspirent because your pores aren&#x27;t being blocked and allowed to breath.  I keep one with my toiletries and one in the car in case I need to reapply.</li>
            <li> This deodorant did not work at all well for me.</li>
            <li> It is Ok.  I like Pit Putty more</li>
            <li> It works great for me and has for months.  I&#x27;ve tried so many natural deodorants and this is the winner!</li>
            <li> If you are changing from a modern deodorant/antiperspirant don&#x27;t expect immediate results. I changed from drug store deodorants to natural this summer. It took about two weeks from my new deodorant to work. Maybe toxins leaving the body???...not sure. BUT since then I have no  problems with smelling BO&#x27;ish with natural deodorants and some talc powder (shower to shower). Someone said \\&quot;it doesn&#x27;t help with underarm wetness\\&quot; um DUH...it is a deodorant NOT an ANTIperspirant. The thing that so many of us are worried about is the amount of aluminum seeping into our bodies through antiperspirants.  I have used many natural deodorants and this is by far the best smelling, goes on very smooth and lasted all day and into the next morning before my shower. I recommend  this over Tom&#x27;s. HEY and if you are sweaty....try drinking more water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---since writing this review I have changed my choice to the original Johnson&amp;Johnson baby powder.  Works extremely well with the deodorant, much better at controlling the sweaty factor than Shower to Shower. Lasts all day through the next morning.</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first this works for me, I have to use regular and in between showers. I like knowing I am not putting aluminum zirconium under my pits near my mammary glands, hopefully, it will reduce my chance of getting breast cancer and Alzheimer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant - great coverage - smells yummy with no dangerous chemicals 😊</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an all natural deodorant that lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling like B.O. I have to admit that I have to apply it once in the morning and once in the afternoon, but the smell is is great!</li>
            <li> While the deodorant works and applies less cake-like than other solid deodorants, the scent is very powerful and strong but unpleasant and smells neither like grapefruit or vanilla or any combination thereof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it applies so nicely, and is all natural, I will try the other scents.  I&#x27;m also not quite sure if it is working, since eliminating dairy from my diet appears to have eliminated underarm sweat odor even when I&#x27;m not wearing any deodorant.  I&#x27;ll update if I do a trial of putting dairy back in my diet.</li>
            <li> This did not last very long. After I walked to work it needed reapplying and even with reapplying throughout the day, it wasn&#x27;t effective at covering up the stinky sweaty smell for me.</li>
    </ol>
