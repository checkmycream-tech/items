            <li>Love the smell!</li>
            <li>It will give you a headache if you put on too many places - like your forehead, temples &amp; throat.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I suspect they&#x27;re able to keep their prices lower since they&#x27;re not a multi-level marketing thing or whatever.  </li>
            <li>It was okay</li>
            <li>stuff  more and more.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>But I am feeling more energized.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>It has an elegant fragrance, arrived quickly</li>
            <li>Fabulous oil.</li>
            <li>After giving  Clary Sage a fair try with barely noticeable effects</li>
            <li>I was having warm flashes during the day and hot flashes at night beginning at 11 pm consistently.</li>
            <li>THis has a good fragrance, and I think that it is actually helping.</li>
            <li>I have friends who love Young Living Oils, so if you can afford them, go for it!</li>
            <li>I had zero  hot flashes and leg cramp/aches!  </li>
            <li>So i did order it first since it is much less costly and thought that would be great.  </li>
            <li>It is very pure and I was also amazed that while Young Living is out to supply its customers, Amazon still was able to supply the product.  </li>
            <li>and I sleep very well!</li>
            <li>my friend said i should try Edens Garden Clary Sage first since it also is for the endocrine system balance.  </li>
            <li>I slept marginally better the first night and by the third day/night</li>
            <li>Outstanding essential oil .</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>really like</li>
            <li>Works really well for my thyroid/adrenal issues.</li>
            <li>This did absolutely NOTHING for me.  </li>
            <li>but once I started using it, I was pleased to see that it is the same as the ones I order direct from the company.  </li>
            <li>i had to keep running outside to cool off  here and there during the daytime.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something more affordable, this has the same ingredients as Vitality by Heritage Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li>From the first night I saw a big difference!</li>
            <li>I was kinda surprised.  </li>
            <li>Was a Young Living product.</li>
            <li>My thyroid test came back normal!</li>
            <li>but i guess for me the Clary Sage is just not strong enough for me right now for my legs and hot flashes.  </li>
            <li>Not sure how well this really works for hot flashes.  </li>
            <li>EndoFlex is an essential oil that I have been using direct from Young Living.  </li>
            <li>I was unable to sleep for months due to hot flashes and night sweats, and this oil helped tremendously!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> Not sure how well this really works for hot flashes.  It will give you a headache if you put on too many places - like your forehead, temples &amp; throat.</li>
            <li> I have a prolactinoma (tumor in my pitutary glad) and have been struggling for a year with high doses of a medication, with horrible side effects, to get my levels to come down in the normal range. I have been using this product for a month and my levels have already dropped by half!</li>
            <li> I love it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and it&#x27;s helping me get off my thyroid medicine. I&#x27;ll definitely keep buying.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results with this but I am a big proponent of Essential OIls!</li>
            <li> I was actually advised to try it along with lemongrass and peppermint for Thyroid. It has an elegant fragrance, arrived quickly and I&#x27;m using it daily.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something more affordable, this has the same ingredients as Vitality by Heritage Essential Oils.  Just Google &amp;#34;Heritage Essential Oils&amp;#34; and you&#x27;ll find them.  They also have a formula specifically for the Thyroid.  I suspect they&#x27;re able to keep their prices lower since they&#x27;re not a multi-level marketing thing or whatever.  I think both are Christian companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have friends who love Young Living Oils, so if you can afford them, go for it!</li>
            <li> Fabulous oil. I use rub it into the skin over my adrenals, thyroid, pubic bone, around my ankles, and beneath my big toe. It&#x27;s helped even out my moods, improved/normalized my sleep patterns, increased energy levels, and reduced overall jitteriness.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any results with this one.</li>
            <li> THis has a good fragrance, and I think that it is actually helping.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Will be buying again. It has helped me get OFF of my levothyroxine. Its been 3.5 weeks and I&#x27;m finally feeling a bit like me again.... after all these years !</li>
            <li> For the price and size of this essential oil, I am disappointed as I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference or improvement in my thyroid.</li>
            <li> If you are having menopausal symptoms that are worsening over time, and you looked into HRT and decided it&#x27;s not for you, get this essential oil ASAP! I was unable to sleep for months due to hot flashes and night sweats, and this oil helped tremendously! I use it every night before bed and I sleep very well! It does not make the symptoms go away but it lessens them dramatically so that you can rest! From the first night I saw a big difference! I don&#x27;t rate products but I had to tell the world about EndoFlex...it works!</li>
            <li> It was recommended for my weak nails and I alr day see a difference.</li>
            <li> This is menopause heaven...a friend of mine introduced me to YL oils and i had used it for  over a year on my thyroid and around my ankles for hormone balance(and also was habitually dabbing some on adrenal areas too). Ran out and thought i could do without.  Could not figure out  why over the Christmas season that  i had to keep running outside to cool off  here and there during the daytime.  This died down a little bit for awhile when i tried to use progesterone cream for  some hormone balance.  It was okay but i was getting night time leg cramps or restless leg syndrome  stuff  more and more.  Enter the spring and  everything intensified. I was having warm flashes during the day and hot flashes at night beginning at 11 pm consistently. Then my legs would ache and throb and hurt sooo bad i thought there was something else wrong with me (besides arthritis which had never been like that before) I was getting a bit worried that there was some kind of circulation problem that would need some scary invasive procedure!  So i started googling and found out menopause can cause the extreme leg cramping restless stuff and i wondered if i should try the Endoflex again before i go to my doctor. Due to the price of YL oils my friend said i should try Edens Garden Clary Sage first since it also is for the endocrine system balance.  So i did order it first since it is much less costly and thought that would be great.  I do have other Edens Gardens oils which i do really like but i guess for me the Clary Sage is just not strong enough for me right now for my legs and hot flashes.  After giving  Clary Sage a fair try with barely noticeable effects i couldn&#x27;t wait to re order Endoflex.  I slept marginally better the first night and by the third day/night I had zero  hot flashes and leg cramp/aches!  I was kinda surprised.  Kinda not.  I also had been having weird weight gain that was concerning me as well.  So i expect this to at least even out a little also but will take some time. So for now I&#x27;m back to using Endoflex and very grateful  to YL for the blend without which i would still be really miserable!.

            <li> Love!! Seems to help my rapid heartbeat I get occasionally from perimenopause stuff. Love the spearmint smell!!!! Wish it wasn&#x27;t so costly...the only downside.</li>
            <li> Was a Young Living product. Love the smell! Works really well for my thyroid/adrenal issues. Can&#x27;t go wrong with Young Living!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now.  I have Hashimotos and all the awful things that go along with that condition - weight gain, dry skin, brittle hair and nails (hair falling out), etc.  This did absolutely NOTHING for me.  The only reason I gave it three stars is because my husband loves the scent on me.  I&#x27;ll keep using as a fragrance  until I run out and then have no plans to buy again.</li>
            <li> My thyroid test came back normal!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a short time. But I am feeling more energized.</li>
            <li> Outstanding essential oil . Great seller. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love the product. Noticed a difference in how I feel after one use.</li>
