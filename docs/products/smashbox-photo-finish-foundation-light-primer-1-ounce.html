            <li>Use it all the time, lovee love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It gives you a nice canvas to apply your foundation.</li>
            <li>The primer is very light and feel like almost nothing after you put it on,</li>
            <li>Brazilian consumer :)</li>
            <li>but i like this one a lot better.</li>
            <li>I love most of Smashbox products.</li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>I am not too big into products but this one is awesome.</li>
            <li>and I love Smash Box</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I love that this leaves your face feeling very soft and smooth and allows your makeup to go on with a near flawless appearance...</li>
            <li>Very wonderful for oily skin (better than original) and not too heavy</li>
            <li>but this works just fine</li>
            <li>this stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is the light</li>
            <li>Enjoy this product</li>
            <li>It helps my concealer go on smoothly and stay in place.  </li>
            <li>It makes me skin look Photoshopped and just perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve used so far - Makeup Forever, regular Smashbox, Mac, and Lancome.</li>
            <li>It is really light and dries quickly to a semi matte finish.</li>
            <li>my foundation goes on flawless and my face stays matte for at least 8 hours before some shine starts to show through.</li>
            <li>this is one of those makeup products i consider &amp;#34;holy grail.&amp;#34; no seriously, thats how much i love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would function as an under - foundation layer that makes the final surface as close to flawless as possible, but this seems to be a total product that, since it has some color to it, is not well suited to be used as a &amp;#34;pre&amp;#34; cosmetic, but is best used alone, which does not supply the coverage I had expected.</li>
            <li>This cream is very lightweight and applies smooth under make up.</li>
            <li>I have tried many but this one surprised me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of only two primers that works for me, and I love the silky feel</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found different brands that work much better at keeping my makeup in place.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it does.non greasy feel.</li>
            <li>it really helps prime my face and make my concealer go on easier!</li>
            <li>I have tried a couple different ones now and smashbox is my favorite.</li>
            <li>i love smashbox products, they really works and gives you a natural touch of glamour, very comfy and a reasonable price</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice substantial change</li>
            <li>I really like this primer.</li>
            <li>i used this with alone on a flight to hawaii and never got greasy the whole time</li>
            <li>but I will switch back to the oil free.</li>
            <li>Keeps my makeup in place and makes my face look fresh and supple (50yrs old).</li>
            <li>It does not need to be applied to the whole face, although it doesn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li>I really like this primer.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>setting spray really helps.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be more like the original photo finish primer which has a thicker, wax-like consistency but the light version really is much less heavy.</li>
            <li>And while there, it was so hot and humid but my makeup never felt like it was running or becoming a greasy mess.</li>
            <li>but my L&#x27;Oreal illuminating is better and half the cost</li>
            <li>I have used this primer for a few years and I love it.  </li>
            <li>but I can definitely tell a difference when I use the oil free primer which definitely kept my makeup looking fresher</li>
            <li>I prefer the clear</li>
            <li>I have sensitive acne prone skin</li>
            <li>But my skin is very oily, and even the &amp;#34;smashbox light&amp;#34; does not have the same effect, in my opinion, than the &amp;#34;prep</li>
            <li>I wanted tbe original slick one.</li>
            <li>I usually purchase the standard primer that is oil free and not the light.this primer works</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Best oily skin primer.  Not tacky or sticky or oily.  Does not break my skin like ALL other primers</li>

            <li> wonderul and i will order again and again and again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a well reviewed primer, hence the purchase but my L&#x27;Oreal illuminating is better and half the cost, don&#x27;t understand the hype</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it does.non greasy feel. I have tried many but this one surprised me.</li>
            <li> The best product I have in my makeup bag. It is a must have for everyone that uses makeup. Your makeup, will last longer throughout the day/night. Just reapply lipstick and you are good to go again.</li>
            <li> excellent delivery. amazing product, for my skin is perfect!!! I&#x27;m so addicted in it. is the best of all. Brazilian consumer :)</li>
            <li> I really like this primer. It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve used so far - Makeup Forever, regular Smashbox, Mac, and Lancome. It is really light and dries quickly to a semi matte finish. It gives you a nice canvas to apply your foundation. I have sensitive acne prone skin and it hasn&#x27;t aggravated it.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time, lovee love it!</li>
            <li> Great product. I use this over my moisturizer and under my foundation and it does help decrease the appearance of tiny wrinkles (no makeup &amp;#34;caked&amp;#34; in wrinkles look).</li>
            <li> This is a good product that provides what it claims - to a point. I was hoping it would function as an under - foundation layer that makes the final surface as close to flawless as possible, but this seems to be a total product that, since it has some color to it, is not well suited to be used as a &amp;#34;pre&amp;#34; cosmetic, but is best used alone, which does not supply the coverage I had expected.</li>

            <li> No complaints and have been using this for years.  It fills in all the lines and smoothes out my skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product  - makes a noticeable difference !</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and never been disappointed. Very wonderful for oily skin (better than original) and not too heavy</li>
            <li> this stuff is fantastic. it really helps prime my face and make my concealer go on easier! i tried a water based one once as well but i like this one a lot better.</li>
            <li> i purchased the wrong product but by the time i got ready to use it i was 1 day late to return it.I wanted tbe original slick one.</li>
            <li> Use this product before, is very good.</li>
            <li> I found a primer that is not oily and perfectly compliments my foundation.  My complexion looks flawless.</li>
            <li> this is one of those makeup products i consider &amp;#34;holy grail.&amp;#34; no seriously, thats how much i love this stuff. i use it over moisturizer then apply my foundation over this. my foundation goes on flawless and my face stays matte for at least 8 hours before some shine starts to show through. i used this with alone on a flight to hawaii and never got greasy the whole time (i am combo/oily skin type). And while there, it was so hot and humid but my makeup never felt like it was running or becoming a greasy mess. just wish this stuff wasn&#x27;t so expensive. however, i use half a pea sized amount and a little goes a long way. (side note- i use MK moisturizer and estee lauder double wear foundation)</li>
            <li> I love most of Smashbox products. I usually purchase the standard primer that is oil free and not the light.this primer works OK but I can definitely tell a difference when I use the oil free primer which definitely kept my makeup looking fresher longer.the light isn&#x27;t bad but I will switch back to the oil free.</li>
            <li> I love that this leaves your face feeling very soft and smooth and allows your makeup to go on with a near flawless appearance... however, I found a site that listed the ingredients of this (not on the bottle) and googled it only to find out it contains almost all the same ingredients found in Monistat Chafing Relief Gel. Upon further reading I read that several makeup artist use the Monistat the same way you use this product. So, for far less money (about 6 bucks) I&#x27;ll be buying the Monistat next time. The added bonus is that it can be purchased at WalMart.</li>
            <li> I am not too big into products but this one is awesome. Keeps my makeup in place and makes my face look fresh and supple (50yrs old). I have recommended it to my mother and daughters and they all like the results as well.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this by mistake. I thought it was the photo finish one. This is the light and I love Smash Box but this one didn&#x27;t do the same for me as the photo finish.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works Fablous♥, Works Fantastico on combination Skin!!!♥ Totally recomend it, although the price is kinda (chimichanga)..Enjoy this product</li>
            <li> I have used this primer for a few years and I love it.  It helps my concealer go on smoothly and stay in place.  It has never caused any acne problems or made my face feel overly greasy.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I don&#x27;t even put foundation on, and just put my moisturizers on below and then apply this on last. It makes me skin look Photoshopped and just perfectly smooth. A little also goes a long way. I would only apply on areas that you notice any enhanced wrinkles like I used to notice when I put on foundation. For me it was just my fore head and eye area. It does not need to be applied to the whole face, although it doesn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li> Ladies...this primer is the best thing out there....put it on and you don&#x27;t even see your wrinkles....LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this primer. I have tried a couple different ones now and smashbox is my favorite. I mix pea size with my moisturizer for a total effect.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it won the title of the best at Sephora. But my skin is very oily, and even the &amp;#34;smashbox light&amp;#34; does not have the same effect, in my opinion, than the &amp;#34;prep + prime skin base visage of Mac&amp;#34; (this is a very very excellent primer!)</li>
            <li> i love smashbox products, they really works and gives you a natural touch of glamour, very comfy and a reasonable price</li>
            <li> I bought this product after seeing couple videos recommending this product as primer to control oil. I have very oily skin. Combining this and a makeup setting spray really helps. The primer is very light and feel like almost nothing after you put it on,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I gave it four stars because I did not know what to expect and I guess I was searching for a miracle.</li>
