            <li>They don&#x27;t put a lot of botanical additives or fragrance which is nice.</li>
            <li>This face moisurizer is nice and creamy but absorbs well.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I am loving Dermalogica brand products.</li>
            <li>Comments are often made that my skin looks nice.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and break out very easily.</li>
            <li>but just didn&#x27;t feel like it went on very easily.</li>
            <li>Best price so far has been Amazon.com</li>
            <li>The perfect cream for my sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li>Best product of all the Dermalogica skin line (that I have tried) as far as I am concerned.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth, love how light it feels!!</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts or irritation and my skin just loves it.  </li>
            <li>Around eight years ago, I was struggling to find an appropriate moisturizer for my face, when I stumbled upon this one.  </li>
            <li>It was so perfect that I stuck with it and didn&#x27;t look back for 7.5 years.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and love it.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be running out, and my skin is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love the multi-active toner spray because it is a moisturizer that you can spray on without having to rub it in and get your fingers sticky with lotion</li>
            <li>Overall, a really good product !!!</li>
            <li>SSC is a top notch product and is for drier or premature aging skin.  </li>
            <li>It glides over your skin and is wonderful for the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mature female.</li>
            <li>and feel healthy and glowing all day.</li>
            <li>I really feels great going on and when it on.  </li>

            <li>Love Dermalogica.</li>
            <li>It can be costly and this company offered the most affordable pricing.</li>
            <li>I love Dermalogica products and have been using them for years.</li>
            <li>I have tried many moisturiser and none can compare to this.</li>
            <li>I love it and being using it for years</li>

            <li>but definitely love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>A great morning - night moisturizer, that&#x27;s got just the right moisture not to feel too greasy or too light.</li>
            <li>Decent price and great product.</li>
            <li>And wow, I thought Dermalogica Skin Smoothing Cream was good, but the CeraVe was even better!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it before buying it at amazon and it works perfectly on my a bit dry skin without making it greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I get excellent results and I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 57 yrs old and people tell me my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, great for my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the whole line!!!?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently been told that my skins looks great and it does feel very smooth.</li>
            <li>She read the ingredient list and said they should be fine (that product wasn&#x27;t the source of my eczema flare-ups)</li>
            <li>These products do not dry out my skin, but are great for keeping oil and acne to a minimum.</li>
            <li>This is a true spa line used by esteticians and great for in home use Some of my male friends even use it, and love it as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great fresh scent, goes on smooth and creamy, and amazing for my very dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>Not much to say except that I love Dermalogica products and have seen a great improvement in my skin using this.  </li>
            <li>If I could afford the larger bottles I definitely would purchase them, but not for the results; just for the way they made my skin feel during and after using them.&lt;br /&gt;Not perfect, but really nice to use, May 28, 2011&lt;br /&gt;By</li>
            <li>This cream has been fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great facial cream.</li>
            <li>This is the only moisturizer I&#x27;ll use - great product for sensitive skin and good price here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I use this product during the summer months because it is light and protects the skin from drying.</li>
            <li>For winter its too light</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and my face always feels hydrated without any residue.</li>
            <li>light moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Also, exfoliating your skin, prior to application will greatly increase getting the full benefit of the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The clay cleanser has a tingling feeling that leaves your face feeling clean.</li>
            <li>The product is wonderful and I recommend it to anyone especially if you have sensitive, combination skin like me.</li>
            <li>Perfect for normal to dry skin and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think its anything special.  </li>
            <li>I age, I am pleased to find this product and while it does not reverse the aging process, it certainly gives me the confidence to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite skin cream.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of dermalogica&#x27;s products and I do feel their products are simple and potent.</li>
            <li>I have become highly allergic to anything around my face since hitting middle age and this lotion works great.  </li>
            <li>this is my favorite face cream, it is very soft and moisturizing</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good moisturizer, only been using it at night as I have a moisturizer I really like and have been using for a while.</li>
            <li>After dealing with adult acne for a couple years, My skin has never felt better after using this line of products.</li>
            <li>Even at the morning my skin looks fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I bought it just as moisturizer and initially wasn&#x27;t very happy, because despite other Dermologica products, that one was outstanding, but the price is pretty high.</li>
            <li>However, product arrived right on time.  </li>
            <li>This is creamy and not greasy, with just the right amount of moisture for my skin.</li>
            <li>The right choice for my skin.</li>
            <li>Soaks right in...</li>
            <li>This product is great for sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I love Dermalogica and and have really enjoyed their products for dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve felt the difference from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>My skin felt refreshed, comfortable, and sooo soft and</li>
            <li>I love all the products in the oily skin kit, but especially the multi-active toner spray.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no telling how many products I have bought over the years only to use them once and then have to thow them away since they make me develop a rash across my face.  </li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Whoops, I meant to write for a period of 25 years; additionally, my skin always looks really smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>It smelled funny, despite the seal being unbroken.</li>
            <li>This has brought back a MUCH more youthful appearance to my skin.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Its the first moisturizer ive ever used that doesnt make my skin feel greasy, or burn...</li>
            <li>it gives such a nice smooth finish and is the only thing he finds that keeps his skin from peeling</li>
            <li>Suitable for dry skin</li>
            <li>However, purchasing it from the Amazon supplier may not have been the best thing only because the product may have been a little old.</li>
            <li>have tried so many products in the past, to only end up with so-so results and have never been truly in love with any one product- until I tried this!</li>
            <li>I have used this for a very long time &amp; love it.  </li>
            <li>Came on time, Exactly what i have expected from the product, and a realy good price, with short supply time.</li>
            <li>and I am very happy with the results (clear, smooth skin - less irritated and hardly any breakouts).</li>
            <li>and my skin stopped giving any oily shining, but is smooth and moisturized in the same time.</li>
            <li>I used the line for sensetive skin, and it really worked wonders.</li>
            <li>I feel like my skin has improved so much since I started using it.</li>
            <li>I used to have oily acne-prone skin and this moisturizer has really balanced out my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>NO irritating fragrance or color and very soothing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend  this!</li>
            <li>The product moisturizes really well</li>
            <li>It really hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this Dermalogica line of products.  </li>
            <li>I first bought the Age Smart Super Rich Repair because I have sensitive, dry skin and live in an arid climate.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, which I love, and it is unscented, which is even better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight yet quenches my dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is not to oily or to dry, just leaves my skin smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough to wear under make-up and thus far (I&#x27;ve been using this for over 2 months now) has not caused any breakouts.</li>
            <li>I am older so my skin has changed.  </li>
            <li>I received this kit from a friend of mine in England who is a estetician over there and highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tad high, as all Dermalogica products are.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li>I have been using this moisturizer since high school.....</li>
            <li>This stuff keeps my face so smooth through the dry winters where I live.</li>
            <li>It can calm my skin and moisture it at the same time.</li>
            <li>skin, so I pretty much have to moisturize my face on a daily basis, and not just any product will do.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worked with Dermalogica products for a few years now, and this is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>First week haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference than my regular (which is about 1/3 the cost)</li>
            <li>Good smell, not too heavy, and seems to help my dry skin.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s saying a lot when you live in a city like NYC.</li>
            <li>This stuff saves my face from getting super dry.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny, has been absolutely a staple of my skincare (sensitive, dry, end 40&#x27;s skin)</li>
            <li>Their ultracalming relief masque has also changed and many with sensitive skin that could tolerate it before now have trouble with stinging.</li>
            <li>Smoothing Cream great product  have been using the product for years,  I switched to another product recently because dermological is so expensive, but ending up going back because other product was not as effective.</li>
            <li>But unbelievably, I realized I lost my love for the Dermalogica when trying it after the CeraVe.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite regular creams when I think my face needs a break from serums and other products or for when my skin has taken some abuse.</li>
            <li>I love this- not too heavy and not too light...keeps me moisturized all day!</li>
            <li>I wish i bought the samples first before buying a big bottle of this, thinking it would work</li>
            <li>This one is lighter and it makes my face baby soft!</li>
            <li>This product is excellent and much less expensive when purchased from this supplier.</li>
            <li>I  live in an area where the climate is hot and dry and,</li>
            <li>and it makes my face really soft..</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised with this product as I&#x27;ve used the intensive moisturizer until now.  </li>
            <li>It works well with my sensitive, combination skin.  </li>
            <li>not greasy feeling but makes skin feel soo soft.</li>
            <li>A bit thick for summer, but still my favorite cream.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love that because it felt like it was so thick that it drags your skin when you try to apply it.  </li>
            <li>My face gets super dry, and I only have to use this twice a day..</li>
            <li>I would definitely suggest getting a professional recommendation if you have questions about your skin&#x27;s particular needs.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this at night for a few weeks now and have noticed a significant difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>For skin that can get in trouble with too rich a cream</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty hard for a calming masque to calm when it stings your skin.</li>
            <li>For fine lines around the eyes, age reversal eye complex was recommended to me.</li>
            <li>Not perfect, but really nice to use, May 28, 2011   </li>
            <li>like a babys behind. :)</li>
            <li>I am nearly 60 and live in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I had JUST bought two new 3.4oz tubes of the Dermalogica product before the switchover, so I asked my dermatologist on a follow-up appointment if it was okay to use them.  </li>
            <li>You served me well for so long, but I&#x27;m on to something new.</li>
            <li>Some people might find it expensive, especially for a trial/travel size, but it is worth it!!!</li>
            <li>I have eczema, and therefore dry -- and relatively sensitive --</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 22 yrs old and a beauty consultant at Ulta recommended I try this for my dry acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive and dry skin</li>
            <li>Have dry and sensitive skin..  </li>

            <li> Amazing!, January 27, 2009&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> In combination w/ the dermotologica pre-cleanser, cleanser and antioxidant mist, my skin looks amazing!</li>
            <li> and i love that it doesnt leave an oily residue on your face like cetaphil does...which makes it wonderful for make up application!</li>
            <li> No fragrance but still smells pleasant and does not have a chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> The oil control lotion does not leave your face feeling greasy but does a good job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This lotion is smooth and works great!  </li>
            <li> so good and refreshing on my face!</li>
            <li> My skin looks better and I fell great.</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product 425 years and have had wonderful consistent results.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it!  </li>

            <li> I use this twice a day and love it!</li>
            <li> Been a staple for my face regimen for many years!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The products are amazing to use.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  </li>
            <li> skin looks amazing when I use this and any Dermalogica product</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t put a lot of botanical additives or fragrance which is nice.</li>
            <li> This face moisurizer is nice and creamy but absorbs well.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am loving Dermalogica brand products.</li>
            <li> Comments are often made that my skin looks nice.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and break out very easily.</li>
            <li> but just didn&#x27;t feel like it went on very easily.</li>
            <li> Best price so far has been Amazon.com</li>
            <li> The perfect cream for my sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li> Best product of all the Dermalogica skin line (that I have tried) as far as I am concerned.  </li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth, love how light it feels!!</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts or irritation and my skin just loves it.  </li>
            <li> Around eight years ago, I was struggling to find an appropriate moisturizer for my face, when I stumbled upon this one.  </li>
            <li> It was so perfect that I stuck with it and didn&#x27;t look back for 7.5 years.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and love it.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be running out, and my skin is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love the multi-active toner spray because it is a moisturizer that you can spray on without having to rub it in and get your fingers sticky with lotion</li>
            <li> Overall, a really good product !!!</li>
            <li> SSC is a top notch product and is for drier or premature aging skin.  </li>
            <li> It glides over your skin and is wonderful for the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mature female.</li>
            <li> and feel healthy and glowing all day.</li>
            <li> I really feels great going on and when it on.  </li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer for years and still love it.</li>
            <li> In fact, my skin is smoother and more supple.</li>
            <li> best moisturiser I have used next to creme de lam ere.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love how it keeps my skin so healthy.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the line.  </li>
            <li> Definitely my favorite lotion out there.</li>
            <li> I Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> and I love the results.</li>
            <li> I am 54 and my face had started to change in appearance (more pores and a rougher appearance.)  </li>
            <li> Love Dermalogica.</li>
            <li> It can be costly and this company offered the most affordable pricing.</li>
            <li> I love Dermalogica products and have been using them for years.</li>
            <li> I have tried many moisturiser and none can compare to this.</li>
            <li> I love it and being using it for years</li>
            <li> and I love Amazon&#x27;s prices...</li>
            <li> love dermalogica products</li>
            <li> My favorite of the Dermalogica lotions.  </li>
            <li> Love dermalogica.</li>
            <li> but definitely love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> A great morning - night moisturizer, that&#x27;s got just the right moisture not to feel too greasy or too light.</li>
            <li> Decent price and great product.</li>
            <li> And wow, I thought Dermalogica Skin Smoothing Cream was good, but the CeraVe was even better!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it before buying it at amazon and it works perfectly on my a bit dry skin without making it greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I get excellent results and I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 57 yrs old and people tell me my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, great for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the whole line!!!?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently been told that my skins looks great and it does feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> She read the ingredient list and said they should be fine (that product wasn&#x27;t the source of my eczema flare-ups)</li>
            <li> These products do not dry out my skin, but are great for keeping oil and acne to a minimum.</li>
            <li> This is a true spa line used by esteticians and great for in home use Some of my male friends even use it, and love it as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great fresh scent, goes on smooth and creamy, and amazing for my very dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> Not much to say except that I love Dermalogica products and have seen a great improvement in my skin using this.  </li>
            <li> If I could afford the larger bottles I definitely would purchase them, but not for the results; just for the way they made my skin feel during and after using them.&lt;br /&gt;Not perfect, but really nice to use, May 28, 2011&lt;br /&gt;By</li>
            <li> This cream has been fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great facial cream.</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizer I&#x27;ll use - great product for sensitive skin and good price here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use this product during the summer months because it is light and protects the skin from drying.</li>
            <li> For winter its too light</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and my face always feels hydrated without any residue.</li>
            <li> light moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Also, exfoliating your skin, prior to application will greatly increase getting the full benefit of the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The clay cleanser has a tingling feeling that leaves your face feeling clean.</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful and I recommend it to anyone especially if you have sensitive, combination skin like me.</li>
            <li> Perfect for normal to dry skin and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think its anything special.  </li>
            <li> I age, I am pleased to find this product and while it does not reverse the aging process, it certainly gives me the confidence to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite skin cream.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of dermalogica&#x27;s products and I do feel their products are simple and potent.</li>
            <li> I have become highly allergic to anything around my face since hitting middle age and this lotion works great.  </li>
            <li> this is my favorite face cream, it is very soft and moisturizing</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer, only been using it at night as I have a moisturizer I really like and have been using for a while.</li>
            <li> After dealing with adult acne for a couple years, My skin has never felt better after using this line of products.</li>
            <li> Even at the morning my skin looks fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I bought it just as moisturizer and initially wasn&#x27;t very happy, because despite other Dermologica products, that one was outstanding, but the price is pretty high.</li>
            <li> However, product arrived right on time.  </li>
            <li> This is creamy and not greasy, with just the right amount of moisture for my skin.</li>
            <li> The right choice for my skin.</li>
            <li> Soaks right in...</li>
            <li> This product is great for sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I love Dermalogica and and have really enjoyed their products for dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve felt the difference from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> My skin felt refreshed, comfortable, and sooo soft and</li>
            <li> I love all the products in the oily skin kit, but especially the multi-active toner spray.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no telling how many products I have bought over the years only to use them once and then have to thow them away since they make me develop a rash across my face.  </li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> Whoops, I meant to write for a period of 25 years; additionally, my skin always looks really smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> It smelled funny, despite the seal being unbroken.</li>
            <li> This has brought back a MUCH more youthful appearance to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Its the first moisturizer ive ever used that doesnt make my skin feel greasy, or burn...</li>
            <li> it gives such a nice smooth finish and is the only thing he finds that keeps his skin from peeling</li>
            <li> Suitable for dry skin</li>
            <li> However, purchasing it from the Amazon supplier may not have been the best thing only because the product may have been a little old.</li>
            <li> have tried so many products in the past, to only end up with so-so results and have never been truly in love with any one product- until I tried this!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a very long time &amp; love it.  </li>
            <li> Came on time, Exactly what i have expected from the product, and a realy good price, with short supply time.</li>
            <li> and I am very happy with the results (clear, smooth skin - less irritated and hardly any breakouts).</li>
            <li> and my skin stopped giving any oily shining, but is smooth and moisturized in the same time.</li>
            <li> I used the line for sensetive skin, and it really worked wonders.</li>
            <li> I feel like my skin has improved so much since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I used to have oily acne-prone skin and this moisturizer has really balanced out my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> NO irritating fragrance or color and very soothing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend  this!</li>
            <li> The product moisturizes really well</li>
            <li> It really hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this Dermalogica line of products.  </li>
            <li> I first bought the Age Smart Super Rich Repair because I have sensitive, dry skin and live in an arid climate.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, which I love, and it is unscented, which is even better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight yet quenches my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is not to oily or to dry, just leaves my skin smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light enough to wear under make-up and thus far (I&#x27;ve been using this for over 2 months now) has not caused any breakouts.</li>
            <li> I am older so my skin has changed.  </li>
            <li> I received this kit from a friend of mine in England who is a estetician over there and highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad high, as all Dermalogica products are.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer since high school.....</li>
            <li> This stuff keeps my face so smooth through the dry winters where I live.</li>
            <li> It can calm my skin and moisture it at the same time.</li>
            <li> skin, so I pretty much have to moisturize my face on a daily basis, and not just any product will do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked with Dermalogica products for a few years now, and this is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> First week haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference than my regular (which is about 1/3 the cost)</li>
            <li> Good smell, not too heavy, and seems to help my dry skin.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s saying a lot when you live in a city like NYC.</li>
            <li> This stuff saves my face from getting super dry.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny, has been absolutely a staple of my skincare (sensitive, dry, end 40&#x27;s skin)</li>
            <li> Their ultracalming relief masque has also changed and many with sensitive skin that could tolerate it before now have trouble with stinging.</li>
            <li> Smoothing Cream great product  have been using the product for years,  I switched to another product recently because dermological is so expensive, but ending up going back because other product was not as effective.</li>
            <li> But unbelievably, I realized I lost my love for the Dermalogica when trying it after the CeraVe.  </li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite regular creams when I think my face needs a break from serums and other products or for when my skin has taken some abuse.</li>
            <li> I love this- not too heavy and not too light...keeps me moisturized all day!</li>
            <li> I wish i bought the samples first before buying a big bottle of this, thinking it would work</li>
            <li> This one is lighter and it makes my face baby soft!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and much less expensive when purchased from this supplier.</li>
            <li> I  live in an area where the climate is hot and dry and,</li>
            <li> and it makes my face really soft..</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised with this product as I&#x27;ve used the intensive moisturizer until now.  </li>
            <li> It works well with my sensitive, combination skin.  </li>
            <li> not greasy feeling but makes skin feel soo soft.</li>
            <li> A bit thick for summer, but still my favorite cream.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love that because it felt like it was so thick that it drags your skin when you try to apply it.  </li>
            <li> My face gets super dry, and I only have to use this twice a day..</li>
            <li> I would definitely suggest getting a professional recommendation if you have questions about your skin&#x27;s particular needs.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at night for a few weeks now and have noticed a significant difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> For skin that can get in trouble with too rich a cream</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty hard for a calming masque to calm when it stings your skin.</li>
            <li> For fine lines around the eyes, age reversal eye complex was recommended to me.</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but really nice to use, May 28, 2011   </li>
            <li> like a babys behind. :)</li>
            <li> I am nearly 60 and live in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had JUST bought two new 3.4oz tubes of the Dermalogica product before the switchover, so I asked my dermatologist on a follow-up appointment if it was okay to use them.  </li>
            <li> You served me well for so long, but I&#x27;m on to something new.</li>
            <li> Some people might find it expensive, especially for a trial/travel size, but it is worth it!!!</li>
            <li> I have eczema, and therefore dry -- and relatively sensitive --</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 yrs old and a beauty consultant at Ulta recommended I try this for my dry acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive and dry skin</li>
            <li> Have dry and sensitive skin..  </li>
            <li> It is highly moisturizing without being heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I have seen results in the texture of my skin and intend to continue using for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go back to any other brand.</li>
            <li> for some reason its always on the top of my lip! :(</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it!</li>
            <li> mostly dry..</li>
            <li> and I use it during winter months when my skin gets really dry.</li>
            <li> well.. I&#x27;ve also made some major diet changes too (flaxseed, fungal cleanse, raw veggies, no processed food)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but absolutely worth the price.</li>
            <li> It was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> It has a faint and pleasing scent, moisturizes the dry spots and doesn&#x27;t leave the more oily spots any worse.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so it&#x27;s quite cost-effective.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> although I&#x27;ve tried other moisturizers, I always return to this product.</li>
            <li> Does what it says and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I like to switch between this product and active moist.</li>
            <li> Active moist for the summer or warmer weather, and the skin smoothing cream for the winter.</li>
            <li> Very little is needed, so it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> In fact, I would have given it five stars just half a year ago.  </li>
            <li> and I feel my skin has less impurities or breakouts.</li>
            <li> But a few months ago, I went to the dermatologist for some eczema flare-ups, and she recommended that I try CeraVe Moisturizing Cream instead, just until we could sort out the issues.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and does not make me greasy.</li>
            <li> The ingredient list for the skin smoothng cream is not accurate on Amazon and not even dermalogica&#x27;s website has the updated ingredient list (they have a disclaimer saying it might not be up to date).</li>
            <li> And I couldn&#x27;t say a bad thing about it, aside from the hefty price value (which I was willing to suck up if it</li>
            <li> Given that a 3.4oz tube of the Dermalogica product is like four times the cost of a 16oz tub of the CeraVe product (that&#x27;s like SIXTEEN TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE!!!)</li>
            <li> The tube usually lasts me 6 to 8 months.</li>
            <li> I usually use cetaphil moisturizing cream, but it cetaphil didnt do anything for my skin texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this now as a staple for at least 5 years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive, shop around.</li>
            <li> Had to pay for shipping which was a little expensive.  </li>
            <li> i get really bad dry skin on my face, neck and chin area... and</li>
            <li> Sorry, Dermalogica.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just really expensive.  </li>
            <li> Crazy.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Always a great product</li>
            <li> Good smell, not too heavy, and seems to help my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought it just as moisturizer and initially wasn&#x27;t very happy, because despite other Dermologica products, that one was outstanding, but the price is pretty high. But now I&#x27;musingit for 2 months two timesa day and my skin stopped giving any oily shining, but is smooth and moisturized in the same time. So now I definitely fill like keep using it.</li>
            <li> I have eczema, and therefore dry -- and relatively sensitive -- skin, so I pretty much have to moisturize my face on a daily basis, and not just any product will do.  Around eight years ago, I was struggling to find an appropriate moisturizer for my face, when I stumbled upon this one.  It was so perfect that I stuck with it and didn&#x27;t look back for 7.5 years.  And I couldn&#x27;t say a bad thing about it, aside from the hefty price value (which I was willing to suck up if it that&#x27;s what my skin needed).  In fact, I would have given it five stars just half a year ago.  But a few months ago, I went to the dermatologist for some eczema flare-ups, and she recommended that I try CeraVe Moisturizing Cream instead, just until we could sort out the issues.  And wow, I thought Dermalogica Skin Smoothing Cream was good, but the CeraVe was even better!  My skin just drinks up that CeraVe and feels so hydrated when using it.  Unfortunately, I had JUST bought two new 3.4oz tubes of the Dermalogica product before the switchover, so I asked my dermatologist on a follow-up appointment if it was okay to use them.  She read the ingredient list and said they should be fine (that product wasn&#x27;t the source of my eczema flare-ups), so I figured I&#x27;d finish them off before converting...  But unbelievably, I realized I lost my love for the Dermalogica when trying it after the CeraVe.  It just doesn&#x27;t compare!  So much so that I have these two tubes of $60 Dermalogica Skin Smoothing Cream which may just go to waste.  Crazy.  Given that a 3.4oz tube of the Dermalogica product is like four times the cost of a 16oz tub of the CeraVe product (that&#x27;s like SIXTEEN TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE!!!) AND the fact that the CeraVe trumps the Dermalogica (in my opinion), not to mention the fact that the CeraVe comes recommended by my dermatologist, I&#x27;m afraid I am an official convert.  Sorry, Dermalogica.  You served me well for so long, but I&#x27;m on to something new.</li>
            <li> I like to switch between this product and active moist. Active moist for the summer or warmer weather, and the skin smoothing cream for the winter. This stuff keeps my face so smooth through the dry winters where I live. I won&#x27;t go back to any other brand. This stuff saves my face from getting super dry. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and love it.  The smoothing cream gives my face a youthful look.  I use it after each facial cleansing.</li>
            <li> Amazing!, January 27, 2009&lt;br /&gt;This review is from: Dermalogica Skin Care Essentials Kit (Misc.)&lt;br /&gt;By The Dictator \\&quot;Miss Kimberly\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many products in the past, to only end up with so-so results and have never been truly in love with any one product- until I tried this! Some people might find it expensive, especially for a trial/travel size, but it is worth it!!! I&#x27;ve had mine for 2 weeks and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be running out, and my skin is fantastic! I&#x27;ve felt the difference from the first time I used it. My skin felt refreshed, comfortable, and sooo soft and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;Finally a line I can stick with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love these products!, November 17, 2008&lt;br /&gt;This review is from: Dermalogica Skin Kit, Oily Skin Conditions, 1 kit (Health and Beauty)&lt;br /&gt;By . Megs828&lt;br /&gt;Dermalogica makes a great line of products. I love all the products in the oily skin kit, but especially the multi-active toner spray. These products do not dry out my skin, but are great for keeping oil and acne to a minimum. The clay cleanser has a tingling feeling that leaves your face feeling clean. The skin prep scrub is one of the best exfoliaters I have tried. The oil control lotion does not leave your face feeling greasy but does a good job of moisturizing. I love the multi-active toner spray because it is a moisturizer that you can spray on without having to rub it in and get your fingers sticky with lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dermalogica is wonderful, and this kit is no exception. I received this kit from a friend of mine in England who is a estetician over there and highly recommended it. I used the line for sensetive skin, and it really worked wonders. They don&#x27;t put a lot of botanical additives or fragrance which is nice. This is a true spa line used by esteticians and great for in home use Some of my male friends even use it, and love it as well.&lt;br /&gt;The products are amazing to use. If I could afford the larger bottles I definitely would purchase them, but not for the results; just for the way they made my skin feel during and after using them.&lt;br /&gt;Not perfect, but really nice to use, May 28, 2011&lt;br /&gt;By&lt;br /&gt;Sarah Graff (Norfolk, VA, USA)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a really good product !!!during and after using them.   Not perfect, but really nice to use, May 28, 2011   By   Sarah Graff (Norfolk, VA, USA)  Overall, a really good product !!!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is worth the price. I feel like my skin has improved so much since I started using it. I used to have oily acne-prone skin and this moisturizer has really balanced out my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this now as a staple for at least 5 years.  Worth every penny, has been absolutely a staple of my skincare (sensitive, dry, end 40&#x27;s skin)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 yrs old and a beauty consultant at Ulta recommended I try this for my dry acne prone skin.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and I don&#x27;t think its anything special.  It&#x27;s just really expensive.  I can get a similar product using Purpose&#x27;s SPF moisturizer at  CVS.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite skin cream. Great fresh scent, goes on smooth and creamy, and amazing for my very dry winter skin. A bit thick for summer, but still my favorite cream. Don&#x27;t go outside in winter months without it. It&#x27;s expensive, but absolutely worth the price.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion! Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and does not make me greasy. It&#x27;s my go to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this moisturizer. It&#x27;s a tad high, as all Dermalogica products are. This face moisurizer is nice and creamy but absorbs well. For fine lines around the eyes, age reversal eye complex was recommended to me. SSC is a top notch product and is for drier or premature aging skin.  The ingredient list for the skin smoothng cream is not accurate on Amazon and not even dermalogica&#x27;s website has the updated ingredient list (they have a disclaimer saying it might not be up to date). It is about double the amount of ingredients and butylene glycol is now the second ingredient. According to my esthetician, this isn&#x27;t the only product that has changed. Their ultracalming relief masque has also changed and many with sensitive skin that could tolerate it before now have trouble with stinging. It&#x27;s pretty hard for a calming masque to calm when it stings your skin. Anyway, I love Dermalogica and and have really enjoyed their products for dry and sensitive skin. I just hope they don&#x27;t start changing the products I have used for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked with Dermalogica products for a few years now, and this is one of my favorite products. Very nice texture, great smell, and soaks in very nicely. A great morning - night moisturizer, that&#x27;s got just the right moisture not to feel too greasy or too light. Also, exfoliating your skin, prior to application will greatly increase getting the full benefit of the moisturizer. Good luck!</li>
            <li> This skin care product refines your facial skin and gives you a youthful glow. It glides over your skin and is wonderful for the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mature female. Recommended by a skin specialist, it is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product for daytime lift with or without my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I age, I am pleased to find this product and while it does not reverse the aging process, it certainly gives me the confidence to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;look and feel healthy and glowing all day.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice moisturizer. I&#x27;ve now been using the whole Dermologica line for a few months and I see a difference in the appearance and feel of my skin! Even my husband noticed.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  I really feels great going on and when it on.  No fragrance but still smells pleasant and does not have a chemical smell.  I use it nightly.  It&#x27;s a little expensive, shop around. Best price so far has been Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer for years and still love it. NO irritating fragrance or color and very soothing. I continue to buy and just use sparingly. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Skin Smoothing Cream for 2 weeks and it works well on me. My skin looks better and I fell great. Thank you Dermalogica.</li>
            <li> I have become highly allergic to anything around my face since hitting middle age and this lotion works great.  There&#x27;s no telling how many products I have bought over the years only to use them once and then have to thow them away since they make me develop a rash across my face.  This lotion has actually prevented my flare-ups and keeps them at bay by acting as a protective barrier on my face.  I use it under my makeup during the week or w/o makeup on the weekends.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and break out very easily. This cream has been fantastic. It has a faint and pleasing scent, moisturizes the dry spots and doesn&#x27;t leave the more oily spots any worse. I use it in the morning and night. It&#x27;s light enough to wear under make-up and thus far (I&#x27;ve been using this for over 2 months now) has not caused any breakouts. In fact, my skin is smoother and more supple. I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> Great facial cream. I have sensitive and dry skin and this works wonders.</li>
            <li> Actually bought this on accident. It&#x27;s a good moisturizer, only been using it at night as I have a moisturizer I really like and have been using for a while. May post update if I see a difference over the next couple weeks. First week haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference than my regular (which is about 1/3 the cost)</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizer I&#x27;ll use - great product for sensitive skin and good price here on Amazon. thanks!</li>
            <li> best moisturiser I have used next to creme de lam ere.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s light weight yet quenches my dry skin. In combination w/ the dermotologica pre-cleanser, cleanser and antioxidant mist, my skin looks amazing! It literally feels like a baby&#x27;s butt! And I never get break outs. That&#x27;s saying a lot when you live in a city like NYC. Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> this is my favorite face cream, it is very soft and moisturizing my face looks younger when i use it</li>
            <li> have been using this product for years.  Love how it keeps my skin so healthy.  Pricing was excellent.  Had to pay for shipping which was a little expensive.  However, product arrived right on time.  No problems.  Would order again.</li>
            <li> Use this product all the time.  I am older so my skin has changed.  This is not to oily or to dry, just leaves my skin smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> This is a great cream. I&#x27;ve tried it before buying it at amazon and it works perfectly on my a bit dry skin without making it greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using dermalogica for over a year... I absolutely love the line.  This is a wonderful moisturizer!  In the winter I do use the moisture booster with it! Would highly recommend  this!</li>
            <li> Not much to say except that I love Dermalogica products and have seen a great improvement in my skin using this.  Have gotten lots of compliments..I&#x27;m 57 yrs old and people tell me my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product 425 years and have had wonderful consistent results. Whoops, I meant to write for a period of 25 years; additionally, my skin always looks really smooth and clear. I&#x27;ve had no problems since switching to Dermalogica products. A little bit goes a long way, so it&#x27;s quite cost-effective. The tube usually lasts me 6 to 8 months.</li>
            <li> i have horrible eczema, and during the winter time.. its at its peak! i get really bad dry skin on my face, neck and chin area... and for some reason its always on the top of my lip! :( I usually use cetaphil moisturizing cream, but it cetaphil didnt do anything for my skin texture. it just keeps it moist.. I started using this cream only two weeks ago, and I already see a drastic change in the texture of my skin! well.. I&#x27;ve also made some major diet changes too (flaxseed, fungal cleanse, raw veggies, no processed food) but this cream does what it says it does. SMOOTHS out the SKIN TEXTURE. and i love that it doesnt leave an oily residue on your face like cetaphil does...which makes it wonderful for make up application! My face gets super dry, and I only have to use this twice a day.. and it makes my face really soft..like a babys behind. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the skin smoothing cream for several years. It works great. It&#x27;s a great value for a great product!</li>
            <li> After dealing with adult acne for a couple years, My skin has never felt better after using this line of products. I especially love the skin smoothing cream. I&#x27;ll never go back to anything else!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dermalogica Skin Smoothing Cream for years and it is a wonderful product.  I  live in an area where the climate is hot and dry and, although I&#x27;ve tried other moisturizers, I always return to this product.</li>
            <li> Very little is needed, so it goes a long way. My skin is aging and used to be oily, it still is oily in some places but mostly dry.. This is creamy and not greasy, with just the right amount of moisture for my skin.</li>
            <li> The product moisturizes really well and I use it during winter months when my skin gets really dry. However, purchasing it from the Amazon supplier may not have been the best thing only because the product may have been a little old. It smelled funny, despite the seal being unbroken.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price. Have been using it on my face for years. Definitely my favorite lotion out there.</li>
            <li> I Love this product. I also buy the face wash scrub together with this. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.  Again amazon price is the best around and the best part is you have it delivered right to your door without running around.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a very long time &amp; love it.  It goes on very smooth, love how light it feels!!</li>
            <li> Dermalogica is AMAZING!!! I love the whole line!!!?</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else but Dermalogica skin smoothing cream.  Perfect for normal to dry skin and not greasy at all.  I can&#x27;t recommend enough.</li>
            <li> The right choice for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer since I had gotten a facial and Dermalogica products were used.  It&#x27;s been over 10 years and I love the results.</li>
            <li> This is a go to cream for layering over serums for me, a night cream on occasion and I even use it on my hands, arms, nails at night before going to bed. I love the smell of dermalogica&#x27;s products and I do feel their products are simple and potent. This is one of my favorite regular creams when I think my face needs a break from serums and other products or for when my skin has taken some abuse.</li>
            <li> This lotion is smooth and works great!  It&#x27;s not greasy at all.  I apply this lotion every morning and see great results.</li>
            <li> The perfect cream for my sensitive combination skin. Having used it for about 6 months now and I feel my skin has less impurities or breakouts. I personally combine it with the Dermalogica UltraCalming Cleanser and I am very happy with the results (clear, smooth skin - less irritated and hardly any breakouts).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at night for a few weeks now and have noticed a significant difference in the texture of my skin. I would recommend this product to anyone as part of their daily regimen.</li>
            <li> Best product of all the Dermalogica skin line (that I have tried) as far as I am concerned.  Totally smoothed my face!  I am 54 and my face had started to change in appearance (more pores and a rougher appearance.)  This has brought back a MUCH more youthful appearance to my skin.  I LOVE it!  Seriously!!!</li>
            <li> Love Dermalogica. It can be costly and this company offered the most affordable pricing. The product is wonderful and I recommend it to anyone especially if you have sensitive, combination skin like me.</li>
            <li> so good and refreshing on my face!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 3 years and absolutely happy with it.  I use it just once a week. I have seen results in the texture of my skin and intend to continue using for a long time.  Another great product from Dermalogica.</li>
            <li> I use this twice daily along with my medibac dermalogica line. It really hydrates my skin. Been using this for yrs now and it is great!</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer since high school.....it&#x27;s been many years! I love this- not too heavy and not too light...keeps me moisturized all day!</li>
            <li> I use this product during the summer months because it is light and protects the skin from drying. I love Dermalogica products and have been using them for years.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and much less expensive when purchased from this supplier. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I like the way this feels, it&#x27;s not greasy at all. Just wish it had an SPF.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Thank you</li>
            <li> Great for summer moisturizer.. For winter its too light</li>
            <li> I really like this Dermalogica line of products.  I&#x27;ve used this cream for years.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it!</li>
            <li> Came on time, Exactly what i have expected from the product, and a realy good price, with short supply time. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, great for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried many moisturiser and none can compare to this. This product is great for sensitive and dry skin. No irritation, no redness, no itchiness after using. It can calm my skin and moisture it at the same time.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day and love it! I&#x27;ve recently been told that my skins looks great and it does feel very smooth. The dermalogica line is the best! Combine it with the Clairisonic and your skin will look and feel great.</li>
            <li> great product, have used this item before.</li>
            <li> I like this cream , especially if I use it with overnight repair serum for night time. Even at the morning my skin looks fresh and moisturized. And I also use it at the morning.</li>
            <li> I first bought the Age Smart Super Rich Repair because I have sensitive, dry skin and live in an arid climate.  I didn&#x27;t love that because it felt like it was so thick that it drags your skin when you try to apply it.  I used it until it was gone but just didn&#x27;t feel like it went on very easily. I just now bought the Skin Smoothing Cream and am VERY pleased. It goes on very smooth, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts or irritation and my skin just loves it.  I think I finally found my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Its the first moisturizer ive ever used that doesnt make my skin feel greasy, or burn... Ive ordered this several times already and plan to continue use!</li>
            <li> Suitable for dry skin but if combination skin, use only at night.</li>
            <li> I wish i bought the samples first before buying a big bottle of this, thinking it would work and it didnt...but after buying a box of the Oil Control samples, it worked, so i ended up throwing this away :(</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer for over five years and recommend it enthusiastically. It is highly moisturizing without being heavy or greasy. My skin feels happier the moment I apply Skin Smoothing Cream, especially in the winder.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and great under makeup. I Use a heavier moisturizer at bedtime and the combo works well for me. I am nearly 60 and live in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised with this product as I&#x27;ve used the intensive moisturizer until now.  I don&#x27;t feel I comprised by buying this product instead of the more expensive &amp;#34;intense&amp;#34; choice.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years.</li>
            <li> The best face cream out there!! I love it and being using it for years&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks amazing when I use this and any Dermalogica product</li>
            <li> Use it every day.......great product.</li>
            <li> Been a staple for my face regimen for many years! Goes on smooth and my face always feels hydrated without any residue.</li>
            <li> Dermalogical Skin  Smoothing Cream great product  have been using the product for years,  I switched to another product recently because dermological is so expensive, but ending up going back because other product was not as effective.</li>
            <li> For skin that can get in trouble with too rich a cream this is great. And it does make your skin feel smoother. A great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.... light moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Box did not contain the authenticity seal :(</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for 6 months..Have dry and sensitive skin..  Soaks right in...I can already see a difference and I love Amazon&#x27;s prices...</li>
            <li> It was just what I expected. I&#x27;ve used it before and that&#x27;s why I reordered it. It arrived in the required time. I use it every morning when I&#x27;m not going to be out in the sun at which time I always use the dermalogica 30 SPF dynamic skin recovery. A little goes a long way and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I would definitely suggest getting a professional recommendation if you have questions about your skin&#x27;s particular needs.&lt;br /&gt;This is a medium bodied moisturizer. I get excellent results and I have very dry skin. I am in my mid 40&#x27;s and always get carded for alcohol... &#x27;nuf said!</li>
            <li> I switch between the skin smoothing and intensive moisture balance.This one is lighter and it makes my face baby soft!</li>
            <li> this is my third tube. love dermalogica products</li>
            <li> My favorite of the Dermalogica lotions.  Does what it says and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied both with the product and the deliverytime.</li>
            <li> Excellent results for the face year after year.</li>
            <li> I am loving Dermalogica brand products. This moisturizer is so great. A little goes a long way, which I love, and it is unscented, which is even better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and use this to moisturize before bed.  It works well with my sensitive, combination skin.  Decent price and great product.</li>
            <li> Love dermalogica. pricey brand but definitely love this moisturizer. not greasy feeling but makes skin feel soo soft. will continue to buy</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer. It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin! It actually makes my skin smoother, and hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> Dermalogica is an awesome product I have been using for over 25 years.  Comments are often made that my skin looks nice.</li>
            <li> Both my boyfriend &amp; I use this it gives such a nice smooth finish and is the only thing he finds that keeps his skin from peeling</li>
