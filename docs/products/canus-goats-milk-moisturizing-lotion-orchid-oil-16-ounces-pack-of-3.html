    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It is an excellent product and we like the pump bottles.</li>
            <li>Canus is a wonderful product, I ran out of the lotion</li>
            <li>Buying it by the case is a great deal.</li>
            <li>lotion is great.  </li>
            <li>So, I tried the Orchid Oil version and, it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li>It was a lot of product for an amazing price!  </li>
            <li>Non greasy and a good lotion</li>
            <li>It does a good job moisturizing, too.</li>
            <li>Loved this product.</li>
            <li>but honestly I prefer the marigold oil lotion.</li>
            <li>The scent is one that most will find pleasing</li>
            <li>I gave a bottle of this lotion to my mother-in-law four years ago for Christmas and it has become her favorite.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy and I love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>Discovered this product about 5 years ago and love it.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance free lotion is perfect for anyone sensitive to odor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced better goat milk products, this one is decent though.</li>
            <li>I love Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Moisturizing Lotion for its non-greasy, effective, quick moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li>The orchid oil is perfect for me -  Non greasy, soaks in quickly and leaves skin soft and protected for hours.</li>
            <li>But it still works great on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My favorite body lotion--fast absorbing and effective with a nice, light scent.  </li>
            <li>It keeps your skin smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>This really does smell good &amp; the scent isn&#x27;t strong either.</li>
            <li>I love it so very much!</li>
            <li>It is worth the effort to reapply more often.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and the fragrance is light, not obtrusive.  </li>
            <li>It is rich yet does not clog my pores.</li>
            <li>Used to buy the 32 oz twin pack, but evidently Amazon doesn&#x27;t offer it any more.</li>
            <li>I still prefer the clean, soap-like scent of the original, but...</li>
            <li>The lotion is smooth going on and absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I find this scent too sweet.</li>
            <li>Is  so very mosturazing cream and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky,  I just love it</li>
            <li>We used this for many month; however, it is becoming harder to find or is increasing in cost so were are looking for alternatives that work as well.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, love that it sinks right in and does not leave a greasy residue, yet it leaves the skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Better yet, the price is a couple of dollars cheaper than at my local store.</li>
            <li>This lotion is pure luxury.  </li>
            <li>I really really recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>As long as this product is available I will use it.  </li>

            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It really does go right into the skin, doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Helps with my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh subtle fragrance, goes on smoothly, and does not leave a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>Great product, moisturizers my skin well during cold months</li>
            <li>I ordered this product for my 80 year old mother who loves it as she has skin allergies.  </li>
            <li>I was unable to find it locally, but was glad to see it and the accompanying bar soap available through Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and after using this lotion for only a couple of days, my skin was noticeably hydrated and much smoother.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced better goat milk products, this one is decent though. I&#x27;d had to add alittle johoba oil for a smoother application.</li>
