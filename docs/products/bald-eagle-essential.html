            <li>I have used it several times and the battery life has been excellent!  </li>
            <li>I absolutley love this shaver..  </li>
            <li>A grand 45 seconds of battery life.</li>
            <li>Outstanding beard and head shaver....</li>
            <li>The results are better than any clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>After wearing out yet another set of $50 replacement blades I decided to google to see if a better head shaver had emerged instead of buying more 3 blades replacements.</li>
            <li>Well, I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is outstanding.</li>
            <li>It feels more substantial.  </li>
            <li>The single-touch ON/OFF button also feels more refined than the two-stage &amp;#34;click-Click&amp;#34</li>
            <li>After years of struggling with maintaining my bald hair within the week, I finally found this product as the best for the job.</li>
            <li>My husband was in love with this shaver.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>very handy when gauging how much use I might have before recharging.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Bald Eagle Essential and LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to maintain my shaved head much more consistently and save time doing it!</li>
            <li>But after some practice, I am able to get a very smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Great product for keeping us follicle challenged guys looking crisp, clean, and dare I say, trendy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was super happy with my Bald Eagle Pro when I first got it - way better than what I had been using.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>In addition to being easy to use, it also is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It is oodles more powerful, spins FASTER, and it SOUNDS more refined.  </li>
            <li>He can&#x27;t believe how easy it is to use .</li>
            <li>Seen to be a excellent device I used it on my head and mustache, cut it very low and smooth no irritation right now .</li>
            <li>so no matter how good this shaver is, don&#x27;t get rid of your old one if you can use while its charging!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not baby butt smooth like a blade, yet, but I feel I will be over time.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>They must have filled the palm grip with batteries -- I have  had this for about 6 weeks</li>
            <li>I had  Norelco that wasnt cheap at al</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I am a long time user of the original Skull Shaver, and this review will share my experiences with the original Skull Shaver, and the incredible BALD EAGLE head shaver that has replaced it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good, i have used it twice.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use without any cuts, scrapes, or burns.</li>
            <li>I had doubts because it was too good to be true, and I have very sensitive skin mild eczema.</li>
            <li>Although this is advertised as a wet/dry shaver (using shaving lotion, NOT IN THE SHOWER), I primarily use it as a dry shaver, and am happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>This was truly worth every penny!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The SS (Skull Shaver), in its original design, is everything that a head shaver should be.  </li>
            <li>; button on the original SS.  </li>
            <li>The product gets the job done and it does a clean job.</li>
            <li>The SS&#x27;s original claim was 30 minutes of use on a full charge.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal Holyfield its all that it says and more.</li>
            <li>The Bald Eagle does a good job adapting to the various surfaces of the skull/scalp.</li>
            <li>I would often use the SS for a quick &amp;#34;touch</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I was hooked,  it took me about six minutes to shave my head with ease!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>This soap lube will get you a head shave pretty darn close to the razor shave!</li>
            <li>I love the easy clean rinsing system which is so much easier than my prior shavers.</li>
            <li>He finds it to be far better than what he was using before.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, does a fantastic job, very quick(I can shave my head in less than 5 minutes) and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>This takes about 10-12 mins if that, it works really well for a quick shave a hair cut...</li>
            <li>The first one lasted 6 months before it quit.  </li>
            <li>After 3 months and EIGHT (8) follow ups, they finally replaced it under warranty.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!!  </li>
            <li>At first I could restart it by hitting the power button.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says but with ease.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for over a week and have not had to charge it since the first charge.</li>
            <li>But the thing I like most is that people at work are asking me how I get such a close shave on my head...</li>
            <li>real bummer!</li>
            <li>Bald Eagle Essential feels much more like a high-end shaver than its predecessor.  </li>
            <li>Well needless to say I was impressed, the cut came closer than my wahl electric clippers ever did.</li>
            <li>I did have to make a warranty claim as the battery had some issues at first</li>
            <li>Thanks Skull Shaver for improving my quality of life!</li>
            <li>This simplifies things to an easy, reliable daily routine.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to all looking for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Fast with a refund.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking this shaver a lot.</li>
            <li>its the best you will not be disappointment with, unless your not using it right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks skull shaver for helping my man stay groomed</li>
            <li>but this is fast n painless</li>
            <li>, the problem with the head popping off seems to be happening more frequent now and its not snapping back on like it use to.</li>
            <li>With the Bald Eagle, should you choose to ignore the convenient battery indicator and run out of power, it only takes 3 or 4 hours for a full charge.</li>
            <li>I use an old tuna can to submerge the head (HEAD ONLY) of the shaver in luke-warm water, running it for 5-10 seconds to clean out all the stubble.  </li>
            <li>This sucks because I actually liked it.</li>
            <li>Not as smooth as my foil, but shaves fast, less  than 1/2 the time.</li>
            <li>, so I bought this new one and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li>Save your money, low quality had two units that will not accept charge after first use.</li>
            <li>The first one I had finally bit the dust</li>
            <li>the one thing I would like to mention is that you must keep the shaver flat on the surface of your head, the first time I use it one of the heads poped off, I thought it was broke, but it just snap back on and now that I know how to keep it flat on my head its fine.</li>
            <li>It did not shave my head down perfectly smooth like a razor would, but it was a lot faster and easier to use.  </li>
            <li>I think the next version they come out with will really change that game, but for now I am satisfied!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t hurt at all and did not leave my skin feeling raw.</li>
            <li>I also found it takes less time to shave and is easier to clean.</li>
            <li>The LED lights are very helpful to know the renaming battery life left.</li>
            <li>My old shaver works while its plug in so I keep it around...</li>
            <li>I got the essential version not wanting to sink too much money into a product I didn&#x27;t expect to work.</li>
            <li>Good shave extremely poor quality!</li>
            <li>On a full charge it will run for about 5 minutes tops and then completely shuts down.</li>
            <li>The heads are a little noisy and they don&#x27;t last quite as long, but at $16 for a replacement, that is ok!</li>
            <li>The original nickel-cadmium batteries were a little undersized for the duty, and needed replacing.  </li>
            <li>The BE is slightly heavier than the SS, by a full ounce.  </li>
            <li>He had tried many different ones in the past and nothing worked to his liking until we found this one.</li>
            <li>I am planning to buy one for my father-in-law for his next birthday and would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>It came almost fully charged, and I let it for a few hours to bring it to a full charge.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen reviews stating that the Bald Eagle doesn&#x27;t shave a close as other products, which I was concerned with at first.</li>
            <li>Not as close as a blade razor, but that was not expected.  </li>
            <li>I have THICK hair, which the BE makes quick work of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only other criticisms of the SS is that its motor could run a little faster, and it felt underpowered at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a series of emails with SkullShaver (as my original SS was still under warranty), I received the BALD EAGLE ESSENTIAL, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li>But my main issue with this thing is that the lights that tell you its charged don&#x27;t go out 1 by 1, to let you know its dying down...</li>

            <li> Seen to be a excellent device I used it on my head and mustache, cut it very low and smooth no irritation right now .</li>
            <li> so no matter how good this shaver is, don&#x27;t get rid of your old one if you can use while its charging!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not baby butt smooth like a blade, yet, but I feel I will be over time.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> They must have filled the palm grip with batteries -- I have  had this for about 6 weeks</li>
            <li> I had  Norelco that wasnt cheap at al</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of the original Skull Shaver, and this review will share my experiences with the original Skull Shaver, and the incredible BALD EAGLE head shaver that has replaced it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far so good, i have used it twice.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use without any cuts, scrapes, or burns.</li>
            <li> I had doubts because it was too good to be true, and I have very sensitive skin mild eczema.</li>
            <li> Although this is advertised as a wet/dry shaver (using shaving lotion, NOT IN THE SHOWER), I primarily use it as a dry shaver, and am happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> This was truly worth every penny!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The SS (Skull Shaver), in its original design, is everything that a head shaver should be.  </li>
            <li> ; button on the original SS.  </li>
            <li> The product gets the job done and it does a clean job.</li>
            <li> The SS&#x27;s original claim was 30 minutes of use on a full charge.  </li>
            <li> This is the real deal Holyfield its all that it says and more.</li>
            <li> The Bald Eagle does a good job adapting to the various surfaces of the skull/scalp.</li>
            <li> I would often use the SS for a quick &amp;#34;touch</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I was hooked,  it took me about six minutes to shave my head with ease!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This soap lube will get you a head shave pretty darn close to the razor shave!</li>
            <li> I love the easy clean rinsing system which is so much easier than my prior shavers.</li>
            <li> He finds it to be far better than what he was using before.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, does a fantastic job, very quick(I can shave my head in less than 5 minutes) and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> This takes about 10-12 mins if that, it works really well for a quick shave a hair cut...</li>
            <li> The first one lasted 6 months before it quit.  </li>
            <li> After 3 months and EIGHT (8) follow ups, they finally replaced it under warranty.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!!  </li>
            <li> At first I could restart it by hitting the power button.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says but with ease.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for over a week and have not had to charge it since the first charge.</li>
            <li> But the thing I like most is that people at work are asking me how I get such a close shave on my head...</li>
            <li> real bummer!</li>
            <li> Bald Eagle Essential feels much more like a high-end shaver than its predecessor.  </li>
            <li> Well needless to say I was impressed, the cut came closer than my wahl electric clippers ever did.</li>
            <li> I did have to make a warranty claim as the battery had some issues at first</li>
            <li> Thanks Skull Shaver for improving my quality of life!</li>
            <li> This simplifies things to an easy, reliable daily routine.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to all looking for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Fast with a refund.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this shaver a lot.</li>
            <li> its the best you will not be disappointment with, unless your not using it right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thanks skull shaver for helping my man stay groomed</li>
            <li> but this is fast n painless</li>
            <li> , the problem with the head popping off seems to be happening more frequent now and its not snapping back on like it use to.</li>
            <li> With the Bald Eagle, should you choose to ignore the convenient battery indicator and run out of power, it only takes 3 or 4 hours for a full charge.</li>
            <li> I use an old tuna can to submerge the head (HEAD ONLY) of the shaver in luke-warm water, running it for 5-10 seconds to clean out all the stubble.  </li>
            <li> This sucks because I actually liked it.</li>
            <li> Not as smooth as my foil, but shaves fast, less  than 1/2 the time.</li>
            <li> , so I bought this new one and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> Save your money, low quality had two units that will not accept charge after first use.</li>
            <li> The first one I had finally bit the dust</li>
            <li> the one thing I would like to mention is that you must keep the shaver flat on the surface of your head, the first time I use it one of the heads poped off, I thought it was broke, but it just snap back on and now that I know how to keep it flat on my head its fine.</li>
            <li> It did not shave my head down perfectly smooth like a razor would, but it was a lot faster and easier to use.  </li>
            <li> I think the next version they come out with will really change that game, but for now I am satisfied!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t hurt at all and did not leave my skin feeling raw.</li>
            <li> I also found it takes less time to shave and is easier to clean.</li>
            <li> The LED lights are very helpful to know the renaming battery life left.</li>
            <li> My old shaver works while its plug in so I keep it around...</li>
            <li> I got the essential version not wanting to sink too much money into a product I didn&#x27;t expect to work.</li>
            <li> Good shave extremely poor quality!</li>
            <li> On a full charge it will run for about 5 minutes tops and then completely shuts down.</li>
            <li> The heads are a little noisy and they don&#x27;t last quite as long, but at $16 for a replacement, that is ok!</li>
            <li> The original nickel-cadmium batteries were a little undersized for the duty, and needed replacing.  </li>
            <li> The BE is slightly heavier than the SS, by a full ounce.  </li>
            <li> He had tried many different ones in the past and nothing worked to his liking until we found this one.</li>
            <li> I am planning to buy one for my father-in-law for his next birthday and would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> It came almost fully charged, and I let it for a few hours to bring it to a full charge.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen reviews stating that the Bald Eagle doesn&#x27;t shave a close as other products, which I was concerned with at first.</li>
            <li> Not as close as a blade razor, but that was not expected.  </li>
            <li> I have THICK hair, which the BE makes quick work of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only other criticisms of the SS is that its motor could run a little faster, and it felt underpowered at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a series of emails with SkullShaver (as my original SS was still under warranty), I received the BALD EAGLE ESSENTIAL, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> But my main issue with this thing is that the lights that tell you its charged don&#x27;t go out 1 by 1, to let you know its dying down...</li>
            <li> A quick pass over the head every other day and it works unbelievably well.</li>
            <li> only used it twice and doesn&#x27;t work well.&lt;br /&gt;Battery will not completely charge and has low</li>
            <li> I had used a blade to shave with for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Needed something for head shaving during the week that wouldn&#x27;t take as long as a safety razor.  </li>
            <li> shave max  2 days, does not do well with long hair.</li>
            <li> After 10 months of daily use (sometimes twice daily), the use time cut down to almost 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> This is the 3rd electric razor I have tried for shaving my head and it will be last---until I upgrade to the other model.</li>
            <li> I shake out the excess water, then let the shaver head dry upright on a paper towel.  </li>
            <li> It encases a LITHIUM-ION BATTERY which claims to give 90 minutes of use on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> I have tried it wet and dry, prefer dry.</li>
            <li> Works well in both dry and wet conditions.</li>
            <li> - I cannot urge you enough not to waste your money on this lemon product or this company&#x27;s &amp;#34;customer</li>
            <li> Product works as expected.</li>
            <li> I use this shaver every morning in the shower to save time, I wet my face and head then shave with it.</li>
            <li> I had been using a Norelco for the past few years and always had a hard time getting the right angle with the handle.</li>
            <li> When I plug it again, the led indicator lights are all the way down to the red meaning the battery is completely dead.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try other attachments</li>
            <li> Due to this, there is a learning curve.</li>
            <li> every other morning if you wish)</li>
            <li> Not as good as a razor blade very disappointed</li>
            <li> cleaning as described, not immersing), but not even three months in, it started to slow down and shut off out of the blue.  </li>
            <li> Worked one and a half times, then died.  </li>
            <li> Comparing it to the previous SS, the BE (Bald Eagle)</li>
            <li> The motor handle is also slightly longer, and slightly wider.  </li>
            <li> The motor speed and gearing of the BE alone have cut my shaving times IN HALF.  </li>
            <li> I hate shaving my head every other day with a regular razor and this has made life so much easier.  </li>
            <li> Gotta find an electric one.&amp;#34; Looked on Amazon and found this little beauty.  </li>
            <li> You have to acquire a little finesse.</li>
            <li> and I can maintain my look with little effort.  </li>
            <li> my job does not allow me to wear a beard at work that why I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I currently use wahl balding clippers, but was tired of using them and occassionaly getting knicked and cut, I tried headblade before, didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> So much less time than a razor and shaving cream!</li>
            <li> up&amp;#34; a few minutes before arriving at my destination for work, with the added benefit that it takes up very little room in my luggage case.  </li>
            <li> So P am going to have to change my recommendation to DO NOT BUY -- too bad as it worked well for the short it actually worked.</li>
            <li> No more shaving with a razor, this is the system I have been waiting for.</li>
            <li> This product was way too expensive to have it fail after such a brief time.</li>
            <li> Ill write an update in the future if any problem come up.</li>
            <li> After charging it for 12 hours, I turned it on, started shaving, and after nicking up the back of my neck like an angry cat, it proceeded to slowly die.  </li>
            <li> have tried razors such as the Head Blade ATX, but every one of them has left me with a bloody cut at some point.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> We are very disappointed, especially because it broke just a few days after the return window closed.</li>
            <li> After cutting myself badly with a brand new blade, I said &amp;#34;That&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> The worse I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> There is nothing worse than getting part way into a shave and running out of juice, knowing it will be 8, 10, 12 hours before you can finish the job.</li>
            <li> So needless to say</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my shaver quit after about 6 months.</li>
            <li> Quite possibly the worst product I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after a month of use, the shaver wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li> bought this for my husband for Christmas and he was kinda skeptical but he loves it !</li>
            <li> and I was doubtful.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend the product for those who hate shaving their head with a (non-electric) razor and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> 1 year warranty is up - too bad!!!  </li>

            <li> This thing is great!! Been using for 1 week now and very happy with the results. Take your time to get used to using it. I&#x27;m not baby butt smooth like a blade, yet, but I feel I will be over time. Stays charged for several uses and cleans in a snap. I have tried it wet and dry, prefer dry. The best part is no cuts or irritation after shaving. This is the 3rd electric razor I have tried for shaving my head and it will be last---until I upgrade to the other model.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted 6 months before it quit.  After 3 months and EIGHT (8) follow ups, they finally replaced it under warranty.  The replacement unit lasted 4 months before it quit.  Their response?  1 year warranty is up - too bad!!!  So needless to say - I cannot urge you enough not to waste your money on this lemon product or this company&#x27;s &amp;#34;customer no-service&amp;#34;.  BUYER BEWARE!</li>
            <li> This is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;Have only used it twice and doesn&#x27;t work well.&lt;br /&gt;Battery will not completely charge and has low power.&lt;br /&gt;Buy something else !</li>
            <li> After my husband tried several different electric shavers, a friend recommended the Bald Eagle.  My husband loves it.  This shaver is the best thing going for those who like the clean head look.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband since he likes to keep his head shaved closely but not use a razor.  It does a great job and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Best Head Shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  Can&#x27;t wait to try other attachments</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations.  I get a close shave with no cuts and without the hassle of shaving in the shower as I used to do.  This is the best electric shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. I always used razors and foil shavers. Started using the Skull Shaver last month and I love it. Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and am very pleased with its operation. I have been shaving my head for several years and have tried all kinds of blades and shavers. This is the best combination of quality of shave and ease of use I have found. In addition to being easy to use, it also is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with this product. Quick and easy to use without any cuts, scrapes, or burns. Easy to use and a remarkably close shave. I definitely recommend this product to all looking for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Save your money, low quality had two units that will not accept charge after first use. Good shave extremely poor quality! Would not buy again or recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product. Very easy to use and does a very good job. Cleaning the heads is very easy. They must have filled the palm grip with batteries -- I have  had this for about 6 weeks and it is still showing more than 50% charged. If you are follicle challenged, you need this shaver.  Unfortunately my shaver quit after about 6 months. It was replaced promptly. The replacement lasted about 3 months. So P am going to have to change my recommendation to DO NOT BUY -- too bad as it worked well for the short it actually worked.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works great.</li>
            <li> I got my Bald Eagle Essential shaver a couple of weeks ago and I love it. It came almost fully charged, and I let it for a few hours to bring it to a full charge.  The first time I used it, I was hooked,  it took me about six minutes to shave my head with ease!  It was VERY easy to use.  It did not shave my head down perfectly smooth like a razor would, but it was a lot faster and easier to use.  I have used it several times and the battery life has been excellent!  The LCD that shows the battery life is excellent.  I am planning to buy one for my father-in-law for his next birthday and would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Best shaver ever. I had doubts because it was too good to be true, and I have very sensitive skin mild eczema. This is the real deal Holyfield its all that it says and more. Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t hurt at all and did not leave my skin feeling raw. It cut just as close as a razor. men with bald heads, this is a gold mine. By the way I never leave reviews because I never had a product blow me away. But this one did. Thank you guys</li>
            <li> Unit stop working after two weeks. Fast with a refund.</li>
            <li> Very nice covienant shave almost a perfect shave still need a razor but this is easy for bald heads and doesn&#x27;t cut you or leave a razor bump or Burn impressive and fast</li>
            <li> Quality is good. Shaver blades don&#x27;t get as close as I would like.</li>
            <li> This shaver is awesome!! A quick pass over the head every other day and it works unbelievably well. No more shaving with a razor, this is the system I have been waiting for.</li>
            <li> I had used a blade to shave with for a long time.  I thought I would try an electric razor to see if I could save some time shaving.  I now use this razor on my head and face every day and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I absolutley love this shaver..  My wife got it for me for Christmas and I was doubtful.  It works great for a nice clean cut on my head and face.  I had  Norelco that wasnt cheap at al and it always torn my face apart.  The Skull Shaver is great and feels great.  Would highly recommend!!  So much less time than a razor and shaving cream!</li>
            <li> The worse I have ever seen. It doesn&#x27;t work as it was advertised.i will return this product may 29. I&#x27;m in a conference out of state</li>
            <li> Great product for keeping us follicle challenged guys looking crisp, clean, and dare I say, trendy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my head hair is quite course (the remaining hair, that is), I shave my head with an electric clipper. Then I go over it on a daily basis with the Bald Eagle to keep it as closely cut as possible. The Bald Eagle does a good job adapting to the various surfaces of the skull/scalp. I would recommend the product for those who hate shaving their head with a (non-electric) razor and shaving cream. This simplifies things to an easy, reliable daily routine.</li>
            <li> I was super happy with my Bald Eagle Pro when I first got it - way better than what I had been using.  I took care of it per the instructions (cleaning as described, not immersing), but not even three months in, it started to slow down and shut off out of the blue.  At first I could restart it by hitting the power button.  This went on for two or three uses and then I couldn&#x27;t restart it - power button did nothing even though it was fully charged.  This sucks because I actually liked it.</li>
            <li> Quite possibly the worst product I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon.  How this has so many good reviews I&#x27;ll never know.  After charging it for 12 hours, I turned it on, started shaving, and after nicking up the back of my neck like an angry cat, it proceeded to slowly die.  A grand 45 seconds of battery life.</li>
            <li> Outstanding beard and head shaver....great job....no complaints.  Will probably buy another one for my nephew.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for over three months now, and I can&#x27;t imagine being without it now! This has been the best head shaving experience. The results are better than any clippers I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s nice to be able to maintain my shaved head much more consistently and save time doing it! This was truly worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Great Shaver! I have been shaving my head since 2007 and have used various electric shavers as well as the head blade. After wearing out yet another set of $50 replacement blades I decided to google to see if a better head shaver had emerged instead of buying more 3 blades replacements. I&#x27;m glad I did as I have been real happy with the smooth, close shave of my Bald Eagle Pro! I love the easy clean rinsing system which is so much easier than my prior shavers. The heads are a little noisy and they don&#x27;t last quite as long, but at $16 for a replacement, that is ok!</li>
            <li> Does a good job on body hair as well as head hair, once the hair is trimmed.  Not as close as a blade razor, but that was not expected.  Like cleaning the blades in water as well.  Timely delivery.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my father-in-law. He has been using it for about two months now and hasn&#x27;t had any problems. He finds it to be far better than what he was using before. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> DOA, not a sign of life in it.  I wish they did quality control so I wouldn&#x27;t have to go through the hassle of returning it.</li>
            <li> One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made, and I don&#x27;t give out rave reviews lightly!  I used to shave my head in the shower with a blade.  After cutting myself badly with a brand new blade, I said &amp;#34;That&#x27;s it! Gotta find an electric one.&amp;#34; Looked on Amazon and found this little beauty.  Couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. Well, I LOVE IT.  It is very easy to use, does a fantastic job, very quick(I can shave my head in less than 5 minutes) and easy to clean.  I don&#x27;t know what else I could ask for. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Piece of junk. Didn&#x27;t even last six months. On a full charge it will run for about 5 minutes tops and then completely shuts down. When I plug it again, the led indicator lights are all the way down to the red meaning the battery is completely dead. Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> Great Product and would buy 10 more. Does exactly what it says but with ease. Skull Shaver is a life saver. I have recommended it to all of my friends. I have sensative skin and skull shaver has not caused any irritations or bumps. Its amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this shaver a lot. The battery life is outstanding. There is nothing worse than getting part way into a shave and running out of juice, knowing it will be 8, 10, 12 hours before you can finish the job. With the Bald Eagle, should you choose to ignore the convenient battery indicator and run out of power, it only takes 3 or 4 hours for a full charge. The design of the head gives you great flexibility to maneuver the unique topography of one&#x27;s scalp. With this flexibility, though, comes a loss of stability. The micro-foil razor I just stepped up from did have a &amp;#34;just press harder&amp;#34; aspect that got the job done, but could lead to irritation. Due to this, there is a learning curve. You have to acquire a little finesse. I&#x27;ve seen reviews stating that the Bald Eagle doesn&#x27;t shave a close as other products, which I was concerned with at first. But after some practice, I am able to get a very smooth, comfortable shave. I believe may days of trial and error with shaving products has come to an end. Great piece of equipment Skull Shaver. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Needed something for head shaving during the week that wouldn&#x27;t take as long as a safety razor.  This does the job. Not quite as close (after ~1 week of use), but also takes about a quarter of the time.</li>
            <li> The Bald Eagle truly is a great device. I had been using a Norelco for the past few years and always had a hard time getting the right angle with the handle. This design solves that problem. I also found it takes less time to shave and is easier to clean.</li>
            <li> Worked one and a half times, then died.  Returning.</li>
            <li> Product works as expected. Easy to clean. Works well in both dry and wet conditions. The LED lights are very helpful to know the renaming battery life left.</li>
            <li> I use this shaver every morning in the shower to save time, I wet my face and head then shave with it. This takes about 10-12 mins if that, it works really well for a quick shave a hair cut...my job does not allow me to wear a beard at work that why I use it everyday. I&#x27;ve had it for over a week and have not had to charge it since the first charge. But the thing I like most is that people at work are asking me how I get such a close shave on my head... the one thing I would like to mention is that you must keep the shaver flat on the surface of your head, the first time I use it one of the heads poped off, I thought it was broke, but it just snap back on and now that I know how to keep it flat on my head its fine. the head hasn&#x27;t poped off since. its the best you will not be disappointment with, unless your not using it right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Ok, the problem with the head popping off seems to be happening more frequent now and its not snapping back on like it use to. that being said if you can work around that its still a good shaver. But my main issue with this thing is that the lights that tell you its charged don&#x27;t go out 1 by 1, to let you know its dying down...its either fully lit or no lights at all! it would be nice not see all the lights on 1 day then the next day it out of power no warning...what makes this even more frustrating is that you can&#x27;t use while its plugged in! real bummer! My old shaver works while its plug in so I keep it around...so no matter how good this shaver is, don&#x27;t get rid of your old one if you can use while its charging!</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of the original Skull Shaver, and this review will share my experiences with the original Skull Shaver, and the incredible BALD EAGLE head shaver that has replaced it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SS (Skull Shaver), in its original design, is everything that a head shaver should be.  It follows the contours of the head, has an excellent handle, and gives consistent results that you can take with you on the road.  I would often use the SS for a quick &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; a few minutes before arriving at my destination for work, with the added benefit that it takes up very little room in my luggage case.  The SS&#x27;s original claim was 30 minutes of use on a full charge.  After 10 months of daily use (sometimes twice daily), the use time cut down to almost 5 minutes.  The original nickel-cadmium batteries were a little undersized for the duty, and needed replacing.  My only other criticisms of the SS is that its motor could run a little faster, and it felt underpowered at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a series of emails with SkullShaver (as my original SS was still under warranty), I received the BALD EAGLE ESSENTIAL, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It is EVERYTHING that a head shaver should be.  Comparing it to the previous SS, the BE (Bald Eagle) really only shares the same shaving head as the SS.  That is where the similarities end.  The BE is slightly heavier than the SS, by a full ounce.  It feels more substantial.  The motor handle is also slightly longer, and slightly wider.  It encases a LITHIUM-ION BATTERY which claims to give 90 minutes of use on a single charge.  It has been over a week, and I am still using the charge that the BE came with when I opened the box!  When I do recharge it, though, it has a circuit in it that prevents overcharging of the battery.  A BIG IMPROVEMENT!  There is a bright LED charge indicator on the top of the unit.....very handy when gauging how much use I might have before recharging.  The single-touch ON/OFF button also feels more refined than the two-stage &amp;#34;click-Click&amp;#34; button on the original SS.  The biggest improvement to the unit is the MOTOR.  It is oodles more powerful, spins FASTER, and it SOUNDS more refined.  The motor speed and gearing of the BE alone have cut my shaving times IN HALF.  Fewer shaving passes to get the desired results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bald Eagle Essential feels much more like a high-end shaver than its predecessor.  Cleaning it is a snap.  I use an old tuna can to submerge the head (HEAD ONLY) of the shaver in luke-warm water, running it for 5-10 seconds to clean out all the stubble.  I shake out the excess water, then let the shaver head dry upright on a paper towel.  Although this is advertised as a wet/dry shaver (using shaving lotion, NOT IN THE SHOWER), I primarily use it as a dry shaver, and am happy with the results.  I have THICK hair, which the BE makes quick work of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still rave about this shaver, even more-so with all of its technical improvements.  I hope you found my review helpful.  -Wyatt</li>
            <li> After years of struggling with maintaining my bald hair within the week, I finally found this product as the best for the job. I shave once over the weekend and then use the bald eagle to smoothen it out for the rest of the week. Get yours ASAP!</li>
            <li> bought this for my husband for Christmas and he was kinda skeptical but he loves it ! He can&#x27;t believe how easy it is to use . He doesn&#x27;t use a razor so he just likes a buzzed look witch this product does great . thanks skull shaver for helping my man stay groomed</li>
            <li> My husband was in love with this shaver. He had tried many different ones in the past and nothing worked to his liking until we found this one. Unfortunately, after a month of use, the shaver wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. As soon as he turned it on, it shut itself off. We are very disappointed, especially because it broke just a few days after the return window closed. This product was way too expensive to have it fail after such a brief time.</li>
            <li> Best head shaver for the price yet!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Life changing for anyone who shaves there head on a regular basis. Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> great product.qwik an easy</li>
            <li> Well I feel like giving it 3 stars. The product gets the job done and it does a clean job. However, it requires several passes to get the entire head bald. All this product needs is a shaving head that can get the job done in one pass and it will be perfect.</li>
            <li> Not as good as a razor blade very disappointed</li>
            <li> Not as smooth as my foil, but shaves fast, less  than 1/2 the time. (if you don&#x27;t touch your head you can&#x27;t tell the difference)&lt;br /&gt;Must shave max  2 days, does not do well with long hair.</li>
            <li> The best thing I ever had I shaved my head with many things but this is fast n painless</li>
            <li> So far so good, i have used it twice. Seen to be a excellent device I used it on my head and mustache, cut it very low and smooth no irritation right now . Ill write an update in the future if any problem come up.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I have found for both head and face. Fastest, easiest, and closest shave I have found. Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Skull Shavers for years.  The first one I had finally bit the dust, so I bought this new one and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The battery life is amazing and it still gives the great shave that I love.  Clean-up is even easier than it was before.  This one will probably last awhile too, but I&#x27;ll be getting another one when it wears out.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad, brother and husband and they think it&#x27;s a great shaver.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to get cut by a razor, this is the best product for shaving your head!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried razors such as the Head Blade ATX, but every one of them has left me with a bloody cut at some point.&lt;br /&gt;The 5-head setup is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, electric razors don&#x27;t shave your head as closely as regular razors, but, try this routine with your Skull Shaver Bald Eagle:&lt;br /&gt;1: in the shower, shave dry.&lt;br /&gt;2. after that, still in the shower, soap up your head and beard, and shave again with the Bald Eagle.  Do not let water from the shower strike the shaver.  This soap lube will get you a head shave pretty darn close to the razor shave!</li>
            <li> I currently use wahl balding clippers, but was tired of using them and occassionaly getting knicked and cut, I tried headblade before, didn&#x27;t work. I saw this product online last week and decided to give it a shot. I got the essential version not wanting to sink too much money into a product I didn&#x27;t expect to work. Well needless to say I was impressed, the cut came closer than my wahl electric clippers ever did. The motor could stand to be a bit stronger as it took about 10 mins or so to cut my hair. I think the next version they come out with will really change that game, but for now I am satisfied!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Bald Eagle Essential and LOVE IT!!! I hate shaving my head every other day with a regular razor and this has made life so much easier.  It takes one to two minutes per morning (every other morning if you wish) and I can maintain my look with little effort.  I did have to make a warranty claim as the battery had some issues at first but it was handled IMMEDIATELY! Awesome customer service. Thanks Skull Shaver for improving my quality of life!</li>
