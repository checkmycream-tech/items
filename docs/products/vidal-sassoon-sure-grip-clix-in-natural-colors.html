            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>I first got these clips at my corner drugstore and was very impressed at how well they held my hair in place, and I like the color suite of the package too.</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>These type of products are not that easy to find in my area anymore, so happy Amazon had them.</li>
            <li>These clips are amazing.</li>
            <li>43+ years, I have to say these are amazing.  </li>
            <li>They are amazing.</li>
            <li>These are the absolute best!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I liked them a lot.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, them!!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and functional.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, just did not work as well on my hair, liked the colors ,and was well made</li>
            <li>These are by far the best barrettes for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the clips, all others clips slide through my hair, but these clips hold my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>still looks ok for now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for years and love them because they stay in place all day.</li>
            <li>Love these, just wish they came in all one color</li>
            <li>/&gt;First thing she noticed putting them in was \\&quot;These hold fantastic!\\&quot;, she has since worn them to dance many times and worked out with them</li>
            <li>Stay in place hold hair better than any clip</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a soldier and these hold better then</li>
            <li>The bottom portion of the clip is like a comb and allows it to hold more hair.</li>
            <li>As a result most barretts and clips just slip out in minutes and don&#x27;t hold.</li>
            <li>I just hope in two years I don&#x27;t regret not stocking up with more.</li>
            <li>and I will buy more.</li>
            <li>They are actually better.</li>
            <li>They stay in better than any I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Will buy again if I feel the need to get more.    </li>
            <li>I love this style of clip as it stays in my hair better than most.</li>
            <li>Mostly silicon strap ripped your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they are offered here.</li>
            <li>These are forget they are there comfortable!</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li>These clips stay in place better than any others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and these hold it very securely.  </li>
            <li>I have trouble finding them in stores, so I&#x27;m happy happy to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The top clips are gold-ish but more of a metallic-matte type color which does not reflect light like a piece of gold jewelry.  </li>
            <li>Not only do they hold wonderfully, they are comfortable and do not trap or pull your hair out when you remove them.</li>
            <li>They are okay but still slide out of my fine hair.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t bulky, slides through hair nicely and hot dog do these have grip!</li>
            <li>They stay in place, they are cheap and blend in well with brunette hair :)  </li>
            <li>The comb feature on the bottom makes them easy to put in.  </li>
            <li>oh yea i have a lot of hair but its really fine</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but a lot of it and these hold my hair well.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and these work for me.  </li>
            <li>If you have fine hair these clips are for you....</li>
            <li>when i wake up there still in the same spot after all the tossing and turning, theses are great</li>
            <li>These hold an amazing amount of my hair and really stay in place.</li>
            <li>Well, having tried different hair apparatus for the great majority of</li>
            <li>I use this primarily for working out at the gym and for gymnastics.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my slippery hair in place all day, and it&#x27;s so comfortable</li>
            <li>They feel so secure and have never fallen out.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, I bought 2 sets.</li>
            <li>Also the paint is now glossy &amp; cheap looking.  </li>
            <li>They were exactly what I wanted, and I received them quickly! :)</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re worth the cost if you can keep track of them!</li>
            <li>Great for holding back bangs all day &amp; no broken hairs when taking out!</li>
            <li>They do work really well; I wish the color assortments were either more varied or that you could choose which of the three colors to get.</li>
            <li>They are still my absolute favorite clips, nothing else</li>
            <li>These will last forever and are good neutral colors.</li>
            <li>Sure Grip Clix on line after losing one too many of the regular clips from my hair.</li>
            <li>Love them, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>These fit pretty snug.</li>
            <li>So worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Something also worth noting:</li>
            <li>but it still looked stylish and professional.</li>
            <li>These clips are extremely handy for my bangs when clipping them back.</li>
            <li>They ship super fast too!</li>
            <li>In any event, as soon as these new clips arrived, I removed what was left of my old clips, and immediately replaced them with Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s brilliant clips.</li>
            <li>These are awesome for fine hair because they click closed pretty tight.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and these actually hold it in place.</li>
            <li>They do a great job holding your hair back, but what I needed they are too big.</li>
            <li>My only compalint, a fairly substantial one, is that the color fades quickly and they are unusable in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>These work exactly as advertised, even in my really fine soft hair..  </li>
            <li>The little comb in the back helped secure the clips, they stayed put and are a great size.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spend tons of money for all sorts of different clips and barrettes and LOVE these.  </li>
            <li>They work better then slicking my hair back with hair goop all the time.</li>
            <li>I have finally lost all but two pair and went looking for more a couple weeks ago.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with snap clips.  </li>
            <li>They did exactly that.</li>
            <li>Only wish it was available in a more adult size length and that you could get packages in one color.</li>
            <li>I really like these!  </li>
            <li>I thought all the teeth would have made these grip better and hold more hair than the usual ones in the store, but they do not.</li>
            <li>Great for martial arts for people with long hair.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad to have several to choose from</li>
            <li>I found these in Amazon, bought them and exactly what I want.</li>
            <li>It grabs more hair, and its grip is solid.  </li>
            <li>Finally the paint wore off &amp; I ordered more.  </li>
            <li>it is a good barrette and does not easily come out of your hair.</li>
            <li>They are very nice for those with thick hair.</li>
            <li>These clips got very high reviews and were very reasonably priced</li>
            <li>far wife gives this a giant thumbs up, says they are great and wants me to get her a few more.</li>
            <li>The clips do hold better (though only slightly better) than the standard kind that only have one prong on the back.  </li>
            <li>these work best with dry hair, but I  have black woman natural hair</li>
            <li>These stay in the hair better than the single ones.</li>
            <li>One of the only clips that hold my daughter&#x27;s fine hair</li>
            <li>The comb on the bottom really helps.</li>
            <li>(I really don&#x27;t want to readjust during the day)</li>
            <li>These hold my hair in place all day and are very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>and these really hold it in place,</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>They are much better than the old clips I have similar to these.</li>
            <li>AND they seem to be more gentle on it than other snap clips that basically were hair-slicers.</li>
            <li>These really do stay put better than other clips.</li>
            <li>The middle clips are more of a pewter/silver metallic color which would look quite nice in any dark red or brown/black hair color.  </li>
            <li>Does my hair have magical powers to enchant the other clips and \\&quot;wish them into the corn field?\\&quot;</li>
            <li>My daughter in law loves these hair clips with her long hair &amp; fly away short hair because they stay in place &amp; control her angel soft short hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these hair clips.</li>
            <li>Easy to clip on my hair and easy to take out without actually taking out small strands of my hair too.</li>
            <li>However, the prongs on these clips break off easily and become a sharp hazard.  </li>
            <li>These are pricey, but worth it if you&#x27;re looking to clip back your hair and have it stay..</li>
            <li>but I still didn&#x27;t expect them to be that fragile after a week&#x27;s worth of use.</li>
            <li>Hold my thick hair and my daughters very curly hair very securely.</li>
            <li>have fine, thin, curly hair and most other clips slide right through.</li>
            <li>Obviously you can&#x27;t clip huge amounts of hair back, but once I&#x27;ve put them in place</li>
            <li>The colors are nice, although I wish there was a red and olive green.</li>
            <li>I have blonde, medium-thickness hair, and very long (hangs down to the small of my back), and all the colors looked great in their own way when I tried them out.</li>
            <li>and I have tried so many different types of barrettes but these are the only ones that actually hold my hair in place.  </li>
            <li>come in several pretty colors</li>
            <li>and it seems the extra little flared out sides on them really do hold much better than the old school aluminium snap-clips a lot of you are probably trying to replace with these</li>
            <li>In the Amazon product photo it shows two \\&quot;shiny gold\\&quot; clips at the top, two \\&quot;shiny dark red\\&quot; clips in the middle and two \\&quot;shiny black\\&quot; clips at the bottom.  </li>
            <li>i like the functionality of the clip, the three prongs grab much better than typical pop-clip, but the paint started coming off by the second use.  </li>
            <li>These ROCK, pure and simple.</li>
            <li>They always slide out or can&#x27;t hold a large enough chunk of hair.  </li>
            <li>Got these as a stocking stuffer for my wife (a dancer) at Christmas to replace some 100 year old, rusty ones she had since she was</li>
            <li>Overall I really like them.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant initially when purchasing clips like these for my hair.</li>
            <li>Love the hold on thick hair.</li>
            <li>I have thick naturally curly hair and these work great for keeping my hair off my face or to tame strays.</li>
            <li>Well made clips that firmly hold my thick, wavy hair and look nice too!</li>
            <li>I was tired of only being able to work with scrunchies, and I really wanted to spice up my hairstyle repertoire.</li>
            <li>Maybe Sassoon can make the same thing only bigger, that&#x27;d be fun.</li>
            <li>I have very fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>(at least I have seen a lot of her friends with the old-school simple barrettes that I imagine are more common).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like these clips as they are one of the only ones I&#x27;ve bought that stay in my hair and keep it clipped properly.  </li>
            <li>They work in my thick, fine hair.</li>
            <li>They are also perfect for styling your hair down, particularly if it is thick and resistant to bobby pins and other conventional clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another plus is that hair stays in place better than with other clips, especially with a little hairspray.</li>
            <li>Hours later, after spending the day running errands, doing laundry, cooking and occasionally dancing a bit to whatever was coming from the kitchen radio, I realized that not only were the clips all present and accounted for, but my hair had not escaped to perform a devistatingly clever impression of Shirley Temple, completely without my permission.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a diver and have not really long hair</li>

            <li> The bottom portion of the clip is like a comb and allows it to hold more hair.</li>
            <li> As a result most barretts and clips just slip out in minutes and don&#x27;t hold.</li>
            <li> I just hope in two years I don&#x27;t regret not stocking up with more.</li>
            <li> and I will buy more.</li>
            <li> They are actually better.</li>
            <li> They stay in better than any I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> Will buy again if I feel the need to get more.    </li>
            <li> I love this style of clip as it stays in my hair better than most.</li>
            <li> Mostly silicon strap ripped your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they are offered here.</li>
            <li> These are forget they are there comfortable!</li>
            <li> I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> These clips stay in place better than any others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and these hold it very securely.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble finding them in stores, so I&#x27;m happy happy to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The top clips are gold-ish but more of a metallic-matte type color which does not reflect light like a piece of gold jewelry.  </li>
            <li> Not only do they hold wonderfully, they are comfortable and do not trap or pull your hair out when you remove them.</li>
            <li> They are okay but still slide out of my fine hair.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t bulky, slides through hair nicely and hot dog do these have grip!</li>
            <li> They stay in place, they are cheap and blend in well with brunette hair :)  </li>
            <li> The comb feature on the bottom makes them easy to put in.  </li>
            <li> oh yea i have a lot of hair but its really fine</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but a lot of it and these hold my hair well.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and these work for me.  </li>
            <li> If you have fine hair these clips are for you....</li>
            <li> when i wake up there still in the same spot after all the tossing and turning, theses are great</li>
            <li> These hold an amazing amount of my hair and really stay in place.</li>
            <li> Well, having tried different hair apparatus for the great majority of</li>
            <li> I use this primarily for working out at the gym and for gymnastics.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my slippery hair in place all day, and it&#x27;s so comfortable</li>
            <li> They feel so secure and have never fallen out.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, I bought 2 sets.</li>
            <li> Also the paint is now glossy &amp; cheap looking.  </li>
            <li> They were exactly what I wanted, and I received them quickly! :)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re worth the cost if you can keep track of them!</li>
            <li> Great for holding back bangs all day &amp; no broken hairs when taking out!</li>
            <li> They do work really well; I wish the color assortments were either more varied or that you could choose which of the three colors to get.</li>
            <li> They are still my absolute favorite clips, nothing else</li>
            <li> These will last forever and are good neutral colors.</li>
            <li> Sure Grip Clix on line after losing one too many of the regular clips from my hair.</li>
            <li> Love them, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These fit pretty snug.</li>
            <li> So worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Something also worth noting:</li>
            <li> but it still looked stylish and professional.</li>
            <li> These clips are extremely handy for my bangs when clipping them back.</li>
            <li> They ship super fast too!</li>
            <li> In any event, as soon as these new clips arrived, I removed what was left of my old clips, and immediately replaced them with Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s brilliant clips.</li>
            <li> These are awesome for fine hair because they click closed pretty tight.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and these actually hold it in place.</li>
            <li> They do a great job holding your hair back, but what I needed they are too big.</li>
            <li> My only compalint, a fairly substantial one, is that the color fades quickly and they are unusable in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> These work exactly as advertised, even in my really fine soft hair..  </li>
            <li> The little comb in the back helped secure the clips, they stayed put and are a great size.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spend tons of money for all sorts of different clips and barrettes and LOVE these.  </li>
            <li> They work better then slicking my hair back with hair goop all the time.</li>
            <li> I have finally lost all but two pair and went looking for more a couple weeks ago.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with snap clips.  </li>
            <li> They did exactly that.</li>
            <li> Only wish it was available in a more adult size length and that you could get packages in one color.</li>
            <li> I really like these!  </li>
            <li> I thought all the teeth would have made these grip better and hold more hair than the usual ones in the store, but they do not.</li>
            <li> Great for martial arts for people with long hair.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad to have several to choose from</li>
            <li> I found these in Amazon, bought them and exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> It grabs more hair, and its grip is solid.  </li>
            <li> Finally the paint wore off &amp; I ordered more.  </li>
            <li> it is a good barrette and does not easily come out of your hair.</li>
            <li> They are very nice for those with thick hair.</li>
            <li> These clips got very high reviews and were very reasonably priced</li>
            <li> far wife gives this a giant thumbs up, says they are great and wants me to get her a few more.</li>
            <li> The clips do hold better (though only slightly better) than the standard kind that only have one prong on the back.  </li>
            <li> these work best with dry hair, but I  have black woman natural hair</li>
            <li> These stay in the hair better than the single ones.</li>
            <li> One of the only clips that hold my daughter&#x27;s fine hair</li>
            <li> The comb on the bottom really helps.</li>
            <li> (I really don&#x27;t want to readjust during the day)</li>
            <li> These hold my hair in place all day and are very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> and these really hold it in place,</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> They are much better than the old clips I have similar to these.</li>
            <li> AND they seem to be more gentle on it than other snap clips that basically were hair-slicers.</li>
            <li> These really do stay put better than other clips.</li>
            <li> The middle clips are more of a pewter/silver metallic color which would look quite nice in any dark red or brown/black hair color.  </li>
            <li> Does my hair have magical powers to enchant the other clips and \\&quot;wish them into the corn field?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My daughter in law loves these hair clips with her long hair &amp; fly away short hair because they stay in place &amp; control her angel soft short hair.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these hair clips.</li>
            <li> Easy to clip on my hair and easy to take out without actually taking out small strands of my hair too.</li>
            <li> However, the prongs on these clips break off easily and become a sharp hazard.  </li>
            <li> These are pricey, but worth it if you&#x27;re looking to clip back your hair and have it stay..</li>
            <li> but I still didn&#x27;t expect them to be that fragile after a week&#x27;s worth of use.</li>
            <li> Hold my thick hair and my daughters very curly hair very securely.</li>
            <li> have fine, thin, curly hair and most other clips slide right through.</li>
            <li> Obviously you can&#x27;t clip huge amounts of hair back, but once I&#x27;ve put them in place</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, although I wish there was a red and olive green.</li>
            <li> I have blonde, medium-thickness hair, and very long (hangs down to the small of my back), and all the colors looked great in their own way when I tried them out.</li>
            <li> and I have tried so many different types of barrettes but these are the only ones that actually hold my hair in place.  </li>
            <li> come in several pretty colors</li>
            <li> and it seems the extra little flared out sides on them really do hold much better than the old school aluminium snap-clips a lot of you are probably trying to replace with these</li>
            <li> In the Amazon product photo it shows two \\&quot;shiny gold\\&quot; clips at the top, two \\&quot;shiny dark red\\&quot; clips in the middle and two \\&quot;shiny black\\&quot; clips at the bottom.  </li>
            <li> i like the functionality of the clip, the three prongs grab much better than typical pop-clip, but the paint started coming off by the second use.  </li>
            <li> These ROCK, pure and simple.</li>
            <li> They always slide out or can&#x27;t hold a large enough chunk of hair.  </li>
            <li> Got these as a stocking stuffer for my wife (a dancer) at Christmas to replace some 100 year old, rusty ones she had since she was</li>
            <li> Overall I really like them.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant initially when purchasing clips like these for my hair.</li>
            <li> Love the hold on thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick naturally curly hair and these work great for keeping my hair off my face or to tame strays.</li>
            <li> Well made clips that firmly hold my thick, wavy hair and look nice too!</li>
            <li> I was tired of only being able to work with scrunchies, and I really wanted to spice up my hairstyle repertoire.</li>
            <li> Maybe Sassoon can make the same thing only bigger, that&#x27;d be fun.</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> (at least I have seen a lot of her friends with the old-school simple barrettes that I imagine are more common).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like these clips as they are one of the only ones I&#x27;ve bought that stay in my hair and keep it clipped properly.  </li>
            <li> They work in my thick, fine hair.</li>
            <li> They are also perfect for styling your hair down, particularly if it is thick and resistant to bobby pins and other conventional clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another plus is that hair stays in place better than with other clips, especially with a little hairspray.</li>
            <li> Hours later, after spending the day running errands, doing laundry, cooking and occasionally dancing a bit to whatever was coming from the kitchen radio, I realized that not only were the clips all present and accounted for, but my hair had not escaped to perform a devistatingly clever impression of Shirley Temple, completely without my permission.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a diver and have not really long hair</li>
            <li> In my niece&#x27;s thick, curly hair and my other niece&#x27;s baby fine toddler hair.</li>
            <li> Too long bangs in my eyes are not long enough to pull back.  </li>
            <li> The price seems a little high and the paint has chipped on the inside</li>
            <li> I read the reviews (and saw the ridiculously small price) and figured I would be semi-unimpressed but wouldn&#x27;t lose much.  </li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thick</li>
            <li> Nothing stays in my little, blonde, five year old&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> The disappointment came when one broke after only a week (the top side not the comb side) and the paint, or whatever the color coating is, wore off in places.</li>
            <li> In the past when I&#x27;ve tried to take similar clips out of my hair, they&#x27;ve always managed to snag a strand and break it, ruin it, or rip it out completely.</li>
            <li> They are a bit larger than I expected, but they do indeed hold well.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> They hold thick hair really well.</li>
            <li> Finally, the bottom clips are a solid black color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Other similar clips just slide along my hair and don&#x27;t \\&quot;cling\\&quot;.)  </li>
            <li> They look like those little small clips, but the normal ones will hold about 1/3 of all the hair that I need to hold back.</li>
            <li> There are 3 prongs that hold in my loose hair and snaps in.</li>
            <li> I worried for nothing: every time I take these clips out, they come out without a fuss, and without damaging a single strand on my head!</li>
            <li> They keep my thick hair completely out of the way without coming loose throughout my workout.  </li>
            <li> they hold extremely well, stay in place all day and night long!</li>
            <li> These are the only little hair clip things that hold my bulking hair in place.</li>
            <li> Tip: if your hair gets stuck when you&#x27;re trying to take the clip out of your hair, snap the clip closed again, then re-open.</li>
            <li> The 3 pronged clips allow me to pin back my thick hair  without the barrette snapping open like the one pronged ones do.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying any other clips like this.</li>
            <li> I usually clip back my bangs with 4 bobby pins..  </li>
            <li> No more constantly taking out bobby pins or barrettes because they fall out.  </li>
            <li> I have short, straight hair that is long past its cutting date</li>
            <li> They are difficult to open enough to put in.  </li>
            <li> Easier just to pick up the typical ones in the store.</li>
            <li> I typically have issues with clips or barretts because they don&#x27;t hold thinner hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long, THICK hair</li>
            <li> Some hold tight &amp; others do not.  </li>
            <li> I use at least one of these almost every single day.  </li>
            <li> I use them to make a little bump-it with my bangs by pulling in the hair on each side and then bringing the teeth of the clips together.</li>
            <li> My clips broke within a few days of using them.</li>
            <li> There are three prongs, and it&#x27;s almost impossible to hold open all three at the same time.</li>
            <li> Not much  more to say..</li>
            <li> i have a thick and heavy hair</li>
            <li> I lost a few hairs in these clips!</li>
            <li> so i have a hard time looking for hair clips that can hold my hair.</li>
            <li> And if you dive, really hard to make it stay need.</li>
            <li> They do \\&quot;grip\\&quot; and grip a lot (I have THICK hair) Buy em, and use em.  </li>
            <li> Even though my hair is thick and curly it&#x27;s also shiny and some clips have a tendency to start sliding around.</li>
            <li> The ones they sell in the store don&#x27;t hold my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have very straight thick hair and have the WORST history of hair clips.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair, so barrettes are hit or miss.</li>
            <li> It is very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Disappointing and flimsy...  </li>
            <li> The colors aren&#x27;t bad, either.</li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my daughter loves them also and is terrible about misplacing them.</li>
            <li> and then they look horrible.  </li>

            <li> I love the clips, all others clips slide through my hair, but these clips hold my hair.  I love them</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and these hold it very securely.  The comb on the bottom really helps.</li>
            <li> i like the functionality of the clip, the three prongs grab much better than typical pop-clip, but the paint started coming off by the second use.  still looks ok for now.</li>
            <li> these are amazing! they hold extremely well, stay in place all day and night long! i use these wonders to hold my bangs while im sleeping and when i wake up there still in the same spot after all the tossing and turning, theses are great im in love!  oh yea i have a lot of hair but its really fine</li>

            <li> These are perfect for anyone&#x27;s hair. They work in my thick, fine hair. In my niece&#x27;s thick, curly hair and my other niece&#x27;s baby fine toddler hair. And the price is comparable to what you&#x27;d pay at walmart or cvs (if you can even find them in stock there).</li>
            <li> These clips are amazing. They look like those little small clips, but the normal ones will hold about 1/3 of all the hair that I need to hold back. These hold an amazing amount of my hair and really stay in place. Love them!</li>

They do work really well; I wish the color assortments were either more varied or that you could choose which of the three colors to get.</li>
            <li> Love these, just wish they came in all one color and you could choose which one you wanted.</li>
            <li> They stay in place, they are cheap and blend in well with brunette hair :)  Not much  more to say.. lol I use them for golf and tennis and they keep my pesky hair out of my face - they are great.</li>
            <li> Well, having tried different hair apparatus for the great majority of 43+ years, I have to say these are amazing.  I read the reviews (and saw the ridiculously small price) and figured I would be semi-unimpressed but wouldn&#x27;t lose much.  These ROCK, pure and simple. They do \\&quot;grip\\&quot; and grip a lot (I have THICK hair) Buy em, and use em.  So worth it.</li>
            <li> These clips are great. They hold thick hair really well. Great colors and great quality! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying any other clips like this. These are the absolute best!</li>
            <li> Got these as a stocking stuffer for my wife (a dancer) at Christmas to replace some 100 year old, rusty ones she had since she was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing she noticed putting them in was \\&quot;These hold fantastic!\\&quot;, she has since worn them to dance many times and worked out with them and it seems the extra little flared out sides on them really do hold much better than the old school aluminium snap-clips a lot of you are probably trying to replace with these (at least I have seen a lot of her friends with the old-school simple barrettes that I imagine are more common).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far wife gives this a giant thumbs up, says they are great and wants me to get her a few more.</li>
            <li> These are the best clips ever. Stay in place hold hair better than any clip</li>
            <li> These are GREAT clips. Hold my thick hair and my daughters very curly hair very securely. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, them!!</li>
            <li> I have thick naturally curly hair and these work great for keeping my hair off my face or to tame strays. They stay in place well too. Even though my hair is thick and curly it&#x27;s also shiny and some clips have a tendency to start sliding around. These fit pretty snug. The colors are nice, although I wish there was a red and olive green. They are fancier than the standard. Overall I really like them.</li>
            <li> I love these hair clips! I received them in 2 days. They are very nice for those with thick hair.</li>
            <li> Several years ago I bought a pack or two of these clips at a local discount store.  After a while, they disappeared into the nether (the same place rubber bands, clips and socks go to hide indefinitely) and I frantically searched around town to find them again-- to no avail.  I was ecstatic when I found them here on Amazon and promptly ordered a pack.  They are still my absolute favorite clips, nothing else quite compares.  I use this primarily for working out at the gym and for gymnastics.  They keep my thick hair completely out of the way without coming loose throughout my workout.  (Other similar clips just slide along my hair and don&#x27;t \\&quot;cling\\&quot;.)  They are also perfect for styling your hair down, particularly if it is thick and resistant to bobby pins and other conventional clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something also worth noting: In the Amazon product photo it shows two \\&quot;shiny gold\\&quot; clips at the top, two \\&quot;shiny dark red\\&quot; clips in the middle and two \\&quot;shiny black\\&quot; clips at the bottom.  In reality, the colors are quite a bit different than the picture.  The top clips are gold-ish but more of a metallic-matte type color which does not reflect light like a piece of gold jewelry.  The middle clips are more of a pewter/silver metallic color which would look quite nice in any dark red or brown/black hair color.  Finally, the bottom clips are a solid black color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. All-time favorite!</li>
            <li> Nothing stays in my little, blonde, five year old&#x27;s hair. I have been stuck using those tiny elastics and they break her hair. I have ordered these twice. We love them!</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thick and I have tried so many different types of barrettes but these are the only ones that actually hold my hair in place.  Love these!</li>
            <li> These are the best clips for &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> I have very straight thick hair and have the WORST history of hair clips.  I&#x27;ve spend tons of money for all sorts of different clips and barrettes and LOVE these.  They hold with no pulling or tangling.  These are remarkable.  I&#x27;m a soldier and these hold better then anything I&#x27;ve ever used before.  They work better then slicking my hair back with hair goop all the time.</li>
            <li> These clips are great. I recently cut my curly hair to shoulder length and I needed some clips so that my hair wouldn&#x27;t be flying everywhere. They are much better than the old clips I have similar to these. The bottom portion of the clip is like a comb and allows it to hold more hair. They work like a charm!</li>
            <li> I bough these b/c I read someone&#x27;s review stating how great they were!! And, I have to agree!! I usually clip back my bangs with 4 bobby pins..  I only need one of these to clip my hair back, and it stays all day!!  These are pricey, but worth it if you&#x27;re looking to clip back your hair and have it stay.. Great clips!</li>
            <li> Hey, a product that does what it says, and does it well! This is a big improvement over the standard clip design. It keeps my slippery hair in place all day, and it&#x27;s so comfortable I forget it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> These clips stay in your hair, that is all you need to know. The rest fall out and are lost along the way.</li>
            <li> These look like they will hold because of the tri-prongs but they still slip. Also the color coating has already started to peel and ends up in my hair. these work best with dry hair, but I  have black woman natural hair and I require oil in my hair so the clips do not hold.</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair. As a result most barretts and clips just slip out in minutes and don&#x27;t hold. It is very frustrating. I first got these clips at my corner drugstore and was very impressed at how well they held my hair in place, and I like the color suite of the package too. I have finally lost all but two pair and went looking for more a couple weeks ago. I can&#x27;t find these clips anywhere these days except Amazon! So I&#x27;m purchasing two sets to last me the next two years. I just hope in two years I don&#x27;t regret not stocking up with more. Please don&#x27;t ever stop selling these clips!!!</li>
            <li> These are by far the best barrettes for fine hair.  Not only do they hold wonderfully, they are comfortable and do not trap or pull your hair out when you remove them.</li>
            <li> They do the job. I have that in between thing going on.  Too long bangs in my eyes are not long enough to pull back.  These will last forever and are good neutral colors.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant initially when purchasing clips like these for my hair. I was tired of only being able to work with scrunchies, and I really wanted to spice up my hairstyle repertoire. In the past when I&#x27;ve tried to take similar clips out of my hair, they&#x27;ve always managed to snag a strand and break it, ruin it, or rip it out completely. These clips got very high reviews and were very reasonably priced so I decided to buy a pack. I worried for nothing: every time I take these clips out, they come out without a fuss, and without damaging a single strand on my head! I have blonde, medium-thickness hair, and very long (hangs down to the small of my back), and all the colors looked great in their own way when I tried them out. I had to use two clips to get the hold I wanted (I really don&#x27;t want to readjust during the day) but it still looked stylish and professional. I highly recommend these hair clips.</li>
            <li> i have a thick and heavy hair so i have a hard time looking for hair clips that can hold my hair. i bought this years ago and until now, i&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> These clips work amazing!!!</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with snap clips.  I have short, straight hair that is long past its cutting date so I needed something to hold the back and sides off my neck until I could get to the hairdresser. They did exactly that. The little comb in the back helped secure the clips, they stayed put and are a great size.  The disappointment came when one broke after only a week (the top side not the comb side) and the paint, or whatever the color coating is, wore off in places. Perhaps I scraped it off by overlapping clips accidentally but I still didn&#x27;t expect them to be that fragile after a week&#x27;s worth of use.</li>
            <li> I have long, THICK hair and I think I&#x27;ve tried every type of hair clip ever made.  They always slide out or can&#x27;t hold a large enough chunk of hair.  These clips are amazing!!!  I use at least one of these almost every single day.  They feel so secure and have never fallen out.  I will never, ever buy another type of hair clip again.</li>
            <li> Love the hold on thick hair. The comb works excellently going through the hair and HOLDING - yes Holding. Only wish it was available in a more adult size length and that you could get packages in one color.</li>
            <li> I really like these!  They are a bit larger than I expected, but they do indeed hold well.</li>
            <li> I ordered these Vidal Sassoon Sure Grip Clix on line after losing one too many of the regular clips from my hair. Where do they go? Does my hair have magical powers to enchant the other clips and \\&quot;wish them into the corn field?\\&quot; In any event, as soon as these new clips arrived, I removed what was left of my old clips, and immediately replaced them with Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s brilliant clips. Hours later, after spending the day running errands, doing laundry, cooking and occasionally dancing a bit to whatever was coming from the kitchen radio, I realized that not only were the clips all present and accounted for, but my hair had not escaped to perform a devistatingly clever impression of Shirley Temple, completely without my permission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a miracle and I will buy more. Now, there is hope from the world of clips.</li>
            <li> Love these! I use them to make a little bump-it with my bangs by pulling in the hair on each side and then bringing the teeth of the clips together. They are amazing. I have been using them for over 7 years now and they are still great besides the paint chipping off.</li>
            <li> Great clips - hold hair better with more comfort!</li>
            <li> I would not buy these again.  They are difficult to open enough to put in.  There are three prongs, and it&#x27;s almost impossible to hold open all three at the same time.</li>
            <li> I thought all the teeth would have made these grip better and hold more hair than the usual ones in the store, but they do not. Easier just to pick up the typical ones in the store. They are actually better.</li>
            <li> best clips BUT they flake off their color</li>
            <li> These hold your hair however you want and they don&#x27;t tear it. Love them, highly recommend. Wish they were easier to find. Good to just hold hair away from your face or even do the bump if you want.</li>
            <li> These clips are brilliant! There are 3 prongs that hold in my loose hair and snaps in. Easy to clip on my hair and easy to take out without actually taking out small strands of my hair too. Great for martial arts for people with long hair.</li>
            <li> These work really good in my hair.  No more constantly taking out bobby pins or barrettes because they fall out.  The price seems a little high and the paint has chipped on the inside but I wear these practically every day.  Overall it is a good barrette and does not easily come out of your hair.</li>
            <li> They do a great job holding your hair back, but what I needed they are too big.</li>
            <li> These are the best clips for holding those stray hairs that fall out of my ponytail. They stay in better than any I have ever tried.  The comb feature on the bottom makes them easy to put in.  I wish you could buy a card with 6 of the same color.  Why would one person want three different colors?  I guess they hope you will buy three of these cards and toss the colors you don&#x27;t want!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, just did not work as well on my hair, liked the colors ,and was well made</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and these actually hold it in place.</li>
            <li> Really good product. Good pricing. These type of products are not that easy to find in my area anymore, so happy Amazon had them. I have fine hair, but a lot of it and these hold my hair well.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bunch of these clips at my local grocery store. Unfortunately, my daughter loves them also and is terrible about misplacing them. I can&#x27;t find them in the Dept. stores anymore and was so relieved when I found them at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, thin, curly hair and most other clips slide right through. These hold my hair in place all day and are very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;They come in several pretty colors and I ordered 4 sets (but didn&#x27;t tell my daughter-haha). She has wavy, medium-thick hair and they hold her hair in place while cheering. They&#x27;re worth the cost if you can keep track of them!</li>
            <li> These clips are extremely handy for my bangs when clipping them back. They aren&#x27;t bulky, slides through hair nicely and hot dog do these have grip! Obviously you can&#x27;t clip huge amounts of hair back, but once I&#x27;ve put them in place I don&#x27;t have to re-do my hairstyle. Does its job well. Will buy again if I feel the need to get more.    Edit: A month or so later I have still used them but the color is chipping off. A shame, but still workable.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and these really hold it in place, so I&#x27;m glad to have several to choose from</li>
            <li> I really like these clips as they are one of the only ones I&#x27;ve bought that stay in my hair and keep it clipped properly.  The colors aren&#x27;t bad, either.</li>
            <li> I love this style of clip as it stays in my hair better than most. However, the paint tends to start chipping off within a month of wearing them.</li>
            <li> Stays put, keeps all hair in, and the clips hold up for years.</li>
            <li> I have this pin only one, my friend gave me...then I was looking in store. Nothing !! I found these in Amazon, bought them and exactly what I want. Fortunately, I bought 2 sets. I&#x27;m a diver and have not really long hair but when last time I cut my hair, my hair dresser made a mistake. So, my bang and my hair need pin to stay. And if you dive, really hard to make it stay need. Mostly silicon strap ripped your hair. This pin save my hair.</li>
            <li> Disappointing and flimsy...  The clips do hold better (though only slightly better) than the standard kind that only have one prong on the back.  However, the prongs on these clips break off easily and become a sharp hazard.  My clips broke within a few days of using them.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and functional. My only compalint, a fairly substantial one, is that the color fades quickly and they are unusable in a short period of time. Otherwise, I liked them a lot.</li>
            <li> My daughter in law loves these hair clips with her long hair &amp; fly away short hair because they stay in place &amp; control her angel soft short hair.  She also uses them for her daughter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used snap clips for years, but these seem to be a step above the others.  It grabs more hair, and its grip is solid.  I have yet to have one fall off.  I even snagged my hair on a tree branch and didn&#x27;t have to go looking for the clip.  Good design.</li>
            <li> Best barrette  ever.  I use to buy them in the store but can not find them any longer.  The 3 pronged clips allow me to pin back my thick hair  without the barrette snapping open like the one pronged ones do.  This is a great addition to hair accessories!</li>
            <li> Got these to replace similar clips that would often snag my curly hair when removed. Not a problem with these. Another plus is that hair stays in place better than with other clips, especially with a little hairspray.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and these work for me.  Keeps hair back and in place.</li>
            <li> These stay in the hair better than the single ones. Can&#x27;t buy them in a store. I&#x27;m glad they are offered here.</li>
            <li> These are forget they are there comfortable! Ba bye bobby pins! Maybe Sassoon can make the same thing only bigger, that&#x27;d be fun. Great for holding back bangs all day &amp; no broken hairs when taking out! Very pleased, arrived on time too.</li>
            <li> The prongs on the back of these clips are genius.  I&#x27;ve never had clips that hold as well as these.  They appear well made.  I don&#x27;t expect I will have the problem of color chipping or peeling I&#x27;ve had with lower quality clips.  I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> When using anything metal over a period, the paint would come off and it can get bent out shape.  Too bad there&#x27;s no set of 3 pairs with just one color.</li>
            <li> These clips stay in place better than any others I&#x27;ve tried. I highly recommend them! I just wish I could get only the color I want. Tip: if your hair gets stuck when you&#x27;re trying to take the clip out of your hair, snap the clip closed again, then re-open. Before I figured out that trick I lost a few hairs in these clips!</li>
            <li> These are awesome for fine hair because they click closed pretty tight. I typically have issues with clips or barretts because they don&#x27;t hold thinner hair.  The colors in the pack would blend with all hair colors.</li>
            <li> These are the only little hair clip things that hold my bulking hair in place.</li>
            <li> Works amazing! Grips hair, does not fall out or hurt. Great quality for the price and the best clips ive ever worn. Buy these if u do pagents, floor exercises, gymnast, dy to day, tennis, pageant girls, etc. Every woman needs these they are a must.</li>
            <li> The best clips i own. Great buy!</li>
            <li> The paint chips and wears off extremely easily, but I&#x27;m impressed by how well they are staying on the hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these clips 2 years ago &amp; they were excellent.  Finally the paint wore off &amp; I ordered more.  The quality is not the same.  Some hold tight &amp; others do not.  Also the paint is now glossy &amp; cheap looking.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> These really do stay put better than other clips.</li>
            <li> These work exactly as advertised, even in my really fine soft hair..  Very happy.</li>
            <li> They are okay but still slide out of my fine hair.</li>
            <li> these are awesome clips except that the colored coating tends to come off and then they look horrible.  they do hold your hair rather well though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for these for quite some time.  The ones they sell in the store don&#x27;t hold my thick hair. - They were exactly what I wanted, and I received them quickly! :)</li>
            <li> Well made clips that firmly hold my thick, wavy hair and look nice too!</li>
            <li> They grip the hair nicely, they are perfect. They come in colors to match different hair colors.  I recommend them and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair these clips are for you....</li>
