            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Well, it sure smells nice.</li>
            <li>I have thinning and very fine hair.</li>
            <li>I also think it provides a bit more sheen to my hair.</li>
            <li>I use curler former (Magic Leverag) and this product can keep my curls around the day, it is perfect for me !!!!</li>
            <li>My hair looked thicker &amp; like there was more of it.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very soft, which isn&#x27;t good for me as I need something that will give my hair more of a sturdy texture.  </li>
            <li>I really like this adds great volume without too much work as well as my hair does not look like it is slathered in product.</li>
            <li>It absolutely provides more thickness and volume to my hair.</li>
            <li>I do, however, find the entire line a good one for my hair.</li>
            <li>Does a great job of adding volume at half the price of the designer brands.</li>
            <li>This is a super great product for anyone with fine or thin hair.  </li>

            <li>This product is great for my thin hair.</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>I have very fine, limp hair that has no inherent body to it.</li>
            <li>This is one of my new favorites.</li>
            <li>This gives me a little bit of body, it&#x27;s certainly better than nothing, but I have found that I have to use a ton of it, and it makes my hair feel a little rough (not as nice to the touch).</li>
            <li>Maybe I got an old bottle.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well without being overly sticky and stiff.</li>

            <li> Not to heavy, but heavy enough to hold.</li>
            <li> Wont be using this as my hair is now just a limp mess.</li>
            <li> Pump Up is a hard to find product in ordinary stores.</li>

            <li> I have very fine, limp hair that has no inherent body to it. This gives me a little bit of body, it&#x27;s certainly better than nothing, but I have found that I have to use a ton of it, and it makes my hair feel a little rough (not as nice to the touch). I guess life is all about tradeoffs....</li>
            <li> This is the perfect volumizer without any stickieness.</li>
            <li> This is great- it would be just as beneficial to your hair to use any shampoo or conditioner, and use this after!</li>
            <li> This is one of my new favorites. It absolutely provides more thickness and volume to my hair. I also think it provides a bit more sheen to my hair. LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Lift Root Boost &amp; Heat Protect product from the same line. Maybe I got an old bottle.</li>
            <li> I have very flat hair and constantly buy products to give my hair fullness and volume without being sticky.  This really works</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Gives body without stiffness.</li>
            <li> This product is great for my thin hair. It allows me to style it without it falling flat just a few hours later.</li>
            <li> Great product, it does work, smells great, I would buy again for sure. Very pleased, great results. good priced. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Works just like I want it to. Not to heavy, but heavy enough to hold.</li>
            <li> This is a super great product for anyone with fine or thin hair.  Pump Up is a hard to find product in ordinary stores.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make the hair brittle or sticky. Does a great job of adding volume at half the price of the designer brands.</li>
            <li> Well, it sure smells nice. Leaves my hair very soft, which isn&#x27;t good for me as I need something that will give my hair more of a sturdy texture.  I could see this working really well if you have course hair, which I don&#x27;t.  Wont be using this as my hair is now just a limp mess. Boo hoo for me.</li>
            <li> great product. Wont use anything alse</li>
