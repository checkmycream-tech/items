            <li>Love this perfume and love the price.</li>
            <li>Its fragrance is powdery uniquely and reminds me of my mother&#x27;s favorite flower violet.</li>
            <li>Such a beautiful fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is light not too strong.</li>
            <li>Of course, skin chemistry is different for each person (I can&#x27;t wear Joy or Eternity) but Flower suits me just fine - day or evening.</li>
            <li>However, the the fragrance was genuine.  </li>
            <li>Every time I travel I had always purchased this on the plane in a duty free 2 pack...</li>
            <li>refills available.</li>
            <li>Buy something else so this scent will stay out of the spot light</li>
            <li>love this scent, light, fresh, clean</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very tall bottle too!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very strong and very floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>inspections  and special packaging for shipping .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Love it,  fast shipping, thanks  :)</li>
            <li>I Love Flower and was having a hard time finding it a good price</li>
            <li>Honestly I had no clue how big 3.4 oz spray was and was so amazed at the hugeness of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>My mom really likes it and it smells like the original she bought from the department store.</li>
            <li>Amazon has it at the right price.</li>
            <li>I like this perfume very much.</li>
            <li>A sweet peppery scent:)</li>
            <li>I first bought Flower several years ago and received so many compliments, it became my go-to perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as smooth and soft and it used to be.</li>
            <li>Ordered this for my wife who really loves this scent.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s floral and very feminine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Especially when she first puts this on, I don&#x27;t want to even be in the same</li>
            <li>It is wonderfully light yet long lasting.</li>
            <li>I was hestitant about the price for such s large quantity.  </li>
            <li>but that initial blast is just too much for me.</li>
            <li>but I miss the old frosty red bottle smell.</li>
            <li>I only hope I can find a refill in 3.4 oz as so far, on Amazon, I&#x27;ve only seen the 1.6 oz.</li>

            <li> Just received my Flower by Kenzo today; what a nice very attractive scent. Something different in my&lt;br /&gt;Collection of perfumes. A sweet peppery scent:) it&#x27;s a very tall bottle too!!! Omg!!!!</li>

            <li> Easily my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> exquisite perfume smell</li>
            <li> It is ok. I like the aroma, which the same Kenzo flower I had before, but it won&#x27;t remain as long as the once I had bought at the airport.</li>
            <li> I happened upon this perfume accidentally. Best find ever!  It is wonderfully light yet long lasting.</li>
            <li> Its my favorite perfume. And to say I have many perfumes but Flowers it by far the best . Stays on all nite</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially when she first puts this on, I don&#x27;t want to even be in the same room.&lt;br /&gt;It is very strong and very floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a while, its good... but that initial blast is just too much for me.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance .  It lasts for hours without fading. I have allergies to many fragrances but not to this one . Makes me feel  good all over!!  The spray head was damaged and a portion of the perfume leaked  so there needs to be better quality control  inspections  and special packaging for shipping . Still it was a good price for this fabulous perfume!</li>
            <li> It is a favorite of my wife loves this scent .</li>
            <li> I first bought Flower several years ago and received so many compliments, it became my go-to perfume. Both women and men like  the scent. Of course, skin chemistry is different for each person (I can&#x27;t wear Joy or Eternity) but Flower suits me just fine - day or evening.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my wife who really loves this scent. Received it quickly, and in good condition. My wife is happy so I am happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing more to say about it</li>
            <li> I was late for this gift and tyou guys made it happen.  Thank you so much.  I would shop again with you.</li>
            <li> I Love Flower and was having a hard time finding it a good price but when I checked on amazon bingo what a great deal!</li>
            <li> Honestly I had no clue how big 3.4 oz spray was and was so amazed at the hugeness of the bottle.  Quite a value!</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my mom! She loved!</li>
            <li> This is my very favorite perfume and I can always count on Amazon for the best price!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Amazon!!</li>
            <li> This was a very good price and it is not a knock off, its the real deal.  Excellent value at the price.</li>
            <li> You will LOVE Flower if you love BonBon perfume.  It&#x27;s got the same candy-sweet scent with a touch of something fruity.  Very feminine, very sexy!</li>
            <li> Every time I travel I had always purchased this on the plane in a duty free 2 pack...now I like the fact that I have a rechargeable one - I only hope I can find a refill in 3.4 oz as so far, on Amazon, I&#x27;ve only seen the 1.6 oz. refills available. Hmmm....</li>
            <li> Love it. Arrived on time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK now.  It used to be the most wonderful perfume anyone around me, including myself, that has ever smelled.  The bottle has changed and so has the fragrance a bit. It&#x27;s not as smooth and soft and it used to be. Nice, but I miss the old frosty red bottle smell.</li>
            <li> I was debating on if I should write this review or not. Not a lot of people know about this scent and I receive a lot of compliments on the smell. It&#x27;s floral and very feminine. But don&#x27;t take my word for it. Buy something else so this scent will stay out of the spot light and I can keep it all for myself!</li>
            <li> The package and delivery were great, couldn&#x27;t have asked for a more prompt and efficient process.  The perfume itself is one of my favorites - lasts all day and I get compliments throughout from various different people.  My coworker who usually gets a headache from scents even enjoys it. A+ ALL around.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time!! Great even in tropical climates!! Amazon has the best price&amp;soooo easy to shop there!!</li>
            <li> I like this perfume very much. Its fragrance is powdery uniquely and reminds me of my mother&#x27;s favorite flower violet. The perfume is authentic and well stored.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance came beautifully packaged not to get damaged.</li>
            <li> Excelente producto lo recomiendo bastante, llegó en el tiempo justo y en muy buen estado, se lo recomiendo a todo aquel que quiera hacer un buen regalo</li>
            <li> This is a big bottle of perfume!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of \\&quot;FLOWER BY KENZO\\&quot; for years.  It&#x27;s light and fresh.  I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> love this scent, light, fresh, clean</li>
            <li> I bought the 3.4 oz edp kenzo flower from discountperfumes.  My mom really likes it and it smells like the original she bought from the department store.</li>
            <li> Love it,  fast shipping, thanks  :)</li>
            <li> Love this perfume and love the price.</li>
