            <li>I&#x27;ve received many compliments while wearing this scent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;She says she likes XS even better than Himalaya.  </li>
            <li>if she just said that to make me feel better about buying the cheaper XS, but  either way, she approves and I get to save $100.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>and i love it on him</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fresh clean scent that smells great.</li>
            <li>recvd fast, exactly what i ordered, and the best price on the web</li>
            <li>Very clean, fruity smell.  </li>
            <li>its smell pretty good.</li>
            <li>Amazon offered such a great price and free shipping.</li>
            <li>lighter type top - fun to snap</li>
            <li>and I think people will enjoy wearing it...</li>
            <li>arrived very well, nice fragance</li>
            <li>It still smells great, a scent that last all day and is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>too strong, not too musky, just right</li>
            <li>I have been using this for sometime now and not only was the price great, (it is much cheaper than duty free stores), but the delivery was faster than promised.</li>
            <li>Rabanne XS has several years in the market but still a good option.</li>
            <li>Wore this cologne years ago when wife and I first dated and no longer available in stores.  </li>
            <li>the bottle and sticker is not the real one!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also 3 or 4 squirts just right - lasts about 6 months&lt;</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>Service from Amazon&#x27;s source delivered as promised, am pleased with total experience.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>I was sampling various colognes for my girlfriend, so she could pick a favorite.  </li>
            <li>This was the first gift I got my husband 8 years ago.</li>
            <li>Since then, he has been wearing this perfume/fragrance every single day :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a long time,it smells clean!</li>
            <li>Thanks for hosting this product.</li>
            <li>very up set to order</li>
            <li>love this cologne, got it for my  husband, arrived just as expected.</li>
            <li>Women seem to like it, I enjoy it, and would have given it 5 stars except that it only lasts about 2.5 hours on me.</li>
            <li>My friend like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;Paco</li>
            <li>Okay, it was expected,.  </li>
            <li>My order was filled correctly and arrived when expected.</li>
            <li>this is the same exact XS fragance.</li>
            <li>is a cheap knock-off so Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li>It is a masculine floral that can be worn with confidence.  </li>
            <li>This item was bought as a present for my husband and he loved it, a very subtle aroma so not overpowering</li>
            <li>smell right but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>The Paco Rabanne that I received from Amazon.com does not have the same fragance intensity as what I previously purchased in a store near me which leads me to beliee it is a knock-off of the original product.</li>

            <li> this is fake paco xs .  the bottle and sticker is not the real one!! smell right but doesn&#x27;t last long. very up set to order</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a long time,it smells clean! I get a lot of compliment when I have it on. I try to avoid telling people the brand especially at work, so it&#x27;s not a union thing.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! The best!!!!</li>
            <li> my husband loves this fragrance and since it&#x27;s older, I usually have to buy it on line. Amazon offered such a great price and free shipping. Can&#x27;t beat that.  I will only buy it from here now. Love Amazon!</li>
            <li> my wife and i like XS&lt;br /&gt;not too strong, not too musky, just right&lt;br /&gt;i like the bottle - especially the closing snap&lt;br /&gt;zippo lighter type top - fun to snap closed - too big to snap open with one hand like a zippo, but otherwise ok&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also 3 or 4 squirts just right - lasts about 6 months&lt;br /&gt;i keep a spare, and order a new one or 2 when spare gets to half full&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;some companies won&#x27;t ship this to hawaii&lt;br /&gt;no problem with this vendor</li>
            <li> does not have the same fragance intensity as what I previously purchased.&lt;br /&gt;it is a cheap knock-off so Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I have been using this for sometime now and not only was the price great, (it is much cheaper than duty free stores), but the delivery was faster than promised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m throwing this knockoff away. Though it has the key scents of XS, they are all disproportionate and out of whack. The result is a cologne that reminds me of the XS I grew up with but also makes me cough in agony seconds later. Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller I recommend it</li>
            <li> love this cologne, got it for my  husband, arrived just as expected. love the smell and great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received many compliments while wearing this scent.  It is suitable for spring/summer.  It is a masculine floral that can be worn with confidence.  Women seem to like it, I enjoy it, and would have given it 5 stars except that it only lasts about 2.5 hours on me.</li>
            <li> EXLENT  THIS IS BEATIFUL</li>
            <li> This fregrance brings back a lot of memories. I&#x27;ve been using it since 1997 when I was 13 years old.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s somehow become \\&quot;my\\&quot; scent.&lt;br /&gt;Very good smell, but there are better out there.</li>
            <li> smells good, I like it... it does not last very long, but that is expected... will buy again and will give some as gifts and I think people will enjoy wearing it...</li>
            <li> I was sampling various colognes for my girlfriend, so she could pick a favorite.  Unfortunately, she picked Creed Himalaya, which is rather expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, I also had a sample of XS, known as the poor mans Himalaya (I prefer the term frugal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says she likes XS even better than Himalaya.  I&#x27;m not sure if she just said that to make me feel better about buying the cheaper XS, but  either way, she approves and I get to save $100.</li>
            <li> One of the best classic Eau De Toilette I ever had. I thought that this line was disconnected by Paco Rabanne years ago, but when i saw it on Amazon I had to buy it.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift and found the price to be the motivating factor in choosing amazon</li>
            <li> The Paco Rabanne that I received from Amazon.com does not have the same fragance intensity as what I previously purchased in a store near me which leads me to beliee it is a knock-off of the original product. I will not purchase this producr from Amazon.com again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E.G. Kinal</li>
            <li> It was for a present. My friend like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;Paco Rabanne XS has several years in the market but still a good option.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think I was going to find this one but I did. Had to have vintage scent from Paco Rabanne.</li>
            <li> This item was bought as a present for my husband and he loved it, a very subtle aroma so not overpowering</li>
            <li> Okay, it was expected,.  one hundred percent recommended for entire site .  Muy bien  100% recomendable, la vuelvo a comprar si fuere el caso</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Excelente 100% recomendable&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Imitation smell like incense, Is not original.</li>
            <li> its smell pretty good. there is a big issue. the perfume bottle contain trash inside.</li>
            <li> My order was filled correctly and arrived when expected.</li>
            <li> were very good my products, this again could buy more, provided the committee recommends .. the quality is awesome .. thank you very much</li>
            <li> This is either a fake Paco Rabanne XS or bad quality. I have used Paco Rabanne, Paco Rabanne XS and Armani for years and have never had a cologne that fades within 30 minutes after application. This is really bad. Trying to get Amazon to return it but will not allow as it is classified as a &amp;#34;hazardous substance&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My Dad loves this perfume. It&#x27;s one of his favorites. It&#x27;s nice and strong and has notes of woodsy musk.</li>
            <li> Excellent service! !! My husband loves this product and we are happy to find it!</li>
            <li> arrived very well, nice fragance</li>
            <li> this is the same exact XS fragance. it hasn&#x27;t change a bit. I have been using it for quite a while now.</li>
            <li> Buena, pero esperaba un poco mas</li>
            <li> I have searched for this cologne for a long time. I decided to order it through Amazon and it arrived in a timely fashion. It still smells great, a scent that last all day and is not overpowering. It&#x27;s a fresh clean scent that smells great.</li>
            <li> Absolutely I made great purchase, I recommend to you! :)</li>
            <li> This was the first gift I got my husband 8 years ago. Since then, he has been wearing this perfume/fragrance every single day :)&lt;br /&gt;He LOVES it and so do I ! It is an excellent value here, couldn&#x27;t find it cheaper anywhere else, even in Europe !</li>
            <li> me parece que el producto es muy bueno llego a tiempo y cumple con mis expectativas y hay responsabilidad lo recomiendo</li>
            <li> Wore this cologne years ago when wife and I first dated and no longer available in stores.  Very clean, fruity smell.  Not strong perfume smell that gives you a headache.</li>
            <li> recvd fast, exactly what i ordered, and the best price on the web this is the only scent he will wear and i love it on him</li>
