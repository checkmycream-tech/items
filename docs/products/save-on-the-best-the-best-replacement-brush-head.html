            <li>I love how easy they are to replace, just a quick pop on and pop off</li>

            <li>It really helps it absorb into the skin and clean it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first glance, I couldn&#x27;t see any difference between the brushes I received with my unit and these heads.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even realize they were not the real ones!</li>
            <li>These brushes were delivered super fast and ready to use.</li>
            <li>broke to keep my face clean and clear.</li>

            <li>Can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the real Clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li>I was due for a brush change, and I&#x27;m so glad I found these replacement brush heads!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found a Clarisonic brush on sale a few months back, and have loved how well it&#x27;s treated my face.</li>
            <li>You can select the heads that best fit your skin care need: sensitive skin (black), acne (green), or deep pore cleansing (blue).</li>
            <li>Having said that, the low price makes it worth it since you can buy about three of these for every one of the Clarisonic products.</li>
            <li>I no longer purchase the real ones and I buy only from  with this company.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this more economical alternative to expensive name brand brush</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome! Second time I have purchased these. Will order again!</li>
            <li> I love the Clarasonic and these heads work great. I rep[lace them every season and that seems to work well for mr.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are good, but I don&#x27;t think they are as good as the Clarisonic products.  Having said that, the low price makes it worth it since you can buy about three of these for every one of the Clarisonic products.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t  tell the difference</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:4e3f2b3f3c4de9ea59c97d183a984a01]] I found a Clarisonic brush on sale a few months back, and have loved how well it&#x27;s treated my face. I was due for a brush change, and I&#x27;m so glad I found these replacement brush heads!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first glance, I couldn&#x27;t see any difference between the brushes I received with my unit and these heads. The plastic is sturdy and tough, and I have to worries about it cracking. The fibers in the brushes feel super-soft and they spin without any resistance! They&#x27;re as easy to clean as my original brush heads and the tops are vented so that they dry easily and evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I found a reliable replacement that doesn&#x27;t have an extravagant price tag on it! I did receive this product at a discount but price doesn&#x27;t change how well these brushes work, nor does it effect my review.</li>
            <li> just like the Clairsonic brush heads. Very good, vibration is the same as the original Clairsonic.</li>
            <li> i just loved the way they work and I thought it was very easy to use</li>
            <li> fits perfect  thank you</li>
            <li> Not my best Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li> Love these! They fit perfectly, and my face feels so clean now as opposed to a washcloth. I love using this with my face wash. It really helps it absorb into the skin and clean it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s time to get new brushes, I always go to SAVE on the BEST. These brushes were delivered super fast and ready to use. I love how easy they are to replace, just a quick pop on and pop off and you’re ready to go. They are just as described and clean your face with a soft, deep clean. I have bought replacement brushes other places but they just don&#x27;t compare. This is where I will be getting all my replacement needs in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads for facial brushes like the clairsonic cost a fortune. I was happy to find this set offered at a fair price.  These heads seem to be as well made as brand name heads, but just cost a fraction of the price.  Each pack comes with 2 heads. You can select the heads that best fit your skin care need: sensitive skin (black), acne (green), or deep pore cleansing (blue). The heads snap on to my brush with no problem.  I would definitely recommend this more economical alternative to expensive name brand brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for sharing my honest and unbiased review. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price</li>
            <li> I had asked my mother to buy me Clarisonic replacement brushes and I ended up with these. She took them out of the packaging  I didn&#x27;t even realize they were not the real ones! My mom told me about a month later. After she told me I was pretty shocked. I no longer purchase the real ones and I buy only from  with this company. It feels just as  fine as the real ones In Fact I think that it is the rel brand. I highly recommend these if you are looking for a good set of brush heads that are going to do the job just as well as the branded ones. Great purchase</li>
            <li> I have a Clarisonic Mia, purchased a few years ago. These replacement brush heads worked perfectly with it. They are just as good as the real brand. Special good customer service. I recommend this for anyone looking for a good Clarisonic replacement brush for a dicounted price. I am Very happy to have these available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> These work great for my Mia2 and are not as expensive as the ones in the dermatologist&#x27;s office!! I can&#x27;t tell the difference!!</li>
            <li> I hate how expensive my clarisonic brushes are. The thing itself is over $150, why should I have to pay between $20-30 just to replace the brush part?! That&#x27;s why I am so glad I found these. Unless someone told you, you wouldn&#x27;t even know they aren&#x27;t legit. The brushes are super duper soft. They foam up most cleansers. They fit onto my clairsonic with no issues. They didn&#x27;t wiggle or anything. Just like the expensive ones, you can pop out the middle and just use the outside part. I definitely recommend these instead of the expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free in order to give my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> very happy with them!!</li>
            <li> Fit just as good as the original, and lots cheaper!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the real Mia&#x27;s...they last just as long at over 1/2 of the price...try them one time and you will not be dissapointed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and usable. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the real Clarisonic brush heads. I am really glad I found these because it means I don&#x27;t have to go broke to keep my face clean and clear. Oh and the customer service is good, too. I remember a while back one of the brush heads broke and without any questions, they sent me new ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so sad that Clarisonic is so expensive and the heads aren&#x27;t any cheaper - for what you&#x27;re getting. I was very thrilled when I came across these in hopes that I&#x27;ve found the loop hole of being about to continue to use my Clarisonic and not have my wallet hate me to replace the heads. These heads are so very soft to the touch and work wonderfully. My sister also has a Clarisonic and couldn&#x27;t believe that they weren&#x27;t the real deal and that they costed less than half of a Clarisonic one.. and I got two. I&#x27;ve been using a replacement head for a little over 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve yet to have any issues with them. I did receive this at a discounted rate for my unbiased review. My opinion was not influenced by the discount that I received.</li>
