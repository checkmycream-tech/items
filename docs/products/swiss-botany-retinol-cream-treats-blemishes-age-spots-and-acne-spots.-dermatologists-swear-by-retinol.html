            <li>There are a so many types of Retinol creams out there at all kinds of price points.</li>
            <li>Many products you can buy in beauty departments or stores don&#x27;t offer that.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I will buy again:)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but I must say that I am surprisingly pleased with seeing quick results!</li>
            <li>so just the fact that the first morning I woke up after applying it the night before, my face and neck were soft - was awesome --</li>
            <li>STRONG RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.</li>
            <li>I can see my fine lines looking alot softer.</li>
            <li>I would put on top of this a super moisturizer.</li>
            <li>You take off the lid and it has a pump, which I absolutely love because it&#x27;s easy to get the product out and gives you the right amount.  </li>
            <li>Silky smooth.</li>
            <li>it makes my face smooth.</li>
            <li>I have the eye gel and the vitamin c advanced serum as well.  </li>
            <li>The serum soaks in and your skin gets smooth.</li>
            <li>Moisturizer is light and just a dab will cover your face.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and is virtually odor free.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that after just a few weeks using this serum, my skin looks great without it.</li>

            <li>Okay -- I am actually pretty amazed by this product.  </li>
            <li>I just love this product goes on smoothly and gentle for sensetive skin , I put in on at night before going to bed and makes my face smoother and firmer and at 48 thats a plus .</li>
            <li>It also have a nice consistency and no harsh smells.</li>
            <li>The pump dispenses nicely &amp; there&#x27;s no waste.  </li>
            <li>Love this product - goes on well and feel like it makes a real difference</li>
            <li>The retinol really helps turnover the cells on top to minimize clogged pores, which I suffer from and result in pimples.  </li>
            <li>The moisturizer is absorbed quickly and leaves my face and neck feeling so smooth.  </li>
            <li>I review products here on Amazon and have received some great items, but this is one of only a handful that I really will reorder and pay full price for.  </li>
            <li>Feels good on skin, absorbs good, I haven&#x27;t used long enough to see results though.  </li>

            <li>See my pictures because I can clearly see a difference :-)</li>
            <li>A nice mid weight product.</li>
            <li>Little to no smell and goes on very nicely.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually buy any of these kinds of products because I honestly think most of the claims are rubbish.</li>
            <li>My laugh lines have definitely improved since using this product and that is huge for me !</li>
            <li>Its nice to know that if you are spending this kind of money on a product they stand behind their words.</li>
            <li>Love that I picked this up and will be placing another order when I get low on this product!  </li>
            <li>Anything that works on almost 60 year old skin is fantastic in my book</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a lot of various serums &amp; having an actual cream to use is a nice change!  </li>
            <li>This provides more younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>It make my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Third, it does work pretty well.</li>
            <li>Not heavy or light.</li>
            <li>The fine lines around my eyes are starting to fade.</li>
            <li>It smoothes fine lines for a younger looking face!</li>
            <li>This serum absorbs right into my skin and does not sit on top making a greasy mess.  </li>
            <li>For an over the counter type retinal cream it work really well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week, and I really like it.</li>
            <li>makes it so much easier for me.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much tighter but and smoother.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really seen much improvement since using this product for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>This product has worked fantastic over the last week to reduce the frown lines I had on my forehead.</li>
            <li>I really hope it minimize my pores and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, the cream absorbs very well and does not leave my skin with any greasy residue.</li>
            <li>the product is lightweight and soaks in very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First this cream is very easy to dispense and control without waste.</li>
            <li>the fine lines around my eyes and mouth really are harder to see!?  </li>
            <li>I really like how soft it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li>Useful for the entire face.</li>
            <li>so although this product absorbs quickly and does what it should, my skin needs additional moisture and softening in the winter dry air.  </li>
            <li>Swiss Botany makes wonderful products and I have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li>Left soft skin, I would recommend this to anyone interested in skincare.</li>
            <li>I have a few fine lines and wrinkles, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in that yet.</li>
            <li>It is so soft.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li>I would put this on at night and first thing in the morning before any other moisturizers or make up .</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling tight and fresh</li>
            <li>I have been using foundation daily for nearly 30 years</li>
            <li>I used it to help combat my crows feet and laugh lines and over the period of a few weeks have had noticeable results.</li>
            <li>Only used this product 1 week at night time and can see a slight positive &amp;#34;something&amp;#34;: I usually wait to use the whole bottle before reviewing</li>

            <li> skin is really dry (and acne prone -such a pain)</li>

            <li> My skin absorbs this right away and isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t give you clogged pores or leave behind any redness or irritation at all.  </li>

            <li> Silky smooth. Nourishes skin !! It&#x27;s great I  Use it morning and night.  It is clinical strength and absorbs into my skin w/o a greasy feel</li>
            <li> it smells good. I feel good after using it. it makes my face smooth.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described</li>
            <li> I have the eye gel and the vitamin c advanced serum as well.  I feel they compliment each other and keep making my skin healthier with each use.  My skin was very dry before I started using this.</li>
            <li> For what I paid for the item was disappointed with the serum.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom and she loves it.</li>
            <li> 4/29/15&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product to remove dark spots on my forehead and back and I have not seen results. I was expecting to see results within 2 weeks. I will continue to use this product to the very end as it was expensive. The product was a great moisturizer and did not leave my skin feeling oily.&lt;br /&gt;Update:6/14/15&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint now is the price but at least it works! Money well spent. Now I can put on my swimsuit with confidence. See my pictures because I can clearly see a difference :-)</li>
            <li> this cream works great. I love it.</li>
            <li> Love that I picked this up and will be placing another order when I get low on this product!  My skin feels and looks amazing!</li>
            <li> Left soft skin, I would recommend this to anyone interested in skincare.</li>
            <li> For an over the counter type retinal cream it work really well</li>
            <li> Great product. Goes on smoothly, not sticky. Already noticing improvement in my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week, and I really like it. I usually have dry, flaky skin and it keeps my skin moisturize and smoother. It also have a nice consistency and no harsh smells. I would really recommended this product if your are looking for something with a light weight formula that Get the job done. This is all my own opinion of this amazing product!</li>
            <li> Best &amp; Strongest!!! Love this Retinol Serum product !!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> This serum absorbs right into my skin and does not sit on top making a greasy mess.  I really like how soft it makes my skin feel and I am noticing less wrinkles around my eyes and my lips also.  I am very pleased with this retinol serum.</li>
            <li> I have tried other retinol serums and I have to say this by far is the best I have tried so far!  I received this at a discounted rate to try but that doesn&#x27;t affect my opinion at all, if I don&#x27;t like something I let people know.  My skin absorbs this right away and isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t give you clogged pores or leave behind any redness or irritation at all.  This comes packaged in a box and the bottled itself is wrapped with that hard plastic with the perforated line to take it off.  You take off the lid and it has a pump, which I absolutely love because it&#x27;s easy to get the product out and gives you the right amount.  I have arthritis in my hands so to have a facial moisturizer with a pump makes it so much easier for me.  This moisturizer has no smell either.  I have been telling all my friends about this stuff because I honestly do love it!  If you get the chance, I would definitely recommend you try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Feels very smooth on your skin.  Really nice.</li>
            <li> Great product! Wife loves it. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Swiss Botany makes wonderful products and I have never been disappointed. The serum soaks in and your skin gets smooth. Anything that works on almost 60 year old skin is fantastic in my book</li>
            <li> I love retinol cream and can&#x27;t live without it. I have tried many and this one is by far one of the best. Absorbs well into the skin. Makes my skin feel and look amazing. The fine lines around my eyes are starting to fade. My skin feels so much tighter but and smoother. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen much improvement since using this product for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> This product has worked fantastic over the last week to reduce the frown lines I had on my forehead. Im still using this nightly and hope to see even greater results!</li>
            <li> Feels lovely, smells wonderful, not sticky or oily. All around awesome!</li>
            <li> Okay -- I am actually pretty amazed by this product.  I review products here on Amazon and have received some great items, but this is one of only a handful that I really will reorder and pay full price for.  I have used it nightly for only five nights and to my surprise I can actually SEE a difference!  I am over fifty and have very dry skin so just the fact that the first morning I woke up after applying it the night before, my face and neck were soft - was awesome -- but here&#x27;s the thing, after only five nights the fine lines around my eyes and mouth really are harder to see!?  Also I have some discoloration/spots on my cheek and those seem to be fading.  I received this product in exchange for an honest review and I am honestly impressed.</li>
            <li> I only tried this product for a few days. I do feel like it does tighten my skin. I really hope it minimize my pores and wrinkles. I can&#x27;t wait for the results in a few weeks. Shipping took about a few days. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Feels good on the skin!</li>
            <li> I got this as a promotional item. I was skeptical that it would work. After the first week of use, my skin feels amazing! It is so soft. My skin tone looks much more even. I have a few fine lines and wrinkles, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in that yet. I just absolutely love the way this product makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Moisturizer is light and just a dab will cover your face. Doesn&#x27;t leave your face sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer!  This cream does indeed absorb into the skin.  It feels refreshing &amp; it doesn&#x27;t have a scent to me.  I&#x27;ve been using a lot of various serums &amp; having an actual cream to use is a nice change!  The pump dispenses nicely &amp; there&#x27;s no waste.  Quite a lot of uses in the bottle.  I&#x27;ll be using this for a quite a while-Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> it seems to increase the elasticity of the skin, which reduces wrinkles in the skin. This provides more younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying this face cream. Goes on smoothly and is virtually odor free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this retinol serum for just over two weeks and I can already see and feel a difference in my skin.  The moisturizer is absorbed quickly and leaves my face and neck feeling so smooth.  My face looks brighter and my skin tone is much more even.  I have been using foundation daily for nearly 30 years and I can honestly say that after just a few weeks using this serum, my skin looks great without it.</li>
            <li> This is a great eye serum!  It smoothes fine lines for a younger looking face!</li>
            <li> Nice product! Firms skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty residue.</li>
            <li> Only used this product 1 week at night time and can see a slight positive &amp;#34;something&amp;#34;: I usually wait to use the whole bottle before reviewing but I must say that I am surprisingly pleased with seeing quick results! I will keep on using and probably re-order it!</li>
            <li> I just love this product goes on smoothly and gentle for sensetive skin , I put in on at night before going to bed and makes my face smoother and firmer and at 48 thats a plus . I can see my fine lines looking alot softer.</li>
            <li> i just discovered this and I  like it</li>
            <li> Love this serum! It make my skin feel so soft and smooth. I apply it at night, and it feels great in the morning. It absorbs quickly.. I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling tight and fresh</li>
            <li> I wanted to actually use this awhile before the review so I could give good feedback. This is such an amazing product. I would put this on at night and first thing in the morning before any other moisturizers or make up . I noticed after 3 weeks my skin is firmer and looks like it has a glow from within. People I work with have also commented on the difference . I am so glad I decided to try this product and will most likely repurchase. My laugh lines have definitely improved since using this product and that is huge for me !</li>
            <li> Not overly wrapt in this</li>
            <li> Great Retinol Serum.  Arrived quickly, and it was a great price.</li>
            <li> AFTER I RECEIVED  THIS SWISS BOTANY RETINOL MOISTURIZER ,  I USED IT. FEEL SO GOOD. THIS IS GREAT PRODUCTS. STRONG RECOMMEND TO ANYONE. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS AT DISCOUNT PRICE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week. No breakouts(I always have to worry about that) and my skin already looks like it&#x27;s improved</li>
            <li> This product Increases elasticity, firms and plumps my skin around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;It hydrated my delicate eye area I can definitely feel the difference.&lt;br /&gt;It Useful for the entire face. It can be applied all over my face for an enhanced glow and a more radiant looking face. I love how my face  was very nice and pleasant  after I used this and the great thing about this product it does not dry out you&#x27;re face like some products I used in the past. It 5 stars for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product - goes on well and feel like it makes a real difference</li>
            <li> I am very happy with Swiss Botany serum.  The pump makes it very easy to dispense, This hydrates your skin and within a couple of weeks you will notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few weeks now so I feel I can now give a fair review. There are a so many types of Retinol creams out there at all kinds of price points. It is so hard to navigate which one to use, which ones work, ect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First this cream is very easy to dispense and control without waste. The pump allows it to be dispensed without having to use a dropper or dip your fingers in a container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the cream absorbs very well and does not leave my skin with any greasy residue. It doesn&#x27;t have a heavy scent either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, it does work pretty well. I used it to help combat my crows feet and laugh lines and over the period of a few weeks have had noticeable results. I honestly was shocked. I don&#x27;t usually buy any of these kinds of products because I honestly think most of the claims are rubbish. I was amazed that this cream worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, they do offer a money back guarantee. Its nice to know that if you are spending this kind of money on a product they stand behind their words. Many products you can buy in beauty departments or stores don&#x27;t offer that. So you are stuck with a worthless product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Feels good on skin, absorbs good, I haven&#x27;t used long enough to see results though.  Packaging was good, shipping on time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week now and I already see a difference. My skin has a glow about it and seems firmer. the product is lightweight and soaks in very well. I will buy again:)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It works awesome and does the job.</li>
            <li> Great product, absorbed quickly, no scent.  The retinol really helps turnover the cells on top to minimize clogged pores, which I suffer from and result in pimples.  I finally  came to the conclusion that I need a retinol product both day (with spf) and night.  I also switch around several serums underneath it (vitamin C and other brightening serum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results so far:  less blocked pores and much less acne breakout (still get 1 monthly...);  some age spot lightening, but not super noticeable yet (I read that it takes about 3 months for a product to show this effect).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is really dry (and acne prone -such a pain) so although this product absorbs quickly and does what it should, my skin needs additional moisture and softening in the winter dry air.  I would put on top of this a super moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great product, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Little to no smell and goes on very nicely. A nice mid weight product. Not heavy or light.</li>
            <li> This stuff Rocks! My skin looks better, my skin feels better and I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
