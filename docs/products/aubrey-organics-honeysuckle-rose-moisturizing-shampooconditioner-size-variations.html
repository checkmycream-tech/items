            <li>I loved ,loved this stuff.</li>
            <li>Additonally Honeysuckle Rose has a great fragrance.</li>
            <li>Some of the the others dont smell as good as this one</li>
            <li>if you wish to switch to an honeysuckle organic shampoo,this is a good option.</li>
            <li>My hair looks so good</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells so good</li>
            <li>The honeysuckle rose conditioner is a must-have for follow up to prevent fly-aways, but the combination works great for me.  </li>
            <li>the good that it does to my hair</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what it smells like to me after, which is nice lol.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has made a good difference.</li>
            <li>The conditioner helped combat the dryness of the shampoo, but it&#x27;s not an exceptional conditioner.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, cleans good, conditions good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I tried this product.</li>
            <li>and I liked that it&#x27;s fairly natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad I made the purchase!</li>
            <li>I love organic products!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so in love, I hope they continue to make this forever!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work for all hair types, that is for sure!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Smell is very nice, very rare in Audbery shampoo and conditioner family:)&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning power is good.</li>
            <li>I was trying to order the Honeysuckle Rose CONDITIONER but ordered the shampoo instead.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d hear so many good things about this shampoo</li>
            <li>(honeysucke rose)  </li>
            <li>but I still wouldn&#x27;t describe it as nice, to my tastes at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The after smell is light and pleasant, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, light floral scent.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, love the performance of this shampoo!</li>
            <li>The Honeysuckle rose shampoo is ok.</li>
            <li>this by far is the best I have found.</li>
            <li>My favorite is Honeysuckle Rose</li>
            <li>My youngest son has very fine hair, so</li>
            <li>This is an excellent shampoo that has a lovely, soft scent.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning wise, it strips my hair clean to the point</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t produce foamy bubbles like most shampoo</li>
            <li>He has tried so many dandruff shampoos over many years.  </li>
            <li>then I recommend you follow up the shampoo with a better smelling conditioner.</li>
            <li>Your hair mostly holds the smell of the conditioner anyway.</li>
            <li>I have used many of the Aubrey hair care products and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair as shiny, bouncy and healthy looking as my Pantene used to.  </li>
            <li>my hair feels so wonderful, next time around, I will be purchasing both the shampoo and conditioner for even a better outcome.</li>
            <li>Now I am trying it again, and so glad.</li>
            <li>I love how my hair feels now and, as I said, I LOVE the smell.</li>
            <li>the chemical shampoos were more moisturizing than this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love aohsr conditioner and by mistake picked up the shampoo...</li>
            <li>It was ok on my daughter&#x27;s hair but worked much better for me.</li>
            <li>It drys out your hair, be sure to use a conditioner after.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I guess I like lathering more than I realized.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating and makes you hair look great.</li>
            <li>But it lathers better than most organic shampoos.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not awful, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>I love that this is made without sodium laurel sulphate</li>
            <li>it worked just OK for me, but for my daughter - ugh.</li>
            <li>They are remarkable and for the FIRST time I am getting what I expect from a product.</li>
            <li>The fact that the products are also safe for my hair and my health is reason to celebrate.</li>
            <li>Try these products your hair will feel heathier and have a better texture than you could have imagined.</li>
            <li>So many cosmetic products are toxic nowadays.</li>
            <li>, However, the lather doesn&#x27;t slide around your scalp at all since there is no silicone, so you end up having to use more of the product to get the shampoo evenly distributed.  </li>
            <li>Of all the Aubrey organic shampoos I have tried, this is the one I most prefer.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After shampooing, I apply its pairing conditioner, which is also ok.</li>
            <li>would love to find something that also manage my hair</li>
            <li>When I decided to go with sodium lauryl sulfate free shampoos, I tried the Himalaya Herbal Healthcare brand and liked it.</li>
            <li>Definatly try it. :)</li>
            <li>When I used the shampoo I was worried because it didn&#x27;t feel nice on my hair after rinsing, and the conditioner didn&#x27;t really feel like it was doing any good either.</li>
            <li>I find that while the smell of this shampoo is okay, it doesn&#x27;t suds...</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Chamomile sounds much more mild smelling than rose, so we&#x27;ll see how that goes.  </li>
            <li>I also love it, and love the fact that it&#x27;s sulfate free &amp; biodegradable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Furthermore, this shampoo leaves my hair clean, shiny and silky!</li>
            <li>smells fantastic and gets my hair nice and clean</li>
            <li>I used to love Aubrey products and think they smell fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I originally tried this product because I love the scent, but gave up because it doesn&#x27;t work like Pantene.</li>
            <li>For those of you that type, i have 4a/b type hair that gets tangle easily.</li>
            <li>Soap and lotion are easy, but I was unsure how the shampoo would go.  </li>
            <li>but I felt like I needed more just to be clean.</li>
            <li>The shampoo worked for its intended purpose, however I felt the sent was really strong.</li>
            <li>Does not have a strong fragrance</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re fine in a pinch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfectly fine product, cleans hair well just like the rosa mosqueta shampoo -</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as being an effective shampoo, this is very good at de-greasing and just in general, cleaning I guess.</li>
            <li>Aubrey Organics, however, is truly amazing, because I&#x27;ve been using it for what must be over a year now with the same great results as I had at first.</li>
            <li>Again, the floral scent is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable using this product.</li>
            <li>But this is a gentle, nice smelling shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is one of those products that must be used with the matching ( and fabulous) conditioner as it suggests or another moisturizing one of your choice.</li>
            <li>The only product I ever was happy with was Head &amp; Shoulders</li>
            <li>Works great if used with the conditioner from same company .  </li>
            <li>I am looking for products that don&#x27;t have all the chemicals and paraben free ...and this won&#x27;t work for me...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather because It truly is sulfate free.</li>
            <li>People just need to remember that sulfate free shampoos are NOT going to foam up like</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair soft and smells really good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really upsetting that they ruined such a perfect product.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a good natural shampoo and</li>
            <li>Going Natural is very popular right now in oru community</li>
            <li>I felt like blow-drying my hair which I don&#x27;t often do, and from the very first section I was stunned at how silky and easily manageable</li>
            <li>This stuff is not expensive at all, just couple bucks more.</li>
            <li>It did not perform magic with my hair, but I&#x27;m so pleased to have found a shampoo that cleans well, smells fantastic, and has all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>and I was excited because I read the reviews on this product</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I saw that this product was organic, and could not wait to get home to try it.</li>
            <li>and I hope this review can help others decide whether the product is worth a try or not!</li>
            <li>The shampoo is sulfate and paraben free and has many other good ingredients listed.    </li>
            <li>I read so many positive reviews that I was extremely excited to try this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It achieves its goal which is to get the hair clean.</li>
            <li>and it does clean the hair without stripping.</li>
            <li>My hair was clean, my scalp didnt feel as itchy as before I started but my hair felt like it had been washed with detergent.</li>
            <li>Clean your scalp with it and it will work its way through the rest of your hair as you rinse it out.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work like mainstream shampoos because it doesn&#x27;t have the poisonous lathering ingredients, but it gets your hair just as clean once you learn to use it.</li>
            <li>A lot of shampoos contain it however because ppl like the thought of suds and equate it to clean hair</li>
            <li>Its all-natural formula gets my hair clean and leaves it smelling floral and feminine.</li>
            <li>I really was not super happy but the smell is nice</li>
            <li>nothing special really stood out for me to be truthful</li>
            <li>I also tried it on both of my daughters&#x27; hair, tried leaving the conditioner on longer for deep condition, and have waited until 2 months after use to write this review just to be fair.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this shampoo because I LOVED the white camellia shampoo.</li>
            <li>Cleanses my hair really well without the suds but not the most moisturizing shampoo.</li>
            <li>Have you ever drank sweet aloe juice you might find in some oriental grocery store?</li>
            <li>They are all fantastic and worth the price.</li>
            <li>And it leave my kinky hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t notice how incredible my hair felt until I dried it off.</li>
            <li>this much good from one simple sitting</li>
            <li>Cleans hair well; helped with oily issue on my scalp; somewhat cured my frizzy ends; after about a month of use my hair is much more healthy than it used to be; no chemicals    CONS: Kind of expensive; texture is runny, but not unbearable in my opinion; the scent is not that great, but I can live with it; I have to use quite a bit to work through my medium/long hair;</li>
            <li>So here&#x27;s a quick breakdown   PROS:</li>
            <li>Aubrey organic products were recommended in a book about fighting against cancer with healthy foods (vegetables, seeds, grains, legumes and mainly vegetable juices)and using organic products for our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and makes my hair feel great and use it on my dogs hair since he has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to Burt&#x27;s Bees super shiny mango shampoo.</li>
            <li>Luckily the smell doesn&#x27;t linger so I will finish the bottle, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair</li>
            <li>but I am very pleased just the same!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that I&#x27;ve finally found a good natural line that actually works!</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t be using this again as the strong odor was just too much for me.</li>
            <li>this shampoo worked excellent on my natural black hair.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised this is such a great shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair without much body</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with it and highly recommend for anyone whose looking for a natural cleanser for their hair.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and has kept my hair soft and smooth through the winter thus far.</li>
            <li>But it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>In the meantime I am still using the Rose - the smell is not enough of a deterrent to make me stop using it.</li>
            <li>I love that it is Natural.  </li>
            <li>no sulfur shampoo worth trying</li>
            <li>I recently moved to creating my own organic shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>frizzes though!no success yet</li>
            <li>I am pleased that it has natural ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very good my natural curls came back no more losing hair in sink spread the word good price</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s safe to use on color treated hair in addition to being formulated without all the other harmful ingredients found in most shampoos.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this shampoo is ok; it does what it is meant to do which is to get the hair clean.</li>
            <li>Just not the right one for me.</li>
            <li>but in a very squeaky clean</li>
            <li>But what the scent is actually coming from is probably all those floral and herbal extracts, because this shampoo has no green tea in it whatsoever :P</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, you need SO MUCH product to feel clean with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This shampoo lathers well with just a little bit of product, and has a pleasant (and flowery) fragrance.</li>
            <li>I used Aubrey Organics Calaguala Fern Shampoo previously and loved it (I don&#x27;t need lather; I like organic).</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is probably the best-smelling shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used in my life -- granted I love the smell of fruit like mangoes, peaches and pears, there&#x27;s just something EVEN BETTER about the smell of green tea in a shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, wavy hair that easily detangles in the shower-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to Aubrey Organics and after using some of their other products, I get the feeling their products work best when you use them together especially the shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>me, this shampoo smells very intensely like a mix of really really nice green tea and a hint of aloe juice or something -- and it smells pretty sweet.</li>
            <li>It left my hair even more brittle feeling and</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed, after washing my hair I almost did not need to use a conditioner.</li>
            <li>I saw the difference in the first try.</li>
            <li>After i was finished, my hair was soooo soft, moisturized, and drops of water were glistening in the light on my hair.</li>
            <li>I did a hot oil treatment with coconut oil first and then commenced with the shampooing.</li>
            <li>Nothing ever made my hair feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I may not buy this again, but I plan on exploring more of Aubrey organics extensive shampoo formulas.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Aubrey organic products!!</li>
            <li>but with this I&#x27;ve actually been having to brush my hair in the shower with the conditioner in, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s still breaking like a mother.&lt;br /&gt;Booooo.</li>
            <li>messy(dont have the exact word for that...</li>
            <li>I like the scent, and for an organic shampoo it does lather/sud pretty well</li>
            <li>This may work for some hair textures but be aware that your hair may not react well and could fall out.</li>
            <li>After the first lather my hair felt stripped of any moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave up dying along with blow-drying as my first step.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m pretty amazed -</li>
            <li>If it bothers me when I use it regularly I&#x27;ll just mix in another oil to make it smell better.</li>
            <li>In all fairness, this was my first foray into a less-chemical shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to shampoo and have been looking for a moisturizing organic shampoo for years.</li>
            <li>, I applied the AO Honeysuckle Rose conditioner and it returned the moisture which enabled me to detangle without effort and minimal hair loss.</li>
            <li>This is all natural and good for people with sensitive skin and sensitive noses.  </li>
            <li>Certainly not honeysuckle or rose scented.</li>
            <li>once I&#x27;ve washed it because it leaves your hair squeaky clean and not slick at all.  </li>
            <li>As mucb as I want to be natural, my hair is very long and needs to look good.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo did suds up for me and it left my hair very clean.</li>
            <li>Probably because when I think green tea, I think CLEANSING -- whereas mangoes peaches and pears, sure they&#x27;re very sweet and healthy, but if you were to slather yourself with those sweet fruits (instead of wet green tea bags), you&#x27;d probably get all sticky and kind of yucky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most importantly, when I use it I have little to no troble with dandruff</li>
            <li>I suffer with seborrheic dermatitis and since using this natural product the flaky scaly scalp has reduced significantly.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t expect a huge later like traditional shampoo that pulls all the natural oil out but a nice gentle lather with a great cleanse, I highly recommend this line for anyone with long, dry and easy to tangle hair</li>
            <li>I can observe my hair is soft and clean after usage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Now, if only I could find a good alternate shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li>If you want a shampoo that really is natural (unlike most shampoos from so-called natural companies), try any Aubrey Organics shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I am always on the hunt for natural products to help my hair stay moisturized and be as nice as possible.</li>
            <li>I got ready to use it the first time and it came out of the bottle like water, ran throug my fingers, etc.  </li>
            <li>However, my hair eventually got used to the shampoo, making it less effective.</li>
            <li>Thank you Aubrey Organics for creating such a lovely natural shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>This is the first time trying both shampoo and conditioner and highly recommend both.</li>
            <li>and together they make a great team, the shampoo didn&#x27;t leave my hair with the usual slickness from typical shampoos which I loved but it wasn&#x27;t overly dry either.</li>
            <li>My husband had eczema on his scalp and dandruff that was increasing so much so that it fell on his shoulders like snow.  </li>
            <li>A tip, make sure your hair is REALLY WET</li>
            <li>I was looking for a chemical free shampoo because chemicals such as sulfates give me dandruff.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for it.  </li>
            <li>I really want to like Aubrey Organics products</li>
            <li>BUT the saving grace for this product is when used with its conditioner (or another very moisturizing one of your choosing)</li>
            <li>Typically I primarily use conditioner only, but even the Aubrey conditioner issn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>My whole family uses this shampoo, myself, my teen-aged daughter &amp; my husband.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed with the way that this product reacted with my hair.  </li>
            <li>It cleans well but gently.</li>
            <li>I have corse hair, very dense, with medium thickness.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really care for this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Maybe I have unusual hair</li>
            <li>or I received a defective product, but there is absolutely NOTHING moisturizing about this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This has a matching conditioner that works really well, too.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li>Companies do not have to disclose what they are really using.</li>
            <li>It lathers, but very well.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>I am very light-skinned to begin with, so all of this redness just shined like a very unwanted beacon.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I combed the conditioner gently through my hair and rinsed it out at the end of my shower.</li>
            <li>However I do feel that this and its conditioner really works well with my hair type</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did leave my hair very tangled;however</li>
            <li>He ran out of his dandruff shampoo and used my Honeysuckle Rose and after using a few times he no longer has ANY dandruff.  </li>
            <li>Finally in my efforts to use something more natural and organic still, I tried this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>mom, with same hair but more naturally oily, doesn&#x27;t like the conditioner but uses the shampoo by itself when visiting and loves it.  </li>
            <li>If you like a good, thick lather, you won&#x27;t like this.  </li>
            <li>But luckily, you only smell it while shampooing and once your hair dries the smell is pretty much gone.  </li>
            <li>I am going to experiment with some other shampoos in the Aubrey line to see if any have a better fragrance.  </li>
            <li>(since this shampoo doens&#x27;t have the harmful suds-creating ingredient that most other soaps have)</li>
            <li>but I also have and love GP Protein, Island Naturals and one other that escapes me at the moment.</li>
            <li>Sometime in my middle 30s, my hair had turned almost pure white, became very resistant to dye, very brittle and had thinned to the point that you could see way more of my scalp than anyone should.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m highly amazed at how good my hair feels after using this shampoo because I&#x27;ve used other organic shampoos that left my hair so opaque and lifeless.</li>
            <li>It definitely felt clean as it felt stripped of everything, which is why I couldn&#x27;t give it a 1 star rating...</li>
            <li>My hair felt clean, but no cleaner and healthier than with my regular Aussie products.</li>
            <li>anyone who has never tried a sulfate free shampoo, it is extremely low lathering, it takes some getting used to, but that is normal.</li>
            <li>I have really fine, completely straight, fairly dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Plus, I didn&#x27;t need as much having short hair, so I wanted something good with less chemicals.</li>
            <li>and that is the one main thing that I don&#x27;t like about this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I like this one in particular for it&#x27;s scent.  </li>
            <li>The main point is, this stuff works for me</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will say that before I used these two products, I had done a deep cleansing and balancing/conditioning treatment in order to fix the foundations of my hair as much as possible, so this also adds to the reasons why my hair is feeling much better than before.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product along with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all of the shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>so after very thorough reviewing of  this product I decided that there were more positive reviews than negative reviews.</li>
            <li>let me tell you this stuff completely strips your hair!!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, the ingredients are decent, and the conditioner that comes with it is so thick it feels like body butter..</li>
            <li>I was excited to use it, but when I did it made my hair feel extremely dry.</li>
            <li>OK, let me set the scene with the mess that my hair was before I started my new haircare regime.</li>
            <li>But you&#x27;d be surprised how fast you get used to it.</li>
            <li>and that should help you get a few more suds.</li>
            <li>Regardless, this is a purchase I don&#x27;t think went to waste. :)</li>
            <li>I have really nice thick hair</li>
            <li>I had high expectation for this product, but it just didn&#x27;t live up to my standards.</li>
            <li>It leaves my long hair soft and clean &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>your hair does come out very smooth, a whole lot less coarse, and shiny.</li>
            <li>To me, it lathers as well as expected for a NATURAL SULFATE FREE SHAMPOO.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents and find this one smells like dishwasher detergent.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I shook it before each use and it even lathered a LOT during washings, but after shampooing my hair felt completely stripped of any moisture that it had to begin with!</li>
            <li>but once I finished the first wash I felt that I should wash it for a second time.</li>
            <li>has provided stellar results for me in only about 10 days.</li>
            <li>I went through chemo and lost my long hair and wanted something a little more pure when my hair returned.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t stress enough how much I adore the Aubrey conditioner of this scent, and other shampoos by them, but this one was a huge miss for me.</li>
            <li>The Honeysuckle Rose Shampoo works just as well as other much more expensive shampoos that have harmful ingredients.  </li>
            <li>, I know that&#x27;s a very big claim, but what natural products ever strip color out of your hair and cause it to fall out after first use?</li>
            <li>I had my last relaxer over a year ago and have been working with natural hair for the first time in about 20 years.</li>
            <li>I have had trouble with both dandruff and rosacea as I&#x27;ve gotten older, and I came to realize that harsher shampoos aggravated both conditions significantly.</li>
            <li>and I have to use a little more of it than traditional shampoos.</li>
            <li>I have coarse Mediterranean hair and this shampoo made my hair very silky and soft.</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced, especially for this type of shampoo.  </li>
            <li>All you have to do is put a coin-sized amount in your hands and rub it directly into your scalp.</li>
            <li>Big suprise coming from a brand that I heart the twin of (conditioner) so much.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my 2 year old daughter&#x27;s hair and to assist me with my transition from relaxed to my natural hair texture.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care as it leaves my hair so soft and the conditioner leaves my hair feeling like silk.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Aubrey is natural so gives you the cleanliness without the use of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying another organic shampoo when I used all of this that is in a compostable container and makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shampoo for my daughter who has natural hair.  </li>
            <li>(I know, it&#x27;s not green tea</li>
            <li>My hair is always soft, shiny, &amp; silky after using Aubrey products.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would give this a try on my hair and my daughter (naturally curly, frizzy hair)...</li>
            <li>It seems completely natural as far as I need it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair became soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I finished the whole bottle and still would not go back.</li>
            <li>I use this and the matching conditioner on my girls&#x27; very curly red hair.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s floral but kind of in an unappealing way.  </li>
            <li>sadly, this product isn&#x27;t near as good as some of their others.</li>
            <li>The next day the back of my hair snapped right at the root.</li>
            <li>When I apply this shampoo, my hair is very clean, but I can hardly run my finger through hair after shampooing, I wonder what ingredient cause</li>
            <li>Usually my hair stays clean and pretty for about 2 days after regular showering.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t care about lather, which is minimal, and I can totally tell when my hair is clean because it sort of squeaks).  </li>
            <li>My only negative feedback is that the smell is very strong -</li>
            <li>Have you ever drank really high quality green tea freshly brewed with leaves NOT in a bag?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many people probably need to shampoo twice, which is ridiculous IMHO.</li>
            <li>Overall the shampoo is decent when used with the matching conditioner, but it was not the miracle I was expecting (some reviews would lead you to believe it was liquid gold).  </li>
            <li>Products containing alcohol in particular were my personal trigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I ended up using nearly all of my conditioner to bring my hair back to normal .</li>
            <li>Natural products shouldn&#x27;t be stripping your hair of color so harshly, I&#x27;ve never even had that happen with clarifying shampoos that do actually strip your hair!.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it too much for him, but the other 2 boys have tight kinky curls and it makes their hair super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>After rinsing, my hair is more dry than it usually is when I shampoo</li>
            <li>Right now it&#x27;s in the guest bath about half used.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight, about normal texture and dryness, no special needs like</li>
            <li>I am not very fond of roses so the smell for me is not very nice, but if you do like the smell of roses you will love the scent of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Bahamian-Haitian from Miami with 3C-type hair and had my big chop to natural hair in June.</li>
            <li>I am middle-aged, caucasian, with premature white naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I also developed rosacia on my face at about this same time period.</li>
            <li>I like Aubrey Organics products because they aren&#x27;t full of chemicals, but I usually use the rosa mosqueta scent.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend these products for any woman with normal to dry hair.</li>
            <li>It also left my hair extremely brittle after I rinsed it out, and I noticed so much of my hair coming out!</li>
            <li>I am African American with transitioning hair from relaxed to natural.</li>
            <li>My hair is on the thick side, curly with lots of frizz thanks to South Florida humidity, but blows out straight when I take the time (or when I am up north).</li>
            <li>Tired a different brand and that ones seems to lather a bit better.</li>
            <li>That means daily vitamins, very little flat ironing, and sulfate free shampoo.  </li>
            <li>First, a little about my hair.</li>
            <li>I never felt like it got all over my scalp, and it was hard to tell if hair was cleaned throughout, even after a quick rinse and reworking of shampoo.</li>
            <li>I typically will leave in the shampoo just a little longer than usual for a more reasonable result.</li>
            <li>Perhaps for a different txpe of air this may work, but it barely lathers and actually once applied</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, coarse hair, and apparently naturally dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely thin and fine hair damaged by bleaching for 22 years.</li>
            <li>I shampooed twice as I normally would and the second time I always get lots of suds with other products, I didn&#x27;t get anymore than I had before.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo doesn&#x27;t load up with unnecessary ingredients that makes the hair brittle and dry, but it also leaves your hair feeling clean and silky soft!  </li>
            <li>Works fast as little as two applications.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I loved ,loved this stuff.</li>
            <li> Additonally Honeysuckle Rose has a great fragrance.</li>
            <li> Some of the the others dont smell as good as this one</li>
            <li> if you wish to switch to an honeysuckle organic shampoo,this is a good option.</li>
            <li> My hair looks so good</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells so good</li>
            <li> The honeysuckle rose conditioner is a must-have for follow up to prevent fly-aways, but the combination works great for me.  </li>
            <li> the good that it does to my hair</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what it smells like to me after, which is nice lol.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has made a good difference.</li>
            <li> The conditioner helped combat the dryness of the shampoo, but it&#x27;s not an exceptional conditioner.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, cleans good, conditions good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I tried this product.</li>
            <li> and I liked that it&#x27;s fairly natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glad I made the purchase!</li>
            <li> I love organic products!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love, I hope they continue to make this forever!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for all hair types, that is for sure!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Smell is very nice, very rare in Audbery shampoo and conditioner family:)&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning power is good.</li>
            <li> I was trying to order the Honeysuckle Rose CONDITIONER but ordered the shampoo instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hear so many good things about this shampoo</li>
            <li> (honeysucke rose)  </li>
            <li> but I still wouldn&#x27;t describe it as nice, to my tastes at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The after smell is light and pleasant, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant, light floral scent.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love the performance of this shampoo!</li>
            <li> The Honeysuckle rose shampoo is ok.</li>
            <li> this by far is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> My favorite is Honeysuckle Rose</li>
            <li> My youngest son has very fine hair, so</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shampoo that has a lovely, soft scent.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning wise, it strips my hair clean to the point</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t produce foamy bubbles like most shampoo</li>
            <li> He has tried so many dandruff shampoos over many years.  </li>
            <li> then I recommend you follow up the shampoo with a better smelling conditioner.</li>
            <li> Your hair mostly holds the smell of the conditioner anyway.</li>
            <li> I have used many of the Aubrey hair care products and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair as shiny, bouncy and healthy looking as my Pantene used to.  </li>
            <li> my hair feels so wonderful, next time around, I will be purchasing both the shampoo and conditioner for even a better outcome.</li>
            <li> Now I am trying it again, and so glad.</li>
            <li> I love how my hair feels now and, as I said, I LOVE the smell.</li>
            <li> the chemical shampoos were more moisturizing than this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love aohsr conditioner and by mistake picked up the shampoo...</li>
            <li> It was ok on my daughter&#x27;s hair but worked much better for me.</li>
            <li> It drys out your hair, be sure to use a conditioner after.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I guess I like lathering more than I realized.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating and makes you hair look great.</li>
            <li> But it lathers better than most organic shampoos.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not awful, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love that this is made without sodium laurel sulphate</li>
            <li> it worked just OK for me, but for my daughter - ugh.</li>
            <li> They are remarkable and for the FIRST time I am getting what I expect from a product.</li>
            <li> The fact that the products are also safe for my hair and my health is reason to celebrate.</li>
            <li> Try these products your hair will feel heathier and have a better texture than you could have imagined.</li>
            <li> So many cosmetic products are toxic nowadays.</li>
            <li> , However, the lather doesn&#x27;t slide around your scalp at all since there is no silicone, so you end up having to use more of the product to get the shampoo evenly distributed.  </li>
            <li> Of all the Aubrey organic shampoos I have tried, this is the one I most prefer.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After shampooing, I apply its pairing conditioner, which is also ok.</li>
            <li> would love to find something that also manage my hair</li>
            <li> When I decided to go with sodium lauryl sulfate free shampoos, I tried the Himalaya Herbal Healthcare brand and liked it.</li>
            <li> Definatly try it. :)</li>
            <li> When I used the shampoo I was worried because it didn&#x27;t feel nice on my hair after rinsing, and the conditioner didn&#x27;t really feel like it was doing any good either.</li>
            <li> I find that while the smell of this shampoo is okay, it doesn&#x27;t suds...</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Chamomile sounds much more mild smelling than rose, so we&#x27;ll see how that goes.  </li>
            <li> I also love it, and love the fact that it&#x27;s sulfate free &amp; biodegradable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Furthermore, this shampoo leaves my hair clean, shiny and silky!</li>
            <li> smells fantastic and gets my hair nice and clean</li>
            <li> I used to love Aubrey products and think they smell fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I originally tried this product because I love the scent, but gave up because it doesn&#x27;t work like Pantene.</li>
            <li> For those of you that type, i have 4a/b type hair that gets tangle easily.</li>
            <li> Soap and lotion are easy, but I was unsure how the shampoo would go.  </li>
            <li> but I felt like I needed more just to be clean.</li>
            <li> The shampoo worked for its intended purpose, however I felt the sent was really strong.</li>
            <li> Does not have a strong fragrance</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re fine in a pinch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfectly fine product, cleans hair well just like the rosa mosqueta shampoo -</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as being an effective shampoo, this is very good at de-greasing and just in general, cleaning I guess.</li>
            <li> Aubrey Organics, however, is truly amazing, because I&#x27;ve been using it for what must be over a year now with the same great results as I had at first.</li>
            <li> Again, the floral scent is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I feel comfortable using this product.</li>
            <li> But this is a gentle, nice smelling shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that must be used with the matching ( and fabulous) conditioner as it suggests or another moisturizing one of your choice.</li>
            <li> The only product I ever was happy with was Head &amp; Shoulders</li>
            <li> Works great if used with the conditioner from same company .  </li>
            <li> I am looking for products that don&#x27;t have all the chemicals and paraben free ...and this won&#x27;t work for me...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather because It truly is sulfate free.</li>
            <li> People just need to remember that sulfate free shampoos are NOT going to foam up like</li>
            <li> It leaves the hair soft and smells really good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really upsetting that they ruined such a perfect product.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a good natural shampoo and</li>
            <li> Going Natural is very popular right now in oru community</li>
            <li> I felt like blow-drying my hair which I don&#x27;t often do, and from the very first section I was stunned at how silky and easily manageable</li>
            <li> This stuff is not expensive at all, just couple bucks more.</li>
            <li> It did not perform magic with my hair, but I&#x27;m so pleased to have found a shampoo that cleans well, smells fantastic, and has all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> and I was excited because I read the reviews on this product</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I saw that this product was organic, and could not wait to get home to try it.</li>
            <li> and I hope this review can help others decide whether the product is worth a try or not!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is sulfate and paraben free and has many other good ingredients listed.    </li>
            <li> I read so many positive reviews that I was extremely excited to try this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It achieves its goal which is to get the hair clean.</li>
            <li> and it does clean the hair without stripping.</li>
            <li> My hair was clean, my scalp didnt feel as itchy as before I started but my hair felt like it had been washed with detergent.</li>
            <li> Clean your scalp with it and it will work its way through the rest of your hair as you rinse it out.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work like mainstream shampoos because it doesn&#x27;t have the poisonous lathering ingredients, but it gets your hair just as clean once you learn to use it.</li>
            <li> A lot of shampoos contain it however because ppl like the thought of suds and equate it to clean hair</li>
            <li> Its all-natural formula gets my hair clean and leaves it smelling floral and feminine.</li>
            <li> I really was not super happy but the smell is nice</li>
            <li> nothing special really stood out for me to be truthful</li>
            <li> I also tried it on both of my daughters&#x27; hair, tried leaving the conditioner on longer for deep condition, and have waited until 2 months after use to write this review just to be fair.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo because I LOVED the white camellia shampoo.</li>
            <li> Cleanses my hair really well without the suds but not the most moisturizing shampoo.</li>
            <li> Have you ever drank sweet aloe juice you might find in some oriental grocery store?</li>
            <li> They are all fantastic and worth the price.</li>
            <li> And it leave my kinky hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t notice how incredible my hair felt until I dried it off.</li>
            <li> this much good from one simple sitting</li>
            <li> Cleans hair well; helped with oily issue on my scalp; somewhat cured my frizzy ends; after about a month of use my hair is much more healthy than it used to be; no chemicals    CONS: Kind of expensive; texture is runny, but not unbearable in my opinion; the scent is not that great, but I can live with it; I have to use quite a bit to work through my medium/long hair;</li>
            <li> So here&#x27;s a quick breakdown   PROS:</li>
            <li> Aubrey organic products were recommended in a book about fighting against cancer with healthy foods (vegetables, seeds, grains, legumes and mainly vegetable juices)and using organic products for our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and makes my hair feel great and use it on my dogs hair since he has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to Burt&#x27;s Bees super shiny mango shampoo.</li>
            <li> Luckily the smell doesn&#x27;t linger so I will finish the bottle, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair</li>
            <li> but I am very pleased just the same!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I&#x27;ve finally found a good natural line that actually works!</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t be using this again as the strong odor was just too much for me.</li>
            <li> this shampoo worked excellent on my natural black hair.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised this is such a great shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair without much body</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with it and highly recommend for anyone whose looking for a natural cleanser for their hair.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and has kept my hair soft and smooth through the winter thus far.</li>
            <li> But it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> In the meantime I am still using the Rose - the smell is not enough of a deterrent to make me stop using it.</li>
            <li> I love that it is Natural.  </li>
            <li> no sulfur shampoo worth trying</li>
            <li> I recently moved to creating my own organic shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> frizzes though!no success yet</li>
            <li> I am pleased that it has natural ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> very good my natural curls came back no more losing hair in sink spread the word good price</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s safe to use on color treated hair in addition to being formulated without all the other harmful ingredients found in most shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this shampoo is ok; it does what it is meant to do which is to get the hair clean.</li>
            <li> Just not the right one for me.</li>
            <li> but in a very squeaky clean</li>
            <li> But what the scent is actually coming from is probably all those floral and herbal extracts, because this shampoo has no green tea in it whatsoever :P</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, you need SO MUCH product to feel clean with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers well with just a little bit of product, and has a pleasant (and flowery) fragrance.</li>
            <li> I used Aubrey Organics Calaguala Fern Shampoo previously and loved it (I don&#x27;t need lather; I like organic).</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is probably the best-smelling shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used in my life -- granted I love the smell of fruit like mangoes, peaches and pears, there&#x27;s just something EVEN BETTER about the smell of green tea in a shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, wavy hair that easily detangles in the shower-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to Aubrey Organics and after using some of their other products, I get the feeling their products work best when you use them together especially the shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> me, this shampoo smells very intensely like a mix of really really nice green tea and a hint of aloe juice or something -- and it smells pretty sweet.</li>
            <li> It left my hair even more brittle feeling and</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed, after washing my hair I almost did not need to use a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I saw the difference in the first try.</li>
            <li> After i was finished, my hair was soooo soft, moisturized, and drops of water were glistening in the light on my hair.</li>
            <li> I did a hot oil treatment with coconut oil first and then commenced with the shampooing.</li>
            <li> Nothing ever made my hair feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I may not buy this again, but I plan on exploring more of Aubrey organics extensive shampoo formulas.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Aubrey organic products!!</li>
            <li> but with this I&#x27;ve actually been having to brush my hair in the shower with the conditioner in, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s still breaking like a mother.&lt;br /&gt;Booooo.</li>
            <li> messy(dont have the exact word for that...</li>
            <li> I like the scent, and for an organic shampoo it does lather/sud pretty well</li>
            <li> This may work for some hair textures but be aware that your hair may not react well and could fall out.</li>
            <li> After the first lather my hair felt stripped of any moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave up dying along with blow-drying as my first step.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m pretty amazed -</li>
            <li> If it bothers me when I use it regularly I&#x27;ll just mix in another oil to make it smell better.</li>
            <li> In all fairness, this was my first foray into a less-chemical shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to shampoo and have been looking for a moisturizing organic shampoo for years.</li>
            <li> , I applied the AO Honeysuckle Rose conditioner and it returned the moisture which enabled me to detangle without effort and minimal hair loss.</li>
            <li> This is all natural and good for people with sensitive skin and sensitive noses.  </li>
            <li> Certainly not honeysuckle or rose scented.</li>
            <li> once I&#x27;ve washed it because it leaves your hair squeaky clean and not slick at all.  </li>
            <li> As mucb as I want to be natural, my hair is very long and needs to look good.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo did suds up for me and it left my hair very clean.</li>
            <li> Probably because when I think green tea, I think CLEANSING -- whereas mangoes peaches and pears, sure they&#x27;re very sweet and healthy, but if you were to slather yourself with those sweet fruits (instead of wet green tea bags), you&#x27;d probably get all sticky and kind of yucky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most importantly, when I use it I have little to no troble with dandruff</li>
            <li> I suffer with seborrheic dermatitis and since using this natural product the flaky scaly scalp has reduced significantly.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t expect a huge later like traditional shampoo that pulls all the natural oil out but a nice gentle lather with a great cleanse, I highly recommend this line for anyone with long, dry and easy to tangle hair</li>
            <li> I can observe my hair is soft and clean after usage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now, if only I could find a good alternate shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li> If you want a shampoo that really is natural (unlike most shampoos from so-called natural companies), try any Aubrey Organics shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I am always on the hunt for natural products to help my hair stay moisturized and be as nice as possible.</li>
            <li> I got ready to use it the first time and it came out of the bottle like water, ran throug my fingers, etc.  </li>
            <li> However, my hair eventually got used to the shampoo, making it less effective.</li>
            <li> Thank you Aubrey Organics for creating such a lovely natural shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> This is the first time trying both shampoo and conditioner and highly recommend both.</li>
            <li> and together they make a great team, the shampoo didn&#x27;t leave my hair with the usual slickness from typical shampoos which I loved but it wasn&#x27;t overly dry either.</li>
            <li> My husband had eczema on his scalp and dandruff that was increasing so much so that it fell on his shoulders like snow.  </li>
            <li> A tip, make sure your hair is REALLY WET</li>
            <li> I was looking for a chemical free shampoo because chemicals such as sulfates give me dandruff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for it.  </li>
            <li> I really want to like Aubrey Organics products</li>
            <li> BUT the saving grace for this product is when used with its conditioner (or another very moisturizing one of your choosing)</li>
            <li> Typically I primarily use conditioner only, but even the Aubrey conditioner issn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> My whole family uses this shampoo, myself, my teen-aged daughter &amp; my husband.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed with the way that this product reacted with my hair.  </li>
            <li> It cleans well but gently.</li>
            <li> I have corse hair, very dense, with medium thickness.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really care for this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have unusual hair</li>
            <li> or I received a defective product, but there is absolutely NOTHING moisturizing about this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This has a matching conditioner that works really well, too.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> Companies do not have to disclose what they are really using.</li>
            <li> It lathers, but very well.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> I am very light-skinned to begin with, so all of this redness just shined like a very unwanted beacon.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I combed the conditioner gently through my hair and rinsed it out at the end of my shower.</li>
            <li> However I do feel that this and its conditioner really works well with my hair type</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did leave my hair very tangled;however</li>
            <li> He ran out of his dandruff shampoo and used my Honeysuckle Rose and after using a few times he no longer has ANY dandruff.  </li>
            <li> Finally in my efforts to use something more natural and organic still, I tried this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> mom, with same hair but more naturally oily, doesn&#x27;t like the conditioner but uses the shampoo by itself when visiting and loves it.  </li>
            <li> If you like a good, thick lather, you won&#x27;t like this.  </li>
            <li> But luckily, you only smell it while shampooing and once your hair dries the smell is pretty much gone.  </li>
            <li> I am going to experiment with some other shampoos in the Aubrey line to see if any have a better fragrance.  </li>
            <li> (since this shampoo doens&#x27;t have the harmful suds-creating ingredient that most other soaps have)</li>
            <li> but I also have and love GP Protein, Island Naturals and one other that escapes me at the moment.</li>
            <li> Sometime in my middle 30s, my hair had turned almost pure white, became very resistant to dye, very brittle and had thinned to the point that you could see way more of my scalp than anyone should.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m highly amazed at how good my hair feels after using this shampoo because I&#x27;ve used other organic shampoos that left my hair so opaque and lifeless.</li>
            <li> It definitely felt clean as it felt stripped of everything, which is why I couldn&#x27;t give it a 1 star rating...</li>
            <li> My hair felt clean, but no cleaner and healthier than with my regular Aussie products.</li>
            <li> anyone who has never tried a sulfate free shampoo, it is extremely low lathering, it takes some getting used to, but that is normal.</li>
            <li> I have really fine, completely straight, fairly dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I didn&#x27;t need as much having short hair, so I wanted something good with less chemicals.</li>
            <li> and that is the one main thing that I don&#x27;t like about this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I like this one in particular for it&#x27;s scent.  </li>
            <li> The main point is, this stuff works for me</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say that before I used these two products, I had done a deep cleansing and balancing/conditioning treatment in order to fix the foundations of my hair as much as possible, so this also adds to the reasons why my hair is feeling much better than before.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product along with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend all of the shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> so after very thorough reviewing of  this product I decided that there were more positive reviews than negative reviews.</li>
            <li> let me tell you this stuff completely strips your hair!!</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, the ingredients are decent, and the conditioner that comes with it is so thick it feels like body butter..</li>
            <li> I was excited to use it, but when I did it made my hair feel extremely dry.</li>
            <li> OK, let me set the scene with the mess that my hair was before I started my new haircare regime.</li>
            <li> But you&#x27;d be surprised how fast you get used to it.</li>
            <li> and that should help you get a few more suds.</li>
            <li> Regardless, this is a purchase I don&#x27;t think went to waste. :)</li>
            <li> I have really nice thick hair</li>
            <li> I had high expectation for this product, but it just didn&#x27;t live up to my standards.</li>
            <li> It leaves my long hair soft and clean &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> your hair does come out very smooth, a whole lot less coarse, and shiny.</li>
            <li> To me, it lathers as well as expected for a NATURAL SULFATE FREE SHAMPOO.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents and find this one smells like dishwasher detergent.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I shook it before each use and it even lathered a LOT during washings, but after shampooing my hair felt completely stripped of any moisture that it had to begin with!</li>
            <li> but once I finished the first wash I felt that I should wash it for a second time.</li>
            <li> has provided stellar results for me in only about 10 days.</li>
            <li> I went through chemo and lost my long hair and wanted something a little more pure when my hair returned.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t stress enough how much I adore the Aubrey conditioner of this scent, and other shampoos by them, but this one was a huge miss for me.</li>
            <li> The Honeysuckle Rose Shampoo works just as well as other much more expensive shampoos that have harmful ingredients.  </li>
            <li> , I know that&#x27;s a very big claim, but what natural products ever strip color out of your hair and cause it to fall out after first use?</li>
            <li> I had my last relaxer over a year ago and have been working with natural hair for the first time in about 20 years.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with both dandruff and rosacea as I&#x27;ve gotten older, and I came to realize that harsher shampoos aggravated both conditions significantly.</li>
            <li> and I have to use a little more of it than traditional shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have coarse Mediterranean hair and this shampoo made my hair very silky and soft.</li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced, especially for this type of shampoo.  </li>
            <li> All you have to do is put a coin-sized amount in your hands and rub it directly into your scalp.</li>
            <li> Big suprise coming from a brand that I heart the twin of (conditioner) so much.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my 2 year old daughter&#x27;s hair and to assist me with my transition from relaxed to my natural hair texture.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care as it leaves my hair so soft and the conditioner leaves my hair feeling like silk.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Aubrey is natural so gives you the cleanliness without the use of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying another organic shampoo when I used all of this that is in a compostable container and makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo for my daughter who has natural hair.  </li>
            <li> (I know, it&#x27;s not green tea</li>
            <li> My hair is always soft, shiny, &amp; silky after using Aubrey products.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would give this a try on my hair and my daughter (naturally curly, frizzy hair)...</li>
            <li> It seems completely natural as far as I need it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair became soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I finished the whole bottle and still would not go back.</li>
            <li> I use this and the matching conditioner on my girls&#x27; very curly red hair.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s floral but kind of in an unappealing way.  </li>
            <li> sadly, this product isn&#x27;t near as good as some of their others.</li>
            <li> The next day the back of my hair snapped right at the root.</li>
            <li> When I apply this shampoo, my hair is very clean, but I can hardly run my finger through hair after shampooing, I wonder what ingredient cause</li>
            <li> Usually my hair stays clean and pretty for about 2 days after regular showering.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t care about lather, which is minimal, and I can totally tell when my hair is clean because it sort of squeaks).  </li>
            <li> My only negative feedback is that the smell is very strong -</li>
            <li> Have you ever drank really high quality green tea freshly brewed with leaves NOT in a bag?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many people probably need to shampoo twice, which is ridiculous IMHO.</li>
            <li> Overall the shampoo is decent when used with the matching conditioner, but it was not the miracle I was expecting (some reviews would lead you to believe it was liquid gold).  </li>
            <li> Products containing alcohol in particular were my personal trigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I ended up using nearly all of my conditioner to bring my hair back to normal .</li>
            <li> Natural products shouldn&#x27;t be stripping your hair of color so harshly, I&#x27;ve never even had that happen with clarifying shampoos that do actually strip your hair!.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it too much for him, but the other 2 boys have tight kinky curls and it makes their hair super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> After rinsing, my hair is more dry than it usually is when I shampoo</li>
            <li> Right now it&#x27;s in the guest bath about half used.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight, about normal texture and dryness, no special needs like</li>
            <li> I am not very fond of roses so the smell for me is not very nice, but if you do like the smell of roses you will love the scent of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Bahamian-Haitian from Miami with 3C-type hair and had my big chop to natural hair in June.</li>
            <li> I am middle-aged, caucasian, with premature white naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I also developed rosacia on my face at about this same time period.</li>
            <li> I like Aubrey Organics products because they aren&#x27;t full of chemicals, but I usually use the rosa mosqueta scent.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend these products for any woman with normal to dry hair.</li>
            <li> It also left my hair extremely brittle after I rinsed it out, and I noticed so much of my hair coming out!</li>
            <li> I am African American with transitioning hair from relaxed to natural.</li>
            <li> My hair is on the thick side, curly with lots of frizz thanks to South Florida humidity, but blows out straight when I take the time (or when I am up north).</li>
            <li> Tired a different brand and that ones seems to lather a bit better.</li>
            <li> That means daily vitamins, very little flat ironing, and sulfate free shampoo.  </li>
            <li> First, a little about my hair.</li>
            <li> I never felt like it got all over my scalp, and it was hard to tell if hair was cleaned throughout, even after a quick rinse and reworking of shampoo.</li>
            <li> I typically will leave in the shampoo just a little longer than usual for a more reasonable result.</li>
            <li> Perhaps for a different txpe of air this may work, but it barely lathers and actually once applied</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, coarse hair, and apparently naturally dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely thin and fine hair damaged by bleaching for 22 years.</li>
            <li> I shampooed twice as I normally would and the second time I always get lots of suds with other products, I didn&#x27;t get anymore than I had before.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t load up with unnecessary ingredients that makes the hair brittle and dry, but it also leaves your hair feeling clean and silky soft!  </li>
            <li> Works fast as little as two applications.</li>
            <li> For the first time in a long while I dared to take a small hand mirror and use it to study the back of my head in the wall mirror.</li>
            <li> I have coarse and dry hair( Im african american).</li>
            <li> i sometimes use it as body wash because it does not dry out my already dry skin.</li>
            <li> Since growing my hair out from a pixie cut, I&#x27;ve decided that if I&#x27;m going to grow my fragile hair long - I&#x27;m going to have to baby it.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t even want to flat iron it.  </li>
            <li> I normally have incredibly thick, long, frizzy, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be very dry, but not nearly as dry as when I had relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want anything that will leave residue or build up because that produces flat-head-hair and with straight, fine hair it looks really bad.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why this has gotten such high rating all over the web.</li>
            <li> My other natural shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry like this one, so I think I&#x27;ll stick to that one.  </li>
            <li> I am a Caucasian female with somewhat dry, unruly hair.</li>
            <li> no way... the shampoo left my hair dry and tangled to the point that I was scared it would matte up.</li>
            <li> It could just be me, but it left my hair dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> Our hair (especially my daughter&#x27;s hair) was dry as straw.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m giving this product a one star because I don&#x27;t feel like it fully served its purpose for helping dry damage hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice on my hair and it&#x27;s made it sooo dry both times.  </li>
            <li> My hair is really dry, so I try to use it occasionally in the summer or with a stronger conditioner for a change up.</li>
            <li> Especially for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I struggled less with frizz, tangles, and the natural unruliness of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and although this feels slightly drying to my hair, when I must wash this is the choice.</li>
            <li> It was the same result with their hair and every single time of use.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;s possible that my hair has become so insanely dry after using this for a month!</li>
            <li> love how this has no sulfates, mineral oils, parabens or other weird synthetic chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> hair did not look clean but looked as if a film was left on it and is too expensive.</li>
            <li> The shampoo does NOTHING for dry hair, and basically makes my hair go flat.</li>
            <li> Luckily I also bought a bottle of Shea Moisture Shea Butter Leave in Conditioner which makes a dramatic difference in moisture for my daughters and myself.  </li>
            <li> I rely on Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose conditioner, so I was shocked with this</li>
            <li> but I have long hair and had to use a lot of it to wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> Took twice as long to rinse and twice the amount of my ultra-moisturizing conditioner to get the hair somewhat manageable.</li>
            <li> It was a long drawn out 2 months of disaster on my hair.</li>
            <li> For more reviews on natural hair products check out:  [...]</li>
            <li> My hair is kept very short - again to reduce the stress on my hair from any styling; besides...few can get away with long, thin, white strands and look decent.</li>
            <li> (Seriously, I had salt-n-pepper colored hair way back in high school.)</li>
            <li> and it is not easy finding products that can make our hair manageable and truly soft</li>
            <li> I suffer from several chronic illnesses and as a result my hair was in pretty bad shape thanks to a lack of nutrients and neglect.</li>
            <li> I have really dry 4a/4b hair, with 2 daughters that both have 4a.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product if you have dry hair or use thermal appliances like a hair straightener.</li>
            <li> I thought I was doomed to a life of frizzy, dry hair, but not anymore.</li>
            <li> but not it makes my hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Seems to dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> I thought organic shampoo would be the answer to my dry hair.</li>
            <li> Thois shampoo made my hair feel stripped and dry.</li>
            <li> too dry may be).</li>
            <li> it felt excessively dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and this product made my hair feel sooooo dry and damaged.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry or strip</li>
            <li> I recommended for those with dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair and have been looking for a natural shampoo for ages.  </li>
            <li> corresponding conditioner is a little thick, but I added some water to the bottle and found it was just right.</li>
            <li> I can already tell a major difference after just a few months.  </li>
            <li> I have been searching for a natural alternative to what I had been using with very little luck.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman with very tightly coiled dry hair.</li>
            <li> It was extremely brittle and rough after drying....worse than when starting.</li>
            <li> It keeps our hair soft and fluffy ALL day!</li>
            <li> We camp a lot &amp; even at home just would like to cut down on water pollution whenever possible.</li>
            <li> Like unbelievably dry!</li>
            <li> , I just recently re-died it black</li>
            <li> I must say that it has helped with the oiliness, but the frizzy problem was only slightly helped.    </li>
            <li> It took me a little while to get used to that, and I think I lost extra hair finding out.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little addictive.  </li>
            <li> Infusium 23 shampoo for dry &amp; damaged hair was my mainstay and the product I always returned to as it was the one product that helped somewhat with the hair loss due to being so brittle.</li>
            <li> The consistency is like water which makes it hard to direct where on your hair you want to place the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> After shampooing my hair felt like straw, very rough, stripped, and dry.</li>
            <li> It also left my hair greasy once it dried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use it until the bottle is empty.  </li>
            <li> Although I have found this shampoo in the middle-range of effectiveness of moisturizing shampoos, it does not really lather (no surprise), has a gelatin texture</li>
            <li> if anything its made my hair dryer and harder to deall with.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried using it by itself in one showering session, however, I&#x27;d imagine if I went without the matching conditioner, my past-shoulder length hair would be a bit harder to manage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this does not really feel like shampoo - really no lather.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth a try considering it&#x27;s not that expensive, and thebottles aren&#x27;t exactly small so it will last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Epic fail, my hair was left feeling so brittle and dry, but it was clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Other people have commented on the smell, but I like it.</li>
            <li> - in other words does not add volume but also does not add weight.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other shampoo,</li>
            <li> I will be exchanging it for anything other than this.  </li>
            <li> and my skin doesn&#x27;t flare up like it did with other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> though, it is low-sudsing due to the plant extracts.</li>
            <li> Extremely moisturizing and goes well with the matching conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say go with just the conditioner, but I feel that they both helped each other out and work well together as they should.</li>
            <li> Seriously I cannot praise this stuff enough; I have not used it long term but for it to have done my hair</li>
            <li> The scent is very subtle and this shampoo cleans my hair gently without harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I noticed less breakage while shampooing with this product compared to using other \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; shampoos.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like the smell either unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> wish they&#x27;d sell these in larger containers, or at least make them cheaper.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have tried prescription shampoos and just about every product on the market (or so it seemed) with varying results (including conditioners) for at least the brittleness of my white hair.</li>
            <li> Ironically, my hair has always felt soft and silky but I shed worse than my long-haired cat.</li>
            <li> If tye price comes down I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> the roots for a touch up) and this shampoo some how stripped the black from my hair turning it brown.</li>
            <li> With this shampoo, less than 24 hours after showering my hair is already getting oily and stringy.</li>
            <li> I had already noticed the front of my scalp looked much better and hair loss is decreasing by the day but the back of my head was always the worst.</li>
            <li> Less washing probably will help too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo in an effort to start using less chemically enhanced beauty products.</li>
            <li> It takes several long washings with lots of shampoo for my hair to reel clean and it feels awful.  </li>
            <li> I normally use Biocleanse shampoo and conditioner but became troubled by some of the ingredients in the Biocleanse product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I will have to look for other natural shampoo/conditioner after years of using Aubrey.</li>
            <li> I am caucasian with thick, long hair.  </li>
            <li> I am Caucasian with very long and thick wavy hair that just does not like to behave.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin very soft, which is weird to me after drying out my hair.  </li>
            <li> A little background on me.</li>
            <li> I mean they aren&#x27;t horrible, but they aren&#x27;t remarkable either.</li>
            <li> was a little scared with the results of the was, so</li>
            <li> Like it but seems to be something in it that is not in the other one I usually buy; &#x27;Calaguala Fern&#x27; does not make my skin itch.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, very coarse hair</li>
            <li> Everything I tried had dried out my hair horribly, even though I kind of have oily hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now, because I needed a moisturizing shampoo without sulfates.</li>
            <li> It was like washing my hair with harsh dish soap.  </li>
            <li> and I found out about this product in green beauty book of Julie Gabriel.</li>
            <li> iv been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> It does not leave a heavy residue like the others though, which I like.</li>
            <li> I did not like the scent or how it dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, my scalp was flaming red.</li>
            <li> dried my hair out, this is not for my hair texure</li>
            <li> I can even go a few days without washing my hair without it looking greasy.</li>
            <li> Then let it sit a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> It can be a little tough to get into all of your hair if you have long hair because it doesn&#x27;t suds up quite like the toxic stuff</li>
            <li> , I can forgive the smell; it actually doesn&#x27;t smell at all unpleasant once the hair is dry and if you&#x27;ve applied other products it mixes</li>
            <li> Since I have thick hair, I divide it in half and put a dime sized portion of the soap on each half.  </li>
            <li> I expected differences, but this was just ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> I received the actual product and opened the bottle, it smelled pretty disgusting to me; it&#x27;s very herbal in an unpleasant way, to the point of smelling almost like chemicals, if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey for the small bottle</li>
            <li> It was no better than the 99 cent store shampoo or the shampoo for sale for 99 cents in any store.</li>
            <li> Again order this product because I could not make it to health food store where I usually purchase from.</li>
            <li> detangled my hair with a wide-toothed comb and it seemed to be easier than usual.</li>
            <li> especially considering how skeptical I was.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is thick with a cotton like texture,t hat&#x27;s not easily done.</li>
            <li> but I really wanted to get away from using such a nasty product on my head.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time with getting suds without using a lot of product...</li>
            <li> The smell once it was mixed a little wasn&#x27;t quite so bad</li>
            <li> it at least did that.  </li>
            <li> this lack of kather and slipperiness is common with organic shampoos, but i did not lime tge feelimb at all.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t improve dramatically but I have verrrrrrry curly, thick hair.</li>
            <li> Like walking in a thick patch of honeysuckle.</li>
            <li> I mean would not purchase this product</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s what probably makes this stuff so expensive compared to conventional shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Calaguala Fern Shampoo was not available via Prime, so I stupidly looked for a Prime alternative and assumed a Moisturizing shampoo by the same company would provide, you know, moisture.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed in the shampoo and it left her hair hard.</li>
            <li> it is not good at all.</li>
            <li> So disappointed with this product, I am back to using salon quality hair products.</li>
            <li> But then again I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> It also lathered poorly (which organic shampoo does do)</li>
            <li> I feel as though the ingredients are false</li>
            <li> After it dried my hair was extremely greasy and disgusting!</li>
            <li> It was very dry and impossible to de-tangle and was driving me crazy, nothing was working for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product wasn&#x27;t the moisture experience for me that it was for all the reviewers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It made me sad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to avoid using conditioners and unfortunately with this shampoo I had to.</li>
            <li> Smells weird too</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t too expensive.  </li>
            <li> but still I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> I am afraid that they are part of the green-wash wagon now...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me and it stinks.</li>
            <li> And those products are also bad for your health and your environment.</li>
            <li> Not an a altogether bad way</li>
            <li> It was bad, please dont buy this stuff.</li>
            <li> Now, bear in mind that sulfates (bad for your hair, maybe bad for you) is the ingredient that makes shampoo lather</li>
            <li> Too bad, I found it cheaper in Hawaii&#x27;s health food store.</li>
            <li> I opted for the Aubrey Organics on a whim and was fairly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate wasting money, so</li>
            <li> Taming curly hair is a brutal operation.  </li>

            <li> This product was absolutely awful. I was excited to use it, but when I did it made my hair feel extremely dry. I have really nice thick hair, I just recently re-died it black 2 weeks prior(mostly the roots for a touch up) and this shampoo some how stripped the black from my hair turning it brown. Natural products shouldn&#x27;t be stripping your hair of color so harshly, I&#x27;ve never even had that happen with clarifying shampoos that do actually strip your hair!. It also left my hair extremely brittle after I rinsed it out, and I noticed so much of my hair coming out! After it dried my hair was extremely greasy and disgusting! The next day I tried using it again since I finally got the conditioner. Worst mistake. It left my hair even more brittle feeling and the conditioner just felt slimy. It also left my hair greasy once it dried. I feel as though the ingredients are false, I know that&#x27;s a very big claim, but what natural products ever strip color out of your hair and cause it to fall out after first use?</li>
            <li> I went through chemo and lost my long hair and wanted something a little more pure when my hair returned. Plus, I didn&#x27;t need as much having short hair, so I wanted something good with less chemicals. I feel comfortable using this product. It doesn&#x27;t produce foamy bubbles like most shampoo but that&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t contain the chemical to do so. So it may take some getting used to. But this is a gentle, nice smelling shampoo. Glad I made the purchase! Good for the price, too!</li>
            <li> I really was not super happy but the smell is nice nothing special really stood out for me to be truthful</li>
            <li> My husband had eczema on his scalp and dandruff that was increasing so much so that it fell on his shoulders like snow.  He has tried so many dandruff shampoos over many years.  He ran out of his dandruff shampoo and used my Honeysuckle Rose and after using a few times he no longer has ANY dandruff.  It is like a miracle! And all the eczema is gone also. Now I will stock up on this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now, because I needed a moisturizing shampoo without sulfates. This is exactly what I needed, after washing my hair I almost did not need to use a conditioner. It leaves the hair soft and smells really good. I noticed less breakage while shampooing with this product compared to using other \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; shampoos.</li>
            <li> I read so many positive reviews that I was extremely excited to try this shampoo.  I have really dry 4a/4b hair, with 2 daughters that both have 4a.  Unfortunately this product wasn&#x27;t the moisture experience for me that it was for all the reviewers.  Yes, I shook it before each use and it even lathered a LOT during washings, but after shampooing my hair felt completely stripped of any moisture that it had to begin with! It definitely felt clean as it felt stripped of everything, which is why I couldn&#x27;t give it a 1 star rating...it at least did that.  But moisturize, no.  I bought the conditioner with it and that added no help whatsoever to softening or moisturizing my hair.  It was extremely brittle and rough after drying....worse than when starting. I also tried it on both of my daughters&#x27; hair, tried leaving the conditioner on longer for deep condition, and have waited until 2 months after use to write this review just to be fair.  It was the same result with their hair and every single time of use. It was like washing my hair with harsh dish soap.  I really didn&#x27;t like the smell either unfortunately.  I was hoping that would be the one bonus.  I hate wasting money, so I&#x27;m going to use it until the bottle is empty.  I definitely won&#x27;t be buying again though.  Luckily I also bought a bottle of Shea Moisture Shea Butter Leave in Conditioner which makes a dramatic difference in moisture for my daughters and myself.  It keeps our hair soft and fluffy ALL day! Now that stuff is awesome!! It has helped counter balance the moisture stripping effect of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an organic shampoo and I found out about this product in green beauty book of Julie Gabriel.I am so happy..I saw the difference in the first try.I have coarse Mediterranean hair and this shampoo made my hair very silky and soft.Do not use those monster shampoos (pantene, herbal essence) that actually damages your scalp and hair.And those products are also bad for your health and your environment. This stuff is not expensive at all, just couple bucks more.But it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I was trying to order the Honeysuckle Rose CONDITIONER but ordered the shampoo instead. This has to be the best mistake I ever made. First, a little about my hair. I am African American with transitioning hair from relaxed to natural. For those of you that type, i have 4a/b type hair that gets tangle easily. As I began to use the shampoo, my hair started to detangle and all I was doing was massaging my scalp with he product!!! After i was finished, my hair was soooo soft, moisturized, and drops of water were glistening in the light on my hair. Because my hair is thick with a cotton like texture,t hat&#x27;s not easily done. I have read some reviews and some of you have said that it doesn&#x27;t   lather.\\&quot; To me, it lathers as well as expected for a NATURAL SULFATE FREE SHAMPOO. A tip, make sure your hair is REALLY WET and that should help you get a few more suds. I&#x27;m sold and this is now my staple shampoo. It smells just like honeysuckle and roses so if you don&#x27;t like the flowery smell then I recommend you follow up the shampoo with a better smelling conditioner. The after smell is light and pleasant, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> A little background on me. I&#x27;m a Bahamian-Haitian from Miami with 3C-type hair and had my big chop to natural hair in June. My hair tends to be very dry, but not nearly as dry as when I had relaxed hair. Although I have found this shampoo in the middle-range of effectiveness of moisturizing shampoos, it does not really lather (no surprise), has a gelatin texture and I have to use a little more of it than traditional shampoos. But then again I have very thick hair. Other people have commented on the smell, but I like it. Your hair mostly holds the smell of the conditioner anyway. I&#x27;m new to Aubrey Organics and after using some of their other products, I get the feeling their products work best when you use them together especially the shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my hair as I am switching my body/skin care products to organic.  I like the smell....but I have long hair and had to use a lot of it to wash my hair.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey for the small bottle so I think I&#x27;ll try out some others before I make a solid decision on whats for me.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a chemical free shampoo because chemicals such as sulfates give me dandruff. This shampoo lathers well with just a little bit of product, and has a pleasant (and flowery) fragrance. I have fine hair without much body and I do not notice a difference in styling with this shampoo one way or another - in other words does not add volume but also does not add weight. I have short hair and do not need to use creme rinse or detangler with this shampoo. It is reasonably priced, especially for this type of shampoo.  I have used many of the Aubrey hair care products and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I recently attended a health seminar that made me realize that every thing you put on your body ends up inside your body - it enters your bloodstream through your skin and eventually circulates to all your internal organs.  So basically, if you wouldn&#x27;t eat it, you shouldn&#x27;t put it on your skin.  So I decided to throw away all my chemical-ridden drugstore beauty products and start buying all organic.  Soap and lotion are easy, but I was unsure how the shampoo would go.  As mucb as I want to be natural, my hair is very long and needs to look good.  I am happy to report that this shampoo did not dissapoint.  It leaves my hair as shiny, bouncy and healthy looking as my Pantene used to.  My only negative feedback is that the smell is very strong - it&#x27;s floral but kind of in an unappealing way.  I don&#x27;t really care for it.  It&#x27;s almost like roses mixed with sulfur or something. But luckily, you only smell it while shampooing and once your hair dries the smell is pretty much gone.  I am going to experiment with some other shampoos in the Aubrey line to see if any have a better fragrance.  The Chamomile volumizing shampoo (not the blue chamomile) is next on my list.  Chamomile sounds much more mild smelling than rose, so we&#x27;ll see how that goes.  In the meantime I am still using the Rose - the smell is not enough of a deterrent to make me stop using it.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair and have been looking for a natural shampoo for ages.  This shampoo doesn&#x27;t load up with unnecessary ingredients that makes the hair brittle and dry, but it also leaves your hair feeling clean and silky soft!  I bought just the shampoo to see how I would like it, and if with just using the shampoo (with my regular deep conditioner product) my hair feels so wonderful, next time around, I will be purchasing both the shampoo and conditioner for even a better outcome.</li>
            <li> The Honeysuckle rose shampoo is ok. It achieves its goal which is to get the hair clean. When I use this shampoo, I shampoo like I regularly do and then rinse. After rinsing, my hair is more dry than it usually is when I shampoo and that is the one main thing that I don&#x27;t like about this shampoo. This shampoo like its name implies, has a smell of roses. I am not very fond of roses so the smell for me is not very nice, but if you do like the smell of roses you will love the scent of this shampoo. The shampoo is sulfate and paraben free and has many other good ingredients listed.    Overall, this shampoo is ok; it does what it is meant to do which is to get the hair clean. It is affordable and has natural/organic ingredients.     For more reviews on natural hair products check out:  [...]</li>
            <li> This is the highest rated shampoo from ewg.org.  It is great for my curly hair, and it smells delicious.  I will never use any other shampoo, when I do, my hair just doesn&#x27;t look the same.</li>
            <li> I really want to like Aubrey Organics products but they just don&#x27;t do it for me the way the Eulence brand does. I mean they aren&#x27;t horrible, but they aren&#x27;t remarkable either. They&#x27;re fine in a pinch. I do like the smell of this shampoo and it does clean the hair without stripping.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo because I LOVED the white camellia shampoo.I have coarse and dry hair( Im african american). so after very thorough reviewing of  this product I decided that there were more positive reviews than negative reviews. So today I finally used this shampoo and ladies let me tell you this stuff completely strips your hair!! Not an a altogether bad way but in a very squeaky clean but my hair will be tangled type way.   I did a hot oil treatment with coconut oil first and then commenced with the shampooing. This does lather sort of but once I finished the first wash I felt that I should wash it for a second time. My hair was clean, my scalp didnt feel as itchy as before I started but my hair felt like it had been washed with detergent. BUT the saving grace for this product is when used with its conditioner (or another very moisturizing one of your choosing) your hair does come out very smooth, a whole lot less coarse, and shiny. Its alot easier to comb and detangle.   This is one of those products that must be used with the matching ( and fabulous) conditioner as it suggests or another moisturizing one of your choice.</li>
            <li> I am a Caucasian female with somewhat dry, unruly hair. I normally use Biocleanse shampoo and conditioner but became troubled by some of the ingredients in the Biocleanse product. I opted for the Aubrey Organics on a whim and was fairly disappointed. The shampoo does NOTHING for dry hair, and basically makes my hair go flat. Don&#x27;t buy this product if you have dry hair or use thermal appliances like a hair straightener.</li>
            <li> Both the shampoo and conditioner smell great.  My hair didn&#x27;t improve dramatically but I have verrrrrrry curly, thick hair. I still use it because it works as well as everything else I have tried but smells GREAT!</li>
            <li> I originally tried this product because I love the scent, but gave up because it doesn&#x27;t work like Pantene. Now I am trying it again, and so glad. All you have to do is put a coin-sized amount in your hands and rub it directly into your scalp. Clean your scalp with it and it will work its way through the rest of your hair as you rinse it out. It doesn&#x27;t work like mainstream shampoos because it doesn&#x27;t have the poisonous lathering ingredients, but it gets your hair just as clean once you learn to use it. I love how my hair feels now and, as I said, I LOVE the smell. Give it a chance!</li>
            <li> I used to love Aubrey products and think they smell fantastic.  However, this product is dries out my hair something fierce and I don&#x27;t even use shampoo that often.  Typically I primarily use conditioner only, but even the Aubrey conditioner issn&#x27;t that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made me sad.  I wonder if they changed their formulas?</li>
            <li> Bought this shampoo and matching conditioner today. I have extremely thin and fine hair damaged by bleaching for 22 years. Nothing ever made my hair feel so soft and smooth. I thought I was doomed to a life of frizzy, dry hair, but not anymore. I highly recommend this product along with the conditioner. And it smells AMAZING! Like walking in a thick patch of honeysuckle. Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> They have changed the formula, it used to be so moisturizing and nourishing but not it makes my hair dry and brittle. It&#x27;s really upsetting that they ruined such a perfect product.</li>
            <li> iv been using it for a few weeks and it hasnt done my hair any favors. if anything its made my hair dryer and harder to deall with. the chemical shampoos were more moisturizing than this.&lt;br /&gt;I have curly hair with some frizz.</li>
            <li> I love aohsr conditioner and by mistake picked up the shampoo... no way... the shampoo left my hair dry and tangled to the point that I was scared it would matte up. I detangled before hand with a cheapie condiotioner just for this reason and this product was so drying that I&#x27;d rather use dish detergent before using this again.   I will be exchanging it for anything other than this.  Big suprise coming from a brand that I heart the twin of (conditioner) so much. It leads me to believe that for textured hair as is mine its a no go. My hair is itchy and scratchy as I type. UGH!</li>
            <li> I would never buy this again and don&#x27;t recommend it.  The consistency is like water which makes it hard to direct where on your hair you want to place the shampoo.  It runs off your hand as soon as you raise it above your head, just like water would.  The smell also reminds me of an elderly woman.  Can&#x27;t wait til its gone and we can switch to something else.</li>
            <li> The Honeysuckle Rose Shampoo works just as well as other much more expensive shampoos that have harmful ingredients.  It did not perform magic with my hair, but I&#x27;m so pleased to have found a shampoo that cleans well, smells fantastic, and has all natural ingredients.  Since I have thick hair, I divide it in half and put a dime sized portion of the soap on each half.  That way (since this shampoo doens&#x27;t have the harmful suds-creating ingredient that most other soaps have) I feel like my hair is evenly cleaned.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my 2 year old daughter&#x27;s hair and to assist me with my transition from relaxed to my natural hair texture. I can honestly say that this is a great product. I suffer with seborrheic dermatitis and since using this natural product the flaky scaly scalp has reduced significantly. It was ok on my daughter&#x27;s hair but worked much better for me. I will continue to use this product...I&#x27;m very satisfied with it and highly recommend for anyone whose looking for a natural cleanser for their hair.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and the low-lather is not a problem at all, but the shampoo just felt really weird in my hair. Perhaps it&#x27;s just something I my hair needs to get used to. Regardless, this is a purchase I don&#x27;t think went to waste. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo to try to help with oiliness on my scalp and frizzy texture at the ends.  I must say that it has helped with the oiliness, but the frizzy problem was only slightly helped.    Overall the shampoo is decent when used with the matching conditioner, but it was not the miracle I was expecting (some reviews would lead you to believe it was liquid gold).  Also, the shampoo will lather. I may not buy this again, but I plan on exploring more of Aubrey organics extensive shampoo formulas.    So here&#x27;s a quick breakdown   PROS: Cleans hair well; helped with oily issue on my scalp; somewhat cured my frizzy ends; after about a month of use my hair is much more healthy than it used to be; no chemicals    CONS: Kind of expensive; texture is runny, but not unbearable in my opinion; the scent is not that great, but I can live with it; I have to use quite a bit to work through my medium/long hair;</li>
            <li> I love that it is Natural.  It drys out your hair, be sure to use a conditioner after.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love organic products!  This shampoo is wonderful!</li>
            <li> hair did not look clean but looked as if a film was left on it and is too expensive.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses this shampoo, myself, my teen-aged daughter &amp; my husband. It has to be good to please both of them! I also love it, and love the fact that it&#x27;s sulfate free &amp; biodegradable. We camp a lot &amp; even at home just would like to cut down on water pollution whenever possible. It leaves my long hair soft and clean &amp; shiny. I recommend this to anyone! I pair it with a Burts Bees conditioner &amp; just couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I&#x27;ve finally found a good natural line that actually works! Aubrey organic products were recommended in a book about fighting against cancer with healthy foods (vegetables, seeds, grains, legumes and mainly vegetable juices)and using organic products for our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, this shampoo leaves my hair clean, shiny and silky! I didn&#x27;t buy the conditioner so I&#x27;m highly amazed at how good my hair feels after using this shampoo because I&#x27;ve used other organic shampoos that left my hair so opaque and lifeless. I highly recommend Aubrey organic products!!</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed with the way that this product reacted with my hair.  I have very thick, very coarse hair and I was excited because I read the reviews on this product and they were so good.  I got ready to use it the first time and it came out of the bottle like water, ran throug my fingers, etc.  Then I put what was left on my hair and it wouldn&#x27;t suds up at all.  I shampooed twice as I normally would and the second time I always get lots of suds with other products, I didn&#x27;t get anymore than I had before.  My hair felt clean, but no cleaner and healthier than with my regular Aussie products.</li>
            <li> this shampoo worked excellent on my natural black hair. I ordered it by mistake and decided to use it. Great smelling and lots of suds, nice slip, I would recommend it to any one looking for a moisturizer shampoo</li>
            <li> Switched to this shampoo a year or so ago and I&#x27;ll never go back! Smells great and does amazing things to my hair!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. I use it for my 3 boys (along with the conditioner). My youngest son has very fine hair, so I don&#x27;t like it too much for him, but the other 2 boys have tight kinky curls and it makes their hair super soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with both dandruff and rosacea as I&#x27;ve gotten older, and I came to realize that harsher shampoos aggravated both conditions significantly. Products containing alcohol in particular were my personal trigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this based on Amazon reviews and I was not disappointed. It cleans well but gently. It has a pleasant, light floral scent. Most importantly, when I use it I have little to no troble with dandruff and my skin doesn&#x27;t flare up like it did with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who has never tried a sulfate free shampoo, it is extremely low lathering, it takes some getting used to, but that is normal. I use the conditioner as well, and I like it. My hair is straight, about normal texture and dryness, no special needs like curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying a bottle of the Camellia scent to try it but I would recommend this product based on my experience.</li>
            <li> I have corse hair, very dense, with medium thickness. I was excited when I saw that this product was organic, and could not wait to get home to try it. Epic fail, my hair was left feeling so brittle and dry, but it was clean.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little scared with the results of the was, so I did a deep conditioner treatment, and it helped.But I would not I mean would not purchase this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total not the product for me</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this shampoo and conditioner.  This is all natural and good for people with sensitive skin and sensitive noses.  The scent is very subtle and this shampoo cleans my hair gently without harsh chemicals.  Beware though, it is low-sudsing due to the plant extracts. If you like a good, thick lather, you won&#x27;t like this.  I don&#x27;t care as it leaves my hair so soft and the conditioner leaves my hair feeling like silk.  Highly recommended!  Now, if only I could find a good alternate shampoo/conditioner.  My hair likes a switch every now and then.</li>
            <li> I loved ,loved this stuff. I have been searching for a good natural shampoo and this by far is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the shampoo.  Extremely moisturizing and goes well with the matching conditioner.  This is the first time trying both shampoo and conditioner and highly recommend both.</li>
            <li> I used it. It was no better than the 99 cent store shampoo or the shampoo for sale for 99 cents in any store. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> The product does not sud because it does not contain Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. This is a filler and adds nothing to the cleaning effect. A lot of shampoos contain it however because ppl like the thought of suds and equate it to clean hair but it does not. Aubrey is natural so gives you the cleanliness without the use of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. I hope that answers why it doesn&#x27;t sud when you wash. For anyone that likes the look and feeling of suds Aubrey&#x27;s shampoo is probably not the product for you.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!!!! I have been searching for a natural alternative to what I had been using with very little luck. Everything I tried had dried out my hair horribly, even though I kind of have oily hair. My hair is on the thick side, curly with lots of frizz thanks to South Florida humidity, but blows out straight when I take the time (or when I am up north). The only product I ever was happy with was Head &amp; Shoulders but I really wanted to get away from using such a nasty product on my head. This product is a dream!!! My hair is shiny, silky, nourished, and I can actually skip a day washing it because it does not get oily. I&#x27;m so in love, I hope they continue to make this forever!</li>
            <li> Aubrey Organics is going corporate after they update their packaging graphics and change their formula.  There are a lot of chemicals and unpronounceable ingredients now.  I am afraid that they are part of the green-wash wagon now...Unfortunately I will have to look for other natural shampoo/conditioner after years of using Aubrey.</li>
            <li> Again order this product because I could not make it to health food store where I usually purchase from. I like Aubrey products so I hope this product is the same</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  It&#x27;s all natural and makes my hair feel great and use it on my dogs hair since he has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really care for this shampoo. It could just be me, but it left my hair dry and tangled. I won&#x27;t be buying this again. I&#x27;ll stick to Burt&#x27;s Bees super shiny mango shampoo.</li>
            <li> I like Aubrey Organics products because they aren&#x27;t full of chemicals, but I usually use the rosa mosqueta scent.  I bought this because I needed to keep shampoo in two different places and have read reviews raving about it.  It&#x27;s a perfectly fine product, cleans hair well just like the rosa mosqueta shampoo - but the smell is TERRIBLE.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents and find this one smells like dishwasher detergent.  Luckily the smell doesn&#x27;t linger so I will finish the bottle, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Seems to dry out my hair. The ingredients list is wonderful and I love the promise of Aubrey Organics...sadly, this product isn&#x27;t near as good as some of their others. I ended up buying another organic shampoo when I used all of this that is in a compostable container and makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> very good my natural curls came back no more losing hair in sink spread the word good price no sulfur shampoo worth trying</li>
            <li> Cleanses my hair really well without the suds but not the most moisturizing shampoo. The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest either.</li>
            <li> I guess I like lathering more than I realized. I never felt like it got all over my scalp, and it was hard to tell if hair was cleaned throughout, even after a quick rinse and reworking of shampoo. So-so.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised this is such a great shampoo. Very hydrating and makes you hair look great.</li>
            <li> We did not like the smell or feel of the hair after using it. We discarded the bottle with about 80% left.</li>
            <li> It smells great but I would never call it moisturizing. I&#x27;ve been trying to avoid using conditioners and unfortunately with this shampoo I had to. But it lathers better than most organic shampoos. It&#x27;s not awful, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love that this is made without sodium laurel sulphate so it&#x27;s safe to use on color treated hair in addition to being formulated without all the other harmful ingredients found in most shampoos.  The fragrance of the shampoo and the conditioner is wonderful and lingers in your hair all day!</li>
            <li> I thought organic shampoo would be the answer to my dry hair. This shampoo made the texture of my hair feel like hay. So disappointed with this product, I am back to using salon quality hair products. Smells weird too</li>
            <li> Thois shampoo made my hair feel stripped and dry. My hair was matted after I used this and I had to deep condition for a longer period of time. No bueno!</li>
            <li> This is horrible shampoo! I used Aubrey Organics Calaguala Fern Shampoo previously and loved it (I don&#x27;t need lather; I like organic). The Calaguala Fern Shampoo was not available via Prime, so I stupidly looked for a Prime alternative and assumed a Moisturizing shampoo by the same company would provide, you know, moisture. Like another reviewer, my hair was matted after using the shampoo - I couldn&#x27;t get my fingers through it to get the product out! Took twice as long to rinse and twice the amount of my ultra-moisturizing conditioner to get the hair somewhat manageable. Maybe I have unusual hair or I received a defective product, but there is absolutely NOTHING moisturizing about this shampoo.</li>
            <li> i have used this for years now.  i wont buy anything else.  i sometimes use it as body wash because it does not dry out my already dry skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair</li>
            <li> I used this along with the honey suckle conditioner and together they make a great team, the shampoo didn&#x27;t leave my hair with the usual slickness from typical shampoos which I loved but it wasn&#x27;t overly dry either. don&#x27;t expect a huge later like traditional shampoo that pulls all the natural oil out but a nice gentle lather with a great cleanse, I highly recommend this line for anyone with long, dry and easy to tangle hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hear so many good things about this shampoo i just had to try it ( BIG MISTAKE ) This stuff left my hair feeling like a brillo pad . I ended up using nearly all of my conditioner to bring my hair back to normal .</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo for my daughter who has natural hair.  I was somewhat disappointed in the shampoo and it left her hair hard.</li>
            <li> Have you ever drank sweet aloe juice you might find in some oriental grocery store? Have you ever drank really high quality green tea freshly brewed with leaves NOT in a bag?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, this shampoo smells very intensely like a mix of really really nice green tea and a hint of aloe juice or something -- and it smells pretty sweet. But what the scent is actually coming from is probably all those floral and herbal extracts, because this shampoo has no green tea in it whatsoever :P (I know, it&#x27;s not green tea I&#x27;m just saying it smells a lot like it to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably the best-smelling shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used in my life -- granted I love the smell of fruit like mangoes, peaches and pears, there&#x27;s just something EVEN BETTER about the smell of green tea in a shampoo. Probably because when I think green tea, I think CLEANSING -- whereas mangoes peaches and pears, sure they&#x27;re very sweet and healthy, but if you were to slather yourself with those sweet fruits (instead of wet green tea bags), you&#x27;d probably get all sticky and kind of yucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as being an effective shampoo, this is very good at de-greasing and just in general, cleaning I guess. I haven&#x27;t tried using it by itself in one showering session, however, I&#x27;d imagine if I went without the matching conditioner, my past-shoulder length hair would be a bit harder to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how this has no sulfates, mineral oils, parabens or other weird synthetic chemicals in it. but that&#x27;s what probably makes this stuff so expensive compared to conventional shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they&#x27;d sell these in larger containers, or at least make them cheaper.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shampoo that has a lovely, soft scent.  If you want a shampoo that really is natural (unlike most shampoos from so-called natural companies), try any Aubrey Organics shampoo.  I like this one in particular for it&#x27;s scent.  My hair is always soft, shiny, &amp; silky after using Aubrey products.  This has a matching conditioner that works really well, too.</li>
            <li> I am an african american woman with relaxed hair. I am always on the hunt for natural products to help my hair stay moisturized and be as nice as possible. I thought I would give this a try on my hair and my daughter (naturally curly, frizzy hair)... no can do. drying, stripping and the smell is not what i thought it would be. I don&#x27;t like it at all. I don&#x27;t know why it is so drying. Our hair (especially my daughter&#x27;s hair) was dry as straw. thank goodness for the Protein conditioner.....it worked just OK for me, but for my daughter - ugh. I can only say for my hair it is not good at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff essentially ruined my hair.. Which is a shame cause I really wanted to like it. It smells amazing, the ingredients are decent, and the conditioner that comes with it is so thick it feels like body butter.. so I don&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;s possible that my hair has become so insanely dry after using this for a month! Like unbelievably dry! I have long, fine, wavy hair that easily detangles in the shower- but with this I&#x27;ve actually been having to brush my hair in the shower with the conditioner in, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s still breaking like a mother.&lt;br /&gt;Booooo.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman with very tightly coiled dry hair. I had my last relaxer over a year ago and have been working with natural hair for the first time in about 20 years. I have tried a LOT of products. Going Natural is very popular right now in oru community and it is not easy finding products that can make our hair manageable and truly soft especially the hair texture that I have. I highly recommend all of the shampoos and conditioners. They are remarkable and for the FIRST time I am getting what I expect from a product. The fact that the products are also safe for my hair and my health is reason to celebrate. You must try this product. My favorite is Honeysuckle Rose but I also have and love GP Protein, Island Naturals and one other that escapes me at the moment. They are all fantastic and worth the price. Try these products your hair will feel heathier and have a better texture than you could have imagined. You will also be doing a great thing for your health. So many cosmetic products are toxic nowadays. Companies do not have to disclose what they are really using. I checked Aubrey Organics on the EWG website that studies the toxicity of cosmetics and they got very good scores. This is an all around win, win product. I just wish they would make a larger bottle. Additonally Honeysuckle Rose has a great fragrance. Some of the the others dont smell as good as this one but they work just as well.</li>
            <li> Works great if used with the conditioner from same company .  if you wish to switch to an honeysuckle organic shampoo,this is a good option.Be cautious to use it with the honeysuckle conditioner.If used alone,it leaves hair messy(dont have the exact word for that...too dry may be).</li>
            <li> I like the scent, and for an organic shampoo it does lather/sud pretty well, However, the lather doesn&#x27;t slide around your scalp at all since there is no silicone, so you end up having to use more of the product to get the shampoo evenly distributed.  I also found that I can&#x27;t run my fingers through my hair at all once I&#x27;ve washed it because it leaves your hair squeaky clean and not slick at all.  It took me a little while to get used to that, and I think I lost extra hair finding out.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time with getting suds without using a lot of product...shouldn&#x27;t be necessary...will not buy again...I am looking for products that don&#x27;t have all the chemicals and paraben free ...and this won&#x27;t work for me...</li>
            <li> I had high expectation for this product, but it just didn&#x27;t live up to my standards. The shampoo smelled A LOT like \\&quot;Scrubbing Bubbles,\\&quot; yes, the well-known bathroom cleaning product. The shampoo is runny. It lathers, but very well. Cleaning wise, it strips my hair clean to the point it felt excessively dry. The conditioner helped combat the dryness of the shampoo, but it&#x27;s not an exceptional conditioner. It does the job as conditioner, but it&#x27;s not the best conditioner out there. I typically will leave in the shampoo just a little longer than usual for a more reasonable result. Overall, I&#x27;m giving this product a one star because I don&#x27;t feel like it fully served its purpose for helping dry damage hair. I experienced dryness, fall-outs, and increase split-ends.</li>
            <li> smells fantastic and gets my hair nice and clean</li>
            <li> Like it but seems to be something in it that is not in the other one I usually buy; &#x27;Calaguala Fern&#x27; does not make my skin itch. It seems completely natural as far as I need it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The honeysuckle causes my skin to itch. I notice there are different ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, coarse hair, and apparently naturally dry hair.  I&#x27;ve only used this twice on my hair and it&#x27;s made it sooo dry both times.  My other natural shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry like this one, so I think I&#x27;ll stick to that one.  However, this works absolutely WONDERFUL as a body wash!  Leaves my skin very soft, which is weird to me after drying out my hair.  Whatever works.</li>
            <li> Smells great! I have very curly hair and I need to brush my hair in shower (versus use my fingers) to get my knots out with this conditioner. It does not leave a heavy residue like the others though, which I like.</li>
            <li> This shampoo did a number on my hair! My hair is curly and this product made my hair feel sooooo dry and damaged.  Lets not talk about the smell, OMG! It was bad, please dont buy this stuff.</li>
            <li> I like the ingredients and the scent, but this does not leave my hair moisturized enough. My hair is really dry, so I try to use it occasionally in the summer or with a stronger conditioner for a change up. Right now it&#x27;s in the guest bath about half used.</li>
            <li> Of all the Aubrey organic shampoos I have tried, this is the one I most prefer. Its all-natural formula gets my hair clean and leaves it smelling floral and feminine. Doesn&#x27;t dry or strip hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The corresponding conditioner is a little thick, but I added some water to the bottle and found it was just right. It leaves my hair silky-soft and manageable. Again, the floral scent is a huge plus. I would recommend these products for any woman with normal to dry hair.</li>
            <li> One of the best shampoos on the market; easily as good as Aveda. Especially for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I recently moved to creating my own organic shampoo and conditioner. It was a long drawn out 2 months of disaster on my hair. Finally in my efforts to use something more natural and organic still, I tried this shampoo and conditioner. I loved it! The smell was wonderful! I normally have incredibly thick, long, frizzy, naturally curly hair. I also suffer with psoriasis on my scalp which causes dandruff, because of the dryness. My hair loved this! My hair became soft and manageable. I struggled less with frizz, tangles, and the natural unruliness of my hair. Thank you Aubrey Organics for creating such a lovely natural shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> I am caucasian with thick, long hair.  Perhaps for a different txpe of air this may work, but it barely lathers and actually once applied actually feels like it gums up my haur.  It takes several long washings with lots of shampoo for my hair to reel clean and it feels awful.  Perhps this lack of kather and slipperiness is common with organic shampoos, but i did not lime tge feelimb at all.</li>
            <li> Since growing my hair out from a pixie cut, I&#x27;ve decided that if I&#x27;m going to grow my fragile hair long - I&#x27;m going to have to baby it.  That means daily vitamins, very little flat ironing, and sulfate free shampoo.  I can already tell a major difference after just a few months.  My hair looks so good, I don&#x27;t even want to flat iron it.  This shampoo smells so good, it&#x27;s a little addictive.  Now, bear in mind that sulfates (bad for your hair, maybe bad for you) is the ingredient that makes shampoo lather so this sulfate-free shampoo will not lather.  You have to work in in manually.  But you&#x27;d be surprised how fast you get used to it.</li>
            <li> I have really fine, completely straight, fairly dry hair.  This works great (I don&#x27;t care about lather, which is minimal, and I can totally tell when my hair is clean because it sort of squeaks).  I don&#x27;t want anything that will leave residue or build up because that produces flat-head-hair and with straight, fine hair it looks really bad.  This works great.  The honeysuckle rose conditioner is a must-have for follow up to prevent fly-aways, but the combination works great for me.  I also comb the conditioner through after I&#x27;ve coated my hair with it.&lt;br /&gt;My mom, with same hair but more naturally oily, doesn&#x27;t like the conditioner but uses the shampoo by itself when visiting and loves it.  It doesn&#x27;t work for all hair types, that is for sure!</li>
            <li> Usually my hair stays clean and pretty for about 2 days after regular showering. With this shampoo, less than 24 hours after showering my hair is already getting oily and stringy. Definitely not going to buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, you need SO MUCH product to feel clean with this shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t spread over your head well and doesn&#x27;t get foamy at all. Many people probably need to shampoo twice, which is ridiculous IMHO.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and although this feels slightly drying to my hair, when I must wash this is the choice.</li>
            <li> I love this. It doesn&#x27;t lather because It truly is sulfate free. And it leave my kinky hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this has gotten such high rating all over the web. Didn&#x27;t do anything for me and it stinks.</li>
            <li> Smell is very nice, very rare in Audbery shampoo and conditioner family:)&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning power is good. My hair needs shampooing every 3-4 days. When I apply this shampoo, my hair is very clean, but I can hardly run my finger through hair after shampooing, I wonder what ingredient cause this.&lt;br /&gt;After shampooing, I apply its pairing conditioner, which is also ok. After applying conditioner, my hair feel soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this pair would do any frizz control or any shine adds-on effect. I can observe my hair is soft and clean after usage.&lt;br /&gt;I would love to find something that also manage my hair frizzes though!no success yet</li>
            <li> When I decided to go with sodium lauryl sulfate free shampoos, I tried the Himalaya Herbal Healthcare brand and liked it. However, my hair eventually got used to the shampoo, making it less effective. Aubrey Organics, however, is truly amazing, because I&#x27;ve been using it for what must be over a year now with the same great results as I had at first. It leaves my hair softer and healthier feeling than the chemical-filled shampoos like Garnier Fructis. I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> The shampoo worked for its intended purpose, however I felt the sent was really strong. It also lathered poorly (which organic shampoo does do) but I felt like I needed more just to be clean. Tired a different brand and that ones seems to lather a bit better. I probably won&#x27;t be using this again as the strong odor was just too much for me.</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo along with the conditionor. After shampooing my hair felt like straw, very rough, stripped, and dry. The next day the back of my hair snapped right at the root. My mother used this shampoo as well and had the same reaction only it took the sides of her hair out. This may work for some hair textures but be aware that your hair may not react well and could fall out. I have 4b hair type.</li>
            <li> I did not like the scent or how it dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> Just like that... I&#x27;m very glad I tried this product. For my 1st time buying shampoo and conditioner online. Smells nice, cleans good, conditions good. It does the job and it wasn&#x27;t too expensive.  People just need to remember that sulfate free shampoos are NOT going to foam up like people have grown to expect. Definatly try it. :)</li>
            <li> I rely on Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose conditioner, so I was shocked with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  It smells NOTHING like the conditioner.  I expected differences, but this was just ridiculous.  The best way I can describe it is as smelling like my cat&#x27;s flea bath.  Horrible.&lt;br /&gt;2)  After the first lather my hair felt stripped of any moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stress enough how much I adore the Aubrey conditioner of this scent, and other shampoos by them, but this one was a huge miss for me.</li>
            <li> I am middle-aged, caucasian, with premature white naturally wavy hair. (Seriously, I had salt-n-pepper colored hair way back in high school.) Sometime in my middle 30s, my hair had turned almost pure white, became very resistant to dye, very brittle and had thinned to the point that you could see way more of my scalp than anyone should. To make matters worse, my scalp was flaming red. I also developed rosacia on my face at about this same time period. I am very light-skinned to begin with, so all of this redness just shined like a very unwanted beacon. Over the years, I have tried prescription shampoos and just about every product on the market (or so it seemed) with varying results (including conditioners) for at least the brittleness of my white hair. I gave up dying along with blow-drying as my first step. My hair is kept very short - again to reduce the stress on my hair from any styling; besides...few can get away with long, thin, white strands and look decent. Infusium 23 shampoo for dry &amp; damaged hair was my mainstay and the product I always returned to as it was the one product that helped somewhat with the hair loss due to being so brittle. Ironically, my hair has always felt soft and silky but I shed worse than my long-haired cat. Nothing ever helped reduce the redness of my scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I share my personal physical characteristics and history to provide insight into how Aubrey Organics shampoo &amp; conditioner  (honeysucke rose)  has provided stellar results for me in only about 10 days. For the first time in a long while I dared to take a small hand mirror and use it to study the back of my head in the wall mirror. I was shocked and delighted to discover that my scalp is no longer red! I had already noticed the front of my scalp looked much better and hair loss is decreasing by the day but the back of my head was always the worst. It could be wishful thinking that the back of my hair already appears thicker too but I am very pleased just the same! Perhaps, all I have needed during these years was a shampoo without sulphates and any like that would accomplish the same result. I might eventually test that theory but for now I like this shampoo&#x27;s smell and my hair just feels cleaner. I used to have to wash my hair daily because the conditioning products made my hair feel greasy the next day. Less washing probably will help too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without a doubt, I recommend this product and I hope this review can help others decide whether the product is worth a try or not!</li>
            <li> dried my hair out, this is not for my hair texure</li>
            <li> OK, let me set the scene with the mess that my hair was before I started my new haircare regime. I am Caucasian with very long and thick wavy hair that just does not like to behave. I suffer from several chronic illnesses and as a result my hair was in pretty bad shape thanks to a lack of nutrients and neglect. It was very dry and impossible to de-tangle and was driving me crazy, nothing was working for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this even though I don&#x27;t shampoo too often (and the conditioner to match) to use regularly as a part of a moisture-only routine as I wanted to avoid using anything with protein added for my &#x27;regular&#x27; washes (as opposed to deep conditioning days). I&#x27;d read some recommendations of this product online and I liked that it&#x27;s fairly natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the actual product and opened the bottle, it smelled pretty disgusting to me; it&#x27;s very herbal in an unpleasant way, to the point of smelling almost like chemicals, if that makes any sense. When I used the shampoo I was worried because it didn&#x27;t feel nice on my hair after rinsing, and the conditioner didn&#x27;t really feel like it was doing any good either. Nevertheless, I combed the conditioner gently through my hair and rinsed it out at the end of my shower. The smell once it was mixed a little wasn&#x27;t quite so bad but I still wouldn&#x27;t describe it as nice, to my tastes at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I detangled my hair with a wide-toothed comb and it seemed to be easier than usual. But I didn&#x27;t notice how incredible my hair felt until I dried it off. I felt like blow-drying my hair which I don&#x27;t often do, and from the very first section I was stunned at how silky and easily manageable my hair had become again. Seriously I cannot praise this stuff enough; I have not used it long term but for it to have done my hair this much good from one simple sitting, I&#x27;m pretty amazed - especially considering how skeptical I was. This product is definitely worth a try considering it&#x27;s not that expensive, and thebottles aren&#x27;t exactly small so it will last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the good that it does to my hair, I can forgive the smell; it actually doesn&#x27;t smell at all unpleasant once the hair is dry and if you&#x27;ve applied other products it mixes well - you know that smell your hair gets when you&#x27;ve just been to a salon to get your hair washed, cut etc? That&#x27;s what it smells like to me after, which is nice lol. If it bothers me when I use it regularly I&#x27;ll just mix in another oil to make it smell better. The main point is, this stuff works for me and I&#x27;m really happy about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that before I used these two products, I had done a deep cleansing and balancing/conditioning treatment in order to fix the foundations of my hair as much as possible, so this also adds to the reasons why my hair is feeling much better than before. However I do feel that this and its conditioner really works well with my hair type and I definitely have this product to thank for how well my hair is doing on only day 2 of my routine. I can recommend it to anyone with moisture problems with their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to buy both the shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;d say go with just the conditioner, but I feel that they both helped each other out and work well together as they should.</li>
            <li> In all fairness, this was my first foray into a less-chemical shampoo.I find that while the smell of this shampoo is okay, it doesn&#x27;t suds...like at all. So, I&#x27;m not a fan of this brand and found another brand (also without these chemicals) I prefer. Just not the right one for me.</li>
            <li> Too bad, I found it cheaper in Hawaii&#x27;s health food store. If tye price comes down I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> this does not really feel like shampoo - really no lather. I could deal with that expect for the fact that the smell is terrible. Certainly not honeysuckle or rose scented.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky when it comes to shampoo and have been looking for a moisturizing organic shampoo for years. This is it! It smells amazing and has kept my hair soft and smooth through the winter thus far. Love it. It also smells wonderful. It can be a little tough to get into all of your hair if you have long hair because it doesn&#x27;t suds up quite like the toxic stuff but it works great.</li>
            <li> It made my hair greasy. I finished the whole bottle and still would not go back. Plus, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fully organic. I suppose nothing is unless you make it but still I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has made a good difference. I recommended for those with dry scalp. Works fast as little as two applications.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo in an effort to start using less chemically enhanced beauty products. I had issues with my former shampoos leaving build up on my scalp -- Aubrey Organics leaves my scalp moisturized and without the build up. I can even go a few days without washing my hair without it looking greasy.</li>
            <li> the lack of lather takes some getting used to but I like it. Does not have a strong fragrance</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love the performance of this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I use this and the matching conditioner on my girls&#x27; very curly red hair.  Taming curly hair is a brutal operation.  This stuff is a big help.  Wash, rinse, add conditioner and comb it out.  Then let it sit a few minutes.  Really, Really great.</li>
            <li> The shampoo did suds up for me and it left my hair very clean. I am pleased that it has natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;It did leave my hair very tangled;however, I applied the AO Honeysuckle Rose conditioner and it returned the moisture which enabled me to detangle without effort and minimal hair loss. I like it. I have gone through a lot of different products to get to this. This one looks like a keeper.</li>
