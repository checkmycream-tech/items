            <li>You get 4 different file grain, from shaping to polishing and making your nails nice and shiny!</li>
            <li>These are fantastic and just exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Love these so much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She wants to buy more.</li>
            <li>I play classical guitar and had been using four way buffers found in most mega and supermarkets for many years.</li>
            <li>and they were exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>The sound of fingernail scratch on guitar strings is very objectionable.  </li>
            <li>, this is worth it.  </li>
            <li>They come in a nice big pack too</li>
            <li>They have the 4 different file strengths so it make buffing your nails super easy!</li>
            <li>The grit is just right.</li>
            <li>I use these more for filing after i use a rough file, then use these to smooth my nail and shape them, I do use them every once and awhile to shine my nails.</li>
            <li>It comes with some really cute and useful styles for one low price.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>outside , thinking, as well as nails seem to be able to be used for foot care .</li>
            <li>exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li>and so reasonable!</li>
            <li>Great price and last a long time.</li>
            <li>The buffer/file (I never know what to call these really) is pretty durable.  </li>
            <li>Love the four different textures that you follow in order of manicure!</li>
            <li>The material us as good as as any more expensive files-buffers.</li>
            <li>After using clippers and a stone nail file, these smooth and give a high gloss that looks like a coat of clear polish.  </li>
            <li>in the pack to last a looonnnggg time.&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive and does a fine job.</li>
            <li>These are very well made.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy durable file for me that is.</li>
            <li>They would even tear and they wore out so fast.</li>
            <li>I like the very heart.</li>
            <li>She said this Nail File and buffer is very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These buff very well.  </li>
            <li>But me, I need more and stronger gritty nail filing and less of the smooth.</li>
            <li>Much easier to manoeuvre than the block styles where the gritty strips come unglued and quickly wear out.  </li>
            <li>It is about one full year later</li>
            <li>and I love having several to have in various places.  </li>
            <li>They are large enough for easy handling yet compact enough to toss in your purse for emergency fixes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>They do kind of wear out maybe a little faster, but hey, they have all of the sides I need, and if I lose it - it isn&#x27;t a big loss.</li>
            <li>I would tear up a brand new buffer inside of two minutes.  </li>
            <li>Do not use some other cheap ones, like a $6 multipack because its cheaper, those usually suck and are one use, it is so worth it to spend a few extra bucks and get really great quality nail files.</li>
            <li>Searched many times on here and other sites and finally found these listed.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and don&#x27;t fall apart after a few uses.</li>
            <li>I never understood why some brands have such large printing, that decreases the usable surface on the board.</li>
            <li>Use the grades in order and test your nail directly on the unwound strings and listen for any scratching.  </li>
            <li>I could see a lot of busy</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone is different, as these reviews attest, so these may work really, really well for you.</li>
            <li>because my nail is very worng.&lt;br /&gt;There are several advantages of this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all for keeping my money local and supporting local businesses, but if you&#x27;re on a budget (like I am)</li>
            <li>I do major nail shaping with a metal file, and use this buffer for finer shaping and polishing.</li>
            <li>The second 1/4th that&#x27;s gritty on the nail file side is nearly useless--the grit is too low level.</li>

            <li> A little thin on the abrasion but all in all work very well with the buffing and shaping of the finger nails.</li>
            <li> I used to find similar sticks at the dollar store, but they&#x27;re getting hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Test the pick scratch on the e string as before  and don&#x27;t stop until the scratch quiets down.  </li>

            <li> Alas, the quality of those products declined precipitously.</li>

            <li> UPDATE: It is about one full year later and I am re-ordering. $10 is a fine price to pay for a full year of great nail files. Do not use some other cheap ones, like a $6 multipack because its cheaper, those usually suck and are one use, it is so worth it to spend a few extra bucks and get really great quality nail files. Only nail file/buffer I&#x27;ll ever buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THESE ARE THE BEST NAIL BUFFERS EVER!!!!!!!! I have used so many brands, from amazon and drugstores and these are the best I&#x27;ve encountered. Love these so much. The fact that they don&#x27;t have writing on it is great because more surface area for the file. I use them a few times for a month and then toss them. Great price, great product. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> These are fantastic and just exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> My favourite nail files</li>
            <li> Good Product. These are very well made. They offer 4 steps to getting beautiful nails. Step 1 is the Blue, Step 2 is Pink, Step 3 is Grey and Step 4 is White. These are very affordable if you want great looking nails. I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Works really great and. Having a pack is more convenient as I tend to misplace things. *I received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest opinion *</li>
            <li> Nice grain texture on file which does not hurt or injure nail. Very sturdy durable file for me that is.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Just ok. Guess I didn&#x27;t realize they are one usage only. If they need to be sanitized, which I need (they came apart).</li>
            <li> I needed to find nail boards to handle applying and removing gel polish.  With their various surfaces, they handled removal and replacement of gel polish without requiring additional products.  They are large enough for easy handling yet compact enough to toss in your purse for emergency fixes.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery, really good .&lt;br /&gt;In addition, very light .&lt;br /&gt;Durable outside , thinking, as well as nails seem to be able to be used for foot care .</li>
            <li> Your search is over if you use your fingers to play guitar like I do.  It has four grades that are like they were picked out specifically for guitar players.  The sound of fingernail scratch on guitar strings is very objectionable.  Use the grades in order and test your nail directly on the unwound strings and listen for any scratching.  Here&#x27;s a tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also take these and all your favorite picks and give them a manicure with these sticks.  What you do is bevel the attack side of the pick as in Wegen pics.  When you have the correct bevel, start to polish.  Test the pick scratch on the e string as before  and don&#x27;t stop until the scratch quiets down.  It will change your life if you haven&#x27;t been doing this or even been paying attention to this detail.  I used to find similar sticks at the dollar store, but they&#x27;re getting hard to find.  If I can get 10 at a shot, I&#x27;m in.  Hope this helps get you a wonderful sound on your axe.</li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li> These are very nice, just like a name brand and for a nice price.</li>
            <li> These are nice files.  Inexpensive and I love having several to have in various places.  They do kind of wear out maybe a little faster, but hey, they have all of the sides I need, and if I lose it - it isn&#x27;t a big loss.</li>
            <li> These are easy to use. Four (4) grits for rough shaping through buff.&lt;br /&gt;Plenty in the pack to last a looonnnggg time.&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive and does a fine job.</li>
            <li> I love these 4 way nail file buffers! You get 4 different file grain, from shaping to polishing and making your nails nice and shiny! I love i got 12! These are so much better then those blocks I would buy, and I paid like $6 for 1! That didn&#x27;t even last but a couple times! They would even tear and they wore out so fast. I use these more for filing after i use a rough file, then use these to smooth my nail and shape them, I do use them every once and awhile to shine my nails. These just work so much better then the block ones and last longer! And you get 12! I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
            <li> The review was delayed.&lt;br /&gt;Now I could see a lot of busy products.&lt;br /&gt;Quite a good product ...&lt;br /&gt;The sufficient value.</li>
            <li> I like the very heart. Buying was well</li>
            <li> I do my own manicures and pedicures, and always have--though I&#x27;m lazier these days--so these files attracted me for the 4-way capacity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the smoother side of the board is the buffing side. And the nail file side is not gritty enough. I mean, I almost used up the whole of the most-gritty 1/4th on just one manicure. The second 1/4th that&#x27;s gritty on the nail file side is nearly useless--the grit is too low level. The smooth side is meh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\\&quot;m gonna go back to buying the nail files and buffers separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is different, as these reviews attest, so these may work really, really well for you. But me, I need more and stronger gritty nail filing and less of the smooth.</li>
            <li> A little thin on the abrasion but all in all work very well with the buffing and shaping of the finger nails.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these, but I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere.  I saw the 12 pack here and it will probably last him for years.</li>
            <li> Love these! and so reasonable!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them very long yet but they seem very good.  I am sure that I will like them fine!</li>
            <li> Great price and last a long time. I would definitely buy again. The material us as good as as any more expensive files-buffers.</li>
            <li> These are some really nice nail files / buffers. I had two of this style buffer brand name &amp;#34;Rainbow&amp;#34; for maybe 15 years but they are all but worn out and could not find anything to replace them. Searched many times on here and other sites and finally found these listed. These will make your nails shine without polish. If you want an even better price use the seller website.</li>
            <li> This buffer is good for use. I gave this to my sister. She said this Nail File and buffer is very good.&lt;br /&gt;She wants to buy more.</li>
            <li> These are the very best buffers I&#x27;ve ever found. The grit is just right. I love the fact that they come in a convenient 12-pack. Such a great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> These are awesome! Four levels of &amp;#34;sanding&amp;#34; per file.</li>
            <li> so cute...i love it..</li>
            <li> I play classical guitar and had been using four way buffers found in most mega and supermarkets for many years. Alas, the quality of those products declined precipitously. I would tear up a brand new buffer inside of two minutes.  This product is much, much better. I do major nail shaping with a metal file, and use this buffer for finer shaping and polishing. The resulting sound is very good.</li>
            <li> These are very nice for smoothing the nails and making them shine too.</li>
            <li> I love these files.  They are easy to use and don&#x27;t fall apart after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Purchased these for my wife.  They are unmarked, leaving it up to the user to figure out the proper order to use the four different grit arrangement.  In addition the quality is marginal.</li>
            <li> Really nice for making smooth shiny nails.  Use it this order, blue, pink, white, then grey.</li>
            <li> The price I paid for 12 of these buffers was less than half of what I would have paid for 2 of them from my local pharmacy.  I&#x27;m all for keeping my money local and supporting local businesses, but if you&#x27;re on a budget (like I am) and you need to cut corners sometimes, this is worth it.  The buffer/file (I never know what to call these really) is pretty durable.  I have been using one for about 2 months now and it is only now starting to get towards the end of its life (I use it a couple of times a week).</li>
            <li> I bought this thing for me. because my nail is very worng.&lt;br /&gt;There are several advantages of this product.&lt;br /&gt;1. I have used this every day, but this have had no problems.&lt;br /&gt;2. This nail files and buffers have no scent in them.&lt;br /&gt;3. It comes with some really cute and useful styles for one low price.&lt;br /&gt;4. They are easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Everything I say is my personal opinion on this product. I was trying to say as objectively as possible.&lt;br /&gt;I have received the product for free in exchange for an honest and fair assessment.</li>
            <li> These buff very well.  I like them more than others I&#x27;ve had because there is no printing on them.  I never understood why some brands have such large printing, that decreases the usable surface on the board.</li>
            <li> Love the four different textures that you follow in order of manicure!</li>
            <li> These are the best nail files around. I looked for them forever and finally saw the reviews on these and they were exactly what I was looking for! They have the 4 different file strengths so it make buffing your nails super easy! I can get my smoother than they have been in a long time now. They come in a nice big pack too so I&#x27;m stocked up for a while!</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve used many types of files; these are some of the best.  After using clippers and a stone nail file, these smooth and give a high gloss that looks like a coat of clear polish.  Much easier to manoeuvre than the block styles where the gritty strips come unglued and quickly wear out.  Great value.</li>
            <li> These are great for smoothing your nails.  I&#x27;ve begun doing my own nails at home and these are just what I need to get that salon look for shaping and buffing my nails.</li>
