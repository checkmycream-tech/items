            <li>Very happy with this soap.</li>
            <li>which is impressive, as I now use it in place of shampoo, conditioner, and body-wash.</li>
            <li>Were add on gifts for my boyfriend and my best friend for Christmas.</li>
            <li>and this is a MANLY MENS SOAP. :D</li>
            <li>Great Stuff!</li>
            <li>Perfect gift for returning home from deployment.</li>
            <li>Very good for any man.</li>
            <li>This company has great customer service and the soap is AWESOME!</li>
            <li>and it does smell great.</li>
            <li>Great smell.</li>
            <li>wonderful in the shower, and has a nice, lingering, non-obnoxious smell after&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great soap.</li>
            <li>Amazing customer service from Duke Cannon!</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>He smells good.</li>
            <li>But the concept of a manly soap bar was entertaining and the bf loved it.</li>
            <li>both enjoyed and laughed at the description.</li>
            <li>And smell nice.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t tell you there is some kind of &amp;#34;seed?&amp;#34; in it.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, has terrific lather, and is otherwise all good.  </li>
            <li>Excellent soap, great quality - thrilled the tough fellas in my life, have since purchased 3 more bars although each one lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>The smell is a lot better than most</li>
            <li>so be prepared for either one.  :)</li>
            <li>smelled ok.  </li>
            <li>OK... ordered this for the novelty and had no intention of using the soap...</li>
            <li>The packaging is mildly entertaining, and nicely-made</li>
            <li>I love smelling like accomplishment in the morning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a more manly scent than most others.  </li>
            <li>Oatmeal in the soap makes it easy to grip.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-you might need to clean your tub a bit more often.</li>
            <li>I found this soap to be of good quality, it had a clean fragrance, and the large size made it seem like a bargain.</li>
            <li>This is a HUGE bar of soap.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and is quite big.  </li>
            <li>Everyday use (sometimes twice a day) - the best bar of soap I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Like others have said, the grain in the soap does make it much easier to grip and it also feels nice to the touch.</li>
            <li>Great for getting deep into my husband&#x27;s pores.  </li>
            <li>Smell great and is as big as it claims.</li>
            <li>I bought this and was NOT disappointed by it&#x27;s size.</li>
            <li>And It gets me clean when I have been working in the garage...</li>
            <li>/&gt; Clean your tubs, people.</li>
            <li>Cool soaps.</li>
            <li>When I came home my neighbor, Biff, had already washed my truck and boat, and my wife was more than ready to see me.</li>
            <li>After my first use I looked like I showered with a feral cat!</li>
            <li>I find the latter phrase to be amusing, but some people may not.  </li>
            <li>Easily got suds and it rinses very clean, absolutely no residue.</li>
            <li>Just be aware that you are not getting to choose which phrase is printed on the package--</li>
            <li>I have moderately oily hair, which might help, but I&#x27;ve been told my hair is nice and soft, and not in a soft-because-it&#x27;s-bone-dry</li>
            <li>Good long lasting soap</li>
            <li>I tried it a couple more times hoping these little razors would quickly diminish but no way.</li>
            <li>way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a large bar of nice-smelling soap that I&#x27;d recommend to those looking for an earthier</li>
            <li>Pure accomplishment.</li>
            <li>- you have to wash the sink, after washing your hands, and best leave the soap in the sink to dry, or you wind up with inky soap scum like in the photo.</li>
            <li>Felt like real man after using.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Really like the scent.</li>
            <li>The smell is unique and took a few days to adjust to using it before I really started to enjoy it.</li>
            <li>They market it as some kind of  military government men only testosterone thing thing (to be funny ?)</li>
            <li>I think this soap is ok, but I don&#x27;t get the scents of bergamot and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Most bars are now 4-5 oz,,, so with a 3 pack, I waste approx.</li>
            <li>The Duke Cannon soaps smell nice and last a long time, given their enormous size.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few of the Duke Cannon scents, and so far this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I confidently pick the big-a... bar back up in the shower when it slips my manly grip; no one in prison will mess with this guy.</li>
            <li>Cool can concept, some was good, but black soapy residue was messy and soap didn&#x27;t last very long considering its xl size.</li>
            <li>The bar is as big as advertised and will leave a black residue that easily rinses off.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my boyfriend, and he liked it, but it left blueish black steaks all down the side of his shower..</li>
            <li>Really large, long lasting bars.</li>
            <li>For the man who wants minimal perfume, maximum performance.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll smell clean (not accomplished or any of the other things).</li>
            <li>This soap did not last as long as a normal bar of soap.  </li>
            <li>; I&#x27;m only just coming to the end of my first bar, which I received a year and a half ago...</li>
            <li>I would certainly buy another bar of Duke Cannon, but it wouldn&#x27;t be the black one.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is this soap is much more slippery than other soaps I have used.</li>
            <li>Planning on trying the others in the Duke Cannon lineup, but really like the black bar.</li>

            <li> It seems like it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> How&#x27;s that for a positive negative, huh?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strange, you&#x27;ll have inky soap bubbles</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how long this bar of soap lasted me after I split it into fourths (and used a salux-brand wash cloth).</li>
            <li> With this being so large, I will waste less.</li>
            <li> The bar is pretty large and difficult to handle - I cut mine in half and use one half at a time.  </li>
            <li> However, this specific &amp;#34;Smells like accomplishment&amp;#34; variety is jet black.</li>
            <li> My (female) hands are average size, and I find handling this bar to be an accomplishment in and of itself!  </li>
            <li> Wish the scent was a little stronger and longer-lasting, my only &amp;#34;complaint.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> And they are like tiny little razors.</li>
            <li> Scent is very masculine, yet subtle.</li>
            <li> When new, they are actually somewhat difficult to use because they&#x27;re so large--I tend to drop them in</li>
            <li> other thing to note:  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try the other bars</li>
            <li> Tried this the other day, and before I walked into my office I had already gotten a promotion, 20% raise, and a corner desk with window in downtown DC.</li>
            <li> I usually pitch a bar of soap when there is about  a half ounce left.  </li>
            <li> The smell was average.</li>
            <li> so I could try one of the other scents!  </li>
            <li> Hate those slivers of soap left after a normal bar is only used a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> leaves black in the shower</li>
            <li> /&gt; Black soap &#x3D; black ring, makes sense.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was given the black bar as a gift and was giddy to try it.</li>
            <li> Wife doesn&#x27;t like the black suds on the shower and shower curtain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy it again if it weren&#x27;t a soapy black mess.</li>
            <li> I would be willing to bet that whatever caused this to happen was an artificial coloring agent which should be done away with.</li>
            <li> Personally, I think its difficult to grasp due to size but it might be because I have small womanly hands</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has been using this product for a little over a year now.</li>
            <li> (I keep mine in a little tupperware box to keep a spot from forming)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those with small hands might need to start by cutting it in half with a large knife&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just plain soap.</li>
            <li> It lathers black and left a black mess in my shower which I found disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not comfortable with knowing I&amp;#34;m adding unnecessary black coloring into the water supply, either.</li>
            <li> As noted though, it is crazy big</li>
            <li> I like the smell and the texture of the soap but the size is a little awkward and the black residue is everywhere in my shower.</li>
            <li> Only annoying thing is that it drips black and leaves stains in the shower (they do wash off!).</li>
            <li> Not good at all.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a whole pile of nasty looking soap buildup on and around my soap rack.</li>
            <li> The worst (and main reason for 3 stars) is that the black soap residue looks TERRIBLE around my sink.</li>
            <li> ; phrase--my wife does not want me to give something at a family Christmas that has a vulgar phrase like that, and I understand.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great soap ! Really large, long lasting bars.</li>
            <li> A manly soap. For the man who wants minimal perfume, maximum performance.</li>
            <li> Good long lasting soap</li>
            <li> I accidentally used this soap-my boyfriend&#x27;s as it was-and I grew man parts, turned white, and won a congressional seat. I didn&#x27;t even know I was running for office.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap, great quality - thrilled the tough fellas in my life, have since purchased 3 more bars although each one lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> Got for the size &amp; hoping it would last. Hate those slivers of soap left after a normal bar is only used a couple weeks. This accomplishes that. The manly part is hogwash. It&#x27;s just soap, people. Think Irish Spring, Dial...like that. They market it as some kind of  military government men only testosterone thing thing (to be funny ?) but if you just want a bigger bar of soap that lasts longer get this. That&#x27;s what it does. You&#x27;ll smell clean (not accomplished or any of the other things).</li>
            <li> Big brick, but it just melted away.  This soap did not last as long as a normal bar of soap.  For the price, I will not be purchasing another.  I see it as just a novelty item.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend, and he liked it, but it left blueish black steaks all down the side of his shower..</li>
            <li> I found this soap to be of good quality, it had a clean fragrance, and the large size made it seem like a bargain. However, this specific &amp;#34;Smells like accomplishment&amp;#34; variety is jet black. It lathers black and left a black mess in my shower which I found disappointing. I would be willing to bet that whatever caused this to happen was an artificial coloring agent which should be done away with. I&#x27;d buy it again if it weren&#x27;t a soapy black mess.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Felt like real man after using.</li>
            <li> This company has great customer service and the soap is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> Imagine you&#x27;ve been sorting newspapers for a couple of hours, then washed away the ink, and you can picture what comes off as you use this soap. It&#x27;s strange, you&#x27;ll have inky soap bubbles - you have to wash the sink, after washing your hands, and best leave the soap in the sink to dry, or you wind up with inky soap scum like in the photo. I&#x27;m not comfortable with knowing I&amp;#34;m adding unnecessary black coloring into the water supply, either. As noted though, it is crazy big and it does smell great.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this soap. Scent is very masculine, yet subtle. And it truly is a big brick of soap, it will last. Oatmeal in the soap makes it easy to grip. Only complaint is this soap is much more slippery than other soaps I have used.</li>
            <li> Smells great and is quite big.  I like the feel and it works like you would expect.  The smell is a lot better than most</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has been using this product for a little over a year now. He loves it. He smells good. And it lasts forever!</li>
            <li> Works as described. Shipment went as planned</li>
            <li> The Duke Cannon soaps smell nice and last a long time, given their enormous size.  When new, they are actually somewhat difficult to use because they&#x27;re so large--I tend to drop them in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing to note:  there are two different packages for these soaps.  Some packages say &amp;#34;superior grade bar soap&amp;#34;--some others say &amp;#34;big ass brick of soap&amp;#34;.  I find the latter phrase to be amusing, but some people may not.  I ordered one from Amazon that had the &amp;#34;superior grade&amp;#34; phrase in the description and photo, and ended up getting one with the &amp;#34;big ass&amp;#34; phrase--my wife does not want me to give something at a family Christmas that has a vulgar phrase like that, and I understand.  Just be aware that you are not getting to choose which phrase is printed on the package--so be prepared for either one.  :)</li>
            <li> This is a HUGE bar of soap.  My (female) hands are average size, and I find handling this bar to be an accomplishment in and of itself!  It smells wonderful, has terrific lather, and is otherwise all good.  I just wish it would use up faster so I could try one of the other scents!  How&#x27;s that for a positive negative, huh?  Oh, FYI, I don&#x27;t smell of after shave or men&#x27;s cologne all day.  The scent of the soap doesn&#x27;t compete with my floral perfume, etc.</li>
            <li> smelled ok.  leaves black in the shower</li>
            <li> OK... ordered this for the novelty and had no intention of using the soap... but I ran out and needed some so I popped the box o[en.  This is QUALITY soap... manly smelling but not over powering.  And It gets me clean when I have been working in the garage...something my wife&#x27;s soap wont do.</li>
            <li> I think this soap is ok, but I don&#x27;t get the scents of bergamot and black pepper. Just plain soap. I prefer the Naval Supremecy</li>
            <li> Great smell. Very good for any man.</li>
            <li> First the 2 small cons, then the pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-the wheat in the bar doesn&#x27;t do much&lt;br /&gt;-you might need to clean your tub a bit more often. It doesn&#x27;t stain, but the build-up of soap in the shower can start to look like mildew.&lt;br /&gt; Black soap &#x3D; black ring, makes sense.&lt;br /&gt; Clean your tubs, people. (I keep mine in a little tupperware box to keep a spot from forming)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-smells wonderful in the shower, and has a nice, lingering, non-obnoxious smell after&lt;br /&gt;-lasts forever; I&#x27;m only just coming to the end of my first bar, which I received a year and a half ago...&lt;br /&gt;-...which is impressive, as I now use it in place of shampoo, conditioner, and body-wash. I have moderately oily hair, which might help, but I&#x27;ve been told my hair is nice and soft, and not in a soft-because-it&#x27;s-bone-dry way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a large bar of nice-smelling soap that I&#x27;d recommend to those looking for an earthier scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those with small hands might need to start by cutting it in half with a large knife&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. The packaging is mildly entertaining, and nicely-made</li>
            <li> I like the smell and the texture of the soap but the size is a little awkward and the black residue is everywhere in my shower. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I love smelling like accomplishment in the morning.</li>
            <li> Cool can concept, some was good, but black soapy residue was messy and soap didn&#x27;t last very long considering its xl size. Disappointed. Probably wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> Six weeks...that&#x27;s how long this bar of soap lasted me after I split it into fourths (and used a salux-brand wash cloth). Everyday use (sometimes twice a day) - the best bar of soap I&#x27;ve ever used. Easily got suds and it rinses very clean, absolutely no residue. Wish the scent was a little stronger and longer-lasting, my only &amp;#34;complaint.&amp;#34; Planning on trying the others in the Duke Cannon lineup, but really like the black bar.</li>
            <li> Cool soaps. Were add on gifts for my boyfriend and my best friend for Christmas. Only annoying thing is that it drips black and leaves stains in the shower (they do wash off!). But the concept of a manly soap bar was entertaining and the bf loved it. I&#x27;m assuming my friend did too cause he didn&#x27;t complain.:D both enjoyed and laughed at the description.Personally, I think its difficult to grasp due to size but it might be because I have small womanly hands and this is a MANLY MENS SOAP. :D</li>
            <li> Great Stuff! Can&#x27;t wait to try the other bars</li>
            <li> The bar is pretty large and difficult to handle - I cut mine in half and use one half at a time.  I&#x27;ve tried a few of the Duke Cannon scents, and so far this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an add on recently.  The bar is as big as advertised and will leave a black residue that easily rinses off.  The smell reminds me of&lt;br /&gt;Lava soap, (just without the pumice).  It&#x27;s a more manly scent than most others.  It seems like it will last a long time.  I usually pitch a bar of soap when there is about  a half ounce left.  Most bars are now 4-5 oz,,, so with a 3 pack, I waste approx. 2 oz.  With this being so large, I will waste less.</li>
            <li> Tried this the other day, and before I walked into my office I had already gotten a promotion, 20% raise, and a corner desk with window in downtown DC. When I came home my neighbor, Biff, had already washed my truck and boat, and my wife was more than ready to see me. Did I mention the 50% discount I got from Home Depot on wood-paneling my home office? This stuff is the real deal. I confidently pick the big-a... bar back up in the shower when it slips my manly grip; no one in prison will mess with this guy. Pure accomplishment. Oh yea... I feel cleaner too. And smell nice. Perfect gift for returning home from deployment.</li>
            <li> I was given the black bar as a gift and was giddy to try it. The smell is unique and took a few days to adjust to using it before I really started to enjoy it. Like others have said, the grain in the soap does make it much easier to grip and it also feels nice to the touch. The worst (and main reason for 3 stars) is that the black soap residue looks TERRIBLE around my sink. My roommates constantly complain about it and I don&#x27;t blame them...there&#x27;s a whole pile of nasty looking soap buildup on and around my soap rack. I would certainly buy another bar of Duke Cannon, but it wouldn&#x27;t be the black one.</li>
            <li> So I wanted a BIG BAR of Soap that didn&#x27;t disappear after a week. I bought this and was NOT disappointed by it&#x27;s size. HOWEVER, user beware! They don&#x27;t tell you there is some kind of &amp;#34;seed?&amp;#34; in it. And they are like tiny little razors. After my first use I looked like I showered with a feral cat! I tried it a couple more times hoping these little razors would quickly diminish but no way. I couldn&#x27;t handle it. The smell was average. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Really like the scent. Wife doesn&#x27;t like the black suds on the shower and shower curtain. I am going to stick with the peppermint.</li>
            <li> Great soap. Amazing customer service from Duke Cannon!</li>
            <li> Not good at all. I&#x27;ll stick to the Musgo by Claus Porto.</li>
            <li> Big bar of soap.  Great for getting deep into my husband&#x27;s pores.  The one challenge, as with all bar soaps, as it does start to separate layers after several weeks in the shower.  Smell great and is as big as it claims.</li>
