            <li>My kids like it, it is safe and convenient.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably upgrade to something better and I won&#x27;t be giving up the spa steam treatments.</li>
            <li>Its ok</li>
            <li>This is one of the best products for at home use if you want clear clean skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gets pretty warm quite quickly and the steam is effective in opening pours as it claims to do!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to operate and clean; light weight and easy to store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and works well.</li>
            <li>it could easily tip if not</li>
            <li>Light weight and easy to store</li>
            <li>After using the facial sauna, with towel over head, with my face still moist I then put on moisturizer and it helps greatly.  </li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, GOOD FOR JUST STEAMING, A FACIAL AND EVEN A HEAD</li>
            <li>It produces a good stream of steam, and the face funnel is soft.  </li>
            <li>Great product plenty of room so that you don&#x27;t feel closed in while using the steamer.  </li>
            <li>Also it helps my sinuses tremendously.  </li>
            <li>It let&#x27;s off an adequate amount of steam; but you have to put your face into the mask.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to use and works better than a hot compress.</li>
            <li>and I am ready to give it free.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for I suppose and I wish I had spent more money on a better model.</li>
            <li>She particularly liked the wide face interface and this steamer puts out more steam than the older one made by another company.</li>
            <li>Heats up quick and does get hot...</li>
            <li>For such little money-  great!</li>
            <li>I looked at many facial steamers before choosing this one.</li>
            <li>Got This For My Wife After Looking At Many Different Styles!  </li>
            <li>My goal was simply to help clear my sinuses, and while it DID NOT produce the quantity of the steam of the  old KASS steamer, the BELSON was a happy find for me.</li>
            <li>This is so helpful with getting my skin clean and keeping it clear.  </li>
            <li>In the end, I chose this one because of positive reviews and the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought this to help with my large pores.</li>
            <li>If someone really wants to buy this , pay me the shipping</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather lie back than have to find a comfortable set up on an even surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Produces a lot of steam and works very well.  </li>
            <li>heats up fast too</li>
            <li>I find it also very relaxing to use.</li>
            <li>the cup is wide so for big faces like mine, i ont have to rock from side to side to get a good steam.</li>
            <li>The water heats up quickly but I felt the need to move my head around to get the benefit of the steam to my entire face.</li>
            <li>Plus On Some Of The High End Steamers &amp; Am</li>
            <li>the green Mask was just okay...</li>
            <li>This is not the first steamer I&#x27;ve owned -- and it won&#x27;t be the last.</li>
            <li>But make sure you do it on a hard surface</li>
            <li>Completely covers the face - of any size.</li>
            <li>My old steamer sprayed the steam and lacked the face shield design.</li>
            <li>I used to get professional facials for my problem skin, but since using steam at home, I don&#x27;t need to spend that money.  </li>
            <li>I have had this sauna for 2months so far...</li>
            <li>Using it for facials and for my kids when they have a stuffy nose; my son is 6yrs old and he doesn&#x27;t mind using it.</li>
            <li>I bought this iitem because in my old age I have developed pores the size of man hole covers.  </li>
            <li>wow what a difference.  </li>
            <li>We replacing an old KAZZ steamer, which was now out of production.  </li>
            <li>The product functions well enough, though as many of the other reviews stated, it is necessary to use a large towel placed over the entire product , face, and neck in order to produce/capture enough steam.  </li>
            <li>Has been used daily since it was received for an individual with eyelid oil gland blockage and has worked very well in opening up the glands.  </li>
            <li>Still, it takes up a lot of real estate if you have limited room in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Yes love it My skin looks so good. My husband say  looks great!</li>
            <li> My face always feel dry, even using moistures and oils.  I got this thinking water is a good moisture.  After using the facial sauna, with towel over head, with my face still moist I then put on moisturizer and it helps greatly.  It just feels good, but don&#x27;t put face too close to steam or you&#x27;ll get a red face burn.</li>
            <li> For such little money-  great! At home, to steam the face and children noses  - a good thing! My kids like it, it is safe and convenient. Simple and tasteful. Pouring a small amount of water with measured cap and &#x27;Steamer&#x27; himself prepares a boil. Completely covers the face - of any size.</li>
            <li> Does not generate enough steam  Steam is so miniscuile that could hardly feel on the face  The manual says to put just 5-6 tsp and that is not what I was looking for  If someone really wants to buy this , pay me the shipping and I am ready to give it free.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with my large pores. I looked at many facial steamers before choosing this one. In the end, I chose this one because of positive reviews and the price.&lt;br /&gt;I think it works well. I do put a towel over my head when I use it to intensify the steam. Without the towel, I am not sure that it would be enough steam.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: just before I use it, I take a waffle (thin) cloth and soak it in cold water then squeeze it out really well. I lay it out flat in my freezer. When I finish streaming my face for 10 minutes. I pay my face dry and then take the cloth out of the freezer and pay it on my face to close the press.</li>
            <li> I have an almost 13 year old that has had black heads on her nose. This is the only breakouts she gets. I bought the steamer to help her keep her pores cleaned so that she doesn&#x27;t have to squeeze the blackheads. Works like a charm!</li>
            <li> This is not the first steamer I&#x27;ve owned -- and it won&#x27;t be the last. My old steamer sprayed the steam and lacked the face shield design. I really liked it until it spewed boiling water on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, the price of the Belson Profiles Steamer can&#x27;t be beat. But, it has its drawbacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of this steamer makes you have to lean over the steam. I&#x27;d rather lie back than have to find a comfortable set up on an even surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something that gives salon results, you&#x27;ll find it disappointing too. The water heats up quickly but I felt the need to move my head around to get the benefit of the steam to my entire face. I&#x27;d call that a fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it cleans very easily and comes apart for easier storage. Still, it takes up a lot of real estate if you have limited room in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;ll probably upgrade to something better and I won&#x27;t be giving up the spa steam treatments.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace my basic steamer that kicked the bucket.  This is so helpful with getting my skin clean and keeping it clear.  Also it helps my sinuses tremendously.  I used to get professional facials for my problem skin, but since using steam at home, I don&#x27;t need to spend that money.  This is one of the best products for at home use if you want clear clean skin.  I use this daily and can&#x27;t do without it.  I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and works well. It&#x27;s gets pretty warm quite quickly and the steam is effective in opening pours as it claims to do!  But make sure you do it on a hard surface, It&#x27;s so light it could easily tip if not</li>
            <li> Got This For My Wife After Looking At Many Different Styles!  I Was A Little Leary About Spending $150 Plus On Some Of The High End Steamers &amp; Am Very Glad I Got This 1 Instead!  Works Great &amp; Best Of All She Loves It!</li>
            <li> This product works well. The larger face mask is a plus and make it a lot easier to use. I received very good service from Amazon and no complaints....I have had this sauna for 2months so far...so good. Heats up quick and does get hot...beware another good purchase</li>
            <li> She particularly liked the wide face interface and this steamer puts out more steam than the older one made by another company.</li>
            <li> It let&#x27;s off an adequate amount of steam; but you have to put your face into the mask.  It&#x27;s very easy to operate and clean; light weight and easy to store. Using it for facials and for my kids when they have a stuffy nose; my son is 6yrs old and he doesn&#x27;t mind using it. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> am super happy that I order this mask :-):-)</li>
            <li> Seriously helps my granddaughters complextion</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;locking&amp;#34; for the mask part arrived already broken, was no more than a thin piece of plastic rim.  The product functions well enough, though as many of the other reviews stated, it is necessary to use a large towel placed over the entire product , face, and neck in order to produce/capture enough steam.  You get what you pay for I suppose and I wish I had spent more money on a better model.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, GOOD FOR JUST STEAMING, A FACIAL AND EVEN A HEAD COLD. I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of ordering a &#x27;wide&#x27; mask facial steamer.  That being said, the amount of steam it produces is not enough for my needs.</li>
            <li> Great product plenty of room so that you don&#x27;t feel closed in while using the steamer.  Produces a lot of steam and works very well.  Has been used daily since it was received for an individual with eyelid oil gland blockage and has worked very well in opening up the glands.  Much easier to use and works better than a hot compress.</li>
            <li> this is just an average facial steamer. Steam was not strong enough. the green Mask was just okay... I feel that it does not stay well in position..</li>
            <li> Does what I wanted.  Opens my pores in a no nonsense manner.  Light weight and easy to store</li>
            <li> It woks as what I expected. The only could be improved is the opening is a little bit too wide.</li>
            <li> The item does what it is supposed to do and it is very easy to use.  I would recommend the item to other shoppers.</li>
            <li> bought these as gifts for girls at a pageant. they loved them. the cup is wide so for big faces like mine, i ont have to rock from side to side to get a good steam. great product. heats up fast too</li>
            <li> Its ok but I wish I would have sent it back! Not worth the money and I think a washcloth works just as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this iitem because in my old age I have developed pores the size of man hole covers.  The only thing that helps is this nifty&lt;br /&gt;little item.  I find it also very relaxing to use.</li>
            <li> This is the second product of this type I bought from Amazon.  First one ordered many great reviews, but didn&#x27;t work as advertised. Amazon permitted the return, and we ordered the BELSON instead.  A tiny bit more expensive, but wow what a difference.  We replacing an old KAZZ steamer, which was now out of production.  We contacted the manufacturer and the BELSON was one the products recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is compact; only 8 inches tall and the base is about 5 inches. It produces a good stream of steam, and the face funnel is soft.  I don&#x27;t have to use a towel to cover my head or use any medicated pads with this product. My goal was simply to help clear my sinuses, and while it DID NOT produce the quantity of the steam of the  old KASS steamer, the BELSON was a happy find for me.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with the steam coming out.</li>
            <li> Performs as advertised but not very strong .</li>
            <li> I order this and in end up returning it because it was too wide for my small face.it might be would work for others!</li>
