            <li>okay.  </li>

            <li>Great price for quality thus far.</li>
            <li>Seller reached out with a nice email for feedback with fun fact included.</li>
            <li>Super pricing!</li>
            <li>Super soft brush head, works great with my clarisonic pro.  </li>
            <li>The brushes came very quickly and appear to work just as the original Clarisonic brushes.</li>
            <li>Very soft and superior to the original.</li>
            <li>They fit my Mia 2 and seem to work just as well as the clarasonic ones.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give a review right now because I will be giving these to my granddaughter when she visits is Jun - if you remind me at that time I will be glad to give a review.</li>
            <li>It fits and works just like the original.</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased and plan on buying replacements here from now on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited about the money I&#x27;ll be saving ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li>Works as well as the original.</li>
            <li>These work just as well as the original brush heads at a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li>Very very soft and nice to use.</li>
            <li>They are so soft, yet effective in cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Went on Amazon and noticed the price difference between the original brush, read the positive reviews, and yes, they really are nice and delivered right to my door.</li>
            <li>Thank you for shipping so quickly</li>
            <li>They feel very soft and fit in my Clarisonic easily.</li>
            <li>I really love this and used the sensitive brush heads for years.</li>
            <li>Soft and smooth like a cloud !</li>
            <li>At this price, very comparable to the original.</li>
            <li>Great but a little too soft compared to the original brush I purchased with the Mia.</li>
            <li>I plan to place another order very soon!</li>
            <li>Thanks for a job well done!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>These brushes are very soft, but still clean my normal/dry skin well.</li>
            <li>I received them far in advance of the original time estimated and were exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;cashmere&amp;#34; brush head is SUPER SOFT!</li>
            <li>Then it&#x27;s pretty much</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine with me, because that&#x27;s actually what I wanted.</li>
            <li>very well, recd.</li>
            <li>The brush portion is much deeper than the picture.</li>
            <li>I bought the cashmere brushes, but it should be stated these are NOT like the Clarisonic Cashmere brushes which have much longer bristles than this.</li>
            <li>The cashmere brush doesn&#x27;t really do much when it comes to getting make-up off, etc.</li>
            <li>The only con, if you want to call it that, is they hold the water and tend to splatter a little more than the original brush heads.  </li>
            <li>(you know very well it doesn&#x27;t cost anywhere near $25-$30 to make a damn brush; and yes, Radiance brushes are $30!).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I paid less for two than the original price for one!  </li>
            <li>so soft and gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li>My only issue is that this is NOT like the Cashmere Luxe brush head - it&#x27;s pretty much identical to the &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34;  head.  </li>
            <li>work great and are soft enough for my delicate and sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>When it was time to order a new brush head of my Mia, I ran across these and took a chance.</li>
            <li>I am currently on actuate and was looking for something very gentle and this does the job.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>These are so soft!  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the brushes fling a lot more water/cleanser in my eyes (compared to my original brush) so you have to be a little more careful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this less expensive substitution.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, I haven&#x27;t had any bristles fall out or anything like that...</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not blaming the product itself, but I was looking for something with a much stiffer brush for facial cleansing.</li>
            <li>These heads are so soft.</li>
            <li>fits on clarisonic aria perfectly--very soft and not scratchy</li>
            <li>not quite as soft as a cashmere should be</li>
            <li>is quite a great deal compared to the expensive brush replacement heads sold by the NAME BRAND company! ;-D</li>
            <li>It may be that I&#x27;m used to a deep pore brush and that&#x27;s why they seem too soft.</li>
            <li>Soft enough to use around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>The Cashmere line has the really long, tapered bristles, and this has the more common short bristles.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a little concerned that they are too soft, otherwise I would give them 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how long it will last, but since you&#x27;re only supposed to use these for 2-3 months I don&#x27;t foresee it being a really big problem (especially for the price).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try their other types next.</li>
            <li> I will definitely re-order when the time is due.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> Definitely will order again when i need to replace my other brush head!!</li>
            <li> Feels like washing your face with a wet bunny rabbit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not a problem though.</li>
            <li> I wet them and then shake any excess water out.</li>
            <li> Even the delicate and sensitive brush heads were not suitable for my skin.</li>
            <li> The brushes are well made, quite comparable to Clarisonic&#x27;s but costing much less.</li>
            <li> At less than half the price of the clarisonic brand</li>
            <li> I am on a tight budget after changing jobs.</li>
            <li> All other brush heads I&#x27;ve had were too stiff and hard even on the lowest</li>
            <li> My brush was past the 3 month replacement period</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on tge clarisonic hrush heads!</li>
            <li> : They come in a small box (no plastic!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much less expensive than the Clarisonic product, but works just as well.  </li>
            <li> No reason to pay the outrageous price for the real clarisonic heads.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of the cost of replacement brushes</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with these brushes !!!</li>

            <li> This is an amazing product! It feels like the softest cotton cleansing my face. I really love this and used the sensitive brush heads for years. I&#x27;ll only use the cashmere brush heads from now on! So smooth and perfect for cleansing gently :)))</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic! Incredibly luxurious and soft! The Clarisonic brand brushes are a total rip off compared to these.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with these brushes !!! I love this cashmere brush because its so soft and feels so nice on the skin!! The costumer service was amazing!! Definitely will order again when i need to replace my other brush head!! And im never going to buy the clarosonic one ever</li>
            <li> different design, same result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the cashmere brush heads. I plan to place another order very soon! Thank you!</li>
            <li> worked well and liked the softness.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful.  Actually better than the Clarisonic and not just the price.  It&#x27;s like using the cashmere clarisonic only in a shorter length.  Terrific.  Everyone Will love this.</li>
            <li> Great Product...works very well with the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; skin cleaner!&lt;br /&gt;Packed very well, recd. as described, swift shipping!&lt;br /&gt;So far, I haven&#x27;t had any bristles fall out or anything like that...the product TURNS SMOOTHLY.&lt;br /&gt;This is quite a great deal compared to the expensive brush replacement heads sold by the NAME BRAND company! ;-D&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;cashmere&amp;#34; brush head is SUPER SOFT! It can be used on my 8 yr. old&#x27;s skin if needed! :-D</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft. I love them. The brush portion is much deeper than the picture. I will order these again.</li>
            <li> Seems like these will be perfect but the cashmere heads are so soft that I think they may be ineffective. Feels like washing your face with a wet bunny rabbit.  I may have to exchange them for maybe the deep pore heads instead. However, they fit perfectly and I&amp;#34;m glad I found them! No reason to pay the outrageous price for the real clarisonic heads.</li>
            <li> I bought the cashmere brushes, but it should be stated these are NOT like the Clarisonic Cashmere brushes which have much longer bristles than this. They are, instead, closest to the newest Clarisonic brush called Radiance (I checked the brush out in Ulta). I thought that might be the case because of the picture of this brush here on Amazon. That&#x27;s fine with me, because that&#x27;s actually what I wanted. These brushes are very soft, but still clean my normal/dry skin well. The brushes are well made, quite comparable to Clarisonic&#x27;s but costing much less. I had no problem getting it installed on my Mia. It fits and works just like the original. I was so tired of the cost of replacement brushes (you know very well it doesn&#x27;t cost anywhere near $25-$30 to make a damn brush; and yes, Radiance brushes are $30!). So far I am very pleased and plan on buying replacements here from now on.</li>
            <li> Great for the price but spray water</li>
            <li> Great product! It works just as well as the clarion is brushes!!</li>
            <li> My brush was past the 3 month replacement period and I wasn&#x27;t sure when I could make it to Ulta. Went on Amazon and noticed the price difference between the original brush, read the positive reviews, and yes, they really are nice and delivered right to my door.</li>
            <li> They fit my Mia 2 and seem to work just as well as the clarasonic ones. I&#x27;m excited about the money I&#x27;ll be saving ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly.  Thank you for shipping so quickly</li>
            <li> These brush heads are amazing!  They are so soft, yet effective in cleaning.  I have very sensitive and delicate skin.  Even the delicate and sensitive brush heads were not suitable for my skin. I saw these and thought I would give it whirl!&lt;br /&gt;They work great and are soft enough for my delicate and sensitive skin!  The only con, if you want to call it that, is they hold the water and tend to splatter a little more than the original brush heads.  It&#x27;s really not a problem though. I wet them and then shake any excess water out. Then it&#x27;s pretty much okay.  As far as the seller, they were as great as the brush heads!  I received them far in advance of the original time estimated and were exactly as described.  The price was amazing!  I paid less for two than the original price for one!  They reached my every expectation!  I would not hesitate to purchase any product from this seller!  Thanks for a job well done!</li>
            <li> Great but a little too soft compared to the original brush I purchased with the Mia.</li>
            <li> Received the brushes and very pleased.  They work well on the Mia 2 and at a much better price point.</li>
            <li> I am super happy with these brush heads. The cashmere type feels luxurious, hence the reason-I imagine, they are called cashmere. I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Softer and longer bristles than I like, but that was my first-time purchase of this product.  It&#x27;s much less expensive than the Clarisonic product, but works just as well.  I&#x27;ll try their other types next.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not blaming the product itself, but I was looking for something with a much stiffer brush for facial cleansing. The cashmere brush doesn&#x27;t really do much when it comes to getting make-up off, etc.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong. At this price, very comparable to the original.</li>
            <li> The brushes came very quickly and appear to work just as the original Clarisonic brushes.</li>
            <li> These heads are so soft. They feel wonderful. If you have sensitive skin, they would be perfect. I&#x27;m a little concerned that they are too soft, otherwise I would give them 5 stars.  It may be that I&#x27;m used to a deep pore brush and that&#x27;s why they seem too soft. I really like them and they fit my Clarisonic perfectly. I&#x27;ll purchase these again. It&#x27;s also really nice to get a thank you email from the company that makes them. Very nice.</li>
            <li> fits on clarisonic aria perfectly--very soft and not scratchy</li>
            <li> These are great! They fit my Mia1 perfectly and they are so soft.  Soft enough to use around my eyes.  I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing these again.</li>
            <li> They feel very soft and fit in my Clarisonic easily. They&#x27;re also a great price compared to buying the brushes from a store. My only complaint is that the brushes fling a lot more water/cleanser in my eyes (compared to my original brush) so you have to be a little more careful.</li>
            <li> not quite as soft as a cashmere should be</li>
            <li> Very very soft and nice to use. I will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> This product works great on my Clairsonic unit.  I&#x27;m very happy with this less expensive substitution.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and works well with my Clarisonic Plus.  Super pricing!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give a review right now because I will be giving these to my granddaughter when she visits is Jun - if you remind me at that time I will be glad to give a review.</li>
            <li> Great product and great value. Seller reached out with a nice email for feedback with fun fact included.</li>
            <li> Super soft brush head, works great with my clarisonic pro.  At less than half the price of the clarisonic brand it&#x27;s a good buy for sure.  My only issue is that this is NOT like the Cashmere Luxe brush head - it&#x27;s pretty much identical to the &amp;#34;delicate&amp;#34;  head.  The Cashmere line has the really long, tapered bristles, and this has the more common short bristles.  Still an awesome brush head at a great price.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Great fit with my Clarisonic Mia 2.</li>
            <li> Soft and smooth like a cloud !</li>
            <li> These are perfect.  Why pay an over-inflated price when these are perfect for my Mia 2.  I will definitely re-order when the time is due.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  Works as well as the original. Save your money and buy these!</li>
            <li> My kid says it works great</li>
            <li> I am on a tight budget after changing jobs. When it was time to order a new brush head of my Mia, I ran across these and took a chance. They work amazing. I will be purchasing them again. Bonus: They come in a small box (no plastic!) so the extra store away great!</li>
            <li> WOW! great quality and so soft! i got the cashmere one and its amazing! so soft and gentle on the skin.  I am currently on actuate and was looking for something very gentle and this does the job.  All other brush heads I&#x27;ve had were too stiff and hard even on the lowest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is perfect! will buy again! save yourself some money!!</li>
            <li> Worked great with my Mia.  Love the Price and I will be buying them again.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles and works perfectly with my MIA. Great price for quality thus far. Not sure how long it will last, but since you&#x27;re only supposed to use these for 2-3 months I don&#x27;t foresee it being a really big problem (especially for the price).</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on tge clarisonic hrush heads! I just used these and they are the SAME as the name brand. I will only be purchasing these from now on. Same quality, fits perfectly, and you cant beat the price.</li>
            <li> Very soft and superior to the original.</li>
            <li> These are so soft!  It&#x27;s like washing your face with bunny fur...</li>
            <li> These work just as well as the original brush heads at a fraction of the cost</li>
