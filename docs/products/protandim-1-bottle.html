    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Incredible deal!</li>
            <li>This stuff is wonderful !  </li>
            <li>You have a very good chance of obtaining the contaminated Protandim here or anywhere else.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Miracles are happeninmg, and they can happen for you too.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has a great price.</li>
            <li>Great product-great price</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  good</li>
            <li>a nice day.</li>
            <li>Just happened to go to Dr &amp; they had to do some normal tests &amp; they reported everything looked great!</li>
            <li>Too good to be true??  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Too costly, there are much better things to spend money on.</li>
            <li>I will not be buying any more.</li>
            <li>The disorganized daisy chain of primary Mormon church distributors never recalled the product.</li>
            <li>Fantastic</li>
            <li>Now I can sleep 12 hours with no proble, deep sleep and great dreams,&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never tried a supplement as powerful as this one .....</li>
            <li>If you can afford these babies, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Change requires letting go of the old (toxins, free radicals, negative energy patterns, inadequate belief systems, etc.), and this product has a good balance between helping provide energy and leaving your body cleaner, and more alert, in the process.  </li>
            <li>I have added this to my daily intake, and I do believe it is giving me more energy throughout my day..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that if I take one capsule a day, for three days, then skip a day, it serves me better than a daily intake.  </li>
            <li>but buy it safely and securely from Distributor for less at Nrf2life.rocks .</li>
            <li>I am hoping that the blood work will show a  positive change.</li>
            <li>It really works</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice anything.</li>
            <li>This is a product that, for me, for my physiology, provides a gentle boost and a sense of well-being.  </li>
            <li>My work is intense as I help people restore their health through bodywork.</li>
            <li>The product price is jacked up way too high.</li>
            <li>This product is normally retails for $60 a bottle.</li>
            <li>I noticed when going up the stairs I was able to run up the stairs, rather than step slowly as is my usual way.</li>
            <li>I understand that the only way to tell a difference is to have blood work done and look for a change in certain levels in your blood tests.</li>
            <li>but really couldn&#x27;t afford to buy them on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>but it does help a whole lot for people with multiple severe illnesses</li>
            <li>I do not care about negative comments others may have about the product since it is their own fault that they have not used the product long enough to know what it is capable of or they are just not observant enough.  </li>
            <li>My friend told me about this product and 14 days later I feel new again</li>
            <li>I have not heard my knees snapping loudly anymore and the pain in my left knee has not returned.  </li>
            <li>Milk Thistles is a weak never toxin, most flowers are toxic and long term exposure will make you even more stupid and lose fine motor skills function.&lt;br /&gt;Blog</li>
            <li>Since using Protandum my nails are now white instead of being oily and transparent like they were a month and a half ago, some old scars have been reduced, my sleep is much better,my right finger which was collagen deficient has plumped up,  my blood pressure is normal and so is my diabetes with zero dizzy spells.  </li>
            <li>Item arrived today finally, it&#x27;s all that I expected, nothing I disliked about the product delivery could have been made a little sooner, with more instructions for use such as any lab work should have been done.</li>

You have a very good chance of obtaining the contaminated Protandim here or anywhere else.

            <li> Incredible deal! Would buy from Seller again.</li>
            <li> i feel energized after 2 weeks of using this product......i feel less tired....I have never tried a supplement as powerful as this one .....It really works</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful !  As I have been aging my joints are getting sore.  My friend told me about this product and 14 days later I feel new again</li>
            <li> I have added this to my daily intake, and I do believe it is giving me more energy throughout my day..</li>
            <li> Protandim is *Fantastic* but buy it safely and securely from Distributor for less at Nrf2life.rocks . Helping your body help itself while obtaining financial freedom</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell any difference from using this product for a month. Im not sure though what I was supposed to be feeling but there was no increase in energy or well being etc..</li>
            <li> Excelente producto !!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to order these as I&#x27;ve used them before years ago but really couldn&#x27;t afford to buy them on a regular basis. It takes about a month to see results but you will see it with increased energy. I noticed when going up the stairs I was able to run up the stairs, rather than step slowly as is my usual way. If you can afford these babies, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.  I love this product.  Had heavy cramps from fibroid and now I don&#x27;t after taking this product for 6 months.  Lowered my blood pressure as well.  Took my bp before I started taking protandim then 2 weeks after and lower bp.  Doc was going to take me off of bp medicine but I was hesitant.  Too good to be true??  See for youself.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed anything different</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve felt any benefit in any way. Too costly, there are much better things to spend money on.</li>
            <li> Came as promised and I keep re-ordering, and I think I will continue to keep re-ordering.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Husband takes and loves this.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice anything. Smells and tastes like dog food. Just happened to go to Dr &amp; they had to do some normal tests &amp; they reported everything looked great!</li>
            <li> Item arrived today finally, it&#x27;s all that I expected, nothing I disliked about the product delivery could have been made a little sooner, with more instructions for use such as any lab work should have been done.</li>
            <li> I have seen some bad reviews about Protandum from people that have never used the product or those that never took the time to use the product long enough to evaluate and record their findings.  I am not a distributor of Protandum just a user of it.  Since using Protandum my nails are now white instead of being oily and transparent like they were a month and a half ago, some old scars have been reduced, my sleep is much better,my right finger which was collagen deficient has plumped up,  my blood pressure is normal and so is my diabetes with zero dizzy spells.  I have not heard my knees snapping loudly anymore and the pain in my left knee has not returned.  I do not care about negative comments others may have about the product since it is their own fault that they have not used the product long enough to know what it is capable of or they are just not observant enough.  Those that are saying negative things about Protandum have not been sick enough to use and recover with it when nothing else helps a bunch of illnesses all at the same time.  I do agree that the product is a bit pricey but it does help a whole lot for people with multiple severe illnesses and I hope that there will be a way for this product to be sold a bit cheaper because I see a lot of potential in it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way too expensive now and i can&#x27;t afford to buy it through amazon anymore. am hugely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Feel pain in my joint.  Is not for me.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working that&#x27;s why I have reordered</li>
            <li> The product price is jacked up way too high.</li>
            <li> In just 30 days of the product, my Insomnia went away. Now I can sleep 12 hours with no proble, deep sleep and great dreams,&lt;br /&gt;My friends and Colleages think I am 20 years younger,&lt;br /&gt;I can run 30 miles a day, have so much energy not sure what to do with it all.&lt;br /&gt;Miracles are happeninmg, and they can happen for you too.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has a great price. This product is normally retails for $60 a bottle. if you can get it cheaper. Get it.&lt;br /&gt;Get off all your other Big Pharma crap. This will be your saving grace.</li>
            <li> The years pass and we all find our way through life.  This is a product that, for me, for my physiology, provides a gentle boost and a sense of well-being.  My work is intense as I help people restore their health through bodywork. I need the energy to hold a space for growth and change.  Change requires letting go of the old (toxins, free radicals, negative energy patterns, inadequate belief systems, etc.), and this product has a good balance between helping provide energy and leaving your body cleaner, and more alert, in the process.  I&#x27;ve found that if I take one capsule a day, for three days, then skip a day, it serves me better than a daily intake.  Try it.&lt;br /&gt;Bruce</li>
            <li> Have not felt any change in how I feel. I understand that the only way to tell a difference is to have blood work done and look for a change in certain levels in your blood tests. Will see shortly. I am hoping that the blood work will show a  positive change.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who has chronic fatigue and it has not helped. I will not be buying any more.</li>
            <li> It seem to be helping to stay regular. It also helps with sleeping. It&#x27;s  good product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for asking my comment .</li>
            <li> my husband knew he wanted these he used them before, they stop his leg cramps</li>
            <li> My Doctor told me I would need a hip and knee replacement 3 years ago.  Enter Protandim,  I&#x27;ve not been back for a hip or knee surgery ,  No more pain.</li>
            <li> Great product-great price</li>
