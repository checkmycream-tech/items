    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want the fancy electric one, so this is perfect for us!</li>
            <li>When turning the device it will sometime pull vs cut the nose hairs and the cap that was provided does not stay on the cutter will keep for backup grooming but will say honestly recommend staying with battery power.</li>
            <li>Kind of cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Lost the one I had for years; so glad it&#x27;s still being made.  </li>
            <li>Most nose trimmers are a pain and don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>device could easily take the place of water-boarding at Guantanamo Bay.</li>
            <li>This always works and is easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>To be honest I haven&#x27;t found it much use .</li>
            <li>The company is quick to deliver and returning was quick and easy so</li>
            <li>Small and does a great job.</li>
            <li>Ok for the price, sometimes pulls on the nose hairs, but not a big deal</li>
            <li>Probably smaller and more practical than the battery ones.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li>Openings around blades are too large.</li>
            <li>The steel versions of this are a little more $, but really work well and are worth the price.</li>
            <li>Absolutely cannot get this thing to trim any hair whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Manual only takes a few seconds more, and seems so much safer than battery-operated (not to mention lighter weight and more convenient).</li>
            <li>I usually keep my nose hairs cut pretty sure</li>
            <li>but I will suggest you buy one of the more expensive nose clippers, perhaps they work better.</li>
            <li>It cuts the hair ok but it is hard to use for ear hair because you can see much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never broken one of these; I&#x27;ve only lost them, so durability isn&#x27;t really a factor.</li>
            <li>Because of that, it became very time consuming compared to the 10 sec.</li>
            <li>it works OK for a manual device, but you have to be careful or you will snag and pull hairs instead of cutting them cleanly.</li>
            <li>so maybe it&#x27;s only good for people who leave it until it&#x27;s pretty long and unpleasant!</li>
            <li>very simple tool..works good, so can&#x27;t say anything bad about it</li>

            <li> One at a time is a lot less painful than a whole gob of them.</li>
            <li> this thing sucks.</li>
            <li> Also, it starting pulling some of the hairs it didn&#x27;t cut, which was a bit painful.</li>
            <li> The outer blade is plastic, so instead of cutting the hair it pinches it between the 2 blades.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>

            <li> this thing sucks. It doesn&#x27;t trim. It pulls hairs.</li>
            <li> Absolutely cannot get this thing to trim any hair whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Ok for the price, sometimes pulls on the nose hairs, but not a big deal</li>
            <li> The outer blade is plastic, so instead of cutting the hair it pinches it between the 2 blades.&lt;br /&gt;Now you have to pull the cutter out and it plucks your nose / ear hair. Ouch just use a tweezers. One at a time is a lot less painful than a whole gob of them.</li>
            <li> very simple tool..works good, so can&#x27;t say anything bad about it</li>
            <li> To be honest I haven&#x27;t found it much use . I usually keep my nose hairs cut pretty sure so maybe it&#x27;s only good for people who leave it until it&#x27;s pretty long and unpleasant!</li>
            <li> Seems to work but does snag sometimes. Minor pain.</li>
            <li> It works, enough said.</li>
            <li> it works OK for a manual device, but you have to be careful or you will snag and pull hairs instead of cutting them cleanly.</li>
            <li> After reading the instruction I gave it a shot and found that this trimmer cuts some hairs but leave others. Because of that, it became very time consuming compared to the 10 sec. electronic nose clippers I am use to. Also, it starting pulling some of the hairs it didn&#x27;t cut, which was a bit painful. I stopped using it after the second tug, not worth it.  The company is quick to deliver and returning was quick and easy so for that I can give this a two star but I will suggest you buy one of the more expensive nose clippers, perhaps they work better.</li>
            <li> Small and does a great job. Probably smaller and more practical than the battery ones.</li>
            <li> Some nose hairs are cut while others are yanked out by the roots.&lt;br /&gt;This device could easily take the place of water-boarding at Guantanamo Bay.</li>
            <li> Not what I was hoping for. Kind of cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Lost the one I had for years; so glad it&#x27;s still being made.  Manual only takes a few seconds more, and seems so much safer than battery-operated (not to mention lighter weight and more convenient).</li>
            <li> Most nose trimmers are a pain and don&#x27;t work. This always works and is easy to travel with. I am going to order anotehr one.</li>
            <li> After ordering and using a few times will say i prefer using a battery operated version.When turning the device it will sometime pull vs cut the nose hairs and the cap that was provided does not stay on the cutter will keep for backup grooming but will say honestly recommend staying with battery power.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should have bought the more expensive version.  Or not at all. The problem is that, of the six &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; on the outside ring of projections, that the hair goes in between, only three have actual cutting blades. There are six steel teeth on the inside ring.  If the hair happens to be pulled toward one of the other plastic teeth when you twist the end, it will just get pulled. Ouch. Then you have to try again.</li>
            <li> We misplaced our previous trimmer in our move, so I ordered this one. It is exactly what it is supposed to be. I didn&#x27;t want the fancy electric one, so this is perfect for us!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever used one of these kinds of hair trimmers before, you know not to move it around while you&#x27;re twisting. It&#x27;ll pull your hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Long as you act accordingly, this trimmer seems to work as expected. I&#x27;ve never broken one of these; I&#x27;ve only lost them, so durability isn&#x27;t really a factor. All in all, if you don&#x27;t have one and don&#x27;t want another thing to plug in or recharge, just get one of these.</li>
            <li> It cuts the hair ok but it is hard to use for ear hair because you can see much.</li>
            <li> Openings around blades are too large. Can cut yourself. The steel versions of this are a little more $, but really work well and are worth the price.</li>
