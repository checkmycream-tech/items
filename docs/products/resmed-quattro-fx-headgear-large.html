            <li>Perfect for my needs!</li>
            <li>Quality was great.</li>
            <li>works great</li>
            <li>Good Value.</li>
            <li>Well this combo was offered with a hose and this headgear along with the mask for what seemed to be a good deal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Forgot how nice a good headgear feels&lt;</li>
            <li>The best fit and most comfort I have found.</li>
            <li>I am paying for my own CPAP supplies.</li>
            <li>It seems like if it were the correct size it would be exceptional comfortable.</li>
            <li>But now that I have the large size its great.</li>
            <li>edit: we were able to use 3 scuba mask straps to make a sturdier one so we&#x27;re not using the one that we just bought a month or so ago.  </li>
            <li>Head gear is ok to start , but wears out and looses its stretch within 6 mo.</li>
            <li>This gear is more comfortable than the full face mask gear.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was quick!</li>
            <li>ResMed Quattro Headgear has a good fit, brand new, just as described</li>
            <li>The velcro-type strap adjusments have held just as well, and are just as comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Well I can&#x27;t even buy a xl size hat at a store because my head doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>it seems mighty pricey for a lightweight strap.</li>
            <li>This just has a cheap feel to it.</li>
            <li>The material as lighter, and thinner (in width and thickness) than my original.  </li>
            <li>This was an original item not a knock off and works well, I would recommend to others .</li>
            <li>If you need a full face mask, you are stuck with it.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t fit over a large head</li>
            <li>it is nice to know I have a back up one of these.</li>

            <li>This was exactly what I needed without the hassle.</li>
            <li>Fits better than the universal one!</li>
            <li>FITS OK, MAYBE I JUST HAVE A BIG HEAD</li>

            <li>The head gear I ordered in a large</li>
            <li>When you purchase a medium mask and headgear set you don&#x27;t have the option of getting a large headgear unless you purchase it separately.</li>
            <li>Resmed is oblivious to the fact that people who need a large mask need a large strap and ship it with a medium-</li>
            <li>However, that is really an issue with ResMed concerning the way they package and sell their product, as opposed to affecting the quality of the product itself.  </li>
            <li>Wears out somewhat fast.</li>

            <li>Not there fault as I&#x27;m sure thats all an automated deal...but just BE CAREFUL of what your buying.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>Seems like most other headgear that are used on ResMed masks</li>
            <li>The dog chewed up the cpap, and I really, really didn&#x27;t want to have to do another sleep test just to get a new prescription.</li>
            <li>Initially, I was concerned this headgear would not hold up as well, or be as comfortable, but so far it has performed as a 100% replacement.  </li>
            <li>Well read carefully its for the FX model....not the original mirage quattro.</li>

            <li>I mean for the money one would think you&#x27;d get better quality stuff.</li>
            <li>Small straps, seems cheap.</li>
            <li>My only gripe would be that it does NOT come with new plastic clips.  </li>

            <li> It was a large, even though I usually use a medium.</li>
            <li> The velcro, or what little was on this thing is no where near what the factory replacements have...</li>
            <li> So cost is about $2.57/month for as long as you use a mask.</li>
            <li> Not worth shipping back for return.  </li>
            <li> Headgear was not a large size when received.</li>
            <li> this product is crap, it is to thin of a material and nothing like the original that i a purchased from original sources.  </li>
            <li> I can say that after using it for several weeks now, it works as well, if not better than the thicker headgear.  </li>
            <li> typical headgear not much that I can add to that.  </li>
            <li> not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Walmart and Target would have taken the product back and refunded the money or at least given me a store credit.  </li>
            <li> For a few seconds, I thought maybe import knock-off.  </li>
            <li> Tired of paying for the markup at the &amp;#34;convenient&amp;#34; local med stores ?</li>
            <li> Was a little small but worked</li>
            <li> Could not use as it was too small.</li>
            <li> I could not use it because it was too small.</li>
            <li> I know what you&#x27;re thinking, The idiot just didn&#x27;t buy the right size.</li>
            <li> waited too late couldn&#x27;t return.</li>
            <li> poor fit, horrible elastic!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product was too small for my head.</li>
            <li> there is no difference betweeen this one and the real expensive ones i purchased at the medical supply store in town, i have told everyone to come here....</li>
            <li> These guys said, too bad, sucks being you.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong size mask, so I got the wrong size gear.  </li>
            <li> Too expensive.</li>
            <li> The velcro design is bad.  </li>
            <li> Over all poor product!!!</li>
            <li> Very bad design, over priced and bad longevity - appart from that</li>

            <li> The material as lighter, and thinner (in width and thickness) than my original.  For a few seconds, I thought maybe import knock-off.  But, it was bagged and tagged as ResMed, and looked legit in that respect.  Upon opening the bag, this one was definitely a lighter weight version than what I was replacing.  However, the quality still appeared to be there otherwise.  I can say that after using it for several weeks now, it works as well, if not better than the thicker headgear.  The velcro-type strap adjusments have held just as well, and are just as comfortable.  Initially, I was concerned this headgear would not hold up as well, or be as comfortable, but so far it has performed as a 100% replacement.  My only gripe would be that it does NOT come with new plastic clips.  I was aware of this before ordering, so I did not lower my rating for that, although I was tempted to give it a four.  However, that is really an issue with ResMed concerning the way they package and sell their product, as opposed to affecting the quality of the product itself.  So, in that respect, I give this headgear five stars.</li>
            <li> Bought 2013Sept05.  Elastic stopped about mid 2014Nov.  So cost is about $2.57/month for as long as you use a mask. Hope the price doesn&#x27;t go up. $30.88 when I ordered it.    edit: we were able to use 3 scuba mask straps to make a sturdier one so we&#x27;re not using the one that we just bought a month or so ago.  Keeping it as backup. DIY</li>
            <li> I know I have a large head so when I went to go buy this it was thinking it would work... Well it was to big. I think a medium size would have worked for me. I know what you&#x27;re thinking, The idiot just didn&#x27;t buy the right size. Well I can&#x27;t even buy a xl size hat at a store because my head doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> Wears out somewhat fast.</li>
            <li> Saved a bunch.  You can&#x27;t ever get just the headgear through your local shop.  I am paying for my own CPAP supplies.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong size mask, so I got the wrong size gear.  This gear is more comfortable than the full face mask gear.  It seems like if it were the correct size it would be exceptional comfortable.</li>
            <li> My old headgear was 4 years old and had lost its stretch&lt;br /&gt;Forgot how nice a good headgear feels&lt;br /&gt;It also stays in the mask guides&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let your headgear get that bad.&lt;br /&gt;Now my mask is more comfortable and have less leaks</li>
            <li> The dog chewed up the cpap, and I really, really didn&#x27;t want to have to do another sleep test just to get a new prescription. This was exactly what I needed without the hassle.</li>
            <li> this product is crap, it is to thin of a material and nothing like the original that i a purchased from original sources.  not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Fits better than the universal one!</li>
            <li> Small straps, seems cheap. I had to have it, fits the only mask I&#x27;m comfortable with.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was the FX model.  Not worth shipping back for return.  Buyer beware and don&#x27;t make foolish mistakes like I did.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my needs!</li>
            <li> The best fit and most comfort I have found.</li>
            <li> Was a little small but worked</li>
            <li> Too expensive. I could have my old headgear. I thought this headgear was designed especially for the fx mask. They&#x27;re all the same.</li>
            <li> Quality was great. Shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> This was an original item not a knock off and works well, I would recommend to others . Good Value.</li>
            <li> I got this to have a backup on hand. I may not need it however, in the middle of the night and my current headgear breaks it is nice to know I have a back up one of these. Plan ahead and hope you never need to use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something you should &amp;#34; in stock at home&amp;#34;  have if you have a resmed CPAP device . If one brakes it you will always have another</li>
            <li> FITS OK, MAYBE I JUST HAVE A BIG HEAD</li>
            <li> ResMed Quattro Headgear has a good fit, brand new, just as described</li>
            <li> is what it is.  If you need a full face mask, you are stuck with it.</li>
            <li> Headgear- The head gear I ordered in a large and although it is very adjustable I feel it is too big for my head.  The cpap mask I ordered came with a medium headgear so it works out.  At first the Velcro pieces looks like they would not stick to the headgear but to my surprise are very sticky.  The headgear does its job and does not move around on my head while I am sleeping.  The Velcro strips do not come undone or lose.  The headgear arrived to my house in two days and came in a big envelope from usps undamaged.</li>
            <li> typical headgear not much that I can add to that.  Seems like most other headgear that are used on ResMed masks</li>
            <li> Tired of paying for the markup at the &amp;#34;convenient&amp;#34; local med stores ? I was. This is exactly as described. works great</li>
            <li> large is not large!!!  waited too late couldn&#x27;t return.</li>
            <li> First off I&#x27;d say to pay close attention to the way amazon does things. I ordered a mask...the resmed mirage quattro. Well under it amazon kinda posted the....those who bought this....also bought this deal.Well this combo was offered with a hose and this headgear along with the mask for what seemed to be a good deal. Well read carefully its for the FX model....not the original mirage quattro. Not there fault as I&#x27;m sure thats all an automated deal...but just BE CAREFUL of what your buying.&lt;br /&gt;  The product itself its just alright. To me....being new to all this....it seems mighty pricey for a lightweight strap. I mean for the money one would think you&#x27;d get better quality stuff. This just has a cheap feel to it. Then again...I guess it would do.</li>
            <li> Very bad design, over priced and bad longevity - appart from that, it&#x27;s your only option so deal with it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product online. It was a large, even though I usually use a medium. Unfortunately, this product was too small for my head. When I asked why, they could not provide an explaination.  Their return policy states that you can return the item if the product is unopened. Of course I have to open it to try it on. (It&#x27;s like Amazon saying if you open the box we will not return it) So they refused to take it back. Walmart and Target would have taken the product back and refunded the money or at least given me a store credit.  These guys said, too bad, sucks being you.  Well, I hope everyone learns from my experience and does not do business with this company</li>
            <li> This is my second headgear purchase in 13 months.  The velcro design is bad.  It wears out and the gear becomes unattached during use while you are sleeping.  This compromises the seal of your mask letting air in.</li>
            <li> Head gear is ok to start , but wears out and looses its stretch within 6 mo.</li>
            <li> When you purchase a medium mask and headgear set you don&#x27;t have the option of getting a large headgear unless you purchase it separately. ResMed needs to re-think that one.  But now that I have the large size its great.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! As described!</li>
            <li> Headgear was not a large size when received. Could not use as it was too small.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34; is considerably smaller that the Medium that I had.  I had the same problem with a &amp;#34;Standard&amp;#34; that I have purchased.  I could not use it because it was too small.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t fit over a large head</li>
            <li> This can&#x27;t be a factory replacement!!! The velcro, or what little was on this thing is no where near what the factory replacements have... poor fit, horrible elastic!! Over all poor product!!!</li>
            <li> there is no difference betweeen this one and the real expensive ones i purchased at the medical supply store in town, i have told everyone to come here.... however, if you are ordering a mask too, wait until you get your mask before you orderthis part... chances are it will be included even though it says it will not be included!!</li>
            <li> Resmed is oblivious to the fact that people who need a large mask need a large strap and ship it with a medium- they should wake up and listen to the people who use their products</li>
