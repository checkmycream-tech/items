            <li>ballast delivered as promised, good as brand new!!!!!</li>
            <li>I bought it because of the good light it put off.</li>
            <li>Most of the tension in the neck was lost so I was constantly catching it from falling over.</li>
            <li>More and more mirrors are moving to warm lighting and LED bulbs, I prefer this kind.</li>

            <li>Add that to the fact that the first one I received didn&#x27;t work at all and had to be returned/replaced, and I&#x27;m not at all happy with this</li>
            <li>Will you be lucky and get a good one?</li>
            <li>(There are none better.)</li>
            <li>I love the lighting but my bulb burned out in about 9 months.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t love it more.</li>
            <li>The only reason for 4 and not 5 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t stay perfectly in position.</li>
            <li>told them i love this mirror</li>
            <li>she forgot it at my house after visiting for Christmas 2012 and said I could keep it :)&lt;</li>
            <li>and I figured I could get something a lot better with that</li>
            <li>If anybody has tried another brand of T5 bulb with this mirror PLEASE comment and tell me about it :)&lt;</li>
            <li>It works perfect if you&#x27;re using it correctly and understand it&#x27;s physical limits.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Love it~</li>
            <li>Only positive for this mirror was that the \\&quot;sunlight\\&quot; was very good and bright.  </li>
            <li>it dims and is a great natural daylight.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased as it does exactly as it was described.</li>
            <li>It is very bright, but not glaring and the mirror is clear and powerful.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to see.....</li>
            <li>The BEST mirror I have ever owned and I am old enough to have owned many!</li>
            <li>The lighting was good and the mirror surfaces were of high quality, so I kept the mirror.</li>
            <li>Yesterday, the plastic light cover broke yet again</li>
            <li>While I agree with all the reviews, i  bought the light bulb anyway, and that wasnt it.</li>
            <li>My husband is an electrician and there was no power to the bulb ( I could have asked him from the beginning but tried to do it myself lol ) upon further inspection  </li>
            <li>For those of you who complain the 10x distorts - magnifying mirrors are concave, parabolic - they work off 45 degree light angles</li>

            <li>But I truly love this mirror and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Fantastic, natural lighting is very important to me.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, natural lighting is very important to me.</li>
            <li>she took it with her when she traveled too and lucky me -</li>
            <li>Stay tuned it will take a week to get it, cost $15.00 but a heck of a lot better than buying a new one.</li>
            <li>actually you see more than you may want to!  </li>
            <li>The light is FAR brighter than any of the MANY other makeup mirrors we own.  </li>
            <li>Great mirror for you fanatics who need to see every little flaw!</li>
            <li>The big 10x mirror is great for the close up work, plucking, popping etc and the 1x for your regular mirror work.</li>
            <li>The big 10x mirror is great for the close up work, plucking, popping etc and the 1x for your regular mirror work.</li>
            <li>Same as many of the reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure not going to buy another and have it do the same thing!</li>
            <li>When I called customer service they told me not to expect it to last more than a year.  </li>
            <li>Interested if another brand would work?</li>
            <li>I love almost everything about this mirror but its not built to last.</li>
            <li>many of the reviews, the light stoped functioning within a few months.</li>
            <li>She has been using it for 40 years without any problem and has never needed to change the fluorescent light bulb either.&lt;br /&gt;Judging from all the negative reviews and my own experience:  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t last six months before the plastic light cover feel off.  </li>
            <li>I took the switch apart and found a piece of the dimmer mechanism has sheared off and was shorting the whole lamp.</li>
            <li>Very Pricey..</li>
            <li>Last month, the light switch began malfunctioning, as others have reported.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than in stores...</li>
            <li>So this mirror had not been used much at all.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Lucky me, my original bulb has been going strong with moderate to heavy use for 6 years, knock on wood.</li>
            <li>Sent the mirror back today HOPEFULLY for a full refund since I feel that it&#x27;s a manufacturer defect.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased to have my mirror standing upright again, hopefully it&#x27;ll be a little while</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased to have my mirror standing upright again, hopefully it&#x27;ll be a little while</li>
            <li>what they don&#x27;t tell you is that every time you use it, it loosens the large screw that holds the mirror and light portion upright -- If I had a dollar for every time that portion has fallen down onto my forehead while I was putting on my makeup, it would&#x27;ve paid for itself 5 times over.  </li>
            <li>None of the normal distortion.  </li>
            <li>I love the lighting however the dimmer broke after a few months of use.</li>
            <li>not hard to replace, I could of done it.</li>
            <li>acted as a band aid until yesterday; my husband bought me a new mirror for my birthday.</li>
            <li>The tension that rotates the mirror was completely gone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a keeper.art that make it look seamless and inaccessible but</li>
            <li>There are smooth round covers over the hinge part that make it look seamless and inaccessible but a slim flat head or something similar will help to pop them right off.</li>
            <li>and as I hadn&#x27;t yet used my super duper duct tape to hold the mirror in place, it slammed down on my nose this morning breaking the skin between my eyes.  </li>
            <li>a slim flat head or something similar will help to pop them right off.</li>
            <li>This actually is the second of these mirrors that we have purchased (the first was for my wife, and now my daughter also has one).  </li>
            <li>Fantastic service for something that was well past</li>
            <li>Well, less than 2 weeks later, it arrived back at my front door, light switch fixed at no cost.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s had a few annoyances but quick fixes and learning to deal with it</li>
            <li>The plastic covering over the bulb just snaps in and it would not take much for it to come loose and the bulb falls forward.  </li>
            <li>A second purchase of the same product obviously is high praise.</li>
            <li>I snapped it back in place and a month later the light would turn on when in the closed position and turn off when opened (an obvious electrical short).  </li>
            <li>(which, may I add that I found and fixed this issue after husband attempted and said it wasn&#x27;t possible)</li>
            <li>When I decided to spend $100 on a make up mirror, the last thing I expected was to have to keep a screw driver at the ready.</li>
            <li>Since the item is over a year old they are not interested in discussing possible alternative problems that could cause it not to work with new bulbs.</li>
            <li>Yes, the hinges on this sucker got lose and for a long, long time I just lived with it because it didn&#x27;t seem like they were accessible to tighten but guess what I found out yesterday?!</li>
            <li>I am very disappointed, this mirror, when it worked was awesome.  </li>

            <li> I recently purchased this item 6 months ago and already it&#x27;s broken. The knob isn&#x27;t tuning properly pretty sad.</li>
            <li> The light is FAR brighter than any of the MANY other makeup mirrors we own.  The mirrors themselves (1x &amp; 10x magnification) are absolutely FLAWLESS--None of the normal distortion.  The stand is beautifully finished and it&#x27;s position adjustments work perfectly.  BUY THIS LIGHTED MIRROR (There are none better.)</li>
            <li> Same as many of the reviews. I love the lighting but my bulb burned out in about 9 months. I purchased a replacement bulb which cost over $20 with shipping. It still does not work, so I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s not the bulb, but the lamp itself. I even took the mirror a part to try to fix it, but I have no idea what&#x27;s wrong with it. VERY disappointing to spend this much money on a piece and have it die in less than a year. And they got an extra $20 out of me because the replacement bulb is a specialty one and you can only buy it from the maker of the mirror. Wish I knew what to buy now.... I&#x27;m sure not going to buy another and have it do the same thing!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these 8 months ago. When it arrived, it was difficult to adjust because the hinge on which the mirror tilted was loose. There was no obvious way to tighten or lock the hinge. The lighting was good and the mirror surfaces were of high quality, so I kept the mirror. Today the dimmer switch broke rendering the whole object useless. The price is not justified by the quality of the construction so I cannot reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> Sad to say I must agree with the other ratings.  I have had this $135 mirror for approximately a year.  Last month the bulb \\&quot;blew\\&quot; and I ordered a replacement.  That did not fix the problem, so I ordered another bulb.  Customer service is horrible.  Since the item is over a year old they are not interested in discussing possible alternative problems that could cause it not to work with new bulbs. I have not tested the mirror or bulbs yet to see if I can figure it out.  I am very disappointed, this mirror, when it worked was awesome.  When I took it apart to replace the bulb I can see where the other raters had problems.  The plastic covering over the bulb just snaps in and it would not take much for it to come loose and the bulb falls forward.  The mirror portion has very small \\&quot;ears\\&quot; that fit into the plastic and with small movements would fall out.  It would not take much for the manufacturer to have a wonderful product.  But for now, it is a gamble to purchase one.  Will you be lucky and get a good one?</li>
            <li> Great mirror for you fanatics who need to see every little flaw! The BEST mirror I have ever owned and I am old enough to have owned many!</li>
            <li> Please, please, please read this review and heed our warnings.  I wish I would have and now it&#x27;s too late. I purchased this mirror in late 2009.  I absolutely loved the design and the ability to close it.  It didn&#x27;t last six months before the plastic light cover feel off.  I snapped it back in place and a month later the light would turn on when in the closed position and turn off when opened (an obvious electrical short).  I then spent $25 in postage to return it to the manufacturer for repair.  Because I had sent it past the one year mark (I got busy with life and failed to ship it right away) Zadro refused to repair it under warranty.  I then reminded of a few things:  (1) I paid $139 for this mirror and now another $25 in shipping to have it repaired (for this price it should last a lifetime and certainly longer than 6 months) and (2) I have yet to write my review on Amazon.  The mirror was repaired under warranty after I sent a check for $10 for the return shipping.  Total spent to date $175. Yesterday, the plastic light cover broke yet again (my guess is the plastic cannot withstand the heat from the bulb).  The mirror is held into place by this plastic cover and as I hadn&#x27;t yet used my super duper duct tape to hold the mirror in place, it slammed down on my nose this morning breaking the skin between my eyes.  Do not buy this overpriced, junk yard mirror.  Does anyone have a bandade?</li>
            <li> Came as stated great product</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. She says that it is the best make-up lamp she has ever used. It is very bright, but not glaring and the mirror is clear and powerful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a ballast problem.  It&#x27;s a switch problem.  I took the switch apart and found a piece of the dimmer mechanism has sheared off and was shorting the whole lamp. Gonna try to find a switch.</li>
            <li> Purchased this mirror on 17Jun11.  On 21Jul11, the metal hinge broke and then the stand broke away from the base.  Sent the mirror back today HOPEFULLY for a full refund since I feel that it&#x27;s a manufacturer defect.  Only positive for this mirror was that the \\&quot;sunlight\\&quot; was very good and bright.  Will not purchase this model again.</li>
            <li> Very Pricey..But;  needed the product!</li>
            <li> only worked for a year,..thought it was the bulb, ordered two bulbs before realizing it was the ballast.  Cant find a replacement ballast.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these and loved it until it broke. Bought another one and it too broke in less than 6 months.  When I called customer service they told me not to expect it to last more than a year.  I won&#x27;t buy anything this company sells.</li>
            <li> Wonderful makeup mirror!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this mirror for almost 4 years. Last month, the light switch began malfunctioning, as others have reported. I emailed Zadro&#x27;s customer service and they promptly sent me instructions. I paid for shipping the mirror to them in Calif ~($21 cross country) and wondered if I&#x27;d ever see it again. Well, less than 2 weeks later, it arrived back at my front door, light switch fixed at no cost. Fantastic service for something that was well past it&#x27;s warranty.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than in stores...great mirror</li>
            <li> I hung onto this piece of junk for as long as I could because I paid $140 for it! I bought it because of the good light it put off. Most of the tension in the neck was lost so I was constantly catching it from falling over. The tension that rotates the mirror was completely gone. I had to use a tissue to keep it from moving while I was putting on my makeup. The white plastic that covered the bulbs started coming off and had to use electrical tape to keep it on. I think the bulb still worked but the switch to turn it on and off went bad. Could tell is was coming for a while but hoping it wouldn&#x27;t catch fire!</li>
            <li> I love this mirror. Other mirrors I have tried in the past have broken because the wires get twisted when changing from the regular mirror to the magnifying side. It will not happen with this mirror!  It is so easy to see.....actually you see more than you may want to!  The light is wonderful...it dims and is a great natural daylight. I can&#x27;t love it more. The only reason for 4 and not 5 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t stay perfectly in position. I&#x27;ve never had one that did. But I truly love this mirror and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> While I agree with all the reviews, i  bought the light bulb anyway, and that wasnt it. no surprise there. My husband is an electrician and there was no power to the bulb ( I could have asked him from the beginning but tried to do it myself lol ) upon further inspection  he deamed it was a bad ballast.  I called zadro told them i love this mirror and it wasnt working,and  also informed them I purchased a bulb to no avail and zadro said it was the ballast. Stay tuned it will take a week to get it, cost $15.00 but a heck of a lot better than buying a new one. I will update this review if it works. ballast delivered as promised, good as brand new!!!!! yeah!!!!!!! not hard to replace, I could of done it.</li>
            <li> I bought mine Dec 12, 2010. I love the lighting however the dimmer broke after a few months of use. I never had a problem with the bulb. I just have to plug and unplug it if I need to use the mirror. It&#x27;s a bit of a hustle but I don&#x27;t want to pay 100+ bucks and the dimmer would just fail on me again.</li>
            <li> My mom purchased this in 2008, anytime I visited I made a point of sitting down and using the 10x - it really is eye opening and hard to go back to a normal magnified mirror once you&#x27;ve owned one with that magnification power. Despite it&#x27;s bulk/weight she took it with her when she traveled too and lucky me - she forgot it at my house after visiting for Christmas 2012 and said I could keep it :)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s had a few annoyances but quick fixes and learning to deal with it acted as a band aid until yesterday; my husband bought me a new mirror for my birthday. It was a Conair 1x/8x round mirror that turns on three light settings with just a tap of the base - unfortunately those setting were all equally bad and not sufficient for putting on make up. I figured, well - it&#x27;s time to sit down and see if I can fix the Zadro now\\&quot;. The Conair was $70 and I figured I could get something a lot better with that money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the problems with this Zadro: I know a lot of people have had issues with bulbs burning out or never working, the ballast etc.  Lucky me, my original bulb has been going strong with moderate to heavy use for 6 years, knock on wood. If you need a replacement, Prime currently has double packs with mediocre reviews for about $15. Interested if another brand would work? If anybody has tried another brand of T5 bulb with this mirror PLEASE comment and tell me about it :)&lt;br /&gt;If you need a replacement ballast, Zadro does sell them, amazon might - I know it&#x27;s a pain but still cheaper than replacing this mirror and honestly, I don&#x27;t ever see any out there I like anyway. If mine breaks I&#x27;ll replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the hinges! Yes, the hinges on this sucker got lose and for a long, long time I just lived with it because it didn&#x27;t seem like they were accessible to tighten but guess what I found out yesterday?! (which, may I add that I found and fixed this issue after husband attempted and said it wasn&#x27;t possible) There are smooth round covers over the hinge part that make it look seamless and inaccessible but a slim flat head or something similar will help to pop them right off. Then you can use a screwdriver to tighten it and if you want (which I advise to prevent/delay stripping) you can hold the other end tight with an 8mm ratchet. I&#x27;m so pleased to have my mirror standing upright again, hopefully it&#x27;ll be a little while before it needs tightening again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does your mirror flip flip and not stay in place? Yeah mine too. For years my mom and then I lived with by sticking a q-tip I between the mirror and frame. There&#x27;s little washer shaped pads where the mirror swivels and I think over time they&#x27;ve lost a little cushion - could be fixed but my q-tip works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror has everything I want and need. Fantastic, natural lighting is very important to me. More and more mirrors are moving to warm lighting and LED bulbs, I prefer this kind. The big 10x mirror is great for the close up work, plucking, popping etc and the 1x for your regular mirror work. For those of you who complain the 10x distorts - magnifying mirrors are concave, parabolic - they work off 45 degree light angles so \\&quot;distortion\\&quot; occurs the further away you get from the center or the further back you walk - it&#x27;s science. It works perfect if you&#x27;re using it correctly and understand it&#x27;s physical limits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure this mirror has some physical aspects that could be attributed to poor craftsmanship but really, mine has held up well and now that I know the hinges can be fixed I&#x27;m thrilled. It&#x27;s a keeper.art that make it look seamless and inaccessible but a slim flat head or something similar will help to pop them right off.

            <li> Came broken twice. Didn&#x27;t try for a third.</li>
            <li> When I decided to spend $100 on a make up mirror, the last thing I expected was to have to keep a screw driver at the ready. Unfortunately, that&#x27;s what I have to do.  The mirror does move as depicted and described -- what they don&#x27;t tell you is that every time you use it, it loosens the large screw that holds the mirror and light portion upright -- If I had a dollar for every time that portion has fallen down onto my forehead while I was putting on my makeup, it would&#x27;ve paid for itself 5 times over.  Add that to the fact that the first one I received didn&#x27;t work at all and had to be returned/replaced, and I&#x27;m not at all happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy :-(</li>
            <li> thank you!! works perfect!!!</li>
            <li> This product looks attractive. It appears well designed \\&quot;on the outside\\&quot;. However, IT DOES NOT WORK. My opinion is that it is poorly manufactured (in China).&lt;br /&gt;Like many of the reviews, the light stoped functioning within a few months. We had placed it in our guest room. We have had very few guests over the past year. So this mirror had not been used much at all.&lt;br /&gt;My wife has a make-up mirror made in USA by Westinghouse. She has been using it for 40 years without any problem and has never needed to change the fluorescent light bulb either.&lt;br /&gt;Judging from all the negative reviews and my own experience:  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mom for Christmas.  She had done a lot of research on magnifying mirrors and asked for it specifically.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> This actually is the second of these mirrors that we have purchased (the first was for my wife, and now my daughter also has one).  A second purchase of the same product obviously is high praise. This lighted mirror is the very best one that we have seen in the market. You will get many years of excellent service from this lighted mirror.</li>
            <li> Best makeup mirror I&#x27;ve ever owned!  Love it~</li>
            <li> I was excited to get my mirror until I discovered that it was broken -not from shipping but from poor packaging inside the box. I immediately contacted Amazon and I was sent a replacement in perfect condition!! It really is a great product and I&#x27;m very pleased as it does exactly as it was described.</li>
            <li> The on/off switch broke after 4 months. So I took it back to BedBath&amp;Beyond for a replacement. I love almost everything about this mirror but its not built to last. I have read reviews &amp; majority gave it negative reviews about it being JUNK, the bulb blowing out after a few months. For the price I paid this mirror should last me years but It just don&#x27;t last very long. As long as BedBath&amp;Beyond will replace it, I will keep taking it back when it breaks. I wish Zadro will improve the quality of this mirror.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t give a negative or no rating for this, so I HAD to give it a 1 star. I paid 139.99 for this and it lasted a week. They should know, that you can&#x27;t put a dimmer switch on a fluorescent bulb.</li>
