            <li>If you spray it on your foundation brush before using it, it makes a difference and your face looks even better.</li>
            <li>Such a great product!</li>
            <li>This product feels so refreshing, and it truly sets makeup well.  </li>
            <li>It also feels so refreshing and hydrating when applied to your face.</li>
            <li>It dries in a matter of seconds but leaves the skin feeling hydrated and feeling so light for hours!</li>
            <li>Love this and love the price!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makeup stays on better than if I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t break me out like most setting sprays do.</li>
            <li>My makeup seems to stay on better and longer.</li>
            <li>Great product, works very well.</li>
            <li>and I swear it&#x27;s magical</li>
            <li>so I was very excited to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy that I didn&#x27;t receive any new breakouts or irritation from using this setting spray.</li>
            <li>Great product , I love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>The mist feels so refreshing once sprays and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>So easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This looked really nice and much healthier!</li>
            <li>Hands down the best setting spray I have ever used!</li>
            <li>After a long day of running errands in 100 degree weather without touching my makeup up it still looked great.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice spray with organic ingredients which I really like.</li>
            <li>Hmm, I like that it&#x27;s ingredients, I like how much comes in the bottle,and it feels nice...</li>
            <li>Is a light, moisturizing spray.  </li>
            <li>I tried to focus on my skin without it being to blurry to show that after about 6 hours of working, no creases no blotting-still smooth.</li>
            <li>my appearance is important to me.  </li>
            <li>First thing I noticed was there isn&#x27;t a strong overpowering scent, which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li>It is very intriguing though because the a lot of people swear by it.</li>
            <li>really like that it&#x27;s spraying a very fine mist.</li>
            <li>It has just the slightest scent, but it&#x27;s clean and not in any way chemically.</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and dries very quickly within about 10-15 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy fix, just get a different top :)</li>
            <li>This spray also leaves a dewy finish, but if you love a matte look like me just spray it on after your done applying your makeup, wait for it to dry and apply powder on top of it!</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s actually good for me because I don&#x27;t want to mix or smell my perfume scent and setting spray scent at the same time</li>
            <li>as in cools you down,if it&#x27;s warm/hot weather.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s  not an adequate setting spray for me to buy again</li>
            <li>Really like this product, read reviews and am glad I purchased, keeps make up fresh all dayargie</li>
            <li>I decided to try to it out during a super hot 100 degree weekend at a music festival!</li>
            <li>It also was nice to use as a freshening spray later in the day.</li>
            <li>for the most important part, this did actually held up my makeup till at night.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting to leave work, sweaty, and return home to find a fresh face in the mirror.</li>
            <li>It keeps my face looking fresh and supple to the touch.  </li>
            <li>I normally useodel in a bottle which is teflon in makeup staying power but the strong odor kept me from using it so often.</li>
            <li>It has almost don&#x27;t have a scent to it and right after spraying, the scent does not linger at all</li>
            <li>First, I love that it&#x27;s all natural with organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>After spraying it on my face I was pleasantly surprised that it didn&#x27;t just feel like water but was refreshing like spraying water on your skin on a hot day.</li>
            <li>and I was so happy to find out that it was moisturizing but didn&#x27;t turn my face into an oil slick.</li>
            <li>Our family is using only organic products and this one is high quality product and very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I even slept in my makeup one night (I know, a big no-no), and everything looked great the next morning.</li>
            <li>at first she didnt know what in the world it was, but after reading directions and trying it, your going to have a repeat customer</li>
            <li>This is the first setting spray I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>First, the spray bottle does not produce a mist.  </li>
            <li>I have used cheaper versions of makeup setting spray that worked much better and actually came out as a mist.  </li>
            <li>so I can feel safe letting my teenage daughter use it as well.</li>
            <li>haha!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many makeup setting spray last, I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li>It really does help keep my make-up on and fresh looking for A LOT longer</li>
            <li>I have recently been using the PureBliss setting spray and love it.  </li>
            <li>After many different brands and reading reviews, this product was my decision.  </li>
            <li>I use this this sometimes 4 times a day and it feels like a just applied my makeup for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Dries pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I am a huge makeup junkie and with that I need my makeup to stay on all day, especially in the hot Louisiana summer.</li>
            <li>This pure bliss spray showed just asych staying powder with out the odor.</li>
            <li>I apply primer to my face before putting my make up on, and use the Pure Bliss make up setting spray after I am done to set my foundation, bronzer, blush, eye shadow, brows, and lips.</li>
            <li>It works just as well as the high end make up and leaves my make up on all day and prevents it from running, creasing and blotting in this hot Florida heat &amp; humidity.</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>my daughter absolutely loves this.  </li>
            <li>It may just end up replacing my high end setting spray!</li>
            <li>I have heard and seen so much make up setting sprays on youtube and stores</li>
            <li>For me, it looks very &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>but it looks promising.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes this Makeup Setting Spray.</li>
            <li>My makeup stays put and it really feels like it tightens up your face.</li>
            <li>It really does what it promises.</li>
            <li>If you hold it closer to your face, your face will get more wet which may cause your make up to run</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t say that I really notice much of a difference between applying this over my makeup and just using a primer under my makeup.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I use very costly makeuo</li>
            <li>I just started using this product, I only used it for 2 times, but so far I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I was a bit sceptical but it really does make your makeup last longer and is just refreshing in general.</li>
            <li>I had received a tiny sample of this and could not wait to try it in full size.</li>
            <li>I had to put it in a different spray bottle, as the spray bottle it came in like full on squirt rather than spritzed my face.</li>
            <li>, it worked great- as in, I got home so late after all was said and done that I went to sleep without washing my face (big no-no</li>
            <li>This is a good product, I only buy this spray because I know it will work everyday, every time.</li>
            <li>When I sprayed it on my face after doing my makeup, it came out as a fine mist and easily covered my entire face in a couple pumps without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Really refreshing with little scent.</li>
            <li>I will have to use it again during the day when it&#x27;s hot and humid outside If this spray will hold my make up really well for a decent amount of time I will give it a 5 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, I really like it.</li>
            <li>I misted several times today because it felt lovely and my skin was left soft and not sticky.</li>
            <li>only thing is I might have used too much because a tiny bit of mascara got on my cheek from my eyes being closed and misted on (which quickly and easily wiped off)...</li>
            <li>I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li>I had to by a new spary bottle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a setting spray before, so this was a new experience.</li>
            <li>and we live way south.</li>
            <li>With this setting spray, I only need to put the mackeup on first.  </li>
            <li>Used as directed and seems to keep make up in place especially on those hot, humid days.</li>
            <li>I have to say I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised I believe it actually may even work better than my more expensive setting spray which is a bonus.</li>
            <li>I squirts out in a very direct stream and even though I held the bottle directly in front of my face it sprayed over my head.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased this setting spray by Pure Bliss.</li>
            <li>I received this setting spray as a sample with Pure Bliss&#x27; facial toner.</li>
            <li>The spray part needs to be fixed.</li>
            <li>Make sure you hold it at least 12 inches away from your face.</li>
            <li>Wow, Really, wow.</li>
            <li>Also, I like that it is made with natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is natural and does not burn my skin.</li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>I walk several miles (8-11) in very hot/humid weather</li>
            <li>After first trying on my face and beingshocked with the force-Tried spraying the first few away</li>
            <li>I always worry about trying new facial products because I have sensitive acne-prone skin</li>
            <li>I live in Florida &amp; this is not oily, it only takes a minute to set &amp;</li>
            <li>A necessity for long days, however...I expected a mist, but this product is a full spray.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to switch from your more expensive setting spray give this one a try I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It barely has a fragrance which I like since I do not wish to be suffocated when I spay this on.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my once T-zone oily skin  has become dry sometimes, so this may help with that.</li>
            <li>Second, even after the new bottle there were droplets of water left on my face.  </li>
            <li>and I needed to refresh it less (which is good, because I&#x27;m not great at that).</li>
            <li>It really helped my makeup stay on all day and made it just a little bit easier to wear makeup throughout the day, especially if you&#x27;re going to be busy and don&#x27;t have time to touch up your makup...</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t break me out like most setting sprays do.</li>
            <li> My makeup seems to stay on better and longer.</li>
            <li> Great product, works very well.</li>
            <li> and I swear it&#x27;s magical</li>
            <li> so I was very excited to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m happy that I didn&#x27;t receive any new breakouts or irritation from using this setting spray.</li>
            <li> Great product , I love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> The mist feels so refreshing once sprays and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> So easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This looked really nice and much healthier!</li>
            <li> Hands down the best setting spray I have ever used!</li>
            <li> After a long day of running errands in 100 degree weather without touching my makeup up it still looked great.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice spray with organic ingredients which I really like.</li>
            <li> Hmm, I like that it&#x27;s ingredients, I like how much comes in the bottle,and it feels nice...</li>
            <li> Is a light, moisturizing spray.  </li>
            <li> I tried to focus on my skin without it being to blurry to show that after about 6 hours of working, no creases no blotting-still smooth.</li>
            <li> my appearance is important to me.  </li>
            <li> First thing I noticed was there isn&#x27;t a strong overpowering scent, which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li> It is very intriguing though because the a lot of people swear by it.</li>
            <li> really like that it&#x27;s spraying a very fine mist.</li>
            <li> It has just the slightest scent, but it&#x27;s clean and not in any way chemically.</li>
            <li> The smell is fresh and dries very quickly within about 10-15 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easy fix, just get a different top :)</li>
            <li> This spray also leaves a dewy finish, but if you love a matte look like me just spray it on after your done applying your makeup, wait for it to dry and apply powder on top of it!</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s actually good for me because I don&#x27;t want to mix or smell my perfume scent and setting spray scent at the same time</li>
            <li> as in cools you down,if it&#x27;s warm/hot weather.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s  not an adequate setting spray for me to buy again</li>
            <li> Really like this product, read reviews and am glad I purchased, keeps make up fresh all dayargie</li>
            <li> I decided to try to it out during a super hot 100 degree weekend at a music festival!</li>
            <li> It also was nice to use as a freshening spray later in the day.</li>
            <li> for the most important part, this did actually held up my makeup till at night.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting to leave work, sweaty, and return home to find a fresh face in the mirror.</li>
            <li> It keeps my face looking fresh and supple to the touch.  </li>
            <li> I normally useodel in a bottle which is teflon in makeup staying power but the strong odor kept me from using it so often.</li>
            <li> It has almost don&#x27;t have a scent to it and right after spraying, the scent does not linger at all</li>
            <li> First, I love that it&#x27;s all natural with organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> After spraying it on my face I was pleasantly surprised that it didn&#x27;t just feel like water but was refreshing like spraying water on your skin on a hot day.</li>
            <li> and I was so happy to find out that it was moisturizing but didn&#x27;t turn my face into an oil slick.</li>
            <li> Our family is using only organic products and this one is high quality product and very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I even slept in my makeup one night (I know, a big no-no), and everything looked great the next morning.</li>
            <li> at first she didnt know what in the world it was, but after reading directions and trying it, your going to have a repeat customer</li>
            <li> This is the first setting spray I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> First, the spray bottle does not produce a mist.  </li>
            <li> I have used cheaper versions of makeup setting spray that worked much better and actually came out as a mist.  </li>
            <li> so I can feel safe letting my teenage daughter use it as well.</li>
            <li> haha!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many makeup setting spray last, I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> It really does help keep my make-up on and fresh looking for A LOT longer</li>
            <li> I have recently been using the PureBliss setting spray and love it.  </li>
            <li> After many different brands and reading reviews, this product was my decision.  </li>
            <li> I use this this sometimes 4 times a day and it feels like a just applied my makeup for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Dries pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I am a huge makeup junkie and with that I need my makeup to stay on all day, especially in the hot Louisiana summer.</li>
            <li> This pure bliss spray showed just asych staying powder with out the odor.</li>
            <li> I apply primer to my face before putting my make up on, and use the Pure Bliss make up setting spray after I am done to set my foundation, bronzer, blush, eye shadow, brows, and lips.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as the high end make up and leaves my make up on all day and prevents it from running, creasing and blotting in this hot Florida heat &amp; humidity.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> my daughter absolutely loves this.  </li>
            <li> It may just end up replacing my high end setting spray!</li>
            <li> I have heard and seen so much make up setting sprays on youtube and stores</li>
            <li> For me, it looks very &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> but it looks promising.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this Makeup Setting Spray.</li>
            <li> My makeup stays put and it really feels like it tightens up your face.</li>
            <li> It really does what it promises.</li>
            <li> If you hold it closer to your face, your face will get more wet which may cause your make up to run</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t say that I really notice much of a difference between applying this over my makeup and just using a primer under my makeup.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I use very costly makeuo</li>
            <li> I just started using this product, I only used it for 2 times, but so far I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I was a bit sceptical but it really does make your makeup last longer and is just refreshing in general.</li>
            <li> I had received a tiny sample of this and could not wait to try it in full size.</li>
            <li> I had to put it in a different spray bottle, as the spray bottle it came in like full on squirt rather than spritzed my face.</li>
            <li> , it worked great- as in, I got home so late after all was said and done that I went to sleep without washing my face (big no-no</li>
            <li> This is a good product, I only buy this spray because I know it will work everyday, every time.</li>
            <li> When I sprayed it on my face after doing my makeup, it came out as a fine mist and easily covered my entire face in a couple pumps without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Really refreshing with little scent.</li>
            <li> I will have to use it again during the day when it&#x27;s hot and humid outside If this spray will hold my make up really well for a decent amount of time I will give it a 5 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, I really like it.</li>
            <li> I misted several times today because it felt lovely and my skin was left soft and not sticky.</li>
            <li> only thing is I might have used too much because a tiny bit of mascara got on my cheek from my eyes being closed and misted on (which quickly and easily wiped off)...</li>
            <li> I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li> I had to by a new spary bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a setting spray before, so this was a new experience.</li>
            <li> and we live way south.</li>
            <li> With this setting spray, I only need to put the mackeup on first.  </li>
            <li> Used as directed and seems to keep make up in place especially on those hot, humid days.</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised I believe it actually may even work better than my more expensive setting spray which is a bonus.</li>
            <li> I squirts out in a very direct stream and even though I held the bottle directly in front of my face it sprayed over my head.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased this setting spray by Pure Bliss.</li>
            <li> I received this setting spray as a sample with Pure Bliss&#x27; facial toner.</li>
            <li> The spray part needs to be fixed.</li>
            <li> Make sure you hold it at least 12 inches away from your face.</li>
            <li> Wow, Really, wow.</li>
            <li> Also, I like that it is made with natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is natural and does not burn my skin.</li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I walk several miles (8-11) in very hot/humid weather</li>
            <li> After first trying on my face and beingshocked with the force-Tried spraying the first few away</li>
            <li> I always worry about trying new facial products because I have sensitive acne-prone skin</li>
            <li> I live in Florida &amp; this is not oily, it only takes a minute to set &amp;</li>
            <li> A necessity for long days, however...I expected a mist, but this product is a full spray.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to switch from your more expensive setting spray give this one a try I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It barely has a fragrance which I like since I do not wish to be suffocated when I spay this on.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my once T-zone oily skin  has become dry sometimes, so this may help with that.</li>
            <li> Second, even after the new bottle there were droplets of water left on my face.  </li>
            <li> and I needed to refresh it less (which is good, because I&#x27;m not great at that).</li>
            <li> It really helped my makeup stay on all day and made it just a little bit easier to wear makeup throughout the day, especially if you&#x27;re going to be busy and don&#x27;t have time to touch up your makup...</li>
            <li> I typically use a high end makeup setting spray that costs almost triple the price of this one</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s actually helping my skin in the long run.</li>
            <li> The problem that I run into is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like, so I thought I&#x27;d give this setting spray a try.</li>
            <li> I had to use a hair dryer to dry the product.  </li>
            <li> It seems to keep my make up on the longer and it makes me neither oily or dry</li>
            <li> Not only does it set my make up (even in the recent hot and muggy weather to boot)</li>
            <li> It only took a few seconds for it to dry on my face.</li>
            <li> The setting spray also contains white and green tea which are also antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, and have anti-aging benefits.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected  it to be.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different products for extending the life of your make-up (primer, other setting sprays.)</li>
            <li> Living in a very hot and humid climate it is quite difficult to keep your make-up on your face and not running down it.</li>
            <li> I prefer it over the expensive one I purchased from a large beauty supply store!</li>
            <li> and I do like that it has other beneficial ingredients as well.  </li>
            <li> which sometimes I feel like my other setting spray did.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not sticky like some other sprays our there.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about all the reviews but decided to give it a go due to how affordable it is!</li>
            <li> It stings a little just for a sec</li>
            <li> Not worth anything.  </li>
            <li> It also calms the hair so that it is less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling tight and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the heavy spray that it gives, I prefer a finer mist.</li>
            <li> and I could feel that sensation as it dried.</li>
            <li> I use it to moisturize my face when I have make-up on since I don&#x27;t want it to go to waste.</li>
            <li> and I just recently finished off my full face of make up with this spray for an outdoor concert in the AWFUL humid heat, and though I was sweating like a whore in church</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that I touched my face very little and patted off the sweat with a tissue rather than wipe off the sweat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually I have to touch up my make up once or twice during the day.  </li>
            <li> Anything too close, you will end up with small droplets.</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer in setting spray and often use a prestige brand that costs almost 3x this amount!</li>
            <li> It is like a jet spray and very harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> I like the ingredients &amp; don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m putting something bad for my skin on my sensitive face.</li>
            <li> Not bad The spray nozzle is horrible</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this as I previously have used a very expensive setting spray that I purchased from A department store.</li>
            <li> (sorry about the poor quality)</li>
            <li> Does not clog my pores or make my makeup look bad after spraying.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it sprays so violently</li>
            <li> so well that I did not even need to use powder, a step I have always hated anyway.</li>
            <li> go the the chiropractor and the worst is putting you face on the table getting up and makeup everywhere and smeared.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works really well.  Felt great on my face and my makeup stayed on all day.  Usually I have to touch up my make up once or twice during the day.  With this setting spray, I only need to put the mackeup on first.  I carry this spray with and when needed I spray it on my face to get a refresh.</li>
            <li> A necessity for long days, however...I expected a mist, but this product is a full spray. I have to blot it after using, which totally defeats it&#x27;s purpose. I will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> The spray part needs to be fixed. It is like a jet spray and very harsh on the skin. After first trying on my face and beingshocked with the force-Tried spraying the first few away and it was still the same.</li>
            <li> This spray worked well as a makeup setting spray and I do like that it has other beneficial ingredients as well.  It also was nice to use as a freshening spray later in the day.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my Benefit brand which is a bit pricey at Sephora. I decided to try something new. This looked really nice and much healthier! It works just as great as Benefit! And it&#x27;s a larger quantity!! Smells great! So happy with my buy!</li>
            <li> my daughter absolutely loves this.  at first she didnt know what in the world it was, but after reading directions and trying it, your going to have a repeat customer</li>
            <li> What a great setting spray. I live in Florida &amp; this is not oily, it only takes a minute to set &amp; I&#x27;mso glad I bought2 bottles!</li>
            <li> I am a huge makeup junkie and with that I need my makeup to stay on all day, especially in the hot Louisiana summer. I typically use a high end makeup setting spray that costs almost triple the price of this one so I was very excited to give this one a try. This is a really nice spray with organic ingredients which I really like. The setting spray also contains white and green tea which are also antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, and have anti-aging benefits. So this spray doesn&#x27;t just help keep my makeup lasting all day, it&#x27;s actually helping my skin in the long run. The mist feels so refreshing once sprays and dries very quickly. After a long day of running errands in 100 degree weather without touching my makeup up it still looked great. I always worry about trying new facial products because I have sensitive acne-prone skin but I&#x27;m happy that I didn&#x27;t receive any new breakouts or irritation from using this setting spray. So far I&#x27;m really impressed with it and will be using this bottle up. It may just end up replacing my high end setting spray! *discount received for testing and review*</li>
            <li> Sets makeup well. Good valve too.</li>
            <li> This is the first setting spray I have ever tried. It is refreshing and I just recently finished off my full face of make up with this spray for an outdoor concert in the AWFUL humid heat, and though I was sweating like a whore in church, my face stayed in place!!</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about all the reviews but decided to give it a go due to how affordable it is! I&#x27;m happy to say that I&#x27;m loving this spray. I decided to try to it out during a super hot 100 degree weekend at a music festival! I&#x27;m happy to say that it withstood the heat and sweat. Keep in mind that I touched my face very little and patted off the sweat with a tissue rather than wipe off the sweat.&lt;br /&gt; I also like to spray some unto a damp beauty blender and apply my foundation that way!&lt;br /&gt;I love how it smells! it smells great! This spray also leaves a dewy finish, but if you love a matte look like me just spray it on after your done applying your makeup, wait for it to dry and apply powder on top of it! It looks great like that and not cakey at all.&lt;br /&gt;Purebliss: Don&#x27;t change the formula and don&#x27;t change how affordable you are!</li>
            <li> It does what it says it will and I love it. I was a bit sceptical but it really does make your makeup last longer and is just refreshing in general.</li>
            <li> Hmm, I like that it&#x27;s ingredients, I like how much comes in the bottle,and it feels nice...as in cools you down,if it&#x27;s warm/hot weather.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s  not an adequate setting spray for me to buy again</li>
            <li> I have heard and seen so much make up setting sprays on youtube and stores but I cannot see myself spending top money for it. It is very intriguing though because the a lot of people swear by it. When I was given the chance to try this spray at a promotional price in return of my unbiased opinion, I just couldn&#x27;t help but get so excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray came in a simple plastic bottle. For me, it looks very &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;. Nothing too fancy but it looks promising. Tonight I went out for a family dinner and finally tested the spray. I did my make up and sprayed it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that it&#x27;s spraying a very fine mist. Make sure you hold it at least 12 inches away from your face. Anything too close, you will end up with small droplets. It only took a few seconds for it to dry on my face. It has almost don&#x27;t have a scent to it and right after spraying, the scent does not linger at all so that&#x27;s actually good for me because I don&#x27;t want to mix or smell my perfume scent and setting spray scent at the same time anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for the most important part, this did actually held up my makeup till at night. It was a good 4-5 hours for me. I will have to use it again during the day when it&#x27;s hot and humid outside If this spray will hold my make up really well for a decent amount of time I will give it a 5 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely update in a week or two because I would like to test it in different weather condition. But for now, I&#x27;m gonna say that I am really starting to like it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the heavy spray that it gives, I prefer a finer mist.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin feel! With or without makeup it&#x27;s perfect to spray on anytime</li>
            <li> Not worth anything.  First, the spray bottle does not produce a mist.  I squirts out in a very direct stream and even though I held the bottle directly in front of my face it sprayed over my head.  After I adjusted the height of my hand it squirted my in the forhead.  I had to by a new spary bottle.  Second, even after the new bottle there were droplets of water left on my face.  I had to use a hair dryer to dry the product.  I have used cheaper versions of makeup setting spray that worked much better and actually came out as a mist.  I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Wow, Really, wow. My makeup lasts 10-12 hours with this. So easy to apply. Dries pretty fast. Really refreshing with little scent. Love this, and such a great value!</li>
            <li> Works great! It Doesn&#x27;t smell or leave your face oily. Love that it&#x27;s made with organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> Great product , I love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this setting spray by Pure Bliss. I have tried a few different products for extending the life of your make-up (primer, other setting sprays.) This has been one of my favorites. Living in a very hot and humid climate it is quite difficult to keep your make-up on your face and not running down it. This setting spray has had the best overall results. It works best when you hold it about 8 inches from your face so its a lighter mist. Also, I like that it is made with natural ingredients so I can feel safe letting my teenage daughter use it as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it sprays so violently and it burns. Do not purchase.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this as I previously have used a very expensive setting spray that I purchased from A department store. I have to say I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised I believe it actually may even work better than my more expensive setting spray which is a bonus. It seems to keep my make up on the longer and it makes me neither oily or dry which sometimes I feel like my other setting spray did. If you&#x27;re looking to switch from your more expensive setting spray give this one a try I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not bad The spray nozzle is horrible it shoots at you instead a being a mist spray</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time when I went to a wedding this past weekend. I followed the directions- only thing is I might have used too much because a tiny bit of mascara got on my cheek from my eyes being closed and misted on (which quickly and easily wiped off)... but then again it worked!&lt;br /&gt;Like, it worked great- as in, I got home so late after all was said and done that I went to sleep without washing my face (big no-no I know!) the thing is that I woke up in the morning and my makeup still looked fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;I know overnight makeup wearing is not the purpose of this spray, but now I know it totally works! haha!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Our family is using only organic products and this one is high quality product and very refreshing. My wife really likes this Makeup Setting Spray.</li>
            <li> From the wife: I use mineral makeup exclusively for everything from foundation to eyeshadow, blush and even eyeliner. The problem that I run into is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like, so I thought I&#x27;d give this setting spray a try. I&#x27;ve never used a setting spray before, so this was a new experience. First, I love that it&#x27;s all natural with organic ingredients. When I sprayed it on my face after doing my makeup, it came out as a fine mist and easily covered my entire face in a couple pumps without feeling heavy. There is an ingredient in it which tightens the skin and I could feel that sensation as it dried. It has just the slightest scent, but it&#x27;s clean and not in any way chemically. My makeup did stay put longer and I needed to refresh it less (which is good, because I&#x27;m not great at that). I think that says a lot considering it&#x27;s summer and we live way south. I&#x27;d recommend it and I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> So refreshing. Does not clog my pores or make my makeup look bad after spraying. I plan to buy this product again once I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> Great product my makeup stayed on and looks fresh and don&#x27;t see or feel oily .</li>
            <li> This is a good product, I only buy this spray because I know it will work everyday, every time. Exactly as I expected  it to be.</li>
            <li> My make-up still comes off. I would like to find a setting spray that keeps my make-up from getting on my cell phone, and stays on throughout the day. I like the fact that it is natural and does not burn my skin.</li>
            <li> Is a light, moisturizing spray.  I use it to set my make up but also I spray it on my arms and legs .  It sets my make up for hours. No harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> This Setting spray is absolutely wonderful..I walk several miles (8-11) in very hot/humid weather and my make up still looks great after!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love it love it :)</li>
            <li> I am makeup artist and this stuff impressed me. I normally useodel in a bottle which is teflon in makeup staying power but the strong odor kept me from using it so often. This pure bliss spray showed just asych staying powder with out the odor. I&#x27;ve used many makeup setting spray last, I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> A fabulous mist! I tried another cheaper brand and it washed all my make up off! This one actually is a mist and is wonderful. I misted several times today because it felt lovely and my skin was left soft and not sticky. No smell, no irritation, no residue. So far, I really like it.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing and it sets make up well!</li>
            <li> Really like this product, read reviews and am glad I purchased, keeps make up fresh all dayargie</li>
            <li> This is the best make up setting spray I have used so far! My makeup stays put and it really feels like it tightens up your face. It barely has a fragrance which I like since I do not wish to be suffocated when I spay this on. If you spray it on your foundation brush before using it, it makes a difference and your face looks even better. Such a great product! I will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Great product. It really does help keep my make-up on and fresh looking for A LOT longer</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed was there isn&#x27;t a strong overpowering scent, which is a huge plus! After spraying it on my face I was pleasantly surprised that it didn&#x27;t just feel like water but was refreshing like spraying water on your skin on a hot day. I have oily skin and I was so happy to find out that it was moisturizing but didn&#x27;t turn my face into an oil slick. It really helped my makeup stay on all day and made it just a little bit easier to wear makeup throughout the day, especially if you&#x27;re going to be busy and don&#x27;t have time to touch up your makup...just spray a couple times throughout the day and carry on!&lt;br /&gt;I will be repurchasing this product. Must have.</li>
            <li> This product feels so refreshing, and it truly sets makeup well.  I was not expecting to leave work, sweaty, and return home to find a fresh face in the mirror. I will be purchasing this product again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I had received a tiny sample of this and could not wait to try it in full size. Wonderful product, so refreshing in this triple-digit summer heat. It really does what it promises.</li>
            <li> Love this setting spray! I am a firm believer in setting spray and often use a prestige brand that costs almost 3x this amount! However, I am converting to this product! It works just as well as the high end make up and leaves my make up on all day and prevents it from running, creasing and blotting in this hot Florida heat &amp; humidity. I apply primer to my face before putting my make up on, and use the Pure Bliss make up setting spray after I am done to set my foundation, bronzer, blush, eye shadow, brows, and lips. It also feels so refreshing and hydrating when applied to your face. Simply just hold the bottle about 12&amp;#34; from your face and spray 2-3 times to mist your face. If you hold it closer to your face, your face will get more wet which may cause your make up to run-so don&#x27;t hold it too closely. It dries in a matter of seconds but leaves the skin feeling hydrated and feeling so light for hours! I have attached a picture of my make up (sorry about the poor quality) I tried to focus on my skin without it being to blurry to show that after about 6 hours of working, no creases no blotting-still smooth. Love this and love the price!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for exchange of my honest, unbiased review, but this is really one of the best setters I have used.</li>
            <li> Works great for setting makeup but the spray part just attacks your face. Easy fix, just get a different top :)</li>
            <li> Works well. Makeup stays on better than if I didn&#x27;t use it. I had to put it in a different spray bottle, as the spray bottle it came in like full on squirt rather than spritzed my face. I like that it has hyaluronic acid in it. It stings a little just for a sec so if you have sensitive skin just be careful. Doesn&#x27;t bother me enough to stop using it - I&#x27;ll probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Doesn&#x27;t break me out like most setting sprays do.</li>
            <li> Used as directed and seems to keep make up in place especially on those hot, humid days. As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my once T-zone oily skin  has become dry sometimes, so this may help with that. Just started using it, but does seem refreshing and used mid-day is nice too.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would make my make-up last longer, but it doesn&#x27;t. It is a nice refresher though. I use it to moisturize my face when I have make-up on since I don&#x27;t want it to go to waste. But it doesn&#x27;t help with making the make-up last longer.</li>
            <li> I like the ingredients &amp; don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m putting something bad for my skin on my sensitive face. But I can&#x27;t say that I really notice much of a difference between applying this over my makeup and just using a primer under my makeup. The seller was great though, and I got it quickly, so I gave it a fair rating.</li>
            <li> I received this setting spray as a sample with Pure Bliss&#x27; facial toner. I wouldn&#x27;t have thought to buy it since I don&#x27;t wear much make up but the ingredients of this are so great and feel really nice on my skin. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff! Not only does it set my make up (even in the recent hot and muggy weather to boot) it also feels so refreshing! I find myself using it throughout the day. Clean and Fresh scent which isn&#x27;t overwhelming and best of all it&#x27;s not sticky like some other sprays our there. Def recommend</li>
            <li> Love it! It really works. My makeup stays all day!</li>
            <li> This setting spray is great! I prefer it over the expensive one I purchased from a large beauty supply store!</li>
            <li> I have recently been using the PureBliss setting spray and love it.  I work in an office meeting and greeting people for eight hours of the day, so my appearance is important to me.  The setting spray set my makeup keeping in on my face and not rubbing off onto the phone.  It keeps my face looking fresh and supple to the touch.  It also calms the hair so that it is less noticeable.  Thank you for introducing me to PureBliss!</li>
            <li> I just started using this product, I only used it for 2 times, but so far I am pleased with it. My makeup seems to stay on better and longer.</li>
            <li> Great beauty spray! I use it on my face, hair and body. Will purchase again for myself and as a gift.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best setting spray I have ever used! It set my liquid foundation so well that I did not even need to use powder, a step I have always hated anyway. I even slept in my makeup one night (I know, a big no-no), and everything looked great the next morning. This spray smells good, is not sticky or tacky, and best of all, it works. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product, works very well. Refreshing and sets makeup well!</li>
            <li> So I must say I was hesitant about this purchase.  After many different brands and reading reviews, this product was my decision.  I truly HAVE made the BEST product decision after about 2 weeks of using this product.  I use very costly makeuo but my face tends to still be greasy.  I use this this sometimes 4 times a day and it feels like a just applied my makeup for the first time.  It leaves my face feeling tight and refreshed.  The smell is fresh and dries very quickly within about 10-15 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;I go the the chiropractor and the worst is putting you face on the table getting up and makeup everywhere and smeared.  I spray this on and I swear it&#x27;s magical no makeup comes off of my face.&lt;br /&gt;ty for a great  product shipping was prompt received before estimated delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;this is an honest review and I was not advised to write this...this is truly based on my experience.</li>
