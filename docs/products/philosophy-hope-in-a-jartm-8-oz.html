            <li>Amazing moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>-I took it on faith by company&#x27;s reputation and the fact I have LOVED every perfume the company has made- that it would smell good.  </li>
            <li>My husband used it once on vacation for his burnt face and loved it</li>
            <li>came right on time and the price was the best I have ever seen.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s now buying it on her own.</li>
            <li>Shopping around, I was able to get this at an amazing price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It does not have the oily or greasy coating most lotions or creams</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>just so one can be sure of what they are purchasing.</li>
            <li>I purchased this in Sephora and was quite pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>I have given it as gifts to friends and family who also love it.  </li>
            <li>Hope in a Jar is an excellent moisturizer with many glowing independent reviews.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Philosophy and Hope in a Jar</li>
            <li>is my all time favorite cream.  </li>
            <li>I can purchase this at a better price in the supersize and it gets delivered to my door on time.</li>
            <li>This is the best facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I was buying this product on Auto Delivery from QVC for many years, but found it on Amazon for $40 cheaper.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS NOT THE REAL PRODUCT!!!!  </li>
            <li>My wife has used Hope in a Jar for quite sometime and is very familiar with the product.</li>
            <li>I liked how well this product was absorbed by my skin</li>
            <li>Very light on the skin and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t given it a full five stars yet, as I need a month or more to see any visible skin help it has done (or not)</li>
            <li>I have less oil, but this is still the product that works the best.  </li>
            <li>What I experienced was totally different.</li>
            <li>Free 2-day shipping.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a nice product but honestly for the price I expected a lot more.</li>
            <li>She normally purchases HIJ from Ulta locally and has always been very happy with it.</li>
            <li>originally saw it as one of opra&#x27;s favorites.</li>
            <li>The lady I bought this more really likes the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and very hydrating.  </li>
            <li>-it gets absorbed.  </li>
            <li>Cetafil creme is far better</li>
            <li>Love the Hope in a jar, makes my face feel so soft....</li>
            <li>And Prime is really worth it.  </li>
            <li>you wouldn&#x27;t just buy a car with out test driving, right?</li>
            <li>This was nice when I 1st got it, but I didnt find that it worked in the long haul.</li>
            <li>In the end, I would recommend consumers get samples first</li>
            <li>my wife and I have been using this for a while we both love it along with when hope is not enough</li>
            <li>After all the attention this product gets in the media, I was expecting exactly what they promise.</li>
            <li>Who knows what this product is and if it is safe for human use.</li>
            <li>only problem was the jar top was cracked on</li>
            <li>but she is exceptionally satisfied with the overall results.</li>
            <li>I doubt I will have a flat tv screen forehead like a celebrity, but if even some wrinkles are less visible, it will be a good thing!  </li>
            <li>There is a slight lavender to it and to me, it just smells clean and light.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast.  </li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t have much hope...</li>
            <li>, it sounds so promising, but it&#x27;s a lie.</li>
            <li>It has a slightly unusual odour coming out of the jar</li>
            <li>my skin is soft, I don&#x27;t break out like I used to, and I love the entire line.</li>
            <li>So overall not a bad product by any means, but not quite what I&#x27;m looking for, which would be a moisturizer better for those with sensitive skin, and having longer lasting benefits.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product that I use everyday!</li>
            <li>but I will most definitely not buy another product sold by Net Traders again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>OK, it took some guts for me to suggest this to her, haha, but she was unhappy with her previous cream and is much more satisfied with this.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I did, as the texture of this is entirely different from any other facial cream I have used.</li>
            <li>For sensitive skin, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I am a redhead with very sensitive yet acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>as I said I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I use other body cream on my arms and legs but save this for the important and more delicate skin.</li>
            <li>She shared her secret and I am glad that she did!</li>
            <li>I suspect the product is old or adulterated.</li>
            <li>I recently tried the Essential Daily Moisturizer by AHAVA and have found that to be much better for my skin, and at a similar price as Philosophy.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m so happy that i didn&#x27;t buy the regular size jar, that would be a complete disappointment.</li>
            <li>I stopped taking it for a few months to try something cheaper, and my skin changed tremendously.  </li>
            <li>part of 3 items that were bought and now are used on a daily basis, so far so good.would recommend.</li>
            <li>and it was non-greasy and smells lovely ( although my friend finds the smell irritating).</li>
            <li>Again I got this at a much lower price than all of the other sites that only carry the 4 oz.</li>
            <li>This jar contained a substance that was much thinner in body, almost as though it was watered down.</li>

            <li> and this cream scent is far from bad.</li>

            <li> I have always used  hope in a jar, but  this jar of moisturizer is thinner  in body , not as thick  as it has always been every time  that I have bought a jar.  </li>

            <li> Unless an ingredient had gone bad-things have shelf lives, and can also have been transported in terrible conditions from manufacturer to store (temperatures too high,</li>
            <li> she called me and let me know that there is something wrong with the HIJ sent by Amazon.</li>
            <li> The smell if very unpleasant, like something you&#x27;d use to remove paint.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s greasy, smells really disgusting, i wouldn&#x27;t use it even on my feet.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have used this face cream for a long time. No miracles to disguise my age but an excellent face cream. Shipped fast.  Good price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this totally on a whim, thinking whatever, I will try it.  I admit I did not go to Sephora and ask for a sample-I took it on faith by company&#x27;s reputation and the fact I have LOVED every perfume the company has made- that it would smell good.  I am very glad I did, as the texture of this is entirely different from any other facial cream I have used. It does not have the oily or greasy coating most lotions or creams have-it seems to be water based, so of course, it is going to feel MUCH different in the tactile sense. I like its lightness, and it doesn&#x27;t just sit on your skin and then shine-it gets absorbed.  As for the aroma or scent, which is not only an issue on this review site but several others- like QVC, Ulta...I love it.  There is a slight lavender to it and to me, it just smells clean and light.  I professionally \\&quot;smell\\&quot; and taste for a living, and let me tell you, I can tell BAD smells when they come up (try very oxidized oil-corn, canola-whatever is in your pantry-that IS BAAAAD!) and this cream scent is far from bad. Why would a company make a rancid smelling facial cream? or anything, for that matter?  Unless an ingredient had gone bad-things have shelf lives, and can also have been transported in terrible conditions from manufacturer to store (temperatures too high, etc) There could be some factors, and Philosophy should look in to it.  I haven&#x27;t given it a full five stars yet, as I need a month or more to see any visible skin help it has done (or not) so I will get back to you all and update how it went..I doubt I will have a flat tv screen forehead like a celebrity, but if even some wrinkles are less visible, it will be a good thing!  In the end, I would recommend consumers get samples first just so one can be sure of what they are purchasing. The stuff is not cheap...you wouldn&#x27;t just buy a car with out test driving, right?</li>
            <li> I purchased this in Sephora and was quite pleased with the product.  I purchased the 8 0z. size from this vendor to save a few bucks.  The product was quite different. It has a thin watery texture.  Water actually separates out. I can pour it off. The color is yellowy.  Not the same as purchased in the store.  i would not order form this vendor again.  I suspect the product is old or adulterated.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for years and swear by it!  I have given it as gifts to friends and family who also love it.  My husband used it once on vacation for his burnt face and loved it, I catch him putting it on all the time now! It&#x27;s an amazing product that I use everyday!</li>
            <li> False product. I had a skin reaction, and the seller still made me pay for the return shipping. Scam. do not buy.</li>
            <li> I have used Philosophy for 3 years now and I will never use anything else. my skin is soft, I don&#x27;t break out like I used to, and I love the entire line.</li>
            <li> my wife and I have been using this for a while we both love it along with when hope is not enough</li>
            <li> Something is not right with this jar. I have always used  hope in a jar, but  this jar of moisturizer is thinner  in body , not as thick  as it has always been every time  that I have bought a jar.  I don&#x27;t  know  what has happened to this product but I don&#x27;t think that I will being Buying anymore Hope In A Jar after this.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a nice product but honestly for the price I expected a lot more. My face still looks the same as when I use the Regenerist Oil of Olay product line. The only thing that looks different is the amount in my bank account. Just not worth the price to me.</li>
            <li> After all the attention this product gets in the media, I was expecting exactly what they promise. What I experienced was totally different. The product is very watery and smells terrible. I had to add lavender essential oil to it to make it tolerable. Cetafil creme is far better and I&#x27;ll stick with that. Tried to use it again last night on my feet but the smell even with lavender is yuk! Will not buy it again, and this one is going in the garbage can.</li>
            <li> My wife has used Hope in a Jar for quite sometime and is very familiar with the product. She normally purchases HIJ from Ulta locally and has always been very happy with it. I wanted to save some money so I ordered this 8oz. jar of HIP from Amazon. When she received her HIJ she called me and let me know that there is something wrong with the HIJ sent by Amazon. This jar contained a substance that was much thinner in body, almost as though it was watered down. The substance was also a different color than HIJ sort of a yellowish color. The product also smelled different. Who knows what this product is and if it is safe for human use. Our daughter compared the jar with a jar that my wife bought locally and felt that it was counterfeit. Not sure what happened here but I will most definitely not buy another product sold by Net Traders again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had read some of the negative reviews on this product before I ordered. How unfortunate for those that are trying HIJ for the first time because this product is not even remotely related to what HIJ.</li>
            <li> came right on time and the price was the best I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> Hope in a Jar is an excellent moisturizer with many glowing independent reviews. Very light on the skin and absorbs quickly. Shopping around, I was able to get this at an amazing price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product! It is a drink of water for your skin. I use it on my face, neck and the back of my hands daily. I use other body cream on my arms and legs but save this for the important and more delicate skin. My mom turned me on to this as I asked her why she keeps looking younger every time that I see her. She shared her secret and I am glad that she did!</li>
            <li> Wife loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Philosophy and Hope in a Jar is my all time favorite cream.  The pricing through amazon prime was a great deal as well.  For sensitive skin, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This has been the moisturizer my husband has been using the past five years. He loves this product stating that it is not greasy and it keeps his skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> Amazing moisturizer!  Been using it for years!  Best value on Amazon!  I stopped taking it for a few months to try something cheaper, and my skin changed tremendously.  No wonder why it was one of Oprah&#x27;s Favorite things years ago!!!</li>
            <li> This is a cream I have used for several years and the only one that instantly absorbs into the skin without making it oily.  I have combination skin, as the years go by I have less oil, but this is still the product that works the best.  I like that I can purchase this at a better price in the supersize and it gets delivered to my door on time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who is going through chemo therapy.  She said this is the only lotion that helps her skin.  Would recommend</li>
            <li> Love the Hope in a jar, makes my face feel so soft....altho&#x27; I still don&#x27;t have much hope...lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem was the jar top was cracked on arrival.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t contact Amazon....probably should have.</li>
            <li> What is in this stuff?  After the third day of use, my face was swollen and red and itchy.  The smell if very unpleasant, like something you&#x27;d use to remove paint.  I&#x27;ll never stray from my Clinique again?</li>
            <li> my wife loves this stuff.pricey, but she swears by it,so i keep buying it and she keeps smiling. originally saw it as one of opra&#x27;s favorites.</li>
            <li> i bought this product in sephora in a small set of samples. and i&#x27;m so happy that i didn&#x27;t buy the regular size jar, that would be a complete disappointment. i haven&#x27;t finished even a small sample, it&#x27;s greasy, smells really disgusting, i wouldn&#x27;t use it even on my feet. i guess i bought it because of the name \\&quot;hope in a jar\\&quot;, it sounds so promising, but it&#x27;s a lie. will never buy this product again</li>
            <li> This is the best facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s light and very hydrating.  Philosophy makes great products.  Try this with the Purity facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Again I got this at a much lower price than all of the other sites that only carry the 4 oz. size. This 8 oz was about 20% less.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT THE REAL PRODUCT!!!!  I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR 2 YEARS.  THIS IS NOT IT.  DONT PURCHASE!!!!</li>
            <li> This was nice when I 1st got it, but I didnt find that it worked in the long haul. For this price I have decided not to reorder; Im now a Josie Maran girl!</li>
            <li> I was buying this product on Auto Delivery from QVC for many years, but found it on Amazon for $40 cheaper.  The only thing I would request is the ability to use auto delivery on Amazon.  I am finding that I can find ANYTHING on Amazon and use it as my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for buying everything.  And Prime is really worth it.  Free 2-day shipping.</li>
            <li> part of 3 items that were bought and now are used on a daily basis, so far so good.would recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this from amazon at the recommendation of a friend of mine, who has very similar skin issues as me.  So you can evaluate if my review will be applicable to your needs:  I am a redhead with very sensitive yet acne prone skin.  I tend to get very dry skin around my forehead, chin and eyes.  I liked how well this product was absorbed by my skin and it was non-greasy and smells lovely ( although my friend finds the smell irritating). However, I did find it irritating on the skin and it would make my eyes tear up some...as I said I have very sensitive skin.  I think overall it is overpriced for the level of effectiveness.  I didn&#x27;t find that my skin felt significantly moisturized all day and often noted that my skin felt tight and dried out a few hours afterwords.  So overall not a bad product by any means, but not quite what I&#x27;m looking for, which would be a moisturizer better for those with sensitive skin, and having longer lasting benefits. I recently tried the Essential Daily Moisturizer by AHAVA and have found that to be much better for my skin, and at a similar price as Philosophy.</li>
            <li> The service, packing and price were wonderful on this.  Also very happy with the product..will definitly order again.  This is so convenient..very happy.</li>
            <li> Since I found it on Amazon I know like have to go to the mall to buy it and pay almost double for it..plus this stuff works great on my skin</li>
            <li> The lady I bought this more really likes the product. It has a slightly unusual odour coming out of the jar but she is exceptionally satisfied with the overall results. She&#x27;s now buying it on her own. OK, it took some guts for me to suggest this to her, haha, but she was unhappy with her previous cream and is much more satisfied with this. It&#x27;s called \\&quot;hope\\&quot; in a jar, not &#x27;miracle\\&quot; in a jar, but she&#x27;s finding that hope is what she needs.</li>
            <li> She used to buy the smaller 2 oz sizes but you save a bit when you get the larger one anyway. She swears by it.</li>
            <li> Who needs make up with Philosophy skin care line?</li>
