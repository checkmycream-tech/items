    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great item!!</li>
            <li>Works great on my wife&#x27;s arthritis</li>
            <li>Great for pain relief although it does not treat everything.</li>
            <li>good quality product that works well.  </li>
            <li>I need to practice what I preach more!</li>
            <li>Does nothing my Doctor said it was nothing more than a heating pad.</li>
            <li>They &amp;#34;weren&#x27;t sure what happen.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>chiropractor said it is the best thing next to the laser&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>this has made a huge difference for me.</li>
            <li>Has helped me tremendously.</li>
            <li>One of my coworkers recommended the light therapy, so I shopped around for one that was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The unit was worth the price however after 8 months and maybe 100 4.5  minute treatments it stoped working after about 1.5 minutes it should run for 4.5 minutes.</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>So much better than the regular 630 (not Pro) that I used to have.&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li>After using this for three weeks once or twice a day on the elbow, and also on top of the arm where the muscle would get really tight, I started having pain-free stretches that eventually turned into pain free days.</li>
            <li>This really dos help to relieve pain -- it isn&#x27;t a cure-all</li>
            <li>Well made and really helped with my wrist pain</li>
            <li>I have several infrared devices that provide significant relief from joint pain and muscle soreness, but THIS DEVICE DID NOTHING FOR ME.</li>
            <li>Seems effective on sore muscles not sure if it&#x27;s the heat or the inferred or both.</li>
            <li>Wish it was more of a zap (with the same effect) instead of having to sit there for as long as (15 mins) for every spot.  </li>
            <li>you want something that&#x27;s effective on muscle/tendonitis pain, at least temporarily, I recommend a TENS unit.</li>
            <li>Did very little for myself-----perhaps I was expecting more.</li>
            <li>It kind of crept up on me slowly, not some dramatic overnight shift.</li>

            <li> Have never tried for a minor contusion, so I&#x27;ll refrain from a one star.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasted about two days before it started losing power and then conked out completely- a complete waste of $200.00.</li>
            <li> (I haven&#x27;t used it since I got it in December, &#x27;cause it takes so long, and I can&#x27;t have my dogs around when I do it!)  </li>
            <li> That seemed very reasonable so the company does stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> Not very relaxing to have to hold it as you are doing therapy on yourself.</li>
            <li> 3 minute timer, don&#x27;t feel tied down.  </li>
            <li> Or, just sit down and watch tv or read a book and hold it in place!  </li>

            <li> Duh.</li>
            <li> I had not used the unit for at least 3 to 4 months it was stored.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s just a slow process.  </li>
            <li> The added bonus of a TENS is that it slowly rehabs the affected area for longer-term pain</li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s returnable but I have to pay the return shipping...?!</li>
            <li> Will see if they stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> Then when I needed it it failed I sent Amazon and the manufacturer emails and messages.</li>
            <li> Inconvenient as it must be held.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually hate the device, but I hate spending $200 on something that does me no good.  </li>
            <li> If you are hurting desperately, that&#x27;s how you will decide to spend your time!  </li>
            <li> On a defective product?! :-(</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t actually hate the device, but I hate spending $200 on something that does me no good.  I used the device as directed and it did NOTHING at all for me.  I have several infrared devices that provide significant relief from joint pain and muscle soreness, but THIS DEVICE DID NOTHING FOR ME.</li>
            <li> Seems effective on sore muscles not sure if it&#x27;s the heat or the inferred or both.</li>
            <li> Did very little for myself-----perhaps I was expecting more.</li>
            <li> Does nothing my Doctor said it was nothing more than a heating pad. How do I return for refund?</li>
            <li> good quality product that works well.  Inconvenient as it must be held.  Not very relaxing to have to hold it as you are doing therapy on yourself.</li>
            <li> This really dos help to relieve pain -- it isn&#x27;t a cure-all but it does what it is supposed to do!</li>
            <li> It really works!  For me, it&#x27;s just a slow process.  Wish it was more of a zap (with the same effect) instead of having to sit there for as long as (15 mins) for every spot.  (I haven&#x27;t used it since I got it in December, &#x27;cause it takes so long, and I can&#x27;t have my dogs around when I do it!)  If you are hurting desperately, that&#x27;s how you will decide to spend your time!  Or, just sit down and watch tv or read a book and hold it in place!  I need to practice what I preach more!</li>
            <li> Seemingly ineffective on tendonitis. Have never tried for a minor contusion, so I&#x27;ll refrain from a one star.&lt;br /&gt;If you want something that&#x27;s effective on muscle/tendonitis pain, at least temporarily, I recommend a TENS unit. The added bonus of a TENS is that it slowly rehabs the affected area for longer-term pain relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, I had to contact the reseller after 20 days of not receiving this item. They &amp;#34;weren&#x27;t sure what happen.&amp;#34; The USPS tracking # said they never sent it. Duh. Don&#x27;t waste your time/money.</li>
            <li> I had a nagging &amp;#34;tennis elbow&amp;#34; that was causing me pain for about four months. One of my coworkers recommended the light therapy, so I shopped around for one that was reasonably priced. After using this for three weeks once or twice a day on the elbow, and also on top of the arm where the muscle would get really tight, I started having pain-free stretches that eventually turned into pain free days. It kind of crept up on me slowly, not some dramatic overnight shift. I would recommend this device.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  3 minute timer, don&#x27;t feel tied down.  Does help pain in my back, hip and knee.  Recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Works great on my wife&#x27;s arthritis</li>
            <li> Has helped me tremendously. I have plantar fasciitis and all kinds of foot pain and this has made a huge difference for me.</li>
            <li> Works we&#x27;ll on sore ankle</li>
            <li> Superfast shipping! Great item!! A++</li>
            <li> It lasted about two days before it started losing power and then conked out completely- a complete waste of $200.00. It came in a cheesey looking box with graphics from the &#x27;80&#x27;s that looks like something you&#x27;de find at a swap meet. At least it&#x27;s returnable but I have to pay the return shipping...?! On a defective product?! :-(</li>
            <li> So much better than the regular 630 (not Pro) that I used to have.&lt;br /&gt;More LEDS for faster treatment time&lt;br /&gt;I use it for three cycles twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it for pain and inflammation on a chronic&lt;br /&gt;condition &#x3D; torn posterior tibial tendon.&lt;br /&gt;My chiropractor said it is the best thing next to the laser&lt;br /&gt;treatment he does in his office.</li>
            <li> Great for pain relief although it does not treat everything. So it may or may not work for your ailment. The unit was worth the price however after 8 months and maybe 100 4.5  minute treatments it stoped working after about 1.5 minutes it should run for 4.5 minutes. I had not used the unit for at least 3 to 4 months it was stored. Then when I needed it it failed I sent Amazon and the manufacturer emails and messages. Will see if they stand behind their product. I will update this review when I get a response. Follow up the company StuffofKtown who I purchased it through Amazon denied the return basically stated they do not warranty for life. I found out if purchased through GSI there is a 1 year warranty. I called the manufacturer in Florida at 727 451-7160. They stated they would repair it for a flat fee of $25 plus shipping. That seemed very reasonable so the company does stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm on the pain and inflammation in my knee and shoulder.</li>
            <li> Well made and really helped with my wrist pain</li>
