            <li>I bought these to put in Christmas gift bags - liked them</li>
            <li>Highly recommended! â™¥</li>
            <li>I had borrowed a friend&#x27;s one day and knew I needed some of my own.</li>
            <li>I have used glass nail files many times before (made in the USA) and I absolutely loved them.  </li>
            <li>i love the bright colors, very easy to use and apply, i will probably do this again</li>
            <li>Very fast shippin very good for the price</li>
            <li>So far they work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I love these kind of files</li>
            <li>the grit is very fine.</li>
            <li>They were of good quality and fun colors!</li>
            <li>Very nice and at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t file my nails very smoothly either.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for and at a very nice price ;P</li>
            <li>Love these crystal files.  </li>
            <li>I need faster turn around, I&#x27;m going to order more.</li>
            <li>Ordered these for Christmas presents ~ Personally, I love using glass nail files.</li>
            <li>Love &#x27;em.</li>
            <li>WE love them.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t express how much I love these files.</li>
            <li>Cute colors, but</li>
            <li>and she love&#x27;s them .</li>
            <li>/&gt;Meanwhile, the Swissco files are a finer grain and clearly of better quality.</li>
            <li>They are of better use as a decoration.</li>
            <li>but i love them.</li>
            <li>The liner of glass look cheap!</li>
            <li>Others I have given them to have had better experiences.</li>
            <li>I love glass nail files.  </li>
            <li>For the price they are ok.  </li>
            <li>LOVE ALL THE CRYSTAL NAIL FILES.</li>
            <li>I heard that glass nail files were better for your nails, so I ordered these.</li>
            <li>Love the files.</li>
            <li>Love these crystal glass nail files.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I had some with the name Cheeky on them that worked a lot better.  </li>
            <li>These worked ok but were not quite what I was looking for in a glass file.</li>
            <li>Like comments before mine, I received 3 of the same color &amp; the files themselves aren&#x27;t the greatest, but for the price, they get the job done.</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>these are cute and funky.</li>
            <li>Colors are bright and pretty.</li>
            <li>These are a pretty good value but they tend to clog up and quit working</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t the best nail files and they did take a fairly long time to arrive, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>Great items provided in a professional manner</li>
            <li>I think if I had these first, without the comparison, I may have liked them better.  </li>
            <li>They are as pictured and don&#x27;t seem like they would break easily.</li>
            <li>BUT, after three or four uses I noticed the glass was becoming smooth.</li>
            <li>These are wonderful, never have to worry about the files wearing down.</li>
            <li>Very happy with these, and the shipping was faster than expected!!</li>
            <li>So fine with it</li>
            <li>Now all I have are smooth glass sticks.</li>
            <li>It rubs away to expose smooth glass.</li>
            <li>Great price for these glass emery boards that should last about forever.</li>
            <li>The grit on the others rubbed off to smooth glass with one use by my fingernails.</li>
            <li>Not quality files, cheap imitations from CHINA</li>
            <li>They file nicely but sometimes they file too much.</li>
            <li>The file is not as smooth or refined.  </li>
            <li>Great value, These things last forever.</li>
            <li>On first inspection, they look pretty good.</li>
            <li>: ) I love these so much ad</li>
            <li>so far they are still good.</li>
            <li>I am excited to try them.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased these as door prizes for my Jamberry Nails parties.</li>
            <li>They are a great color and work so much better than an average file!</li>
            <li>When I purchased these I was super excited to do away with my paper nail files.</li>
            <li>These work OK but are not near as nice as OPI.  </li>
            <li>I bought this set and only 2 are any good.</li>
            <li>The glass is very coarse and doesn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the Cheeky that I ordered last time.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping coming from overseas.</li>
            <li>These things wear out quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very pretty to look at.</li>
            <li>Like these nail files very gentle on all nails &amp; shapes!</li>
            <li>so much I had to keep one for myself!!</li>
            <li>They worked fine for me since I don&#x27;t file much.</li>
            <li>got them in a little over a week but great...</li>
            <li>But it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>: they come in their own individual plastic sheaths and they are double-sided.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope the quality is as good as other glass nail files out there.  </li>
            <li>Maybe people are right when they say that you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Seems like the glass particles wear right off when you use the file.</li>
            <li>Great product which leaves the edges of your nails extremely smooth with about half the time and work of the old metal or emery board files.</li>
            <li>They work great and are superior quality to other much more expensive glass files I have tried.</li>
            <li>Suprisingly good for the little price.</li>
            <li>they really don&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re not suppose to be able to file the roughness off of the actual file!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised and I received on time.</li>
            <li>I got my first nail fungus ever.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive too!</li>
            <li>I have had better quality, but you can&#x27;t beat the price for having extra files around..</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks you!</li>
            <li>These are really pretty</li>
            <li>You get 5 nail files for a very inexpensive price!</li>
            <li>These &amp;#34;pieces-of-junk&amp;#34; are straight from China!  </li>
            <li>Work Really Well; and Priced Rght too !</li>
            <li>I bought these hoping for a file similar to the OPI file that I have, which I love.  </li>
            <li>slow delivery but great product</li>
            <li>A friend gave my first one to me, and I wanted to give some to my daughters and friends.  </li>
            <li>Pretty, but don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure these are actually made of plastic.</li>
            <li>In the attached picture, the top is file is an old OPI glass file and the bottom is a brand new one from this set.  </li>
            <li>But they wore out too fast when he uses them, his nails grow out super fast</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old!!!!</li>
            <li>These in particular are a GREAT deal because you&#x27;re getting 5 for the price you&#x27;d usually pay for one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fine, you can barely call it a nail file.</li>
            <li>I also love that they last so much longer.</li>
            <li>They are not actually etched; there is an applied finish that wears off very quickly.</li>
            <li>They do a great job and don&#x27;t wear down like my regular emery boards do.</li>
            <li>Not as good hardly any sanding would rather pay 5.00 for one goodone</li>
            <li>These were even better than I had expected.</li>
            <li>fast delivery but files, I dont like them too much</li>
            <li>The grit of the bottom file is much more coarse and uneven as compared to the top.  </li>
            <li>They came fast even though all the way from China...</li>
            <li>but I saw Gianna (@nailstorming on Instagram) using a crystal file, hers was $7.00 or something for one while this was much cheaper for 5.</li>
            <li>I was very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>When you file, it rubs the sand off and you&#x27;re left with smooth glass.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend.</li>
            <li>I really like them.</li>
            <li>I found I really like them as a final step in my manicure and for daily use to keep my jams looking nice-</li>
            <li>Fast shipping,  great quality,  not happy about the assorted colors sent</li>
            <li>Thick but with a good surface.</li>
            <li>These pretty crystal nail files are so fun in their rainbow of colors and they come in individual flexible plastic covers.</li>
            <li>They arrived early and they work really well!</li>
            <li>You can use these files only once before having to replace them, in which case you would be better off buying regular nail files.</li>
            <li>The price is unbeatable, not as high quality as a Sephora file</li>
            <li>They work fine, but not sure I like them better than regular old emory boards.</li>
            <li>I gave a few away to friends and they love how their nails feel after.</li>
            <li>Even when new the do not work well.</li>
            <li>The filing is coarser then previous glass files; and the files slip out of their sleeves quite easily.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended using the glass nail files as they are better for your nails, not sure how</li>
            <li>I have normal nails and the glass rubs right off the first few uses.  </li>
            <li>So his glass files had patches of clear glass and the rest was the grits.</li>
            <li>Complete junk.</li>
            <li>do however work well on natural nails.</li>
            <li>I would advise anyone to not waste your money on these.</li>
            <li>I feel like they give a much smoother, snag-free edge when compared to traditional emery boards.</li>
            <li>Worked well, good price, failed early.</li>
            <li>I bought these looking for decent nail files that would last me longer than the cardboard ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to the higher quality albeit more expensive Swissco files.</li>
            <li>These are coated with a rough spray that wears off almost with the first use.  </li>
            <li>They are not nearly as hard on your nails as a regular file.  </li>
            <li>I have previously used an amazing glass file that got broken, and I am still using the broken end to file my nails because it does such a great job.</li>
            <li>Arrived promptly and are pretty BUT...didn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other glass nail files that didn&#x27;t wear down at all, and that left my nails really smooth and did the job fast, but I can&#x27;t find the same brand again.  </li>
            <li>They are glass sticks with sand barely glued to them.</li>
            <li>I had used a normal file for so long</li>
            <li>Kind of useless.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t file well and are too thick to clean out your nails with the end.</li>
            <li>And, I don&#x27;t have strong or tough nails.</li>

            <li> I love these!</li>
            <li> I picked my fave color and gave the others to friends and sisters and they love them too !</li>
            <li> I gave them to friends and will be getting more as prizes for customers!</li>
            <li> They work amazing and they are really cute as well!</li>
            <li> and I love the bright colors.</li>
            <li> I had a glass nail file before but lost it, it did an amazing job of filing my nails.</li>
            <li> Nice variety of colors.</li>
            <li> I bought these to put in Christmas gift bags - liked them</li>
            <li> Highly recommended! â™¥</li>
            <li> I had borrowed a friend&#x27;s one day and knew I needed some of my own.</li>
            <li> I have used glass nail files many times before (made in the USA) and I absolutely loved them.  </li>
            <li> i love the bright colors, very easy to use and apply, i will probably do this again</li>
            <li> Very fast shippin very good for the price</li>
            <li> So far they work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I love these kind of files</li>
            <li> the grit is very fine.</li>
            <li> They were of good quality and fun colors!</li>
            <li> Very nice and at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t file my nails very smoothly either.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and at a very nice price ;P</li>
            <li> Love these crystal files.  </li>
            <li> I need faster turn around, I&#x27;m going to order more.</li>
            <li> Ordered these for Christmas presents ~ Personally, I love using glass nail files.</li>
            <li> Love &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> WE love them.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express how much I love these files.</li>
            <li> Cute colors, but</li>
            <li> and she love&#x27;s them .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Meanwhile, the Swissco files are a finer grain and clearly of better quality.</li>
            <li> They are of better use as a decoration.</li>
            <li> but i love them.</li>
            <li> The liner of glass look cheap!</li>
            <li> Others I have given them to have had better experiences.</li>
            <li> I love glass nail files.  </li>
            <li> For the price they are ok.  </li>
            <li> LOVE ALL THE CRYSTAL NAIL FILES.</li>
            <li> I heard that glass nail files were better for your nails, so I ordered these.</li>
            <li> Love the files.</li>
            <li> Love these crystal glass nail files.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> I had some with the name Cheeky on them that worked a lot better.  </li>
            <li> These worked ok but were not quite what I was looking for in a glass file.</li>
            <li> Like comments before mine, I received 3 of the same color &amp; the files themselves aren&#x27;t the greatest, but for the price, they get the job done.</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> these are cute and funky.</li>
            <li> Colors are bright and pretty.</li>
            <li> These are a pretty good value but they tend to clog up and quit working</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the best nail files and they did take a fairly long time to arrive, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Great items provided in a professional manner</li>
            <li> I think if I had these first, without the comparison, I may have liked them better.  </li>
            <li> They are as pictured and don&#x27;t seem like they would break easily.</li>
            <li> BUT, after three or four uses I noticed the glass was becoming smooth.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful, never have to worry about the files wearing down.</li>
            <li> Very happy with these, and the shipping was faster than expected!!</li>
            <li> So fine with it</li>
            <li> Now all I have are smooth glass sticks.</li>
            <li> It rubs away to expose smooth glass.</li>
            <li> Great price for these glass emery boards that should last about forever.</li>
            <li> The grit on the others rubbed off to smooth glass with one use by my fingernails.</li>
            <li> Not quality files, cheap imitations from CHINA</li>
            <li> They file nicely but sometimes they file too much.</li>
            <li> The file is not as smooth or refined.  </li>
            <li> Great value, These things last forever.</li>
            <li> On first inspection, they look pretty good.</li>
            <li> : ) I love these so much ad</li>
            <li> so far they are still good.</li>
            <li> I am excited to try them.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased these as door prizes for my Jamberry Nails parties.</li>
            <li> They are a great color and work so much better than an average file!</li>
            <li> When I purchased these I was super excited to do away with my paper nail files.</li>
            <li> These work OK but are not near as nice as OPI.  </li>
            <li> I bought this set and only 2 are any good.</li>
            <li> The glass is very coarse and doesn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Cheeky that I ordered last time.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping coming from overseas.</li>
            <li> These things wear out quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very pretty to look at.</li>
            <li> Like these nail files very gentle on all nails &amp; shapes!</li>
            <li> so much I had to keep one for myself!!</li>
            <li> They worked fine for me since I don&#x27;t file much.</li>
            <li> got them in a little over a week but great...</li>
            <li> But it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> : they come in their own individual plastic sheaths and they are double-sided.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope the quality is as good as other glass nail files out there.  </li>
            <li> Maybe people are right when they say that you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Seems like the glass particles wear right off when you use the file.</li>
            <li> Great product which leaves the edges of your nails extremely smooth with about half the time and work of the old metal or emery board files.</li>
            <li> They work great and are superior quality to other much more expensive glass files I have tried.</li>
            <li> Suprisingly good for the little price.</li>
            <li> they really don&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not suppose to be able to file the roughness off of the actual file!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised and I received on time.</li>
            <li> I got my first nail fungus ever.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive too!</li>
            <li> I have had better quality, but you can&#x27;t beat the price for having extra files around..</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Thanks you!</li>
            <li> These are really pretty</li>
            <li> You get 5 nail files for a very inexpensive price!</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;pieces-of-junk&amp;#34; are straight from China!  </li>
            <li> Work Really Well; and Priced Rght too !</li>
            <li> I bought these hoping for a file similar to the OPI file that I have, which I love.  </li>
            <li> slow delivery but great product</li>
            <li> A friend gave my first one to me, and I wanted to give some to my daughters and friends.  </li>
            <li> Pretty, but don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure these are actually made of plastic.</li>
            <li> In the attached picture, the top is file is an old OPI glass file and the bottom is a brand new one from this set.  </li>
            <li> But they wore out too fast when he uses them, his nails grow out super fast</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old!!!!</li>
            <li> These in particular are a GREAT deal because you&#x27;re getting 5 for the price you&#x27;d usually pay for one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fine, you can barely call it a nail file.</li>
            <li> I also love that they last so much longer.</li>
            <li> They are not actually etched; there is an applied finish that wears off very quickly.</li>
            <li> They do a great job and don&#x27;t wear down like my regular emery boards do.</li>
            <li> Not as good hardly any sanding would rather pay 5.00 for one goodone</li>
            <li> These were even better than I had expected.</li>
            <li> fast delivery but files, I dont like them too much</li>
            <li> The grit of the bottom file is much more coarse and uneven as compared to the top.  </li>
            <li> They came fast even though all the way from China...</li>
            <li> but I saw Gianna (@nailstorming on Instagram) using a crystal file, hers was $7.00 or something for one while this was much cheaper for 5.</li>
            <li> I was very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> When you file, it rubs the sand off and you&#x27;re left with smooth glass.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend.</li>
            <li> I really like them.</li>
            <li> I found I really like them as a final step in my manicure and for daily use to keep my jams looking nice-</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,  great quality,  not happy about the assorted colors sent</li>
            <li> Thick but with a good surface.</li>
            <li> These pretty crystal nail files are so fun in their rainbow of colors and they come in individual flexible plastic covers.</li>
            <li> They arrived early and they work really well!</li>
            <li> You can use these files only once before having to replace them, in which case you would be better off buying regular nail files.</li>
            <li> The price is unbeatable, not as high quality as a Sephora file</li>
            <li> They work fine, but not sure I like them better than regular old emory boards.</li>
            <li> I gave a few away to friends and they love how their nails feel after.</li>
            <li> Even when new the do not work well.</li>
            <li> The filing is coarser then previous glass files; and the files slip out of their sleeves quite easily.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended using the glass nail files as they are better for your nails, not sure how</li>
            <li> I have normal nails and the glass rubs right off the first few uses.  </li>
            <li> So his glass files had patches of clear glass and the rest was the grits.</li>
            <li> Complete junk.</li>
            <li> do however work well on natural nails.</li>
            <li> I would advise anyone to not waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> I feel like they give a much smoother, snag-free edge when compared to traditional emery boards.</li>
            <li> Worked well, good price, failed early.</li>
            <li> I bought these looking for decent nail files that would last me longer than the cardboard ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to the higher quality albeit more expensive Swissco files.</li>
            <li> These are coated with a rough spray that wears off almost with the first use.  </li>
            <li> They are not nearly as hard on your nails as a regular file.  </li>
            <li> I have previously used an amazing glass file that got broken, and I am still using the broken end to file my nails because it does such a great job.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and are pretty BUT...didn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other glass nail files that didn&#x27;t wear down at all, and that left my nails really smooth and did the job fast, but I can&#x27;t find the same brand again.  </li>
            <li> They are glass sticks with sand barely glued to them.</li>
            <li> I had used a normal file for so long</li>
            <li> Kind of useless.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t file well and are too thick to clean out your nails with the end.</li>
            <li> And, I don&#x27;t have strong or tough nails.</li>
            <li> However this barely makes a dent in my nails, it didn&#x27;t feel like it made a single bit of difference.</li>
            <li> pretty, but very thick and did not work as a file for my natural nails</li>
            <li> The colors I got are magenta, hot pink, purple, orange, and green.</li>
            <li> The files themselves are okay, but two of mine came broken in half.  </li>
            <li> Have to be careful not to file thick nails because the rough part can scrape off and the glass beneath is smooth</li>
            <li> I had been paying almost this much money for one small crystal nail file.  </li>
            <li> Hope they last a long time.</li>
            <li> The abrasive part of the file rubs off (the part that you use to file nails), so then all that is left is a smooth, useless piece of glass.  </li>
            <li> They take a long time to ship.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to get here</li>
            <li> the etching on the PLASTIC came off immediately leaving nothing but a long piece of plastic.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last very long for being crystal nail files!!</li>
            <li> Some arrived broken, others wore out after FIRST use.</li>
            <li> Would have given 5 stars but unfortunately international shipping took a little longer than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Abrasive surface gone after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> the rough file COATING wore off leaving a shiny glass exposed.  </li>
            <li> But instead I got 2 greens, 2 purpley-pink colors and then a pink one.</li>
            <li> Just be careful how and where you store them as they can break.  </li>
            <li> works as expected.</li>
            <li> came quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These Crystal Glass Nail Files are rough and get worn down after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> After that point, they&#x27;re pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> Product is what I expected!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rip my nails like the other nail files.</li>
            <li> Overall, disappointing, and I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend them.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is shipping time.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money and the wait.</li>
            <li> Although inexpensive, not worth it.</li>
            <li> This is not worth the money since they wear out after a couple of uses.  </li>
            <li> These did NOT match the standards of the previous files.  </li>
            <li> But it seems like their sharpness wears off  a little too soon</li>
            <li> careful not to be hard when filing as these work with just a stroke or two</li>
            <li> These are so pretty..except the turquoise is green.</li>
            <li> I bought these &amp; shared a few with my husband, so that he could stop biting his nails.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for a nail file to use everyday, these aren&#x27;t the ones.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money or the wait to get them!!</li>
            <li> I have had crystal nail files in the past.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried these glass nail files you are missing out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if there is a coating on them or not as I discarded them when they stopped working.</li>
            <li> A piece of plastic with small specks of sanding stuff is chipping off with each use.</li>
            <li> They are a little thick and hard to get in the edge parts of the nail.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be etched glass files that last for a very long time, but was disappointed when they wore out immediately.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they did not live up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They shouldn&#x27;t ever get dull</li>
            <li> I use a nail file at least once a day.</li>
            <li> I have been using these nail files for at least three months now</li>
            <li> after a couple uses, the file surface wore down to the glass making them useless.</li>
            <li> They are not a good value when all is said and done.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed because I don&#x27;t like the color green</li>
            <li> But these are not very good quality, I&#x27;m sorry to say.  </li>
            <li> However, when I recieved my package two of the files were broken.</li>
            <li> 2 out of the 5 files were broken upon receipt.</li>
            <li> They feel like the grit is made out of plastic, and it does not work on my nails, even as thin as they are.</li>
            <li> I have used glass nail files for at least 10 years, and these are really bad.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that the crystal glass was fake.</li>
            <li> Bad quality.</li>
            <li> bad bad quality</li>
            <li> Am so disappointed...</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re.honestly worthless.</li>
            <li> These are the worst files I have ever used.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love these files  !!!</li>
            <li> Love these crystal files.  They are not nearly as hard on your nails as a regular file.  These in particular are a GREAT deal because you&#x27;re getting 5 for the price you&#x27;d usually pay for one.</li>
            <li> Junk.  Abrasive surface gone after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> These were even better than I had expected. Will make excellent gifts for those who book a Jamberry Party with me!!</li>
            <li> I have had crystal nail files in the past.  These did NOT match the standards of the previous files.  Yes, they worked, but not as well.  They arrived on time and were packaged well. Am so disappointed...they really don&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> Great product. Exactly what I was expecting. Only complaint is shipping time. I need faster turn around, I&#x27;m going to order more.</li>
            <li> I did not like these at all. It&#x27;s so fine, you can barely call it a nail file.</li>
            <li> fast delivery but files, I dont like them too much but it just me</li>
            <li> I bought these looking for decent nail files that would last me longer than the cardboard ones. One (1) glass nail file (both sides) lasted for only one (1) hand!! Now all I have are smooth glass sticks. Also, it comes from China so it takes longer for shipping.</li>
            <li> after a couple uses, the file surface wore down to the glass making them useless.</li>
            <li> Great items provided in a professional manner</li>
            <li> Took a month to arrive since shipped from China and arrived intact.  I hope the quality is as good as other glass nail files out there.  On first inspection, they look pretty good.</li>
            <li> Complete junk. Some arrived broken, others wore out after FIRST use. Don&#x27;t buy!!</li>
            <li> Ordered these for Christmas presents ~ Personally, I love using glass nail files. Great product.  I have been asked what I do when one breaks - - don&#x27;t know, I have never had one break !  Love &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried these glass nail files you are missing out! Great product which leaves the edges of your nails extremely smooth with about half the time and work of the old metal or emery board files. I bought two sets of 5, have given away a bunch, so I&#x27;m making converts all over the place! WE love them.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express how much I love these files. They are a great color and work so much better than an average file! as a Jamberry nails consultant, these make great prizes and incentives for my customers!</li>
            <li> These are so pretty..except the turquoise is green.</li>
            <li> I bought these &amp; shared a few with my husband, so that he could stop biting his nails. But they wore out too fast when he uses them, his nails grow out super fast so He would use them almost every day. So his glass files had patches of clear glass and the rest was the grits. They worked fine for me since I don&#x27;t file much. But if you&#x27;re looking for a nail file to use everyday, these aren&#x27;t the ones.</li>
            <li> When I purchased these I was super excited to do away with my paper nail files. However, when I recieved my package two of the files were broken. No problem, that&#x27;s probably the postal service&#x27;s fault. BUT, after three or four uses I noticed the glass was becoming smooth. That&#x27;s not suppose to happen with a glass nail file. You&#x27;re not suppose to be able to file the roughness off of the actual file! These don&#x27;t work and I don&#x27;t recommend anyone buy them.</li>
            <li> Cute colors, but these are very low quality.  In the attached picture, the top is file is an old OPI glass file and the bottom is a brand new one from this set.  The grit of the bottom file is much more coarse and uneven as compared to the top.  You get what you pay for I suppose.</li>
            <li> great vlue and perfect new condition.</li>
            <li> 2 out of the 5 files were broken upon receipt. I would not recommend this item, even at the price.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Exactly as advertised and I received on time.</li>
            <li> Nice variety of colors.</li>
            <li> I got my first nail fungus ever. I am 60 years old!!!!</li>
            <li> Not the quality I was expecting</li>
            <li> Great.  Hope they last a long time.</li>
            <li> Look great and have very good color!  They are costlier than others, though.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be etched glass files that last for a very long time, but was disappointed when they wore out immediately. Maybe one to two uses and they were no longer working. I&#x27;m not sure if there is a coating on them or not as I discarded them when they stopped working. I have previously used an amazing glass file that got broken, and I am still using the broken end to file my nails because it does such a great job. So just know there are great glass files out there, but these are not them</li>
            <li> Really nice and sturdy nail files! Very inexpensive too! They came fast even though all the way from China...</li>
            <li> They take a long time to ship. They are a little thick and hard to get in the edge parts of the nail. But they work well and they were affordable.</li>
            <li> Kind of useless. They don&#x27;t file well and are too thick to clean out your nails with the end.</li>
            <li> These are the best nail files EVER! Great value1</li>
            <li> Are the best nail file&#x27;s  I have ever seen/used</li>
            <li> I bought these to put in Christmas gift bags - liked them so much I had to keep one for myself!!</li>
            <li> File once and the ruff whatever it is rubs off. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had used a normal file for so long but I saw Gianna (@nailstorming on Instagram) using a crystal file, hers was $7.00 or something for one while this was much cheaper for 5. I am so impressed, they didn&#x27;t separate the layers on my nails, which was the biggest win for me. : ) I love these so much ad they are now a part of my 2 a week care routine. Highly recommended! â™¥</li>
            <li> I got them for my girlfriend and they arrived today and she love&#x27;s them .</li>
            <li> Thick but with a good surface. I prefer a file that can be used under the nail; why else have a pointed tip?</li>
            <li> Crystal nail files are great.  This is a great price!  I have had better quality, but you can&#x27;t beat the price for having extra files around..in the office, car, purse.</li>
            <li> So far they work wonderfully. The only downside was the wait for them to ship. But it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I was very dissatisfied. I use a nail file at least once a day. And about the fifth time using it I noticed that the crystal glass was fake. A piece of plastic with small specks of sanding stuff is chipping off with each use. Please don&#x27;t sell it anymore</li>
            <li> The filing surface is NOT etched into the glass as the description states. It rubs away to expose smooth glass.</li>
            <li> I purchased these hoping to finding a cheaper alternative to the Swissco Glass Nail Files from Sally Beauty. Unfortunately, they did not live up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Crystal Glass Nail Files are rough and get worn down after only a few uses. After that point, they&#x27;re pretty much useless. I&#x27;ll give them some credit: they come in their own individual plastic sheaths and they are double-sided.&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, the Swissco files are a finer grain and clearly of better quality. They seem to last forever - the only time I have to repurchase is when I (inevitably) drop it on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up: I would not recommend these. They are not a good value when all is said and done. I&#x27;ll stick to the higher quality albeit more expensive Swissco files.</li>
            <li> Beautifull! Fast shipping! Thanks you!</li>
            <li> I had borrowed a friend&#x27;s one day and knew I needed some of my own. I love these! They do a great job and don&#x27;t wear down like my regular emery boards do.</li>
            <li> Great price and good quality. Quick shipping coming from overseas. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> One very satisfied customer here! Thank you</li>
            <li> These are really pretty but they don&#x27;t file well at all. They are of better use as a decoration.</li>
            <li> These are a pretty good value but they tend to clog up and quit working</li>
            <li> A friend recommended using the glass nail files as they are better for your nails, not sure how but i love them. I gave a few away to friends and they love how their nails feel after. It&#x27;s also very pretty to look at.</li>
            <li> rasp wears out with one use</li>
            <li> Suprisingly good for the little price. It took a long time to get here but I was not in a hurry. Debbie</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them (so does her husband).</li>
            <li> So so! The liner of glass look cheap! But it matches with its price. So fine with it</li>
            <li> Great price, beautiful colors, worked great at my jamberry party,  thanks!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last very long for being crystal nail files!!</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t file my nails at all. They&#x27;re.honestly worthless.</li>
            <li> The files themselves are okay, but two of mine came broken in half.  They actually came faster than scheduled.</li>
            <li> Worked well, good price, failed early. The coating on mine began wearing off after a week or so. Others I have given them to have had better experiences. Who knows.</li>
            <li> Like these nail files very gentle on all nails &amp; shapes!</li>
            <li> Great price for these glass emery boards that should last about forever.</li>
            <li> I love glass nail files.  Great product for the price</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t actually glass nail files. They are glass sticks with sand barely glued to them. When you file, it rubs the sand off and you&#x27;re left with smooth glass.</li>
            <li> Bad quality. Took ages to arrive! Not worth the money and the wait. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Although inexpensive, not worth it. I bought this set and only 2 are any good. The grit on the others rubbed off to smooth glass with one use by my fingernails. And, I don&#x27;t have strong or tough nails.</li>
            <li> I bought these files for stocking stuffers. They are as pictured and don&#x27;t seem like they would break easily. They shouldn&#x27;t ever get dull either.&lt;br /&gt;But I have acrylic nails and they aren&#x27;t that great on acrylic unless you plan to buff afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;They do however work well on natural nails.</li>
            <li> Very good ... these glass files are great. got them in a little over a week but great...</li>
            <li> Very nice and at a very reasonable price.  Shipping did take over 3 weeks but package was well insulated   8/11/15  UPDATE After using the files the rough file COATING wore off leaving a shiny glass exposed.  Not quality files, cheap imitations from CHINA</li>
            <li> Not as good hardly any sanding would rather pay 5.00 for one goodone</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work.... bad bad quality</li>
            <li> Works great and I love the bright colors. Good price.</li>
            <li> They are wonderful. Especially for Jamberry Nails wraps.</li>
            <li> For the price they are ok.  Not as good as others I have bought but they were more expensive.</li>
            <li> I love these files they are the best.</li>
            <li> pretty, but very thick and did not work as a file for my natural nails</li>
            <li> The glass is very coarse and doesn&#x27;t do a good job. I ended up throwing them all in the recycling bin.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the best nail files and they did take a fairly long time to arrive, but for the price I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,  great quality,  not happy about the assorted colors sent but it does the job.</li>
            <li> They file nicely but sometimes they file too much. They&#x27;re great for the cost though.</li>
            <li> LOVE ALL THE CRYSTAL NAIL FILES.</li>
            <li> awesome product.  careful not to be hard when filing as these work with just a stroke or two</li>
            <li> These are not the same as the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon. They are not actually etched; there is an applied finish that wears off very quickly.</li>
            <li> I heard that glass nail files were better for your nails, so I ordered these. They are amazing! You get 5 nail files for a very inexpensive price! Great deal!!</li>
            <li> Love the files. Colors are bright and pretty. Have to be careful not to file thick nails because the rough part can scrape off and the glass beneath is smooth (so it won&#x27;t file in that area any longer).</li>
            <li> You only get what you pay for!  These &amp;#34;pieces-of-junk&amp;#34; are straight from China!  I have used glass nail files many times before (made in the USA) and I absolutely loved them.  I used these one time and the etching on the PLASTIC came off immediately leaving nothing but a long piece of plastic.  I would advise anyone to not waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful, never have to worry about the files wearing down.</li>
            <li> Work Really Well; and Priced Rght too !</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase for a excellent price.  Love these crystal glass nail files.</li>
            <li> I love these. I needed something nice for socking stuffers this year for christmas and these are perfect. I have one left over and I&#x27;ll be keeping it for myself. It works great, and my family and friends will love them too.</li>
            <li> They arrived early and they work really well! The colors I got are magenta, hot pink, purple, orange, and green. They work amazing and they are really cute as well!</li>
            <li> I bought these hoping for a file similar to the OPI file that I have, which I love.  These work OK but are not near as nice as OPI.  The file is not as smooth or refined.  I think if I had these first, without the comparison, I may have liked them better.  I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend.</li>
            <li> Great value, These things last forever. You will lose it before you wear it out.</li>
            <li> slow delivery but great product</li>
            <li> Very fast shippin very good for the price</li>
            <li> Would have given 5 stars but unfortunately international shipping took a little longer than I expected.  Product is what I expected!  Works well!</li>
            <li> These things wear out quickly.  I have normal nails and the glass rubs right off the first few uses.  I had some with the name Cheeky on them that worked a lot better.  Maybe people are right when they say that you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Wonderful on the nails....so far they are still good.</li>
            <li> They work great and are superior quality to other much more expensive glass files I have tried.</li>
            <li> Best nail files I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> They last and last ! I picked my fave color and gave the others to friends and sisters and they love them too !</li>
            <li> I had been paying almost this much money for one small crystal nail file.  A friend gave my first one to me, and I wanted to give some to my daughters and friends.  These were 20 percent of the price so I saved about $40.00 on the five files. They don&#x27;t have anything painted on them, but who cares about that?</li>
            <li> I really like them. But it seems like their sharpness wears off  a little too soon</li>
            <li> These are the worst files I have ever used. They feel like the grit is made out of plastic, and it does not work on my nails, even as thin as they are. I bought them to give as gifts and I refuse to give them to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is not worth the money since they wear out after a couple of uses.  Even when new the do not work well.</li>
            <li> These pretty crystal nail files are so fun in their rainbow of colors and they come in individual flexible plastic covers. They are very good nail files too.</li>
            <li> My daughter is in beauty school and absolutley loved these.  Great price too</li>
            <li> They work fine, but not sure I like them better than regular old emory boards.</li>
            <li> Pretty, but don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> work well and great for the price</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and are pretty BUT...didn&#x27;t last very long.  I have already gone through two of them!</li>
            <li> These get the job done!</li>
            <li> These worked ok but were not quite what I was looking for in a glass file.</li>
            <li> Fun colors &amp; perfect size to keep anywhere! I gave them to friends and will be getting more as prizes for customers!</li>
            <li> I just picked this up from the mail box. I am excited to try them. The reason I gave 3 stars is because I thought that I would receive one of each color like shown in the pictures. But instead I got 2 greens, 2 purpley-pink colors and then a pink one. I am a little disappointed because I don&#x27;t like the color green but I hope the quality makes up for it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do what supposed to do, file nails</li>
            <li> best nail file that I own</li>
            <li> Very happy with these, and the shipping was faster than expected!!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Cheeky that I ordered last time.  Seems like the glass particles wear right off when you use the file.</li>
            <li> Like comments before mine, I received 3 of the same color &amp; the files themselves aren&#x27;t the greatest, but for the price, they get the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure these are actually made of plastic. I had a glass nail file before but lost it, it did an amazing job of filing my nails. However this barely makes a dent in my nails, it didn&#x27;t feel like it made a single bit of difference.</li>
            <li> These are great files.  Just be careful how and where you store them as they can break.  They are the best files I have used!</li>
            <li> it is a very good product</li>
            <li> I had gotten some crystal glass nail files on Amazon before.  They were a big hit as stocking stuffer gifts.  I lost mine and thought I&#x27;d stock up.  These are not like the ones I ordered before.  These are coated with a rough spray that wears off almost with the first use.  Not worth the money or the wait to get them!!</li>
            <li> These were knock-offs.  The filer surface is a glue-on substance that doesn&#x27;t do anything.  Don&#x27;t buy them.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased these as door prizes for my Jamberry Nails parties. I found I really like them as a final step in my manicure and for daily use to keep my jams looking nice- the grit is very fine. The price is unbeatable, not as high quality as a Sephora file but I use these happily and don&#x27;t worry about loosing them.</li>
            <li> These nail files are excellent..It doesn&#x27;t rip my nails like the other nail files.</li>
            <li> They were of good quality and fun colors!</li>
            <li> I love these kind of files</li>
            <li> One for every drawer.  Works great on acrylic nails, too.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and at a very nice price ;P</li>
            <li> ...they are awesome!!!</li>
            <li> The filing is coarser then previous glass files; and the files slip out of their sleeves quite easily.</li>
            <li> I have been using these nail files for at least three months now and I love them. These glass nail files are amazing and a great bargain considering the price. I feel like they give a much smoother, snag-free edge when compared to traditional emery boards. I also love that they last so much longer. These are excellent for use with Jamberry nail wraps. They are all the same level of grit, so if you are expecting a set of different files you may want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;etched&#x27; material that files the nails comes off after only moderate filing, and then they don&#x27;t work at all.  I&#x27;ve had other glass nail files that didn&#x27;t wear down at all, and that left my nails really smooth and did the job fast, but I can&#x27;t find the same brand again.  I tried these, hoping they&#x27;d be a good replacement.  But these are not very good quality, I&#x27;m sorry to say.  They don&#x27;t file my nails very smoothly either.  Overall, disappointing, and I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend them.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t course enough to file anything.  Maybe should be classified as a buffer?</li>
            <li> these are cute and funky. i love the bright colors, very easy to use and apply, i will probably do this again</li>
            <li> I have used glass nail files for at least 10 years, and these are really bad.  The abrasive part of the file rubs off (the part that you use to file nails), so then all that is left is a smooth, useless piece of glass.  You can use these files only once before having to replace them, in which case you would be better off buying regular nail files.</li>
            <li> works as expected. came quicker than expected.</li>
