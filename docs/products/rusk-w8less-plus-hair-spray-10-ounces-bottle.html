    <ol>
            <li>The best part is no animal testing!</li>
            <li>it provides great hold without giving you helmet head!  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Great hairspray.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite hairspray!!</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray, and this the best price for them.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years; it is not sold in my area any more, so I&#x27;m very happy that I can get it through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>This is the most awesome hair spray out there - holds but flexible.  </li>
            <li>This spray has a good hold to it without a plastic-y look or feel to it.  </li>
            <li>Very light but with great hold.  </li>
            <li>Great price and the shipping was outstanding.</li>
            <li>I will never use another kind  </li>
            <li>Love this hairspray, it&#x27;s great for fine hair - it has a strong hold but without stickiness</li>
            <li>It is very light weight and can be used for hold or styling.</li>
            <li>Love the produce.  </li>
            <li>*love*</li>
            <li>And more importantly, IT DRIES MATTE!</li>
            <li>My favorite hairspray.  </li>
            <li>so provides a bit more hold.</li>
            <li>W8less is the BEST at giving me the proper texture and the hold stays for days.</li>
            <li>And it actually has a pleasant scent!</li>
            <li>So glad it&#x27;s available on Amazon because I do not see it in stores.</li>
            <li>Great product, using it for years and cannot get it locally.</li>
            <li>I, too, have had issues with clogging and the spray tip falling off a LOT , but I love this spray so much I still buy it despite that.</li>
            <li>This product does a great job of giving you hold without weighing down your hair or making it sticky.</li>
            <li>It smells great and does a good enough job, but it weighs down my curls so much, they get crunchy and stringy.</li>
            <li>Wow - a hairspray that doesn&#x27;t turn my baby fine hair to straw or make me a helmet head.  </li>
            <li>My only suggestion would be a softer scent-- as with many rusk products, the scent is kind of peppery and dude-ish.</li>
            <li>This come pretty close to the Graham Webb product.</li>
            <li>A big bonus is that it does not have an overpowering scent to it like many sprays.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I prefer the plain W8Less hairspray, which gives a very light hold that allows the hair to move but mostly come back to its style in the wind, but I also use the Plus for a stronger hold.</li>
            <li>Thanks again amazon for coming through.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it where I live</li>
            <li>Hairspray usually makes my head itch and scale if used more than once a week.</li>
            <li>Better price on amazon anyway as usual.</li>
            <li>The aerosol is really fine, so you don&#x27;t see little droplets when it lands on your hair.  </li>
            <li>Works to hold my hair while leaving a natural look.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair and most hairspray products weigh down my hair, flattening any hairstyle I try.  </li>
            <li>Despite the natural look, it actually holds.</li>
            <li>This is the first hairspray in a long time that didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and still made it manageable.  </li>
    </ol>

Unfortunately, my job requires me to have my hair off of my face every day, so it&#x27;s become a requirement.  I *love* this hairspray. The aerosol is really fine, so you don&#x27;t see little droplets when it lands on your hair.  And more importantly, IT DRIES MATTE! No more shiny side bangs plastered to the side of my head!
