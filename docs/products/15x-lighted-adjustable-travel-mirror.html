            <li>Perfect to tuck away in luggage.  </li>
            <li>This is the best cosmetic device since the advent of blow dryers.</li>
            <li>This this is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Very good lighting and magnification</li>
            <li>it is great for travel as well.</li>
            <li>It is compact &amp; lightweight; great for travelling.</li>
            <li>wise, it traveled well, being able to use it?</li>
            <li>It folds up nicely and is light-weight.  </li>
            <li>but it was an nice surprise</li>
            <li>Awesome mirror highly recomended</li>
            <li>Having a light in it is a good idea though.</li>
            <li>Good part is it&#x27;s very clear and great for travel.</li>
            <li>Good for quick touch-ups.</li>
            <li>A couple inches larger would be great!</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>This mirror allows me to see to put my eye liner on better or if there is something in my eye.</li>
            <li>There are many 10X products out there but not like this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made to be used for magnification, so I knew that I would not be able to see my whole face, so I&#x27;m happy with that part of the travel mirror.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping very nice would buy again</li>
            <li>It would be better if LED light sources were used.</li>
            <li>The magnification is way to strong.  </li>
            <li>The use of rechargeable batteries also prolongs the lifespan of light bulbs.</li>
            <li>The light is blinding because I have to get so close.</li>
            <li>I use it to pluck my eyebrows, but the light is on the bottom</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy this for the light</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to see items so much better and therefore pluck the hair very efficiently.  </li>
            <li>The magnification on this mirror is great, but it was larger and heavier than I hoped; too large for travel.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 50&#x27;s and love the 15x magnification and light of this mirror...</li>
            <li>I have to put it two inches from my face to be able to see clearly.</li>
            <li>It has just the right size and magnification for this intended purpose.</li>
            <li>The two miniature incandescent light bulbs are far from \\&quot;super bright\\&quot; as advertised.</li>
            <li>The magnification is great, however the light glares in your eyes so much its hard to see.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit large for travel, but because it&#x27;s light-weight and folds so nicely, I will take it on my next trip.</li>
            <li>This actually is a perfect size -- perhaps just a little bit bigger than my powder compact.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know y exactly ...</li>
            <li>(*) Footnote:</li>
            <li>A better solution is to power the lights with just two AAA rechargeable cells (such as [[ASIN:B00JHKSMJK Panasonic eneloop]]), one on each side of the battery compartment.</li>
            <li>This mirror is so magnified that not only could I not wear my glasses ( I do with my table top mirror @</li>
            <li>natural light from a window or a lamp, to add to the somewhat inadequate lighting power of the mirror.  </li>
            <li>I love that it will fit into my rather small makeup bag.  </li>
            <li>no more squinting or trying to look at things from an angle or going to a window to get more light as I did with my 10x mirror.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for this mirror..</li>
            <li>I was hoping to use it for a travel mirror, but I could not see my whole face in it.</li>
            <li>However, my wife tells me that you have to get very close to the mirror to see whatever you&#x27;re looking for &amp;, when you do that, the concavity of the mirror begins to distort.</li>
            <li>You really have to hold the mirror close to your face.</li>
            <li>Excellent magnification--not for the faint of heart!  </li>
            <li>my particular case, I kept this compact mirror in my office in case of emergency \\&quot;Do-</li>
            <li>decent hand held compact mirror to see you flaws.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to everyone (be prepared to see stray hsirs you have not been seeing).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The small size makes it suitable as a travel mirror.</li>
            <li>However, and this is what made me decide on three stars only, is that as far as I&#x27;ve been able to tell so far, the light is pretty poor.  </li>
            <li>*) can only provide useable illumination for around 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have read the explanation better than I would have realized it would be too small.  </li>
            <li>good magnification, but you can only use it on a very small space of skin.</li>
            <li>15X is ridiculous, you can barely see your own nose in this highly distorting, blurry mirror.</li>
            <li>A huge waste of money.  </li>
            <li>Wow talk about see.</li>
            <li>I need a magnifying mirror because I have trouble seeing up close, so a larger mirror would have been much more helpful.</li>
            <li>For the price, I should have just got the larger table-top mirror for a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty useless if you want to see more than one eye at a time.</li>
            <li>It magnifies beautifully however it&#x27;s very small and hard to hold near face and see everything.</li>
            <li>It is true that other companies carry this same product but Amazon&#x27;s price is competitive.</li>
            <li>Combined with high magnification, it gives a very limited visible area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not nearly as bright as I would like it, but I think it still will be quite usable if there is another light nearby,</li>
            <li>small and hard to see more than ONE eye at a time and light is NOT bright</li>

            <li> Love this item. I had one and it broke. Amglad I found it on Amazon. Would highly recommend to everyone (be prepared to see stray hsirs you have not been seeing).</li>
            <li> I took the travel mirror on vacation and could not have done without it.  The hotel lighting in the rooms was not adequate for applying makeup so this was just what I needed.</li>
            <li> The mirror was smaller than I expected.  I need a magnifying mirror because I have trouble seeing up close, so a larger mirror would have been much more helpful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for this mirror.. Don&#x27;t know y exactly ... Just different than I thought it would b... Didn&#x27;t send it back, though.</li>
            <li> Works great! I bought one for me and one for a friend.</li>
            <li> By looking at the product picture of this item ([[ASIN:B00367HOAI 15X Lighted Adjustable Travel Mirror]]), it is hard to realize its actual size. The unit is so compact, it fits in my palm when folded. The small size makes it suitable as a travel mirror. On the other hand, you also have to cope with its limitations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The mirror is less than 4 inches in diameter. Combined with high magnification, it gives a very limited visible area. This means you can only examine a small region of your face at any one time. Plus you only have a working distance of 4-5 inches from the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The two miniature incandescent light bulbs are far from \\&quot;super bright\\&quot; as advertised. A set of four AAA alkaline cells (*) can only provide useable illumination for around 2-3 hours. It would be better if LED light sources were used. (The same company actual offers a newer model that uses LED lights: [[ASIN:B003NRVA5Q Floxite Fl-10bst 10x Lighted Adjustable Compact Mirror]])&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my particular case, I kept this compact mirror in my office in case of emergency \\&quot;Do-It-Yourself eye surgery\\&quot; (I have problems with inward growing eyelash). It has just the right size and magnification for this intended purpose. Over the past few years, it must have paid for itself ten times over. So for that I&#x27;m satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need something for daily usage at home, you should look for a magnified mirror with a diameter of at least 8 inches. I highly recommend the [[ASIN:B001FS0HAY Floxite Daylight Cosmetic Mirror, 10 x Mag]], also made by Floxite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(*) Footnote: The battery compartment accepts four AAA cells. But the cells are actually connected two-in-parallel, in order to double the operating time. A better solution is to power the lights with just two AAA rechargeable cells (such as [[ASIN:B00JHKSMJK Panasonic eneloop]]), one on each side of the battery compartment. The use of rechargeable batteries also prolongs the lifespan of light bulbs. I have not replaced the bulbs in over 5 years.</li>
            <li> The magnification on this mirror is great, but it was larger and heavier than I hoped; too large for travel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this hardly ever!!!!  It&#x27;s really too small.  My two eyes can&#x27;t look into it at the same time.  I wish I would have read the explanation better than I would have realized it would be too small.  Having a light in it is a good idea though.</li>
            <li> This tiny mirror does magnify 15x but the mirror lens itself is so small that you lose the perspective on the rest of your face. It&#x27;s pretty useless if you want to see more than one eye at a time. I will not be traveling with it.</li>
            <li> I have to put it two inches from my face to be able to see clearly. I can only see a quarter size area at a time. The light is blinding because I have to get so close. I use it to pluck my eyebrows, but the light is on the bottom so it doesn&#x27;t illuminate my eyebrow area. It&#x27;s very frustrating. It&#x27;s well made, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it unless you have another use in mind.</li>

            <li> Perfect to tuck away in luggage.  Excellent magnification--not for the faint of heart!  Sturdier than expected.  An invaluable travel tool.</li>

            <li> I actually threw it out - didn&#x27;t even bother to give to someone because they are awful AND expensive and useless to anyone.  Really shouldn&#x27;t be selling such an inferior product on your site, gives you a bad name.</li>
            <li> This is the best cosmetic device since the advent of blow dryers. I have very poor near vision yet my eyebrows need to be plucked daily or they look like the shrubbery obstacles one sees at equestrian jumping events. After spending a lengthy time looking through mail order catalogs and numerous websites, I can attest that this brand  is the ONLY 15X magnification lighted mirror anywhere. There are many 10X products out there but not like this one. It is true that other companies carry this same product but Amazon&#x27;s price is competitive.</li>
            <li> 15X is ridiculous, you can barely see your own nose in this highly distorting, blurry mirror.</li>

            <li> Very good lighting and magnification</li>
            <li> I am 50 ish &amp; need to wear reading glasses. This mirror is so magnified that not only could I not wear my glasses ( I do with my table top mirror @ home ) could NOT see a thing in this travel mirror. My grown daughter &amp; her roommate ( young eyes ) had a hard time too.&lt;br /&gt;Size wise, it traveled well, being able to use it? Nope...</li>
            <li> It is too small.  It is very awkward to use.  It magnifies well, but the diameter is just to small.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted this for... Well, for whatever wives want mirrors. It is compact &amp; lightweight; great for travelling. However, my wife tells me that you have to get very close to the mirror to see whatever you&#x27;re looking for &amp;, when you do that, the concavity of the mirror begins to distort. Back away &amp; nothing is in focus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before writing this review I tried it for myself. Bottom line: if all you need a mirror for is to decorate your eyes, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I can use it to tweeze my eyebrows but I like to see both eyes at one time.  Good for quick touch-ups.</li>
            <li> Terrible. A huge waste of money.  Cab&#x27; see a thing in it.  Terrible product.</li>
            <li> The magnification is way to strong.  The lights do not display on areas I want to view.  I have donated it to a thrift store.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lighted magnifying travel mirror.  This actually is a perfect size -- perhaps just a little bit bigger than my powder compact.  It&#x27;s made to be used for magnification, so I knew that I would not be able to see my whole face, so I&#x27;m happy with that part of the travel mirror.  The way it folds out of and then back into the &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34; base is also very nice.  However, and this is what made me decide on three stars only, is that as far as I&#x27;ve been able to tell so far, the light is pretty poor.  It&#x27;s not nearly as bright as I would like it, but I think it still will be quite usable if there is another light nearby, natural light from a window or a lamp, to add to the somewhat inadequate lighting power of the mirror.  I love that it will fit into my rather small makeup bag.  It&#x27;ll do the job if I work with the lighting a bit.</li>
            <li> It is very small.  It will fold up to be about the size of a compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has good magnification, but you can only use it on a very small space of skin.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 50&#x27;s and love the 15x magnification and light of this mirror...no more squinting or trying to look at things from an angle or going to a window to get more light as I did with my 10x mirror.  I have used it almost daily for the last month. It folds up nicely and is light-weight.  I use it for eyebrow tweezing and removing upper lip dark hairs.  I&#x27;m able to see items so much better and therefore pluck the hair very efficiently.  It&#x27;s a bit large for travel, but because it&#x27;s light-weight and folds so nicely, I will take it on my next trip. Higly recommend.</li>
            <li> Allows you to see every scary thing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this for the light but it was an nice surprise how well it worked.  This this is awesome.  Big enough to use at home and small enough to travel with.</li>
            <li> Actually no, I thought the size was larger.</li>
            <li> Very distorted and poorly constructed</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror for my sister for one of her birthday gifts.  She likes it, but will have to get use to it.  You really have to hold the mirror close to your face. I also bought her and counter stand up lighted 15x mirror for her BD too. The Travel Mirror will be used when she travels singing in events to do touch up on her make-up.</li>
