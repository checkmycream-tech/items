            <li> SCENT DIDN&#x27;T LAST LONG AT ALL</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t last as long</li>
            <li> Brand displayed was different from the one expected .</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected the fragrance was not like that of Macy&#x27;s considered I would buy it here because of the pricing but still purchase the same product from Macy</li>
            <li> I had to resort a few hours later because the scent was barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> People who complained about this product need to READ before ordering and have common sense that at such a low price, it obviously isn&#x27;t the REAL deal.</li>
            <li> I Just purchase the original Spring fragrance from Christian Dior, and it was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is obviously an imitation!</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;re also paying a VERY small fraction of that price.</li>
            <li> I did have to put it on twice a day, but that isn&#x27;t bad at all, considering the low price.</li>
            <li> False and purposefully deceiving description of product.</li>
            <li> But gift-givers beware, if someone is expecting a bottle of Chanel they may be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Is FAKE!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> SCENT DIDN&#x27;T LAST LONG AT ALL</li>
            <li> This is obviously an imitation! But it is SO worth the $ yeah, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the original but you&#x27;re also paying a VERY small fraction of that price. Smells just like it and I Love it for an everyday use! And the shipping was much faster than stated! Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Impression of a perfume is different from the perfume itself. It may smell good, but it will never be as profound and pure as the actual perfume. in this case, Mademoiselle de Coco Chanel. If you are looking for quality, why waste money on a knockoff perfume even though it is much much cheaper?</li>
            <li> The scent is really good, but naive of me,(because of the price,) I should&#x27;ve known it wasn&#x27;t the original.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what people expect for a fragrance thats 5.00 buck. It smell wonderful. I don&#x27;t understand why you think it would smell exactly the same. If you want Macys quality then purchase at Macys. If you want something close to the real thing get this one you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> The product did not meet my expectations</li>
            <li> This is a great deal and smells wonderful. I did have to put it on twice a day, but that isn&#x27;t bad at all, considering the low price. People who complained about this product need to READ before ordering and have common sense that at such a low price, it obviously isn&#x27;t the REAL deal. But, in my opinion it is close enough. The bottle is large and should last awhile.</li>
            <li> the product not meet my expectations,I did not like that smell ,not compare whit original</li>
            <li> For 8 bucks how can you complain? Very close to the real deal.</li>
            <li> I Just purchase the original Spring fragrance from Christian Dior, and it was a little disappointing. I paid a pretty penny for it.  So,  I am going to purchase two bottle of this fragrance and I hope it&#x27;s as beautiful as other say. If not, I will not complain because it&#x27;s a still!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for me but my mom fell completely in love with it! I just bought another 2! It has an amazing smell! The scent last about 5-7 hours. This is definitely worth the hype!</li>
            <li> Almost like the original... Just doesn&#x27;t last as longðŸ˜”</li>
            <li> Is FAKE!!! Just check the numbers at bottom of the bottle scratch it and they came off.</li>
            <li> Smells SOOOOOOO Good, Light Flowery Feminine. Use it sparingly, can be heavy when first put on...But wow! Great purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> this smells NOTHING like mademoiselle Coco. Save your money-if I could of returned it I would have.</li>
            <li> False and purposefully deceiving description of product. Brand displayed was different from the one expected .</li>
            <li> After my boyfriend mistakenly ordered this for me I did some digging on what could&#x27;ve happened.  I&#x27;d asked for CoCo Chanel&#x27;s Mademoiselle Eau de Parfum.  I gave him the key words; Chanel, Mademoiselle and parfum.  I did an Amazon search for CHANEL Mademoiselle parfum and this was the result.  He probably thought he found the best deal ever.  Buyers please be aware that this is an impression of Chanel&#x27;s Mademoiselle.  That said, it&#x27;s an impressive impression.  The alcohol is a bit face forward at first.  The high notes are accurate but sweet and sticky.  It&#x27;s balanced by a lovely woodiness that could use more cling.  It&#x27;s lacking the sophistication of the middle spice notes and balanced chemical je ne said quoi of the real deal but this is a straight forward bargain.  But gift-givers beware, if someone is expecting a bottle of Chanel they may be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smell so good  is wonderful  I&#x27;m  in love  with this perfume.</li>
            <li> Recommend. very nice!</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected the fragrance was not like that of Macy&#x27;s considered I would buy it here because of the pricing but still purchase the same product from Macy the bottle looked completely different from the one I purchased here and the quality/frangrance from Macy&#x27;s smelled so much better and expensive</li>
            <li> really love the scent.  It is a close replica and some of my friends thought I had the original perfume on.  I had to resort a few hours later because the scent was barely noticeable.  You get what you paid for.  I didn&#x27;t mind having to respray.</li>
