            <li>and best of all, “I can brush my teeth all by</li>
            <li>It works perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is great!  </li>
            <li>best feature is the app for your mobile device.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>app is very good at helping you pair the brush with your device.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a very good toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a brilliant idea, though, and if your kid is used to video games,</li>
            <li>We have always been happy and so has our dentist.  </li>
            <li>I think it would be a great tool if you have a child who is not brushing well.  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare Kids toothbrush is a great electric toothbrush in and of itself for kids.  </li>
            <li>so was quite happy to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s a great thing to</li>
            <li>My kid is happy with the toothbrush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>A great product.</li>
            <li>Sonicare toothbrusshes are great, including this model.</li>
            <li>But the sonicare connected succeeds brilliantly.  </li>
            <li>Sonicare are great toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>than that, the toothbrush and the app have been great.</li>
            <li>The two speeds are convenient, it fits well in the hands of our 9 y.o. and 8 y.o. kids, and it does a great job cleaning teeth.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice toothbrush for kids.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare brand of rechargeable toothbrushes has an impeccable reputation among consumers for its efficiency and ease of use.  </li>
            <li>This is especially handy if you have more than one Kids brush in the house.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this Sonicare for Kids connected toothbrush is a great way to encourage and motivate your kids to develop a good brushing habit.</li>
            <li>Research has repeatedly shown that electric toothbrushes are superior to manual ones in practically ever way and Philips Sonicare is among the best brands available.</li>
            <li>and id say this is a good tool for that.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s a good product with a good app.  </li>
            <li>toothbrush is app-enabled, but good luck finding the app in the App Store.  </li>
            <li>To be fair this is a 1-800 # to call to troubleshoot.  </li>
            <li>With that, the connected brush is a good pic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It succeeds in its mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>of now, this is a good brush to teach and develop tooth brushing habits for a growing children.</li>
            <li>If you are already familiar with Sonicare, you know these brushes give an awesome cleaning to your teeth, reduce gum disease, and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instructions say there is an Android app available but there isn&#x27;t at this time....  wasn&#x27;t too happy</li>
            <li>It also has a nice feature on the handle that allows the toothbrush to rest on the counter (bristle side up) for a neat toothpaste application.  </li>
            <li>Having been using Sonicare toothbrushes for myself and my family, I know how effective they are for oral care.</li>
            <li>This connected toothbrush appears to be an effective tool to help do that.</li>
            <li>get to pick your own sticker to put on it</li>
            <li>and I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own any Apple products, but I wanted this Philips Sonicare Connected toothbrush anyway; they say they are releasing the Android App by the end of summer 2015.  </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, I am brushing with my own Philips Sonicare 2.</li>
            <li>You also set notificiations when it&#x27;s time to change the brush head, and you can set up your own rewards.</li>
            <li>What is another nice feature is the High/Low setting.</li>
            <li>Over all, this is an easy to use, dependable brush with good features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The kids are brushing longer and better, and enjoying it!</li>
            <li>It also walks you through the creation of a profile for your child and uses animation and music to help your child brush more effectively (via timers and reminders to hit all quadrants of the mouth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Sonicare brush head design is superior to the Oral-B for keeping the brush clean.</li>
            <li>in all, this is a great tool for getting the kids interested in brushing their teeth.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy that he brushes more consistently than before.</li>
            <li>Perfect for kids, i find the timer function to be especially helpful.</li>
            <li>Its good to make sure kids are having fun since youre trying to help them establish a habit/routine</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use the edge of the sticker, you have to use the button holes, and that&#x27;s more tricky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We are thrilled we can get this high-quality, highly effective brush in a fun, interesting version for our kids now, too.</li>
            <li>Most of the stickers feature the mascot Sparkly for customization.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that Philips didn&#x27;t inflate the price with the added feature.</li>
            <li>If you have more than one kid, well, more on that in a minute.  </li>
            <li>what if you have more than one kid?  </li>
            <li>The app supports more than one profile, so that&#x27;s no issue.  </li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s OK...</li>
            <li>It is a cute motivation for brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the low is perfect for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>son is enjoying using this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>brush also comes with many stickers and can be customized to the preference of the user.</li>
            <li>so when I saw this brush I thought it would be great for my 6 year old who did not yet have his own.  </li>
            <li>I was using my Philips Sonicare until then and was quite satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the sonicare for kids is a refreshing exception.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My son watches the image of the brush moving around the mouth of the character and does a better job brushing than he ever did before.  </li>
            <li>kids love using the app, and it&#x27;s got them to brush longer and have a more even brushing of their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a really good, useful product, that does what it says it will do, and does it well.</li>
            <li>My husband, son and I all have a Sonicare toothbrush and love it.</li>
            <li>This is the most impressive kids toothbrush I have come by....head and shoulders above the others!&lt;br</li>
            <li>When this one arrived, he was thrilled to be able to customize it, and even more excited that it makes noises.</li>
            <li>We got this brush 7/2/15 and looked all over for the supposed app, which was a feature we were very excited about.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, my son really likes this toothbrush and I am happy it gets him excited about brushing.</li>
            <li>Again, these are all after-thoughts when the most important factor is just how efficient this toothbrush is and this reviewer could find no complaints from a functional or efficiency standpoint.  </li>
            <li>You probably have already heard that kids tend to brush longer with power toothbrushes and also enjoy using them more.</li>
            <li>app works great and my 7 year old son enjoys it.  </li>
            <li>she&#x27;s still more excited about using an electric toothbrush like her parents, so</li>
            <li>My daughter was OK with fill power from first use, but its nice to know there is a gentler option available if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter was OK with fill power from first use, but its nice to know there is a gentler option available if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He doesn’t quite yet grasp the whole “mouth quadrant” thing, but he does know that the toothbrush’s cheerful beeps means “good job;</li>
            <li>/&gt;He lets us “have a turn” when he’s done, but the brush’s design makes it easy for him to be surprisingly thorough for a tiny person that can’t even button his own shirts.</li>
            <li>The grip is well designed for easy handling and easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>I am in the habit of removing the brush head and rinsing it thoroughly, but they cannot remove the Oral-B brush too easily.</li>
            <li>and so it&#x27;s easy to maneuver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(they are easily interchangeable).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun and timed, and perfect for smaller hands.</li>
            <li>When I switched to an electric toothbrush, I was amazed at how easy</li>
            <li>/&gt;They have found a way to make the experience more creative and fun</li>
            <li>My son liked the app at first</li>
            <li>app and bluetooth connectivity is cool, but we don&#x27;t really need it as our kids were taught good dental hygiene habits from the time they were toddlers.  </li>
            <li>As a sonicare goes its fine.  </li>
            <li>she will love having a fun video game-like incentive to brush.</li>
            <li>The notification sound</li>
            <li>It was exciting to start out with the stickers, but after a couple of uses it sort of fell off and wouldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; in any more.  </li>
            <li>The Bluetooth connectivity interacts with a fun app that helps kids brush better and for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a useful feature that I love about this connected toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Sonicare is certainly worth more for those added</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident it&#x27;s worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The coaching app allows the kids to interact with a mascot Sparkly and offers rewards for good brushing.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The stickers it comes with seem generic and are cute in their own way, but they don&#x27;t make it any more special -</li>
            <li>Has all the bells and whistles, even a fun app!</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I was excited to give this brush and the app a try, I had two concerns.  </li>
            <li>Even if your child is not yet brushing on their own, this combination of kid friendly features and the interesting and engaging app will get them on the right dental path and make brushing more productive and less of a chore for both them and</li>
            <li>Even if your child is not yet brushing on their own, this combination of kid friendly features and the interesting and engaging app will get them on the right dental path and make brushing more productive and less of a chore for both them and you.</li>
            <li>myself!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We’ve been using an electric toothbrush on him since he had his full set of chompers, with varying results.</li>
            <li>I started using a Phillips Sonicare myself a year ago, and getting used to brushing for two full minutes took some adjusting even for me</li>
            <li>For a long time he&#x27;s had his eyes on my Sonicare brush, and now he has his own!  </li>
            <li>For younger kids trying to develop good habits, this might work.</li>
            <li>The cool features of this toothbrush is that it connects with an app for your iPad that allows your child to interact with &amp;#34;Sparkles&amp;#34; (a purple pet) who motivates the child.  </li>
            <li>…his actual word was “good”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>feel like the Sonicare toothbrush cleans every bit as good as a rotary brush head and a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I feel like the Sonicare toothbrush cleans every bit as good as a rotary brush head and a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>These facts combined tend to make the Sonicare for Kids a pretty easy purchase decision, assuming you don&#x27;t mind the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The gradually increasing timer system is not intuitive and requires a quick read of the instructions to get the maximum out of this teaching tool.  </li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t use it every day yet and prefers to use her regular toothbrush most nights, but she&#x27;s not scared of it, and this will (hopefully) lead to her using it more as she gets</li>
            <li>The action in the video is not related to the movement of the brush around his mouth, but I think he enjoys seeing the virtual teeth become clean and the germs get vanquished (there is even a germ with a crown, kind of like a boss monster, which was a nice touch).  </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, I am brushing with my own Philips Sonicare 2.ead in water, you&#x27;ll see the action right away.  </li>
            <li>So I was very pleased to have the opportunity to receive this toothbrush, especially since I already have two Oral-B Pro 5000 Toothbrushes with Bluetooth.</li>
            <li>We use them, so I was very interested in the for kids version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the app tracks usage time and is supposed to remind you to get a new brush head as appropriate.</li>
            <li>Also, the app tracks usage time and is supposed to remind you to get a new brush head as appropriate.</li>
            <li>It’s funny!</li>
            <li>timer feature is great as we find our daughters never brush long enough and this makes sure they do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Slightly less impressive but still nice is the little whistle every &amp;#34;quarter&amp;#34; of the brush time.  </li>
            <li>It also &#x27;ramps up&#x27; from gentle to fast over the first 14 uses, which is a great way to get young children to switch without freaking them out with the vibrations/buzzing.</li>
            <li>and I often feel like I&#x27;m repeating myself, because so many of them are great hardware and weak software.  </li>
            <li>Clearly a lot of good UX research went into this, and we appreciate that this isn’t just a miniaturized version of an adult brush.</li>
            <li>The stickers are fun, colorful, and bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the app, you &amp;#34;adopt&amp;#34; a fun creature called a Sparkly.</li>
            <li>I believe the brush by itself is worth the elevated price, and the useful and well done BT feature and app add value.</li>

            <li>The Philips method seems so much closer and admittedly superior to a standard toothbrush and</li>
            <li>/&gt;The app can be an effective way to keep kids motivated to brush, and also engaged and focused enough to brush</li>
            <li>The free app, available for Android and Apple devices, is a clever design that encourages kids to brush by giving them a pet &amp;#34;Sparkly&amp;#34; which can be customized with gifts and prizes that the kids get for brushing regularly and for the appropriate duration.</li>
            <li>We have purchased the battery toothbrushes that aren&#x27;t as good, but better than a normal toothbrush when it comes to little ones trying to brush well.</li>
            <li>The stickers make the toothbrush attractive and fun, and the brush heads are soft and a little larger than the Braun electric toothbrush I use, which is also good for kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apparently since I bought it this morning a question was answered that said this, otherwise, nowhere on the Amazon listing or the top reviews mentioned this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t bring out the iPad each time because it is a hassle sometimes, but another great thing is that her brushing time is recorded and recognized the next time we open the app, even if we weren&#x27;t using it at the time.  </li>
            <li>The brushing head does a good job on a child&#x27;s teeth and my little boy says that it tickles.  </li>
            <li>The High setting is more like the adult Sonicare</li>
            <li>It is a cute concept, but I do not see it holding the interest of children above kindergarten age.  </li>
            <li>My kids are pretty well &amp;#34;trained&amp;#34; to brush their teeth, so we have not used the app.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve personally used Sonicare brushes for years, and love the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The simpler slower power heads on $10 and $20 brushes will not get that same effect, and also many kids brushes are not rechargeable and do not include replaceable heads.</li>
            <li>I ridiculed it when I first saw it.</li>
            <li>I ridiculed it when I first saw it.</li>
            <li>Their quality is so self evident that I&#x27;m not going to try to sell you on why you want one.  </li>
            <li>What is even better about this feature is for younger kids you can work them up to the 2 minute brush time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whether you use electric or manual toothbrush, the most important factor to preserve gums and teeth is to brush for 2 minutes twice daily with soft bristles at 45 degrees to the gum line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s great, because my daughter would otherwise insist on using the iPad every single time she brushed.</li>
            <li>The stickers are also a cute touch but they were kind of tricky to center and line up, and I question how long they will hold up to repeated washings before they start to peel.  </li>
            <li>Even when the fun and interactivity aspect wears off as they grow older, the parents can continue to track their kids&#x27; brushing.</li>
            <li>We only got one for our 10yr old to see how she liked</li>
            <li>It has certainly made the bedtime process that much smoother - that, and she is now brushing her teeth regularly and actually enjoying</li>
            <li>It sounds trivial, but it makes a big difference in the way my daughter brushes her teeth; she smiles every time the toothbrush plays the &amp;#34;change teeth&amp;#34; music, and gets excited about being sure that she spent a full two minutes brushing</li>
            <li>I was specifically interested in how this &amp;#34;connected&amp;#34; toothbrush would work, and I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>its Bluetooth connection to an app on your iOS device, this toothbrush is fun for kids, teaches the proper brushing technique and in the process helps them make good lifelong brushing</li>
            <li>I bought this particular brush because of the kid app that goes with it, thinking it would entice my 3yo to brush his teeth more happily, only to find out upon opening the box that it will not work with our Android phones.</li>
            <li>lot of thought went into the app, and it&#x27;s easy to use and provides just enough content and gratification to serve it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t commit on how well this toothbrush does in that regard, but I can say that when I had braces, I think this would have been better than the normal toothbrush I used back</li>
            <li>To me, this feature really doesn&#x27;t matter much to us, however, I know there are families who might be interested in using an app for kids under 10 to get them to brush.</li>

            <li>It certainly worked wonders with our children.</li>
            <li>Your kids will now have an incentive to go brush their teeth on a consistent basis while learning the proper brushing techniques and keeping Sparkly clean and happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also vibrates a distinct pattern, so if your little one has a hearing disability, they will still be able to tell when to move the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great little toothbrush that will really encourage kids to brush.</li>
            <li>In terms of the toothbrush and app pairing with our iPad&#x27;s bluetooth, it was painless and worked straight away</li>
            <li>There are cheap alternatives on the market, but the amount of vibration (brushing motion) is vastly different.  </li>
            <li>this is really a one-kid system.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, what really makes this brush is the Bluetooth feature set.</li>
            <li>And even if there isn&#x27;t much of a gap, it can even promote an opening.  </li>
            <li>when the Android App becomes available, I will eagerly install it and start tracking the results of the smaller member of the family.</li>
            <li>So when the Android App becomes available, I will eagerly install it and start tracking the results of the smaller member of the family.</li>
            <li>really didn&#x27;t think it would work well, but it did.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, the interactive part of the toothbrush keeps her engaged by allowing her to watch short videos on her iPad that show her how to brush.</li>
            <li>But if you dip the head in water, you&#x27;ll see the action right away.  </li>
            <li>When I saw this, I was excited to see Philips finally had a Sonicare for kids.</li>
            <li>8-year old has been using Sonicare toothbrush for over a year but getting him to brush consistently twice a day has been a challenge.</li>
            <li>Sonicare for kids also has lower speed / sensitive modes that can be used for kids, and you can gradually ease them into higher speed operation if the speed and power of the brush scares or discomforts them.</li>

            <li>I had been using the same set for over ten years and have been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>standard size fits her mouth OK although we may try the compact size in the future.</li>
            <li>Again, as she gets older, this may change.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can sync with an app tied to regular brushing (and timing), but that wasn&#x27;t able to be tested as this is an Android-only household, and the app is only for iPhone newer versions.</li>
            <li>This one is different from our adult model so we&#x27;ll have to buy two kinds and to replace your brush head isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>This one is different from our adult model so we&#x27;ll have to buy two kinds and to replace your brush head isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always gotten extremely high marks at the dentist for my dental hygiene - until a couple of weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The little characters looked goofy, and I thought the kids wouldn&#x27;t think it was fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 10yr old felt the High setting was too much for her</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really want a phone, iPad or iPod anywhere near the bathroom/water.  </li>
            <li>far as the app goes, well, my daughter hasn&#x27;t really taken to it yet --</li>
            <li>you have real young kids</li>
            <li>The standard brush head is about the same size as theSonicare adult version (DiamondClean, etc) but with a rubberized body that is more gentle to the young teeth and gum.</li>
            <li>in all, the app adds interest and useful features, and the connected brush seems to be about thesame price as the standard.</li>
            <li>so younger kids may do better on the Low setting until they get a bit old or if they have sensitivity like my 10yr</li>
            <li>teeth don&#x27;t have that film layer you normally see after kids brush as they never seem to get their teeth</li>
            <li>think that the blending of an interactive video with what is such a mundane chore was actually kind of clever.  </li>
            <li>With the high speed vibration, for the same amount of time spent, you get a lot more brushes.  </li>
            <li>Ok, with a little help from mom or dad, two year old looks forward to using this in the morning and evening.  </li>
            <li>so I bought a new unit with Bluetooth capability.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s new is the Bluetooth connectivity to a free coaching app for iPad, specifically 3rd generation and above</li>
            <li>Our past Sonicare brushes have held up well, so I am confident that this one will too.</li>
            <li>if first before getting a second for our youngest daughter.</li>
            <li>(it doesn&#x27;t sound like that long until you actually try to do it).  </li>
            <li>First, the beeps that meant to alert a kid to move on to the next mouth quadrant come too frequently, like every 15 or 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Other toothbrushes either have a full 2 minute timer or are manual to turn on and off.</li>
            <li>setup process is pretty simple and Philips web site has downloadable manuals, FAQ and other useful information.</li>
            <li>kids love the digital rewards they can earn through the app and the ability to feed their little monster fur</li>
            <li>head size is small, great for small mouths.  </li>
            <li>I picked this up as an adult because I was looking for an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>old set started having charging issues (understandable after 15 years)</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised that neither is an issue.  </li>
            <li>In fact, the only real issue I had was in the kids fighting over what sticker would go on the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 6 year old loves that type of thing, and though I am still doing the brushing for her, the animations that play during the brushing help her see what is going on, and the countdown timer helps her to see when the brushing will be over with.</li>
            <li>The brush head does not have a 90 day wear indicator as the adult Sonicare heads do, so you do not see when you ought to change heads.</li>
            <li>The brush head does not have a 90 day wear indicator as the adult Sonicare heads do, so you do not see when you ought to change heads.</li>
            <li>Second, the app is a bit too much.  </li>
            <li>Our 7 year old daughter loves this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My wife agrees, this is by far the finest children&#x27;s brush on the market</li>
            <li>With every brush I tried so far, it appears the brush heads between Oral B and Philips are interchangeable.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>The designers did as good a job as could be hoped for, coming up with a way to style the moving tongue without it being downright disturbing).</li>
            <li>In my experience, I usually got a lot of extra use out of the brush heads even when the wear indicator was showing, so I am not sure how much use this feature would be for the kids set, as most parents would probably not run right out and get a new $20 brush head the moment the wear indicator showed anyway.</li>

            <li>I knew we had to get more serious about brushing.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sharing this among children (each with their own brush head) that might raise some contention but there are some options within a limited color scheme (green, blue, purple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Regular is a little strong for the under 5 age set</li>
            <li>She has crazy teeth (even worse than her sister who is now wearing braces) but many are still primary so the orthodontist is waiting for more permanent teeth to come</li>
            <li>There are plenty of cheaper power brushes for kids, but none hit the high speed of the Sonicare, and that speed is a key part of the plaque removal and cleaning effect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not very heavy</li>
            <li>Sparkles also awards the child for brushing with things that Sparkles needs such as new clothes, food, etc.  </li>
            <li>It is simple and straightforward and should require little to no supervision by parents.  </li>
            <li>Her first reaction was to giggle at the vibrations, and the app is simple and intuitive enough, that she had no problem following.  </li>
            <li>There are two speed settings obviously geared toward younger and older children.  </li>
            <li>However, we&#x27;ve always wanted to get one for our younger daughters, but felt the ones for adults were not a good fit for a 10yr old or 5yr old.</li>
            <li>My daughter is 3 years old and the dentist is already &amp;#34;watching&amp;#34; 4 of her teeth (the ones all the way in the back).  </li>
            <li>the app is only for iPads as far as I can tell, so I hope Philips introduces it for iPhones and Android smartphones/tablets to widen its appeal.</li>
            <li>There are only two modes to it, not the kajillion that the flagship product offers.  </li>
            <li>as my 5yr old brushed isn&#x27;t something for me.</li>
            <li>I guess younger kids like my 5yr old might be into this, but it isn&#x27;t a selling</li>
            <li>as my 5yr old brushed isn&#x27;t something for me.</li>
            <li>I guess younger kids like my 5yr old might be into this, but it isn&#x27;t a selling</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute but a bit weird (the tongue moves naturally, which is kind of weird.</li>
            <li>First, that it would be too intense for her, and Second, that the app would be too complex.  </li>
            <li>The basics of what one expects from the adult Sonicare brushes are present but with additional kid-centric accessories such as stickers and downloadable apps with interactive games.  </li>
            <li>overall this brush is a big hit with my 3 year old.  </li>
            <li>The app also tracks compliance and will send reminders of missed brushings or short timed instances when the kids are old enough to brush</li>
            <li>She knows how long to brush and since she is messy, it is better to avoid taking other electronics into the bathroom.</li>
            <li>In addition, the Sonicare replacement brushes look like they&#x27;re a little more expensive than their counterparts for Oral B electronic toothbrushes, so this is worth considering when purchasing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has the same speed and power (in high power mode) as well as the 2-minute timer and Quadpacer (a brief signal at 30 second interval to signal to move the brush from the outside of the teeth to the inside and from the upper teeth to the lower teeth).</li>
            <li>It is designed for kids, but I like apps and digital stuff as much as any other guy, so I am not ashamed to get this version to try out.</li>
            <li>Lately, I&#x27;ve come full circle</li>
            <li>It functions as it should, if you are interested in this feature, but it seems too gimmicky; I don&#x27;t think my kid needs to be staring at an app while brushing his teeth, as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Our 10yr old feels like she has a toothbrush like her older brother, but it isn&#x27;t too harsh on her younger teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, just know it&#x27;s a large tooth brush and a little cumbersome for 4-5 year olds, but 6 on up</li>

            <li> and best of all, “I can brush my teeth all by</li>

            <li> app is very good at helping you pair the brush with your device.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a very good toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brilliant idea, though, and if your kid is used to video games,</li>
            <li> We have always been happy and so has our dentist.  </li>
            <li> I think it would be a great tool if you have a child who is not brushing well.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare Kids toothbrush is a great electric toothbrush in and of itself for kids.  </li>
            <li> so was quite happy to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s a great thing to</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> A great product.</li>
            <li> Sonicare toothbrusshes are great, including this model.</li>
            <li> But the sonicare connected succeeds brilliantly.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare are great toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> than that, the toothbrush and the app have been great.</li>
            <li> The two speeds are convenient, it fits well in the hands of our 9 y.o. and 8 y.o. kids, and it does a great job cleaning teeth.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice toothbrush for kids.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare brand of rechargeable toothbrushes has an impeccable reputation among consumers for its efficiency and ease of use.  </li>
            <li> This is especially handy if you have more than one Kids brush in the house.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this Sonicare for Kids connected toothbrush is a great way to encourage and motivate your kids to develop a good brushing habit.</li>
            <li> Research has repeatedly shown that electric toothbrushes are superior to manual ones in practically ever way and Philips Sonicare is among the best brands available.</li>
            <li> and id say this is a good tool for that.</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s a good product with a good app.  </li>
            <li> toothbrush is app-enabled, but good luck finding the app in the App Store.  </li>
            <li> To be fair this is a 1-800 # to call to troubleshoot.  </li>
            <li> With that, the connected brush is a good pic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It succeeds in its mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> of now, this is a good brush to teach and develop tooth brushing habits for a growing children.</li>
            <li> If you are already familiar with Sonicare, you know these brushes give an awesome cleaning to your teeth, reduce gum disease, and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Instructions say there is an Android app available but there isn&#x27;t at this time....  wasn&#x27;t too happy</li>
            <li> It also has a nice feature on the handle that allows the toothbrush to rest on the counter (bristle side up) for a neat toothpaste application.  </li>
            <li> Having been using Sonicare toothbrushes for myself and my family, I know how effective they are for oral care.</li>
            <li> This connected toothbrush appears to be an effective tool to help do that.</li>
            <li> get to pick your own sticker to put on it</li>
            <li> and I really liked it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own any Apple products, but I wanted this Philips Sonicare Connected toothbrush anyway; they say they are releasing the Android App by the end of summer 2015.  </li>
            <li> Meanwhile, I am brushing with my own Philips Sonicare 2.</li>
            <li> You also set notificiations when it&#x27;s time to change the brush head, and you can set up your own rewards.</li>
            <li> What is another nice feature is the High/Low setting.</li>
            <li> Over all, this is an easy to use, dependable brush with good features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The kids are brushing longer and better, and enjoying it!</li>
            <li> It also walks you through the creation of a profile for your child and uses animation and music to help your child brush more effectively (via timers and reminders to hit all quadrants of the mouth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Sonicare brush head design is superior to the Oral-B for keeping the brush clean.</li>
            <li> in all, this is a great tool for getting the kids interested in brushing their teeth.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy that he brushes more consistently than before.</li>
            <li> Perfect for kids, i find the timer function to be especially helpful.</li>
            <li> Its good to make sure kids are having fun since youre trying to help them establish a habit/routine</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use the edge of the sticker, you have to use the button holes, and that&#x27;s more tricky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We are thrilled we can get this high-quality, highly effective brush in a fun, interesting version for our kids now, too.</li>
            <li> Most of the stickers feature the mascot Sparkly for customization.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that Philips didn&#x27;t inflate the price with the added feature.</li>
            <li> If you have more than one kid, well, more on that in a minute.  </li>
            <li> what if you have more than one kid?  </li>
            <li> The app supports more than one profile, so that&#x27;s no issue.  </li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s OK...</li>
            <li> It is a cute motivation for brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the low is perfect for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> son is enjoying using this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> brush also comes with many stickers and can be customized to the preference of the user.</li>
            <li> so when I saw this brush I thought it would be great for my 6 year old who did not yet have his own.  </li>
            <li> I was using my Philips Sonicare until then and was quite satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the sonicare for kids is a refreshing exception.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My son watches the image of the brush moving around the mouth of the character and does a better job brushing than he ever did before.  </li>
            <li> kids love using the app, and it&#x27;s got them to brush longer and have a more even brushing of their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a really good, useful product, that does what it says it will do, and does it well.</li>
            <li> My husband, son and I all have a Sonicare toothbrush and love it.</li>
            <li> This is the most impressive kids toothbrush I have come by....head and shoulders above the others!&lt;br</li>
            <li> When this one arrived, he was thrilled to be able to customize it, and even more excited that it makes noises.</li>
            <li> We got this brush 7/2/15 and looked all over for the supposed app, which was a feature we were very excited about.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, my son really likes this toothbrush and I am happy it gets him excited about brushing.</li>
            <li> Again, these are all after-thoughts when the most important factor is just how efficient this toothbrush is and this reviewer could find no complaints from a functional or efficiency standpoint.  </li>
            <li> You probably have already heard that kids tend to brush longer with power toothbrushes and also enjoy using them more.</li>
            <li> app works great and my 7 year old son enjoys it.  </li>
            <li> she&#x27;s still more excited about using an electric toothbrush like her parents, so</li>
            <li> My daughter was OK with fill power from first use, but its nice to know there is a gentler option available if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter was OK with fill power from first use, but its nice to know there is a gentler option available if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He doesn’t quite yet grasp the whole “mouth quadrant” thing, but he does know that the toothbrush’s cheerful beeps means “good job;</li>
            <li> /&gt;He lets us “have a turn” when he’s done, but the brush’s design makes it easy for him to be surprisingly thorough for a tiny person that can’t even button his own shirts.</li>
            <li> The grip is well designed for easy handling and easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> I am in the habit of removing the brush head and rinsing it thoroughly, but they cannot remove the Oral-B brush too easily.</li>
            <li> and so it&#x27;s easy to maneuver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (they are easily interchangeable).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun and timed, and perfect for smaller hands.</li>
            <li> When I switched to an electric toothbrush, I was amazed at how easy</li>
            <li> /&gt;They have found a way to make the experience more creative and fun</li>
            <li> My son liked the app at first</li>
            <li> app and bluetooth connectivity is cool, but we don&#x27;t really need it as our kids were taught good dental hygiene habits from the time they were toddlers.  </li>
            <li> As a sonicare goes its fine.  </li>
            <li> she will love having a fun video game-like incentive to brush.</li>
            <li> The notification sound</li>
            <li> It was exciting to start out with the stickers, but after a couple of uses it sort of fell off and wouldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; in any more.  </li>
            <li> The Bluetooth connectivity interacts with a fun app that helps kids brush better and for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a useful feature that I love about this connected toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is certainly worth more for those added</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident it&#x27;s worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The coaching app allows the kids to interact with a mascot Sparkly and offers rewards for good brushing.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> The stickers it comes with seem generic and are cute in their own way, but they don&#x27;t make it any more special -</li>
            <li> Has all the bells and whistles, even a fun app!</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I was excited to give this brush and the app a try, I had two concerns.  </li>
            <li> Even if your child is not yet brushing on their own, this combination of kid friendly features and the interesting and engaging app will get them on the right dental path and make brushing more productive and less of a chore for both them and</li>
            <li> Even if your child is not yet brushing on their own, this combination of kid friendly features and the interesting and engaging app will get them on the right dental path and make brushing more productive and less of a chore for both them and you.</li>
            <li> myself!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We’ve been using an electric toothbrush on him since he had his full set of chompers, with varying results.</li>
            <li> I started using a Phillips Sonicare myself a year ago, and getting used to brushing for two full minutes took some adjusting even for me</li>
            <li> For a long time he&#x27;s had his eyes on my Sonicare brush, and now he has his own!  </li>
            <li> For younger kids trying to develop good habits, this might work.</li>
            <li> The cool features of this toothbrush is that it connects with an app for your iPad that allows your child to interact with &amp;#34;Sparkles&amp;#34; (a purple pet) who motivates the child.  </li>
            <li> …his actual word was “good”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> feel like the Sonicare toothbrush cleans every bit as good as a rotary brush head and a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I feel like the Sonicare toothbrush cleans every bit as good as a rotary brush head and a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These facts combined tend to make the Sonicare for Kids a pretty easy purchase decision, assuming you don&#x27;t mind the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The gradually increasing timer system is not intuitive and requires a quick read of the instructions to get the maximum out of this teaching tool.  </li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t use it every day yet and prefers to use her regular toothbrush most nights, but she&#x27;s not scared of it, and this will (hopefully) lead to her using it more as she gets</li>
            <li> The action in the video is not related to the movement of the brush around his mouth, but I think he enjoys seeing the virtual teeth become clean and the germs get vanquished (there is even a germ with a crown, kind of like a boss monster, which was a nice touch).  </li>
            <li> Meanwhile, I am brushing with my own Philips Sonicare 2.ead in water, you&#x27;ll see the action right away.  </li>
            <li> So I was very pleased to have the opportunity to receive this toothbrush, especially since I already have two Oral-B Pro 5000 Toothbrushes with Bluetooth.</li>
            <li> We use them, so I was very interested in the for kids version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the app tracks usage time and is supposed to remind you to get a new brush head as appropriate.</li>

            <li> It’s funny!</li>
            <li> timer feature is great as we find our daughters never brush long enough and this makes sure they do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Slightly less impressive but still nice is the little whistle every &amp;#34;quarter&amp;#34; of the brush time.  </li>
            <li> It also &#x27;ramps up&#x27; from gentle to fast over the first 14 uses, which is a great way to get young children to switch without freaking them out with the vibrations/buzzing.</li>
            <li> and I often feel like I&#x27;m repeating myself, because so many of them are great hardware and weak software.  </li>
            <li> Clearly a lot of good UX research went into this, and we appreciate that this isn’t just a miniaturized version of an adult brush.</li>
            <li> The stickers are fun, colorful, and bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the app, you &amp;#34;adopt&amp;#34; a fun creature called a Sparkly.</li>
            <li> I believe the brush by itself is worth the elevated price, and the useful and well done BT feature and app add value.</li>

            <li> The Philips method seems so much closer and admittedly superior to a standard toothbrush and</li>
            <li> The Philips method seems so much closer and admittedly superior to a standard toothbrush and</li>
            <li> /&gt;The app can be an effective way to keep kids motivated to brush, and also engaged and focused enough to brush</li>
            <li> The free app, available for Android and Apple devices, is a clever design that encourages kids to brush by giving them a pet &amp;#34;Sparkly&amp;#34; which can be customized with gifts and prizes that the kids get for brushing regularly and for the appropriate duration.</li>
            <li> We have purchased the battery toothbrushes that aren&#x27;t as good, but better than a normal toothbrush when it comes to little ones trying to brush well.</li>
            <li> The stickers make the toothbrush attractive and fun, and the brush heads are soft and a little larger than the Braun electric toothbrush I use, which is also good for kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apparently since I bought it this morning a question was answered that said this, otherwise, nowhere on the Amazon listing or the top reviews mentioned this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t bring out the iPad each time because it is a hassle sometimes, but another great thing is that her brushing time is recorded and recognized the next time we open the app, even if we weren&#x27;t using it at the time.  </li>
            <li> The brushing head does a good job on a child&#x27;s teeth and my little boy says that it tickles.  </li>
            <li> The High setting is more like the adult Sonicare</li>
            <li> It is a cute concept, but I do not see it holding the interest of children above kindergarten age.  </li>
            <li> My kids are pretty well &amp;#34;trained&amp;#34; to brush their teeth, so we have not used the app.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve personally used Sonicare brushes for years, and love the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The simpler slower power heads on $10 and $20 brushes will not get that same effect, and also many kids brushes are not rechargeable and do not include replaceable heads.</li>
            <li> I ridiculed it when I first saw it.</li>
            <li> I ridiculed it when I first saw it.</li>
            <li> Their quality is so self evident that I&#x27;m not going to try to sell you on why you want one.  </li>
            <li> What is even better about this feature is for younger kids you can work them up to the 2 minute brush time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whether you use electric or manual toothbrush, the most important factor to preserve gums and teeth is to brush for 2 minutes twice daily with soft bristles at 45 degrees to the gum line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s great, because my daughter would otherwise insist on using the iPad every single time she brushed.</li>
            <li> The stickers are also a cute touch but they were kind of tricky to center and line up, and I question how long they will hold up to repeated washings before they start to peel.  </li>
            <li> Even when the fun and interactivity aspect wears off as they grow older, the parents can continue to track their kids&#x27; brushing.</li>
            <li> We only got one for our 10yr old to see how she liked</li>
            <li> It has certainly made the bedtime process that much smoother - that, and she is now brushing her teeth regularly and actually enjoying</li>
            <li> It sounds trivial, but it makes a big difference in the way my daughter brushes her teeth; she smiles every time the toothbrush plays the &amp;#34;change teeth&amp;#34; music, and gets excited about being sure that she spent a full two minutes brushing</li>
            <li> I was specifically interested in how this &amp;#34;connected&amp;#34; toothbrush would work, and I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> its Bluetooth connection to an app on your iOS device, this toothbrush is fun for kids, teaches the proper brushing technique and in the process helps them make good lifelong brushing</li>
            <li> I bought this particular brush because of the kid app that goes with it, thinking it would entice my 3yo to brush his teeth more happily, only to find out upon opening the box that it will not work with our Android phones.</li>
            <li> lot of thought went into the app, and it&#x27;s easy to use and provides just enough content and gratification to serve it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t commit on how well this toothbrush does in that regard, but I can say that when I had braces, I think this would have been better than the normal toothbrush I used back</li>
            <li> To me, this feature really doesn&#x27;t matter much to us, however, I know there are families who might be interested in using an app for kids under 10 to get them to brush.</li>
            <li> To me, this feature really doesn&#x27;t matter much to us, however, I know there are families who might be interested in using an app for kids under 10 to get them to brush.</li>
            <li> It certainly worked wonders with our children.</li>
            <li> Your kids will now have an incentive to go brush their teeth on a consistent basis while learning the proper brushing techniques and keeping Sparkly clean and happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also vibrates a distinct pattern, so if your little one has a hearing disability, they will still be able to tell when to move the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great little toothbrush that will really encourage kids to brush.</li>
            <li> In terms of the toothbrush and app pairing with our iPad&#x27;s bluetooth, it was painless and worked straight away</li>
            <li> There are cheap alternatives on the market, but the amount of vibration (brushing motion) is vastly different.  </li>
            <li> this is really a one-kid system.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, what really makes this brush is the Bluetooth feature set.</li>
            <li> And even if there isn&#x27;t much of a gap, it can even promote an opening.  </li>
            <li> when the Android App becomes available, I will eagerly install it and start tracking the results of the smaller member of the family.</li>
            <li> So when the Android App becomes available, I will eagerly install it and start tracking the results of the smaller member of the family.</li>
            <li> really didn&#x27;t think it would work well, but it did.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, the interactive part of the toothbrush keeps her engaged by allowing her to watch short videos on her iPad that show her how to brush.</li>
            <li> But if you dip the head in water, you&#x27;ll see the action right away.  </li>
            <li> When I saw this, I was excited to see Philips finally had a Sonicare for kids.</li>
            <li> 8-year old has been using Sonicare toothbrush for over a year but getting him to brush consistently twice a day has been a challenge.</li>
            <li> Sonicare for kids also has lower speed / sensitive modes that can be used for kids, and you can gradually ease them into higher speed operation if the speed and power of the brush scares or discomforts them.</li>

            <li> I had been using the same set for over ten years and have been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> standard size fits her mouth OK although we may try the compact size in the future.</li>
            <li> Again, as she gets older, this may change.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can sync with an app tied to regular brushing (and timing), but that wasn&#x27;t able to be tested as this is an Android-only household, and the app is only for iPhone newer versions.</li>
            <li> This one is different from our adult model so we&#x27;ll have to buy two kinds and to replace your brush head isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> This one is different from our adult model so we&#x27;ll have to buy two kinds and to replace your brush head isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always gotten extremely high marks at the dentist for my dental hygiene - until a couple of weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The little characters looked goofy, and I thought the kids wouldn&#x27;t think it was fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 10yr old felt the High setting was too much for her</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really want a phone, iPad or iPod anywhere near the bathroom/water.  </li>
            <li> far as the app goes, well, my daughter hasn&#x27;t really taken to it yet --</li>
            <li> you have real young kids</li>
            <li> The standard brush head is about the same size as theSonicare adult version (DiamondClean, etc) but with a rubberized body that is more gentle to the young teeth and gum.</li>
            <li> in all, the app adds interest and useful features, and the connected brush seems to be about thesame price as the standard.</li>
            <li> so younger kids may do better on the Low setting until they get a bit old or if they have sensitivity like my 10yr</li>
            <li> teeth don&#x27;t have that film layer you normally see after kids brush as they never seem to get their teeth</li>
            <li> think that the blending of an interactive video with what is such a mundane chore was actually kind of clever.  </li>
            <li> With the high speed vibration, for the same amount of time spent, you get a lot more brushes.  </li>
            <li> Ok, with a little help from mom or dad, two year old looks forward to using this in the morning and evening.  </li>
            <li> so I bought a new unit with Bluetooth capability.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s new is the Bluetooth connectivity to a free coaching app for iPad, specifically 3rd generation and above</li>
            <li> Our past Sonicare brushes have held up well, so I am confident that this one will too.</li>
            <li> if first before getting a second for our youngest daughter.</li>
            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t sound like that long until you actually try to do it).  </li>
            <li> First, the beeps that meant to alert a kid to move on to the next mouth quadrant come too frequently, like every 15 or 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Other toothbrushes either have a full 2 minute timer or are manual to turn on and off.</li>
            <li> setup process is pretty simple and Philips web site has downloadable manuals, FAQ and other useful information.</li>
            <li> kids love the digital rewards they can earn through the app and the ability to feed their little monster fur</li>
            <li> head size is small, great for small mouths.  </li>
            <li> I picked this up as an adult because I was looking for an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> old set started having charging issues (understandable after 15 years)</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised that neither is an issue.  </li>
            <li> In fact, the only real issue I had was in the kids fighting over what sticker would go on the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 6 year old loves that type of thing, and though I am still doing the brushing for her, the animations that play during the brushing help her see what is going on, and the countdown timer helps her to see when the brushing will be over with.</li>
            <li> The brush head does not have a 90 day wear indicator as the adult Sonicare heads do, so you do not see when you ought to change heads.</li>
            <li> The brush head does not have a 90 day wear indicator as the adult Sonicare heads do, so you do not see when you ought to change heads.</li>
            <li> Second, the app is a bit too much.  </li>
            <li> Our 7 year old daughter loves this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My wife agrees, this is by far the finest children&#x27;s brush on the market</li>
            <li> With every brush I tried so far, it appears the brush heads between Oral B and Philips are interchangeable.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> The designers did as good a job as could be hoped for, coming up with a way to style the moving tongue without it being downright disturbing).</li>
            <li> In my experience, I usually got a lot of extra use out of the brush heads even when the wear indicator was showing, so I am not sure how much use this feature would be for the kids set, as most parents would probably not run right out and get a new $20 brush head the moment the wear indicator showed anyway.</li>

            <li> I knew we had to get more serious about brushing.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sharing this among children (each with their own brush head) that might raise some contention but there are some options within a limited color scheme (green, blue, purple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Regular is a little strong for the under 5 age set</li>
            <li> She has crazy teeth (even worse than her sister who is now wearing braces) but many are still primary so the orthodontist is waiting for more permanent teeth to come</li>
            <li> There are plenty of cheaper power brushes for kids, but none hit the high speed of the Sonicare, and that speed is a key part of the plaque removal and cleaning effect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not very heavy</li>
            <li> Sparkles also awards the child for brushing with things that Sparkles needs such as new clothes, food, etc.  </li>
            <li> It is simple and straightforward and should require little to no supervision by parents.  </li>
            <li> Her first reaction was to giggle at the vibrations, and the app is simple and intuitive enough, that she had no problem following.  </li>
            <li> There are two speed settings obviously geared toward younger and older children.  </li>
            <li> However, we&#x27;ve always wanted to get one for our younger daughters, but felt the ones for adults were not a good fit for a 10yr old or 5yr old.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 3 years old and the dentist is already &amp;#34;watching&amp;#34; 4 of her teeth (the ones all the way in the back).  </li>
            <li> the app is only for iPads as far as I can tell, so I hope Philips introduces it for iPhones and Android smartphones/tablets to widen its appeal.</li>
            <li> There are only two modes to it, not the kajillion that the flagship product offers.  </li>
            <li> as my 5yr old brushed isn&#x27;t something for me.</li>
            <li> I guess younger kids like my 5yr old might be into this, but it isn&#x27;t a selling</li>
            <li> as my 5yr old brushed isn&#x27;t something for me.</li>
            <li> I guess younger kids like my 5yr old might be into this, but it isn&#x27;t a selling</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute but a bit weird (the tongue moves naturally, which is kind of weird.</li>
            <li> First, that it would be too intense for her, and Second, that the app would be too complex.  </li>
            <li> The basics of what one expects from the adult Sonicare brushes are present but with additional kid-centric accessories such as stickers and downloadable apps with interactive games.  </li>
            <li> overall this brush is a big hit with my 3 year old.  </li>
            <li> The app also tracks compliance and will send reminders of missed brushings or short timed instances when the kids are old enough to brush</li>
            <li> She knows how long to brush and since she is messy, it is better to avoid taking other electronics into the bathroom.</li>
            <li> In addition, the Sonicare replacement brushes look like they&#x27;re a little more expensive than their counterparts for Oral B electronic toothbrushes, so this is worth considering when purchasing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has the same speed and power (in high power mode) as well as the 2-minute timer and Quadpacer (a brief signal at 30 second interval to signal to move the brush from the outside of the teeth to the inside and from the upper teeth to the lower teeth).</li>
            <li> It is designed for kids, but I like apps and digital stuff as much as any other guy, so I am not ashamed to get this version to try out.</li>
            <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve come full circle</li>
            <li> It functions as it should, if you are interested in this feature, but it seems too gimmicky; I don&#x27;t think my kid needs to be staring at an app while brushing his teeth, as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Our 10yr old feels like she has a toothbrush like her older brother, but it isn&#x27;t too harsh on her younger teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , just know it&#x27;s a large tooth brush and a little cumbersome for 4-5 year olds, but 6 on up</li>
            <li> * Read in another review that the packaging/instructions are outdated and that an Android version of the app is available.</li>
            <li> That said, I think it&#x27;s also not too babyish for a child quite a few years older than her either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This toothbrush, designed especially for children, changes the notification sound from a dull beep to a little jingle.  </li>
            <li> Without reading it first, it is hard to know the difference between beeps</li>
            <li> was a big help, though, since it gave me a sense of how long I had been brushing.  </li>
            <li> The stickers seem to be holding up even with frequent wettings and the usual sort of rough treatment that a 6 year old can offer to any regularly used device.</li>
            <li> Because several years ago I bought a normal sonicare for kids, and it was really hard to get the kids to use it.  </li>
            <li> I tried the BT app a couple of times but did not really see the benefit and just use the toothbrush one a day, alternating with a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At a glance of the app, you can see when and how long your kids brush their teeth.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve long been a fan of Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Go for a soft standard brush and I am not sure there is any evidence to back up the claims on other toothbrush</li>
            <li> The head is small enough for children but not big enough for adults.  </li>
            <li> But hey, if other parents are for it, great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customize your toothbrush wasn&#x27;t a big deal for my daughter either.</li>
            <li> only other commit is</li>
            <li> But hey, if other parents are for it, great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customize your toothbrush wasn&#x27;t a big deal for my daughter either.</li>
            <li> only other commit is</li>
            <li> /&gt;The stickers allow children limited customization of their toothbrush through stickers or sleeves.</li>
            <li> I always used an upward only stroke with my toothbrushes, not up and down both.  </li>
            <li> I always used an upward only stroke with my toothbrushes, not up and down both.  </li>
            <li> If you apply a rotary brush such that half is above the gum and half below, one side of the toothbrush head will be rotating downward.  </li>
            <li> The Philips head is simply vibrating very rapidly up and down and a tiny distance that is difficult to even see.</li>
            <li> When the kid starts to brush, there&#x27;s an animation of the inside of the little Sparkly&#x27;s mouth, showing where to direct the toothbrush and move it along to kill the little germs.</li>
            <li> However, since our preschool-age kid is going to be the one who dolefully tells friends in the future, “When I was little, my weirdo parents didn’t have a tv</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have not tried the iOS app yet, but I do not really see the need.</li>
            <li> It should be advertised heavily that this is an Apple ONLY supported product.</li>
            <li> This connected toothbrush is not much of a difference from his existing toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The app has actually made it fun for my kids to brush their teeth, although it has lengthened brushing time considerably since all of them are waiting their turn for the base.  </li>
            <li> However, that didn&#x27;t limit the enjoyment of having a &amp;#34;toothbrush like mom.&amp;#34; It sealed the deal when presented as a robotic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Now it seems to be missing from the App Store, as we can’t find it to install on a different device.  </li>
            <li> If the child brushes twice a day, Sparkles is happy but if the child fails to brush, this makes Sparkles very sad.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The app is a tad persistent and prolific in its reminders of missed brushings and other events, but this is part of the supervisory aspect of the kids set, and you can modify type of notifications to some extent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> For some reason it did not come with the handle stickers which is a pain because it looks like the 3 other sonicares on the shelf in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used regular ordinary toothbrushes until the Oral-B Bluetooth toothbrush came out.</li>
            <li> (You can also download the app and use it with any other toothbrush, although you&#x27;ll have to manually update the use.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives the child a signal of when to mover on to other parts of the mouth.</li>
            <li> My experience with other wireless health products is that connection breaks periodically and you have to reconnect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your kids use iPhone or iPad and they have hard time brushing their teeth or do not have the proper brushing technique, then this is the toothbrush for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It means that after brushing, it can just be put down on the sink or in the cabinet</li>
            <li> for use, it seems pared down from the grown-up Sonicare I have.  </li>
            <li> I would not assume the brush would hold up to frequent droppings, so if your kid is Mr./Ms Butterfingers or likes to slam things really hard against hard surfaces, you may want to hold off a bit on this</li>
            <li> Here are few other remarks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (since that was the only way to get him to like brushing), which gets expensive enough.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B brushes are less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not seen this feature yet (having used the set for less than 90 days)</li>

            <li> Although there were some slight hiccups downloading the application to the iPad, the problems were solved quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oral B toothbrushes are usually  more expensive and brush heads cheaper; Philips Sonicare toothbrushes are less expensive but brush heads are exhorbitant.  </li>
            <li> Once brushing has begun, there is the 2-minute countdown timer, with 30 seconds allocated to each of the 4 quadrants of the mouth, with a little beep to indicate when it is time to switch quadrants.  </li>

            <li> When I gave this to my 9-year-old daughter, I was a little bit hesitant -</li>
            <li> So, without it, it makes little beeps and tunes during the brushing.</li>
            <li> And if you explain just a little bit about how it works, you can see the little gears turning in their heads.  </li>
            <li> I brush my teeth without the little guy?&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Incidentally, there have been official blind split studies that show rotary toothbrushes are no better than a regular toothbrush (assuming you brush properly).  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare brand of rechargeable toothbrushes has an impeccable reputation among consumers for its efficiency and ease of use.  The basics of what one expects from the adult Sonicare brushes are present but with additional kid-centric accessories such as stickers and downloadable apps with interactive games.  There are two speed settings obviously geared toward younger and older children.  Once brushing has begun, there is the 2-minute countdown timer, with 30 seconds allocated to each of the 4 quadrants of the mouth, with a little beep to indicate when it is time to switch quadrants.  It is simple and straightforward and should require little to no supervision by parents.  The app enables the child to create a profile and interact with animated characters.  It is a cute concept, but I do not see it holding the interest of children above kindergarten age.  The stickers are also a cute touch but they were kind of tricky to center and line up, and I question how long they will hold up to repeated washings before they start to peel.  Again, these are all after-thoughts when the most important factor is just how efficient this toothbrush is and this reviewer could find no complaints from a functional or efficiency standpoint.  Research has repeatedly shown that electric toothbrushes are superior to manual ones in practically ever way and Philips Sonicare is among the best brands available.</li>
            <li> This is a review for the toothbrush, not any of the accompanying potential iOS bells &amp; whistles. It&#x27;s a brilliant idea, though, and if your kid is used to video games, he/she will love having a fun video game-like incentive to brush. However, since our preschool-age kid is going to be the one who dolefully tells friends in the future, “When I was little, my weirdo parents didn’t have a tv and I only got to play video games when we flew on airplanes,&amp;#34; he actually doesn&#x27;t even need the app to be motivated to brush with this toothbrush because of an app.  No, he loves toothbrush time now because it’s “Not too owie!” “It’s a little tickly but it not hurt!” “I like that I made it green!” (he’s obsessed with that color), “It makes so silly sounds! It’s funny! I like it!” and best of all, “I can brush my teeth all by myself!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We’ve been using an electric toothbrush on him since he had his full set of chompers, with varying results. We use an Oral-B model that was deemed “Way too hard! OW!” so had to buy battery-powered disposable ones for children to get a small brush head (since that was the only way to get him to like brushing), which gets expensive enough. When this one arrived, he was thrilled to be able to customize it, and even more excited that it makes noises. He doesn’t quite yet grasp the whole “mouth quadrant” thing, but he does know that the toothbrush’s cheerful beeps means “good job; keep going!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He lets us “have a turn” when he’s done, but the brush’s design makes it easy for him to be surprisingly thorough for a tiny person that can’t even button his own shirts. Clearly a lot of good UX research went into this, and we appreciate that this isn’t just a miniaturized version of an adult brush. Yes, the replacement heads are eye-poppingly expensive, but as other reviewers have mentioned, dental work is even spendier.</li>
            <li> Has all the bells and whistles, even a fun app! Perfect for kids, i find the timer function to be especially helpful. Its good to make sure kids are having fun since youre trying to help them establish a habit/routine and id say this is a good tool for that.</li>
            <li> When I gave this to my 9-year-old daughter, I was a little bit hesitant - I started using a Phillips Sonicare myself a year ago, and getting used to brushing for two full minutes took some adjusting even for me (it doesn&#x27;t sound like that long until you actually try to do it).  The notification sound it gives me whenever it&#x27;s time to switch to another set of teeth was a big help, though, since it gave me a sense of how long I had been brushing.  This toothbrush, designed especially for children, changes the notification sound from a dull beep to a little jingle.  It sounds trivial, but it makes a big difference in the way my daughter brushes her teeth; she smiles every time the toothbrush plays the &amp;#34;change teeth&amp;#34; music, and gets excited about being sure that she spent a full two minutes brushing like she&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Our family has been using Sonicare brushes for years.  We have always been happy and so has our dentist.  This brush is no different.  The brush comes with 8 handle &amp;#34;stickers,&amp;#34; so your child can personalize his/her brush.  This is especially handy if you have more than one Kids brush in the house.  The brush also has a timer that has 2 functions, it tells your child when to move to the next quadrant to brush and also indicates when all 2 minutes of proper brushing have been completed.  My kids are pretty well &amp;#34;trained&amp;#34; to brush their teeth, so we have not used the app.  That and I don&#x27;t really want a phone, iPad or iPod anywhere near the bathroom/water.  I think it would be a great tool if you have a child who is not brushing well.  I will update my review as needed for durability.  Our past Sonicare brushes have held up well, so I am confident that this one will too.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Kids toothbrush is a great electric toothbrush in and of itself for kids.  The grip is well designed for easy handling and easy cleaning. It also has a nice feature on the handle that allows the toothbrush to rest on the counter (bristle side up) for a neat toothpaste application.  The bristle head is substantial for all-over cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gradually increasing timer system is not intuitive and requires a quick read of the instructions to get the maximum out of this teaching tool.  Without reading it first, it is hard to know the difference between beeps .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions say there is an Android app available but there isn&#x27;t at this time....  wasn&#x27;t too happy I wasted time looking.</li>
            <li> It beeps and whistles while timing your brush. I picked this up as an adult because I was looking for an electric toothbrush. It is designed for kids, but I like apps and digital stuff as much as any other guy, so I am not ashamed to get this version to try out. It works perfectly. As an iPhone user, however, I could not find the app in the store. Although the instructions say iOS, it does not seem to be supported for the iPhone. And so, I was left without a game to use during my brushing time. So, without it, it makes little beeps and tunes during the brushing. It does stop its vibration and I am not sure why it stops, but it does it about 3 times in a 1-minute period. Then finalizes with some tune and ends. The stickers it comes with seem generic and are cute in their own way, but they don&#x27;t make it any more special - but at the same time, they don&#x27;t detract from the presentation.</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago, I bought a pair of Oral-B electric toothbrushes for my children. I had been using the same set for over ten years and have been pleased with the results. Unfortunately, they did not take to using the Oral-B toothbrushes and have mostly been manually brushing their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this Sonicare electric toothbrush and decided to let my younger daughter use it. She has crazy teeth (even worse than her sister who is now wearing braces) but many are still primary so the orthodontist is waiting for more permanent teeth to come in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The standard size fits her mouth OK although we may try the compact size in the future. The Sonicare brush head design is superior to the Oral-B for keeping the brush clean. Both children have had some build-up around the brush area. I am in the habit of removing the brush head and rinsing it thoroughly, but they cannot remove the Oral-B brush too easily. The Oral-B brushes are less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old set started having charging issues (understandable after 15 years) so I bought a new unit with Bluetooth capability. I tried the BT app a couple of times but did not really see the benefit and just use the toothbrush one a day, alternating with a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have not tried the iOS app yet, but I do not really see the need. She knows how long to brush and since she is messy, it is better to avoid taking other electronics into the bathroom.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 3 years old and the dentist is already &amp;#34;watching&amp;#34; 4 of her teeth (the ones all the way in the back).  I knew we had to get more serious about brushing.  I mean, we were already brushing, but the focus wasn&#x27;t on being thorough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was excited to give this brush and the app a try, I had two concerns.  First, that it would be too intense for her, and Second, that the app would be too complex.  I was happily surprised that neither is an issue.  Her first reaction was to giggle at the vibrations, and the app is simple and intuitive enough, that she had no problem following.  That said, I think it&#x27;s also not too babyish for a child quite a few years older than her either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall this brush is a big hit with my 3 year old.  We don&#x27;t bring out the iPad each time because it is a hassle sometimes, but another great thing is that her brushing time is recorded and recognized the next time we open the app, even if we weren&#x27;t using it at the time.  And that&#x27;s great, because my daughter would otherwise insist on using the iPad every single time she brushed.</li>
            <li> It should be advertised heavily that this is an Apple ONLY supported product. I bought this particular brush because of the kid app that goes with it, thinking it would entice my 3yo to brush his teeth more happily, only to find out upon opening the box that it will not work with our Android phones. Apparently since I bought it this morning a question was answered that said this, otherwise, nowhere on the Amazon listing or the top reviews mentioned this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like this was a scam for my money, since I would have looked into different toothbrushes had I known this. Hopefully the expensive Sonicare people will change this and get an app ASAP for Android.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My daughter is only three, but she sees her mommy and daddy use electric toothbrushes every day so was quite happy to give this one a try. She doesn&#x27;t use it every day yet and prefers to use her regular toothbrush most nights, but she&#x27;s not scared of it, and this will (hopefully) lead to her using it more as she gets older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is sturdy and has two speeds. It also &#x27;ramps up&#x27; from gentle to fast over the first 14 uses, which is a great way to get young children to switch without freaking them out with the vibrations/buzzing. The stickers make the toothbrush attractive and fun, and the brush heads are soft and a little larger than the Braun electric toothbrush I use, which is also good for kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the app goes, well, my daughter hasn&#x27;t really taken to it yet -- she&#x27;s still more excited about using an electric toothbrush like her parents, so that&#x27;s enough for us. Again, as she gets older, this may change. In terms of the toothbrush and app pairing with our iPad&#x27;s bluetooth, it was painless and worked straight away and that&#x27;s a great thing to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of note: the app is only for iPads as far as I can tell, so I hope Philips introduces it for iPhones and Android smartphones/tablets to widen its appeal.** In addition, the Sonicare replacement brushes look like they&#x27;re a little more expensive than their counterparts for Oral B electronic toothbrushes, so this is worth considering when purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Read in another review that the packaging/instructions are outdated and that an Android version of the app is available. Yay!</li>
            <li> Over all, this is an easy to use, dependable brush with good features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-The handle is ergonomic and &amp;#34;grippy.&amp;#34;  No toothbrush squirting out of the hand and into the sink!  It&#x27;s also not very heavy and so it&#x27;s easy to maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;-The head size is small, great for small mouths.  It&#x27;s thickly bristled, so it won&#x27;t hit gums with the hard plastic edges the way that I&#x27;ve noticed some of these brushes can.&lt;br /&gt;- It has an auto-off feature.  This is great!  It means that after brushing, it can just be put down on the sink or in the cabinet and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the batteries draining.&lt;br /&gt;- Along the same lines, the battery stays charged for quite a while on one overnight charging session.&lt;br /&gt;- Slightly less impressive but still nice is the little whistle every &amp;#34;quarter&amp;#34; of the brush time.  It also vibrates a distinct pattern, so if your little one has a hearing disability, they will still be able to tell when to move the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The sticker panel just doesn&#x27;t stay on, in our experience.  It was exciting to start out with the stickers, but after a couple of uses it sort of fell off and wouldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; in any more.  No big, the brush still works.&lt;br /&gt;- The stickers are a bit difficult to place correctly.  You can&#x27;t use the edge of the sticker, you have to use the button holes, and that&#x27;s more tricky.&lt;br /&gt;- WHERE is the app?  We got this brush 7/2/15 and looked all over for the supposed app, which was a feature we were very excited about.  Nowhere to be found.</li>
            <li> My second grader loves this toothbrush! In every sense, she gets to make it her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush comes with a set of stickers to apply to a faceplate. The stickers are fun, colorful, and bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best feature is the app for your mobile device. In the app, you &amp;#34;adopt&amp;#34; a fun creature called a Sparkly. The Sparkly gets taken care of (fed) every time you brush. There are visual reminders to brush morning and night. The morning sun is grayed out and frowning until you brush, then it becomes colored and smiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I have used Sonicare brushes ourselves for years. We are thrilled we can get this high-quality, highly effective brush in a fun, interesting version for our kids now, too.</li>
            <li> My middle schooler loves using this toothbrush.  For a long time he&#x27;s had his eyes on my Sonicare brush, and now he has his own!  I&#x27;ve personally used Sonicare brushes for years, and love the toothbrush.  With the high speed vibration, for the same amount of time spent, you get a lot more brushes.  The vibration also helps to loosen up stuff (no need to get into graphic descriptions here) for cleaner teeth and gum.  There are cheap alternatives on the market, but the amount of vibration (brushing motion) is vastly different.  Sonicare is definitely my preferred choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it will not do is replace flossing.  You still need to floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The app and bluetooth connectivity is cool, but we don&#x27;t really need it as our kids were taught good dental hygiene habits from the time they were toddlers.  For younger kids trying to develop good habits, this might work.</li>
            <li> This is basically the same as the current Sonicare for Kids rechargeable toothbrush with the addition of Bluetooth connectivity. You get the same speed of up to 31,000 brush strokes/min, 2 power modes, KidTimer and Quadpacer features. The Bluetooth connectivity interacts with a fun app that helps kids brush better and for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 8-year old has been using Sonicare toothbrush for over a year but getting him to brush consistently twice a day has been a challenge. This connected toothbrush is not much of a difference from his existing toothbrush. It has the same speed and power (in high power mode) as well as the 2-minute timer and Quadpacer (a brief signal at 30 second interval to signal to move the brush from the outside of the teeth to the inside and from the upper teeth to the lower teeth). What&#x27;s new is the Bluetooth connectivity to a free coaching app for iPad, specifically 3rd generation and above (Android app is said to be coming soon). The coaching app allows the kids to interact with a mascot Sparkly and offers rewards for good brushing. Your kids will now have an incentive to go brush their teeth on a consistent basis while learning the proper brushing techniques and keeping Sparkly clean and happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a useful feature that I love about this connected toothbrush. It automatically keeps track of and helps you evaluate your kid&#x27;s brushing habits. At a glance of the app, you can see when and how long your kids brush their teeth. You don&#x27;t need to run the app when they are brushing. The toothbrush automatically keeps track of and storing up to 20 brushing sessions in its internal memory. You&#x27;ll have to sync it with the app at least once a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare for Kids Connected Rechargeable toothbrush comes with a recharger base, 8 handle stickers, 2 bonus sticker sheets and a standard brush head. Most of the stickers feature the mascot Sparkly for customization. The standard brush head is about the same size as theSonicare adult version (DiamondClean, etc) but with a rubberized body that is more gentle to the young teeth and gum. If you are buying this toothbrush for a kid of age 3-7, you&#x27;ll need to purchase a smaller, compact size brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this Sonicare for Kids connected toothbrush is a great way to encourage and motivate your kids to develop a good brushing habit. Having been using Sonicare toothbrushes for myself and my family, I know how effective they are for oral care. However, getting the younger kids to brush their teeth can be a difficult challenge by itself. This connected toothbrush appears to be an effective tool to help do that. The kids get to interact with Sparkly and get rewarded while developing their brushing techniques and habits. Even when the fun and interactivity aspect wears off as they grow older, the parents can continue to track their kids&#x27; brushing. This toothbrush is supposed to retail for $50, same price as the current Sonicare for Kids sans Bluetooth. I&#x27;m glad that Philips didn&#x27;t inflate the price with the added feature. My kid is happy with the toothbrush and I&#x27;m happy that he brushes more consistently than before.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve long been a fan of Sonicare.  I think the advantages of a system like this definitely justify the price point.  I especially like that there&#x27;s now a kid&#x27;s version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to start with, out of the box this is really a one-kid system.  If you have more than one kid, well, more on that in a minute.  In a nutshell, the package has some stickers with which your kid can decorate the base, a second base plate (for when your kid gets tired of the sticker he put on the base), a brush head, and a charger.  The value add here is the app (either iOS or Android) that communicates with the brush via Bluetooth.  Yes, this is a Bluetooth-enabled toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The app is very good at helping you pair the brush with your device.  It also walks you through the creation of a profile for your child and uses animation and music to help your child brush more effectively (via timers and reminders to hit all quadrants of the mouth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what if you have more than one kid?  Well, you&#x27;ll want to purchase extra brush heads (they are easily interchangeable).  The app supports more than one profile, so that&#x27;s no issue.  In fact, the only real issue I had was in the kids fighting over what sticker would go on the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for use, it seems pared down from the grown-up Sonicare I have.  There are only two modes to it, not the kajillion that the flagship product offers.  And that&#x27;s OK...no point in baffling the kids.  The app has actually made it fun for my kids to brush their teeth, although it has lengthened brushing time considerably since all of them are waiting their turn for the base.  Still, it&#x27;s a good product with a good app.  I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Ok, with a little help from mom or dad, two year old looks forward to using this in the morning and evening.  &amp;#34;It tickles&amp;#34;.  Something that actually engages them to want to brush.  And if you explain just a little bit about how it works, you can see the little gears turning in their heads.  A great product.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice toothbrush for kids.  The head is small enough for children but not big enough for adults.  The brushing head does a good job on a child&#x27;s teeth and my little boy says that it tickles.  The cool features of this toothbrush is that it connects with an app for your iPad that allows your child to interact with &amp;#34;Sparkles&amp;#34; (a purple pet) who motivates the child.  If the child brushes twice a day, Sparkles is happy but if the child fails to brush, this makes Sparkles very sad.  Sparkles also awards the child for brushing with things that Sparkles needs such as new clothes, food, etc.  It is a cute motivation for brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a very good toothbrush.  The app makes it motivating for the child to brush.  I am very impressed with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great little toothbrush that will really encourage kids to brush. It&#x27;s fun and timed, and perfect for smaller hands. There are two speeds:  low and a regular. Regular is a little strong for the under 5 age set but the low is perfect for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can sync with an app tied to regular brushing (and timing), but that wasn&#x27;t able to be tested as this is an Android-only household, and the app is only for iPhone newer versions. However, that didn&#x27;t limit the enjoyment of having a &amp;#34;toothbrush like mom.&amp;#34; It sealed the deal when presented as a robotic toothbrush. Stickers also help.</li>
            <li> Electric toothbrushes make a world of difference.  When I switched to an electric toothbrush, I was amazed at how easy my next dental cleaning went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son is enjoying using this toothbrush.  He says it tickles on his lips.  He also said  it feels like it cleans well…his actual word was “good”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get to pick your own sticker to put on it and it comes with extra stickers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is app-enabled, but good luck finding the app in the App Store.  My wife and I both searched for Brush Busters, Sonicare, Philips, and combinations of these.  We finally found the Brush Busters app. Now it seems to be missing from the App Store, as we can’t find it to install on a different device.  I am not sure what is going on there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush has multiple timers for properly brushing your teeth and also provides rewards for brushing.  These rewards are motivating and reminding my son to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my son really likes this toothbrush and I am happy it gets him excited about brushing.</li>
            <li> If you are already familiar with Sonicare, you know these brushes give an awesome cleaning to your teeth, reduce gum disease, and are easy to use. You probably have already heard that kids tend to brush longer with power toothbrushes and also enjoy using them more. These facts combined tend to make the Sonicare for Kids a pretty easy purchase decision, assuming you don&#x27;t mind the price. There are plenty of cheaper power brushes for kids, but none hit the high speed of the Sonicare, and that speed is a key part of the plaque removal and cleaning effect. The simpler slower power heads on $10 and $20 brushes will not get that same effect, and also many kids brushes are not rechargeable and do not include replaceable heads. Sonicare is certainly worth more for those added features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, what really makes this brush is the Bluetooth feature set. The free app, available for Android and Apple devices, is a clever design that encourages kids to brush by giving them a pet &amp;#34;Sparkly&amp;#34; which can be customized with gifts and prizes that the kids get for brushing regularly and for the appropriate duration. My 6 year old loves that type of thing, and though I am still doing the brushing for her, the animations that play during the brushing help her see what is going on, and the countdown timer helps her to see when the brushing will be over with. Finally, the one or several gifts at the end of the brushing are anticipated by her, so she can use them to feed the Sparkly, dress it up, change colors etc. The app also tracks compliance and will send reminders of missed brushings or short timed instances when the kids are old enough to brush independently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush also comes with many stickers and can be customized to the preference of the user. The stickers seem to be holding up even with frequent wettings and the usual sort of rough treatment that a 6 year old can offer to any regularly used device. I would not assume the brush would hold up to frequent droppings, so if your kid is Mr./Ms Butterfingers or likes to slam things really hard against hard surfaces, you may want to hold off a bit on this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare for kids also has lower speed / sensitive modes that can be used for kids, and you can gradually ease them into higher speed operation if the speed and power of the brush scares or discomforts them. My daughter was OK with fill power from first use, but its nice to know there is a gentler option available if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are few complaints. The brush head does not have a 90 day wear indicator as the adult Sonicare heads do, so you do not see when you ought to change heads. In my experience, I usually got a lot of extra use out of the brush heads even when the wear indicator was showing, so I am not sure how much use this feature would be for the kids set, as most parents would probably not run right out and get a new $20 brush head the moment the wear indicator showed anyway. Also, the app tracks usage time and is supposed to remind you to get a new brush head as appropriate. I have not seen this feature yet (having used the set for less than 90 days) but I have no doubt that it will function as indicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The app is a tad persistent and prolific in its reminders of missed brushings and other events, but this is part of the supervisory aspect of the kids set, and you can modify type of notifications to some extent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned, the Sonicare for Kids is not cheap, and the replacement heads are also expensive. I believe the brush by itself is worth the elevated price, and the useful and well done BT feature and app add value. Even if your child is not yet brushing on their own, this combination of kid friendly features and the interesting and engaging app will get them on the right dental path and make brushing more productive and less of a chore for both them and you.uent droppings, so if your kid is Mr./Ms Butterfingers or likes to slam things really hard against hard surfaces, you may want to hold off a bit on this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare for kids also has lower speed / sensitive modes that can be used for kids, and you can gradually ease them into higher speed operation if the speed and power of the brush scares or discomforts them.

            <li> Almost everyone in our house uses a sonicare so when I saw this brush I thought it would be great for my 6 year old who did not yet have his own.  As a sonicare goes its fine.  For some reason it did not come with the handle stickers which is a pain because it looks like the 3 other sonicares on the shelf in the bathroom.  My son liked the app at first but it seemed to disconnect or not connect often so he got frustrated with it and said, &amp;#34;Can I brush my teeth without the little guy?&amp;#34;.  To be fair this is a 1-800 # to call to troubleshoot.  I have not called yet.</li>
            <li> Seven months ago, I bought a Philips Sonicare 2 Series Plaque Control Rechargeable Toothbrush and I really liked it.  So I was very pleased to have the opportunity to receive this toothbrush, especially since I already have two Oral-B Pro 5000 Toothbrushes with Bluetooth. Lately, I&#x27;ve come full circle and I only use my Philips Sonicare toothbrush. I&#x27;ll explain why later. I don&#x27;t own any Apple products, but I wanted this Philips Sonicare Connected toothbrush anyway; they say they are releasing the Android App by the end of summer 2015.  So that gives them until September 22nd.  I&#x27;m confident it&#x27;s worth the wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, rotary versus short stroke vibration toothbrushes:  I&#x27;ve used regular ordinary toothbrushes until the Oral-B Bluetooth toothbrush came out. And I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten it except that my daughter gave them to me as a gift.  I was using my Philips Sonicare until then and was quite satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always gotten extremely high marks at the dentist for my dental hygiene - until a couple of weeks ago.  I was astonished to learn I had a gum infection and a fairly serious one at that. How could this happen when I floss a minimum of three times a day and brush immediately after every meal - and even use a Bluetooth toothbrush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have my theory - unproven as it may be.  If you apply a rotary brush such that half is above the gum and half below, one side of the toothbrush head will be rotating downward.  And if there is any gap at all between the tooth and gum line, it will simply shove whatever is on the tooth into the crevice leaving the potential for infection. And even if there isn&#x27;t much of a gap, it can even promote an opening.  Again, this is my theory, but the engineer in me says it is possible and can become a source of infection and what happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now compare rotary brush heads to the Philips method.  The Philips head is simply vibrating very rapidly up and down and a tiny distance that is difficult to even see. But if you dip the head in water, you&#x27;ll see the action right away.  The Philips method seems so much closer and admittedly superior to a standard toothbrush and what I&#x27;ve used all my 71 years of life.  I still have all my teeth and not even one cavity in 45 years. Unfortunately, now I have to add gum disease to my history. It&#x27;s cured for now, but I will need to remain vigilant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like the Sonicare toothbrush cleans every bit as good as a rotary brush head and a regular toothbrush. I always used an upward only stroke with my toothbrushes, not up and down both.  Incidentally, there have been official blind split studies that show rotary toothbrushes are no better than a regular toothbrush (assuming you brush properly).  You can find it with Google.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when the Android App becomes available, I will eagerly install it and start tracking the results of the smaller member of the family. I never in my wildest imagination thought that toothbrushes would ever be Bluetooth enabled. I ridiculed it when I first saw it. But no more.  Meanwhile, I am brushing with my own Philips Sonicare 2.ead in water, you&#x27;ll see the action right away.

            <li> Sonicare toothbrusshes are great, including this model. The distinguishing features here are the design and the app.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stickers allow children limited customization of their toothbrush through stickers or sleeves. If you&#x27;re sharing this among children (each with their own brush head) that might raise some contention but there are some options within a limited color scheme (green, blue, purple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest feature is the app and Bluetooth connectivity. The app features the same characters as the stickers (Sparklys). Each kid gets a profile and can upload a photo to th e app. When the kid starts to brush, there&#x27;s an animation of the inside of the little Sparkly&#x27;s mouth, showing where to direct the toothbrush and move it along to kill the little germs. It&#x27;s cute but a bit weird (the tongue moves naturally, which is kind of weird. The designers did as good a job as could be hoped for, coming up with a way to style the moving tongue without it being downright disturbing). When you finish, you get a prize, and you earn prizes towards achievements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The app can be an effective way to keep kids motivated to brush, and also engaged and focused enough to brush properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the parent, it&#x27;s helpful because you&#x27;ll get alerts when the kid misses a brushing (you can set times). You also set notificiations when it&#x27;s time to change the brush head, and you can set up your own rewards. The brush doesn&#x27;t have to be connected each time its used: you can sync up every few days. (You can also download the app and use it with any other toothbrush, although you&#x27;ll have to manually update the use.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of thought went into the app, and it&#x27;s easy to use and provides just enough content and gratification to serve it&#x27;s purpose. An improvement would be to offer some variety in the brushing animation, just to mix it up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the app adds interest and useful features, and the connected brush seems to be about thesame price as the standard. With that, the connected brush is a good pic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it seems  that this burhs</li>
            <li> I use a sonicare all the time, for years.  Their quality is so self evident that I&#x27;m not going to try to sell you on why you want one.  You can read glowing reviews on that already.  I was specifically interested in how this &amp;#34;connected&amp;#34; toothbrush would work, and I was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I write reviews of Hardware+software combination products regularly and I often feel like I&#x27;m repeating myself, because so many of them are great hardware and weak software.  But the sonicare for kids is a refreshing exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sonicare for kids app works great and my 7 year old son enjoys it.  It succeeds in its mission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I know this?  Because several years ago I bought a normal sonicare for kids, and it was really hard to get the kids to use it.  They preferred manual toothbrushes.  So I can compare the use of the &amp;#34;connected&amp;#34; toothbrush to the &amp;#34;unconnected&amp;#34; toothbrush I already own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my kids never wanted to use the plain sonicare, there were a lot of excuses.  But the sonicare connected succeeds brilliantly.  It makes my kids want to brush their teeth with the sonicare connected instead of their manual toothbrushes.  My son watches the image of the brush moving around the mouth of the character and does a better job brushing than he ever did before.  The action in the video is not related to the movement of the brush around his mouth, but I think he enjoys seeing the virtual teeth become clean and the germs get vanquished (there is even a germ with a crown, kind of like a boss monster, which was a nice touch).  And by watching how to correctly brush your teeth over and over the lesson should take root in his mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really didn&#x27;t think it would work well, but it did.  I hope they come out with support for the iPod soon, so that he can use one of those instead of the iPad.</li>
            <li> Sonicare are great toothbrushes. We use them, so I was very interested in the for kids version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea behind an app to help brush teeth seemed a little hokey (not to be confused with hockey).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little characters looked goofy, and I thought the kids wouldn&#x27;t think it was fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kids love using the app, and it&#x27;s got them to brush longer and have a more even brushing of their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have real young kids, just know it&#x27;s a large tooth brush and a little cumbersome for 4-5 year olds, but 6 on up should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kids love the digital rewards they can earn through the app and the ability to feed their little monster fur ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I didn&#x27;t like was that to just delete a profile (say you messed up), you have to create a parent account which means a login to the Sonicare Philips website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the toothbrush and the app have been great. The kids are brushing longer and better, and enjoying it!</li>
            <li> As a toothbrush, we like it.  The two speeds are convenient, it fits well in the hands of our 9 y.o. and 8 y.o. kids, and it does a great job cleaning teeth.  It seems like it comes with a lot of unnecessary bells and whistles, though.  First, the beeps that meant to alert a kid to move on to the next mouth quadrant come too frequently, like every 15 or 20 seconds.  You get 3 beeps, then the toothbrush shuts off.  Our kids are never finished brushing by the time the toothbrush shuts off, and it seems like a very, very short time.  Second, the app is a bit too much.  It functions as it should, if you are interested in this feature, but it seems too gimmicky; I don&#x27;t think my kid needs to be staring at an app while brushing his teeth, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But those are the only negatives.  This is a really good, useful product, that does what it says it will do, and does it well.</li>
            <li> My husband, son and I all have a Sonicare toothbrush and love it. However, we&#x27;ve always wanted to get one for our younger daughters, but felt the ones for adults were not a good fit for a 10yr old or 5yr old. We have purchased the battery toothbrushes that aren&#x27;t as good, but better than a normal toothbrush when it comes to little ones trying to brush well. When I saw this, I was excited to see Philips finally had a Sonicare for kids. We only got one for our 10yr old to see how she liked if first before getting a second for our youngest daughter. So far so good. Our 10yr old feels like she has a toothbrush like her older brother, but it isn&#x27;t too harsh on her younger teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer feature is great as we find our daughters never brush long enough and this makes sure they do. What is even better about this feature is for younger kids you can work them up to the 2 minute brush time. Other toothbrushes either have a full 2 minute timer or are manual to turn on and off. What is another nice feature is the High/Low setting. My 10yr old felt the High setting was too much for her so she uses the Low setting. The High setting is more like the adult Sonicare so younger kids may do better on the Low setting until they get a bit old or if they have sensitivity like my 10yr does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have kids with braces so I can&#x27;t commit on how well this toothbrush does in that regard, but I can say that when I had braces, I think this would have been better than the normal toothbrush I used back then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed my daughters teeth don&#x27;t have that film layer you normally see after kids brush as they never seem to get their teeth good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things that didn&#x27;t matter or I don&#x27;t like are the app. I think if a company is going to offer an app with their product then need to stop only offering it to iphone/ipad users. Sorry, I grew up with &amp;#34;Macs&amp;#34; and Apple has always made their products difficult to interact with other tech products. Probably the reason they almost went out of business back then. Anyway, so the app feature I could test out as we don&#x27;t use any Apple products in our home. We are totally android based so until an app is offered in the android market, we won&#x27;t be testing the app feature, if at all. To me, this feature really doesn&#x27;t matter much to us, however, I know there are families who might be interested in using an app for kids under 10 to get them to brush. Personally, I think having my tablet or phone sitting where it could get covered in water, toothpaste and whatever else as my 5yr old brushed isn&#x27;t something for me. But hey, if other parents are for it, great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customize your toothbrush wasn&#x27;t a big deal for my daughter either. I guess younger kids like my 5yr old might be into this, but it isn&#x27;t a selling point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only other commit is I use all the Sonicare toothbrushes used the same brush head. This one is different from our adult model so we&#x27;ll have to buy two kinds and to replace your brush head isn&#x27;t cheap.Probably the reason they almost went out of business back then.

            <li> Our 7 year old daughter loves this toothbrush. It used to be the case that brushing teeth was a chore where we had to...pull teeth just to get the brushing done. Fortunately, the interactive part of the toothbrush keeps her engaged by allowing her to watch short videos on her iPad that show her how to brush. Although there were some slight hiccups downloading the application to the iPad, the problems were solved quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the blending of an interactive video with what is such a mundane chore was actually kind of clever.  It has certainly made the bedtime process that much smoother - that, and she is now brushing her teeth regularly and actually enjoying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great tool for getting the kids interested in brushing their teeth. It certainly worked wonders with our children.</li>
            <li> This is the most impressive kids toothbrush I have come by....head and shoulders above the others!&lt;br /&gt;They have found a way to make the experience more creative and fun so if u have an ipad, even better.&lt;br /&gt;however, even without the ipad,, this is one heck of a toothbrush. It gives the child a signal of when to mover on to other parts of the mouth. My wife agrees, this is by far the finest children&#x27;s brush on the market</li>
            <li> If your kids use iPhone or iPad and they have hard time brushing their teeth or do not have the proper brushing technique, then this is the toothbrush for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you use electric or manual toothbrush, the most important factor to preserve gums and teeth is to brush for 2 minutes twice daily with soft bristles at 45 degrees to the gum line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With its Bluetooth connection to an app on your iOS device, this toothbrush is fun for kids, teaches the proper brushing technique and in the process helps them make good lifelong brushing habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The setup process is pretty simple and Philips web site has downloadable manuals, FAQ and other useful information. Here are few other remarks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. My experience with other wireless health products is that connection breaks periodically and you have to reconnect.&lt;br /&gt;2. Oral B toothbrushes are usually  more expensive and brush heads cheaper; Philips Sonicare toothbrushes are less expensive but brush heads are exhorbitant.  With every brush I tried so far, it appears the brush heads between Oral B and Philips are interchangeable.&lt;br /&gt;3. As of now Oral B has a Bluetooth brush and children&#x27;s brush but no equivalent Bluetooth children&#x27;s brush.&lt;br /&gt;4. Go for a soft standard brush and I am not sure there is any evidence to back up the claims on other toothbrush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of now, this is a good brush to teach and develop tooth brushing habits for a growing children.</li>
