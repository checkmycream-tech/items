            <li>good girls dig it very much every time i put it on</li>
            <li>It is not too strong to cause a person to sneeze</li>
            <li>and this is important because I have allergy problems.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price was about $25 for 100ml when I purchased the first two bottles, and they smelled authentic.</li>
            <li>I used this cologne many many years ago, and always liked it and then moved onto other colognes.  </li>
            <li>The scent was sweet, spicy, and woody.</li>
            <li>Manly, woody, spicy, and sweet.</li>
            <li>Good afternoon, last week received two scents that had bought a Paris Hilton and Paris Hilton Guess</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, will reorder</li>
            <li>very grateful and pleased with you, thank you very much for your help</li>
            <li>Its got a very unique masculine smell to it.</li>
            <li>It is OK the scent does not last long but has a good smell</li>
            <li>I use this fragrance on a daily basis because of it&#x27;s light and easy going aroma.</li>
            <li>time.they refound my money very fast,</li>
            <li>Recently, decided to try it again and still love it.  </li>
            <li>Cologne was delivered on time, and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It smells similar to a cologne I have called avon tomorrow mens which smells better than this particular</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product, and definitely recommend it to anyone needing to buy cologne for a male.</li>
            <li>I had three of my friends compare it to the real stuff from Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li>this cologne smells really  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>He thanks me.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>but the smell was much weaker.</li>
            <li>The product arrived on time, and packaged very well.</li>
            <li>it was a gift the same person who i gave it told me that it wasn&#x60;t the original</li>
            <li>and Guess arrived safely arrived without lid and half, not because I get so would happen.</li>
            <li>but I did order pretty late, packaging intact, satisfied customer here.</li>

            <li>I love the small</li>
            <li>It was a really masculine smell and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>In that you can help me?&lt;br /&gt;had not written them because I was so Busy with my marriage day Friday and Saturday.</li>
            <li>I wore this for a few months, but I am a younger guy, teacher, athletic, so I had to stop wearing this scent after awhile because it smelled fatherly :).</li>
            <li>I do not regret this purchase was exactly what I expected</li>

            <li> I do not regret this purchase was exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> I would usually pay twice as much for the same cologne in the mall.</li>
            <li> He needed an everyday cologne and since I know that he douses himself in his everyday cologne before leaving the house, I was hoping for something a little more cost efficient.</li>
            <li> I like how it smell , but it does not last long.</li>
            <li> it is good but don&#x27;t stay on your clothes for long, I think some oil base could be used in it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Guess Marciano as an everyday/casual cologne, especially in the colder season (Fall/Winter) -- strong in the opening; the sillage is average; unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t last long on my skin, and I have to re-apply at the middle of the day as the scent stays very close to the skin as the hours go by.</li>
            <li> this is a fake, the bottle looks real, but the inside packaging is only the bottle sitting in the open box.</li>
            <li> He often opts for pricier and harder to find colognes because he takes a lot of pride in what he wears and how it represents him.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s not overpowering, the masculine scent is still there subtly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why - but it seemed &amp;#34;watered&amp;#34; down to me.</li>
            <li> it is a fake cologne the smell is not the same and it does not last in the sking !!!!  </li>
            <li> It is a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; type of smell, and not sweet.  </li>
            <li> the scent was weird, which shouts old stock.</li>
            <li> Hard to find elsewhere.</li>
            <li> this is a hard product to find anymore..</li>
            <li> but I received a poor bottle --</li>
            <li> SORRY NO WHERE I GET MY PERFUME ...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and was worried when I read the reviews of it smelling fake, but I bought it through Amazon and it smells just like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Shipping was horrible.</li>

            <li> Bought for a gift and he loved it</li>
            <li> Very surprised.  My wife have the female version of these and she gets complements from her friends so I check to see if there was a male version of it and there is so guess what. I live it</li>
            <li> I love the small I think I am gonna  order anotherone.</li>
            <li> all excellent, I loved the product is genuine and I do not get battered box</li>
            <li> very good product congratulations</li>
            <li> I just purchased this bottle of Cologne as I was low on a bottle I had purchased at Macy&#x27;s. And Guess what...this is a fake, the bottle looks real, but the inside packaging is only the bottle sitting in the open box. the cologne itself smells like rubbing alcohol. I had three of my friends compare it to the real stuff from Macy&#x27;s and they said..dude..You have been robbed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t purchase this...or you will throw your money away!</li>
            <li> recommend it to everyone this is the best store the product arrived safely recommend them here at amazon to buy the best reliability and honesty</li>
            <li> My husband is what I like to call, a cologne connoisseur. He often opts for pricier and harder to find colognes because he takes a lot of pride in what he wears and how it represents him. This cologne was a God send in my opinion. He needed an everyday cologne and since I know that he douses himself in his everyday cologne before leaving the house, I was hoping for something a little more cost efficient. We both LOVE the way this smells. It is a great buy for an even better price. Delivery is timely. I wish there was an automatic Amazon subscription because the way he goes through this, I would sign us up.</li>
            <li> Women constantly come up and smell me and love the way I smell and often say mmmm you smell soo good!! its a definate panty dropper for sure.</li>
            <li> very good essence, I really like, and excellent brand</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> product is great smells good</li>
            <li> the price is not the same amazon is saying one prise and my bill is saying another i am not going to $300 + us for a perfume</li>
            <li> I used this cologne many many years ago, and always liked it and then moved onto other colognes.  Recently, decided to try it again and still love it.  It is a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; type of smell, and not sweet.  For some reason, it always reminded me of a cinnamon type of smell.  It lasts about five hours.&lt;br /&gt;Good enough for me.  This will be the last time I buy this, whereas I always like to try others.</li>
            <li> I tested this cologne at the counter and I liked it. The scent was sweet, spicy, and woody. Amazon&#x27;s price is cheaper so I purchased a bottle. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Guess Marciano as an everyday/casual cologne, especially in the colder season (Fall/Winter) -- strong in the opening; the sillage is average; unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t last long on my skin, and I have to re-apply at the middle of the day as the scent stays very close to the skin as the hours go by. For the price I got, I can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the cologne, and purchased another one as a gift for my teenager nephew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUYERS BEWARE: make sure you pick \\&quot;Amazon\\&quot; as the seller before checking out. Amazon&#x27;s price was about $25 for 100ml when I purchased the first two bottles, and they smelled authentic. The third bottle I purchased was from FragnanceNet for $19+ including shipping.. I thought I got a good deal but I received a poor bottle -- the scent was weird, which shouts old stock.</li>
            <li> SORRY NO WHERE I GET MY PERFUME ... AND I WILL BE WAITING ... WHAT HAPPENS??? HAPPENS?? NEED ANSWERS?SORRY NO WHERE I GET MY PERFUME</li>
            <li> this cologne smells really  good girls dig it very much every time i put it on i always get compliments</li>
            <li> Came in a box and it smells really great</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my bf for Valentines Day and Im sure he will  he will like it.. I do</li>
            <li> It was a really masculine smell and it lasts all day.  I would definitely recommend this one.  My bf loves it.</li>
            <li> It is OK the scent does not last long but has a good smell</li>
            <li> I like it, it is different. Manly, woody, spicy, and sweet. Could be overpowering a tad.&lt;br /&gt;Update- I wore this for a few months, but I am a younger guy, teacher, athletic, so I had to stop wearing this scent after awhile because it smelled fatherly :).</li>
            <li> Its an ok smell something I would wear to a funeral. It smells similar to a cologne I have called avon tomorrow mens which smells better than this particular guess brand cologne.</li>
            <li> Wow this cologne is just perfect.  Very nice price from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot and will be getting more. I am on my 3rd bottle. Last about a year</li>

            <li> Great for the price!!</li>
            <li> I use this fragrance on a daily basis because of it&#x27;s light and easy going aroma. It is not too strong to cause a person to sneeze and this is important because I have allergy problems. Even though it&#x27;s not overpowering, the masculine scent is still there subtly.</li>

            <li> I do not regret this purchase was exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Much better price here than I&#x27;ve seen anywhere else. BF has been wearing this cologne forever, haven&#x27;t heard any complaints from him.  Didn&#x27;t arrive in time for Christmas but I did order pretty late, packaging intact, satisfied customer here.</li>
            <li> OMG!!! AMAZON NNNNNEEEEEEDS MORE OF THIS DEAR GOD PLEASE IT IS PERFECT FOR ME IN EVERY WAY!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice perfume. I like it. Its got a very unique masculine smell to it. not fruity at all. totally recommended for all.</li>
            <li> Fellas, if you want to smell great I recommend this cologne. This is a great deal. I would usually pay twice as much for the same cologne in the mall.</li>
            <li> buena fragancia y todo muy bien en el envio muy sastifecho con la compra... recomendado para otras ocaciones y compras</li>
            <li> it is a fake cologne the smell is not the same and it does not last in the sking !!!!  it was a gift the same person who i gave it told me that it wasn&#x60;t the original</li>
            <li> So many options to purchase this cologne. My last purchase was in a local store - and I decided to try Amazon to resupply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells the same as my store bought cologne - but the smell was much weaker. I don&#x27;t know why - but it seemed &amp;#34;watered&amp;#34; down to me. Store bought you could still smell hours later - this was gone in an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need more but will look for another seller.</li>
            <li> Good afternoon, last week received two scents that had bought a Paris Hilton and Paris Hilton Guess and Guess arrived safely arrived without lid and half, not because I get so would happen. In that you can help me?&lt;br /&gt;had not written them because I was so Busy with my marriage day Friday and Saturday.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, will reorder</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time, and packaged very well. I bought this for my boyfriend and was worried when I read the reviews of it smelling fake, but I bought it through Amazon and it smells just like it&#x27;s supposed to. I am very pleased with this product, and definitely recommend it to anyone needing to buy cologne for a male.</li>
            <li> Great product great value. Shipping was horrible. It&#x27;s says Prime which I am but didn&#x27;t receive it till two weeks after.</li>
            <li> Cologne was delivered on time, and was exactly as described. The price was excellent as well.</li>
            <li> Full size product at a great price. My husband has used Guess for the last three years and we both love it, very nice fragrance!</li>
