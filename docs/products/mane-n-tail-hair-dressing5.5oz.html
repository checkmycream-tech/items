            <li>This product is great!</li>
            <li>It is wonderful!</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair beautiful.</li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price for it I&#x27;ve been able to find too!  </li>
            <li>great shine and moisture.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great.</li>
            <li>Again, the best stuff since Dixie Peach, if it were the 1940&#x27;s - 1960&#x27;s this would be the most popular hair pomade on the market!  </li>
            <li>That was the best of the best and Mane and Tail, along with all their other excellent products, knocked the ball out of the park with this pomade!  </li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>and I am good for another week.  </li>
            <li>Really good hair goop tho</li>
            <li>Well it did not disappoint and I am very pleased with this product as well.</li>
            <li>This product, I&#x27;m sure, is great for hair</li>
            <li>Amazing hold and feel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This seems to restore a nice texture without making it too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>The product is also very light</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy more.</li>
            <li>But the \\&quot;healthy luster\\&quot; it imparts to your hair borders on \\&quot;unnatural shininess\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even if it is probably better for you for a number of reasons.</li>
            <li>The reviews looked relatively good, so i figured for the price - it was worth</li>
            <li>but since I&#x27;m bald that isn&#x27;t an issue :-)</li>
            <li>We love all of the Mane nTail hair products.</li>
            <li>I love all mane &#x27;n tail products in my hair.</li>
            <li>The scent is ok but this product it did&lt;br /&gt;little</li>
            <li>If you are looking for what the original rockers and teddy boys would have used, this is it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised this product hasn&#x27;t had more popular support!  </li>
            <li>This is the best Pomade I&#x27;ve used in over 40 years and the one most like the ones of the past when us &amp;#34;greasers&amp;#34; kept a comb in our hip pockets, whipping them out every five minutes:)  </li>
            <li>Keeps his hair looking clean, full, yet holds his style.</li>
            <li>If you apply too much though it does rinse out easily.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product I have found that gives my 50-something hair a nice sheen.</li>
            <li>Seemed like a fun summer task.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair that fresh out of the shower look.</li>
            <li>The scent of this hair dressing is extremely mild, the product works, and its very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a nice product for beard conditioning and adds shine and softness, however I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone who wants to shape and style the beard.</li>
            <li>: The beard is very very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It only adds gloss and it makes the beard more manageable.</li>
            <li>I just use hot water to wash my beard after and shampoo it once a week.  </li>
            <li>This is almost exactly the same product in every way except the light sweet scent Dixie had.</li>
            <li>The others (lay-rite) are more like what we called &#x27;Butch Wax&#x27; back in the day, but if you wanted a style like Elvis and Jerry Lee</li>
            <li>Then turn your collar up and put on your leather jacket or white sports coat:)</li>
            <li>Very impress the way it help my bread grow and making it soft and easy to manger like it alot</li>
            <li>I grow a beard in a week and always have certain stages of the beard that are itchier than others.</li>
            <li>While it does aid in making my beard stay &#x27;groomed&#x27;, it&#x27;s very sticky</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li>All this&lt;br /&gt;did was make it feel very greasy, almost like I rubbed in</li>
            <li>Quickly discovered that my beard hair, if not kept short, is very unruly.</li>
            <li>This formula gives my 14&amp;#34; long beard a nice feel.&lt;br /&gt;It gets dry and wiry</li>
            <li>It does not absorb into hair quickly so it remains greasy for a long time after application.  </li>
            <li>so no small matter).  </li>
            <li>(about 8 inches long right now).  </li>
            <li>It washes out easily with any shampoo, keeps hair in place and returns hair style to your original combing with a pocket comb and a little water, stays in your hair and doesn&#x27;t run down your face and neck in the heat.</li>
            <li>That said, it is a very thick and greasy feeling product so make sure to use plenty of water and really work it in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old enough to remember Dixie Peach and really missed it when it was gone, but with this Mane</li>
            <li>It works well, makes my beard soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>They really should have left it unscented.  </li>
            <li>this stuff arrived a day earlier than it was supposed to which was totally appreciated.</li>
            <li>One treatment seems to last several days, it does not have any strong smell, and at the rate I am using it, it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary: I&#x27;m the only one that normally touches my beard...and the shine, while noticeable, isn&#x27;t distracting.</li>
            <li>if anyone gives negative remarks about this stuff they are full of it!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a LOT in a little jar and you only need a small amount, and its also very, very cheap!</li>
            <li>is bouncy and extra baby soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very inexpensive and will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li>Beard specific conditioners cost 5 to 6 times as much for half the amount.</li>
            <li>This stuff made a difference; it is a little greasy, but costs much less than the other products and makes my facial hair look and feel better.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m 60 and used pomade in the late sixties as well as off and on through my 20&#x27;s because I had thick wavy hair and liked the men&#x27;s hair styles of the 50&#x27;s, then started using it again in my mid 50&#x27;s as my hair got thinner and wanted control.  </li>
            <li> However, my hair is thick and coarse and I think this product would weigh down fine hair.</li>
            <li> I only have to use it once a week to keep my long beard from knotting as long as I don&#x27;t shampoo it out.    </li>
            <li> Hubby wanted this one to tame his wild hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a fluke and because it was such a good price and was shocked at what arrived!  </li>
            <li> I always have problems with dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> It lubricates to prevent the dry skin and also adds a shine to the beard without making it look greasy.</li>
            <li> works well for dry hair but must use sparingly on wet hair and comb through to get it evenly distributed throughout the hair.</li>
            <li> This made my hair hard, probably due to the high amount of petroleum.</li>
            <li> Minimal odor...</li>
            <li> and I have to be careful not to have it leave oil marks my collar.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is some of the least expensive beard conditioner on the market and so far, for me it is working very well.</li>
            <li> I have tried other types but they are often scented...</li>
            <li> I bought this product to tame my long unruly beard</li>
            <li> He says the stuff is really thick, and he only uses it once every two weeks or so.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Expect to hear that if you leave the house less than an hour after applying this product.</li>
            <li> it is much less distracting than say hair gel.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way and the small jar lasts literally years.</li>
            <li> bought this hoping to soften my beard a little.</li>
            <li> Over a few days of use my whiskers are softer and stay in place.  </li>
            <li> if you are worried about the grease, use it heavy at night to achieve softness, and sparingly during the day to keep the hairs in line - but reduce the shine.</li>
            <li> A jar of this lasts me a few months.</li>
            <li> I rub a very small amount into my wet hair and blow-dry as usual.</li>
            <li> It got dry, tangled, and generally uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a number of years, but for the past year I have been unable to find it in the beauty product stores, so I did a little computer work and found it with you.  </li>
            <li> let me tell ya&#x27; rubbing some fruity smelling stuff on a beard and mustache and then having to smell that all day is not a good thing.  </li>
            <li> I almost got cheated out of trying this horse stuff because of random negative remarks about It</li>
            <li> I am addicted to it.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My mustache and beard can be unruly, this does the trick.  Over a few days of use my whiskers are softer and stay in place.  I ride a motorcycle so my beard is exposed to the elements, sun and wind.  This helps.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that gives my 50-something hair a nice sheen. I rub a very small amount into my wet hair and blow-dry as usual. A little goes a very long way and the small jar lasts literally years. However, my hair is thick and coarse and I think this product would weigh down fine hair.</li>
            <li> Minimal odor... great shine and moisture.</li>
            <li> I ordered this stuff as a beard groomer.  It works well, makes my beard soft and manageable.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I always have problems with dry itchy skin. I grow a beard in a week and always have certain stages of the beard that are itchier than others. The mane n tail helps prevent this. It lubricates to prevent the dry skin and also adds a shine to the beard without making it look greasy. It adds definition like a condition does to hair. So why 4 stars? Because once you apply it, if you do go to scratch, you end up with some mane n tail in between your nails. It doesnt absorb like a moose or gel for hair does, but it does its job well.</li>
            <li> My biggest problem with this is the smell.  They really should have left it unscented.  It smells like something Aunt Marge would put on her….  any way…  While it does aid in making my beard stay &#x27;groomed&#x27;, it&#x27;s very sticky and I have to be careful not to have it leave oil marks my collar. I won&#x27;t buy more.</li>
            <li> Bought this as an alternative to using pomade to condition my beard. It works pretty well. There&#x27;s a LOT in a little jar and you only need a small amount, and its also very, very cheap! My only criticism is that the product is a bit greasy which makes your beard look damp. The product is also very light so it doesn&#x27;t work well with styling. It only adds gloss and it makes the beard more manageable. Overall it&#x27;s a nice product for beard conditioning and adds shine and softness, however I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone who wants to shape and style the beard. 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My beard and mustache felt like straw.  This stuff made a difference; it is a little greasy, but costs much less than the other products and makes my facial hair look and feel better.</li>
            <li> This is some of the least expensive beard conditioner on the market and so far, for me it is working very well. One treatment seems to last several days, it does not have any strong smell, and at the rate I am using it, it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Very impress the way it help my bread grow and making it soft and easy to manger like it alot</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Why is your beard so shiny?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expect to hear that if you leave the house less than an hour after applying this product. It works well, making hair/beards easier to style as well as providing a definite softness. But the \\&quot;healthy luster\\&quot; it imparts to your hair borders on \\&quot;unnatural shininess\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shine does go away after an hour or so, but if you&#x27;re the type - like me - who showers, leaves the house, and gets breakfast and coffee on the way into work, you probably won&#x27;t like budgeting the extra time into your routine. Even if it is probably better for you for a number of reasons.</li>
            <li> A while ago I decided I was going to grow my chin hair longer. Seemed like a fun summer task. Quickly discovered that my beard hair, if not kept short, is very unruly. It got dry, tangled, and generally uncomfortable. Conditioner alone did not solve this. Good thing I knew the solution: salves and creams. But which to use? Search through the hundreds of beard balms and waxes - some being quite pricey. I stumbled on Mane &#x27;n Tail&#x27;s hair dressing during a search.  The reviews looked relatively good, so i figured for the price - it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The beard is very very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it IS a bit greasy, and leaves quite the shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: I&#x27;m the only one that normally touches my beard...and the shine, while noticeable, isn&#x27;t distracting. In my opinion. it is much less distracting than say hair gel.  if you are worried about the grease, use it heavy at night to achieve softness, and sparingly during the day to keep the hairs in line - but reduce the shine.</li>
            <li> I had used the shampoo and conditioner before but never the oil. Well it did not disappoint and I am very pleased with this product as well.</li>
            <li> This formula gives my 14&amp;#34; long beard a nice feel.&lt;br /&gt;It gets dry and wiry since I wash my face frequently.&lt;br /&gt;This seems to restore a nice texture without making it too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell too!!</li>
            <li> I use this daily on my beard (its sort of a Duck Dynasty type of beard... so no small matter).  I just moisten the beard, rub some of this between my hands and then work it into the beard. I have tried other types but they are often scented... let me tell ya&#x27; rubbing some fruity smelling stuff on a beard and mustache and then having to smell that all day is not a good thing.  The scent of this hair dressing is extremely mild, the product works, and its very reasonably priced.  A jar of this lasts me a few months.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to tame my long unruly beard (about 8 inches long right now).  It works very well.  I only have to use it once a week to keep my long beard from knotting as long as I don&#x27;t shampoo it out.    I just use hot water to wash my beard after and shampoo it once a week.  Afterwards I reapply this and I am good for another week.  It does not absorb into hair quickly so it remains greasy for a long time after application.  If you apply too much though it does rinse out easily.  You can&#x27;t beat the price though.  Beard specific conditioners cost 5 to 6 times as much for half the amount.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wanting to use this to soften or \\&quot;style\\&quot; your beard, just be prepared for it to be sticky for a while after. I still prefer the regular mane &amp; tail conditioner (leave it in after drying beard).  This product, I&#x27;m sure, is great for hair but since I&#x27;m bald that isn&#x27;t an issue :-)</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. It&#x27;s very inexpensive and will last you a very long time. It gives my hair that fresh out of the shower look. That said, it is a very thick and greasy feeling product so make sure to use plenty of water and really work it in.</li>
            <li> The lid was cracked when it arrived so I put the product in a plastic bag. Really good hair goop tho</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for his beard.  He says the stuff is really thick, and he only uses it once every two weeks or so.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a fluke and because it was such a good price and was shocked at what arrived!  I&#x27;m 60 and used pomade in the late sixties as well as off and on through my 20&#x27;s because I had thick wavy hair and liked the men&#x27;s hair styles of the 50&#x27;s, then started using it again in my mid 50&#x27;s as my hair got thinner and wanted control.  I&#x27;m old enough to remember Dixie Peach and really missed it when it was gone, but with this Mane &#x27;n Tail Hair Dressing,5.5oz it&#x27;s back! This is almost exactly the same product in every way except the light sweet scent Dixie had. This is the best Pomade I&#x27;ve used in over 40 years and the one most like the ones of the past when us &amp;#34;greasers&amp;#34; kept a comb in our hip pockets, whipping them out every five minutes:)  It washes out easily with any shampoo, keeps hair in place and returns hair style to your original combing with a pocket comb and a little water, stays in your hair and doesn&#x27;t run down your face and neck in the heat. Again, the best stuff since Dixie Peach, if it were the 1940&#x27;s - 1960&#x27;s this would be the most popular hair pomade on the market!  I&#x27;m surprised this product hasn&#x27;t had more popular support!  If you are looking for what the original rockers and teddy boys would have used, this is it!  The others (lay-rite) are more like what we called &#x27;Butch Wax&#x27; back in the day, but if you wanted a style like Elvis and Jerry Lee this was the type of product you looked for and as I said before, Dixie Peach! That was the best of the best and Mane and Tail, along with all their other excellent products, knocked the ball out of the park with this pomade!  Amazon has the best price for it I&#x27;ve been able to find too!  Don&#x27;t pass this up, buy a jar today!  Then turn your collar up and put on your leather jacket or white sports coat:)</li>
            <li> Amazing hold and feel. Can fix all day day with a swipe of the comb if gets messed up!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a number of years, but for the past year I have been unable to find it in the beauty product stores, so I did a little computer work and found it with you.  Thank you so much.  I would recommend this product to anyone who uses a hair dressing.  It keeps my hair beautiful.</li>
            <li> This product is great! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Hubby wanted this one to tame his wild hair. He loves it. Keeps his hair looking clean, full, yet holds his style. Just a little bit goes a long way. Makes hair look darker, fuller and softer. We love all of the Mane nTail hair products.</li>
            <li> works well for dry hair but must use sparingly on wet hair and comb through to get it evenly distributed throughout the hair.</li>
            <li> This made my hair hard, probably due to the high amount of petroleum.</li>
            <li> if anyone gives negative remarks about this stuff they are full of it! I love all mane &#x27;n tail products in my hair. It is wonderful! I&#x27;ve been using the hair dressing, conditioner and hoofmaker lotion and my hair has grown an inch in two weeks, is bouncy and extra baby soft. I almost got cheated out of trying this horse stuff because of random negative remarks about It I was getting from people here and there, but this stuff is the cure to all of my hair issues. I am addicted to it.&lt;br /&gt;p.s this stuff arrived a day earlier than it was supposed to which was totally appreciated.</li>
            <li> My beard is shorter so maybe that is part of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this hoping to soften my beard a little. All this&lt;br /&gt;did was make it feel very greasy, almost like I rubbed in&lt;br /&gt;simple vaseline. The scent is ok but this product it did&lt;br /&gt;little to help the texture of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might work for longer beards.</li>
