            <li>I don&#x27;t think these wraps are very effective.</li>
            <li>The home parties and amazing customer service make this company what it is and you miss that when you don&#x27;t have a rep!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;d used them before and if the product was actually good it would have been great.</li>

            <li>fat melting is worth it and smooths the skin !!!!</li>
            <li>They work great lost inches and love handles!</li>
            <li>i have purchased the IT WORKS applicators from ebay and then also from amazon (i want to always try and get the best price, they always come in good condition and are perfectly fine and acceptable for use and fall within the expiration date).</li>
            <li>Good for slimming before an event.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s my biggest problem, to get a good price on the wraps, you have to sign up for a 3 month (minimum) membership, with an autoship each month.</li>
            <li>1 star for good delivery time.</li>
            <li>Good Luck.</li>

            <li>I watched testimonials of the good</li>
            <li>loved it</li>
            <li>I got these hoping to see some good results.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work good at all.</li>
            <li>(if you want good results this is a</li>
            <li>part of what we want in life should be to take good care of our health and</li>
            <li>Good health to you all.</li>
            <li>These work really good.</li>
            <li>I do know a lot of people swear it works and its good.</li>
            <li>Good luck to all.(1 inch after 1st wrap; 0.5 inch for each of the remaining wraps).</li>
            <li>Good luck to all.</li>
            <li>I heard a lot of good things about this product from reviews online, but when I tried them myself, they didn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li>It worked and I was very happy to fit into my 13 size jeans I haven&#x27;t been able to get into for 2 years!</li>
            <li>feel great and love my results.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>They are a great addition to a healthy diet for tightening up areas that store fat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(I have very prominent stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I still love amazon because I have received great products.</li>
            <li>But why stood our most to me is how great it made my scar look.</li>
            <li>; Very satisfied bought multi-pack Will use it again</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am happy and waiting for more wraps to come</li>
            <li>I honestly hoped those reviews that were good had some backing but</li>
            <li>had one of these wraps done at a salon for much more and was thrilled to find them on amazon at a great price.</li>
            <li>and I know my friends who have also bought these would buy more!</li>
            <li>Make sure to take before and after pictures!</li>
            <li>But proportion changed for sure with the pictures!</li>

            <li>buy this product fast!!!!!</li>
            <li>these worked amazing on my stretchmarks and scars.</li>
            <li>Bought the four pack of this item after watching Youtube vidoes about how amazing this product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>after pictures they are amazing so amazing that I signed up</li>
            <li>Some people see amazing results, some people quit before they have a chance to get results.</li>
            <li>so I chose to represent this amazing brand.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any amazing results with these.</li>
            <li>Yet, the results were amazing</li>
            <li>This is AMAZING</li>
            <li>I have amazing results on this product,&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;It works&#x27;</li>
            <li>It smelled amazing, felt amazing.</li>
            <li>Do not buy it, no matter how many good reviews you may see.</li>
            <li>im glad that there ARE people who have seen results tho, good for them.</li>
            <li>That was my own foolish wishful thinking.  </li>
            <li>Nice people to deal with.</li>
            <li>Kind of a rip off of you ask me.</li>
            <li>I was honestly just hoping this would help with the pooch, not expecting it to be lipo by anymeans.....</li>
            <li>I did like the feeling of increased circulation in the areas and the smell was nice.  </li>
            <li>These wraps didn&#x27;t do a thing for me except give me the nice \\&quot;post detox bloat&#x27;\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell a difference by looking at her, though.  </li>
            <li>I was worried because it was kind of brown looking</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t honestly tell anyone to buy this.</li>
            <li>However, if you don&#x27;t use them correctly the wraps will not be effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He said &amp;#34; I wouldn&#x27;t have believe it if I hadn&#x27;t seen it with my own eyes&amp;#34</li>
            <li>if you wear nice clothes to work etc.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can develop your own schedule</li>
            <li>completely worth the money, i will be purchasing again!!!</li>
            <li>She seemed more impressed on her first use</li>
            <li>Seemed like a good idea, but maybe too good to be true.</li>
            <li>If you are looking to buy wraps, I would be more than happy to assist you in setting up a health and wellness plan to fit your needs.</li>
            <li>WOW (12 1/2&amp;#34; from a one hour wrap with 3 1/2&amp;#34; being from my belly (hehe Happy Dance, lol) .</li>
            <li>loyal customer program is great</li>
            <li>I watched the video and it seemed very easy to apply this wrap.  </li>
            <li>It did not work and all and the eucalyptus in it was very strong.</li>
            <li>The better you eat, the better the results!  </li>
            <li>You will feel better about yourself and you will feel better!</li>
            <li>but I could&#x27;ve gotten that with a sea salt scrub and lotion which is much more cost effective.  </li>
            <li>Best to use it on your day off so that you can utilize the restroom frequently and stay hydrated.  </li>
            <li>[...] for more info and to purchase these amazing wraps  [...]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy for the ones who have had success and wish I had lost inches, too.</li>
            <li>its wonderful so natural..</li>
            <li>I had heard and seen a lot of good things about the wraps but wanted to be able to test more than just one out without being committed to buying more from a consultant.</li>
            <li>Easy to follow directions and will use again if needed!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is a permanent fix, but it makes me feel more confident and motivated to go work out more and continue eating better!</li>
            <li>Too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>Good product for a quick fix but not permenent.</li>
            <li>The lady who sells the Lucalean is super nice and answered all my questions when I ordered my own jar.</li>
            <li>I used all 4 and noticed a huge differance!</li>
            <li>Wish they would lower the price on these because I would buy more</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>I did drink more water.  </li>
            <li>I used these as part of some last-ditch efforts toward fitting in a bridesmaid dress when I was retaining water.  </li>
            <li>Listen people in order for these wraps to work you have to eat healthy, work out, drink plenty of water and cut out any junk food from your diet.</li>
            <li>I forgot the part about not using Dove soap &amp; lotion, I did drink the recommended amount of water &amp; resisted my love for energy drinks in those 3 days.</li>
            <li>I measures in at 34in, did more push-ups &amp; sit-ups and ran OK...</li>
            <li>this wrap encourages a healthy lifestyle as your diet &amp; water consumption must be up to par in order for it to work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Clearly a must have :)</li>
            <li>Maybe it takes more than one application</li>
            <li>When I bought this I wasn&#x27;t in the business, and I personally liked the cheap price of it without having to sign up for anything like the company makes you.</li>
            <li>Many people say that they don&#x27;t lose any inches from this.</li>
            <li>I would love to have bought some more for my legs, arms, and chest, but I cannot afford that many.</li>
            <li>look much better</li>
            <li>and I love these.</li>
            <li>I love eucalyptus and didn&#x27;t mind the lotion/smell, but it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Put on a tight-fitting tank top and went to bed.  </li>
            <li>she was that confident).</li>
            <li>Neither one of us would have been able to sleep with them on.</li>
            <li>I have try many things and I was concern about this one</li>
            <li>some people think this is a magic paper that will make your fat or flab disappear in a matter of seconds.</li>
            <li>(How many times have you heard that in a movie film?</li>
            <li>(How many times have you heard that in a movie film?</li>
            <li>I am glad I did it but would not recommend it.</li>
            <li>Let me just start off by saying that I LOVE the</li>
            <li>Message me for more info mariannav920@gmail.com</li>
            <li>Ok so I ordered these and had both my mom and sister try them out.</li>
            <li>Ok so they dont order from amazon ?</li>
            <li>od peoples faces hmm ok thx</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t sign up on some sort of program and spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li>You will lose more weight that way.</li>
            <li>Love it.......</li>
            <li>Nor did I keep a healthy diet.</li>
            <li>The price is definitely the best part of this.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s better to do this.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s more, is that our company is designed to provide ongoing support.</li>
            <li>: I rated this product 5 STARS because IT IS a 5 STAR product regardless of it being sold against company policies :) emeraldcoastwraps.com</li>
            <li>I LOVE the</li>
            <li>overweight and a saggy belly (but healthy).</li>
            <li>I made sure I used soap with no lotion in it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Made my stretch marks look much better (had them for 30 years).</li>
            <li>You would be better off with another product..just not this one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just that some people are more toxic in their system and it takes a bit longer to see the drastic results they want.  </li>
            <li>Wanted to try it out to be sure,  </li>
            <li>Save your money, go to the gym, eat a high-protein diet and low-carb and you&#x27;ll get better results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try a couple more to see if they work or not</li>
            <li>There are more reputable companies and products out there that do not charge a membership.  </li>
            <li>Its just OKAY.</li>
            <li>There are so many drastic before and after pictures</li>
            <li>I had my period for most of it.</li>
            <li>and I used a form fitting garment instead of cellophane to see if it would work.</li>
            <li>Make sure you read reviews online of how it did and did not work for some people.</li>
            <li>i reviewd many web sites about body wraps.</li>
            <li>People love to say the results are temporary, but I&#x27;ve gone months without wrapping and the changes stick.</li>
            <li>Google them and you will find out from respectable sources like webmd.com that they are beneficial.</li>
            <li>-I don&#x27;t bid more than $56.00</li>
            <li>I have used the wraps and love them.</li>
            <li>In fact, I became more bloated.</li>
            <li>If you have more than 5 lbs to lose, exercise and choose a healthy diet, because these alone will not help you lose weight.</li>
            <li>But if you want to look more toned for an upcoming pool party or event, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>DIY body wraps and detoxing are the best way to go and show actual results</li>
            <li>I love these wraps.</li>
            <li>I had ordered just one several months ago and the items was great!</li>
            <li>Going to order some&lt;br /&gt;More :)</li>
            <li>so I said OK.</li>
            <li>but I love it</li>
            <li>These wraps are meant to aid eating better and drinking water.</li>
            <li>to help fit in a dress this is a nice addition.</li>
            <li>Sure.  </li>
            <li>But it won&#x27;t stick around for more than a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>It appears that they depend more on trapping you in a 3 month contract than on making satisfied customers.</li>
            <li>I love these wraps!worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I totally love this product.</li>
            <li>And I workout &amp; eat healthy.</li>
            <li>I am not one of these people looking for a magical  product that is going to poof</li>
            <li>like their defining gel that enhances the wrap results and diminishes the appearance of stretch marks and cellulite even more.</li>
            <li>just remember this rule \\&quot;the more</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t lost anything, in fact I feel more bloated then anything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the whole program works great with the pills and the creams and everything, but for me, buying this package once in a while as part of my plan works.</li>
            <li>I work out and eat healthy too.</li>
            <li>Be sure to read the instructions to get maximum results.</li>
            <li>I would just carry a jug of water with you for the 72 ours :)</li>
            <li>and it gets rid of the flab for sure.</li>
            <li>love it@</li>
            <li>You Have The More</li>
            <li>order one wrap and was pleased with the look and fill of my stomach after one use.</li>
            <li>and I noticed smiling more after about 3 days.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think that the wraps are a magic weight loss tool.</li>
            <li>more of a trial run</li>
            <li>Also, the wrap has a self-tanner, so it&#x27;s an illusion that you&#x27;ve &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; more weight.</li>
            <li>If you do that then you will love the results.</li>
            <li>I have 3 more apllications to use.  </li>
            <li>i love these they work like magic just make sure u drink lots of water</li>
            <li>Kept them on for 45 minutes and drank more water than I do in a week.  </li>
            <li>So I have 48 more hours to go &amp;</li>
            <li>and it had a interesting cooling, tingling sensation.  </li>
            <li>I work out and eat all things healthy.  </li>
            <li>Oh and save your saran wrap for dinner :)</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>And they told me the longer you leave it on..the better.  </li>
            <li>even overnight, that it would work better.  </li>
            <li>most of the people said it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>but i sure can stop &#x27;how&#x27; i age.</li>
            <li>I got more results from just going to the gym and drinking a lot of water during the day.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m going to lower my body fat a bit more before I try one more time.</li>
            <li>Body applicator is almost like magic.</li>
            <li>for me it&#x27;s better to go through a distributer that way you can email them or text them with questions you have.</li>
            <li>I really love food.</li>
            <li>surely but I wanted to try to speed things up.)  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I drank plenty of water, ate a healthy diet, and exercised.</li>
            <li>I have one more  to use.</li>
            <li>i ordered from there as well as amazon and there loyalty program is better.</li>
            <li>Will order more for better results.</li>
            <li>Will order more product in the future&lt;</li>
            <li>Side note, If anyone is looking to make some extra cash, This business is GREAT for that!</li>

            <li>Make sure you have a fitness plan</li>
            <li>Waist-1.5in, Belly button-1in, Love handles-1.5, Hips-3/4in,</li>
            <li>I did eat better and work out....</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>They work, if you maintain a healthy diet with them.</li>
            <li>but i fregging LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m glad i listened to her, because it worked.</li>
            <li>amazingly this product really works!!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would work like most, but it really does!!!!</li>
            <li>You just need to put it on the right way and you&#x27;re good to go</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m considering becoming a consultant because I want more people to feel as good as I do right now :)</li>
            <li>I liked it and it worked amazing the first time</li>
            <li>Seemed like a great idea/concept but for the low quality customer service others have received for a product that a huge percentage have honestly reported doesn&#x27;t work, might as well save the money, find a better company, or make your own.</li>
            <li>Along with my normal diet and work out I am still slimmer and happy</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m almost to the point of saying this company has done an amazing job at marketing a product that is full of caca.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t let the practices of someone violating company policies STOP you from becoming HEALTHY and having the body of your dreams in the process.</li>
            <li>The first wrap went good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve personally seen the wraps produce amazing results!!  </li>
            <li>and I am so excited!</li>
            <li>That worked great for my 55 year old face :)</li>
            <li>Recommend wrapping saran warp around it to keep it tight and secure to get the best and most use for them!</li>
            <li>I had fabulous results with this product :)</li>
            <li>It made Lucalean sound like a much better deal--it is a lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I used the wraps every 3 days as recommended, and followed the detailed post-wrap instructions, which includes drinking LOTS of water, exercising, and eating a healthy diet.</li>
            <li>I went from a size 16/18 to fitting comfortably in a size 14.</li>
            <li>I went from a size 16/18 to fitting comfortably in a size 14.</li>
            <li>Too good to be true wins again.</li>
            <li>Good seller, fast delivery.  </li>

            <li>The skin on my abs was noticeably smoother &amp; softer, &amp; my clothes fit me more comfortably.</li>
            <li>These herbs have strong smell.  </li>
            <li>Smell is strong but</li>
            <li>I opened the packet and discovered it smelled strongly of herbs, specifically eucalyptus.</li>
            <li>, it actually smelled good and people say that it&#x27;s gooey and yucky, but honestly..</li>
            <li>I just bet if U go back and try the wraps doing it right U will see awesome results not they don&#x27;t take the place of excersize but the do show off the results,,,,</li>
            <li>After the first wrap my belly was a pinkish shade and warm for a couple hours after I took it off.</li>
            <li>When you wrap the most benefit is going to come from using a full treatment which is 4 wraps.</li>

            <li>I have tried this product and was able to see a difference within the first application!</li>
            <li>I woke up and didnt see a huge difference until i compared pictures i had taken the night before.</li>
            <li>I am a huge amazon shopper which is why I happened upon this, but in this case I would be scared to order this product.</li>
            <li>any huge transformation</li>
            <li>I have a huge event coming up</li>
            <li>I used three of these wraps and didn&#x27;t see any huge difference in my waist size.</li>
            <li>You cannot enjoy a #1 w/ a coke and expect your wrap to work.</li>
            <li>She gave me a free one to try out</li>
            <li>We both wore them all day, using plastic wrap to secure them.</li>
            <li>Well as for my wraps hmm this will be a total of 8 lol</li>
            <li>Let me preface by telling you about myself as I think body composition is important to how these work.</li>
            <li>Did not see any great results works for a short time.</li>
            <li>The item itself provides a great short term reduction (a day or two) of the affected area.</li>
            <li>but you can get it a lot cheaper and be assured you are getting a fresh product if you buy it through the appropriate channels</li>
            <li>Can use anywhere and help to smooth the skin and remove inches.</li>
            <li>enjoy my $100</li>
            <li>I just wish it would have lived up to the description since it wasn&#x27;t a cheap beauty find.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t even get the smooth skin that people rave about.</li>
            <li>I did not think this would work but happy, I bought this for under sixty for 4 wraps at wraps.howtonow.org , these are personal results with just 1 wrap!</li>
            <li>lol my waist is smaller than my hips etc</li>
            <li>lol the next day(today)</li>
            <li>It was perfect nothing was missing</li>
            <li>but you get 40% off all orders and after 3 months you don&#x27;t have to pay for the member fee and they will automatically send it to you with free shipping.</li>
            <li>makes my skin smooth and does show definition.&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
            <li>I now feel comfortable to buy wraps from a consultant.</li>
            <li>This is a great final step to weight loss.  </li>
            <li>I won a free wrap from a distributor</li>
            <li>The ultimate body applicator package was on time and it was in great shape..</li>
            <li>I have several friends who have bought this and their results are great.</li>
            <li>I figured with all the water I drank that I would have lost 1 or 2 lbs after 3 days (since water filled my stomach &amp; curbed my appetite).</li>
            <li>and you keep yourself fit.</li>
            <li>iI know i may sound like a distributor with what i&#x27;m about to say...</li>
            <li>i cannot EMPHASIZE how important it is to drink water.....  </li>
            <li>so far its good, but</li>
            <li>So far the product is  good.  </li>
            <li>I would imagine the more fat you have to lose the better it works but who really knows.</li>
            <li>Enjoy, because this is truly an amazing product and saved my body after the birth of my child, so much</li>
            <li>shipping was great, came fast and the seller respoond to email fast..</li>
            <li>I have found the best results where skin was loose and not so great results other areas.</li>
            <li>Needed these to fit into a bridesmaid dress, fast!!!</li>
            <li>I did everything right, opened the pores, no lotions, used the gel, ate healthy and drank lots of water.</li>
            <li>👍 :) recieved it right on time when said..</li>
            <li>Plus you get the answers and tips that you need on top of other products that work great together...</li>
            <li>I would recommend becoming  a loyal customer from their website.</li>
            <li>They really do work and you see results immediately!!!</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work!!!</li>
            <li>Its Works, really works!!!</li>
            <li>First month in I am getting a $500 commission check and $300 in bonus&#x27;s!!  </li>
            <li>but these arent very useful.</li>
            <li>the gel that is on each wrap is very strong in smell ( similar to a very strong Ben Gay).  </li>
            <li>;) also drinking a lot of water is very important with this because it is detoxing your body.</li>
            <li>But the first time i tried it i bought from a health Fair in Atlanta and saw a very noticiable difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get them again because even though it&#x27;s high price , they bandages works amazingly .</li>
            <li>I do not smoke or drink alcohol, I eat healthy, and live a healthy life style.</li>
            <li>..its is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>--so I flagged the review for abuse and commented that I was pretty sure it was Kaye Lucas writing the review.  </li>
            <li>I replied again to her original comment, describing what had happened and pasted her rebuttal which had been emailed to me.  </li>
            <li>And it makes ur skin fell so fresh!</li>
            <li>I was so excited.  </li>
            <li>did take a hot shower before the wrap, and I did make sure I had all lotions off my stomach.  </li>
            <li>I know everyone is unique...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t fall for it if you have a significant belly or mommy &amp;#34;pouch&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>so I was definitely excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed they don&#x27;t do a lot of advertising and thought people should be aware that there is a much better option.</li>
            <li>I lost at the most 1/2 inch on my first wrap.</li>
            <li>So I cannot comment if that would have caused or could cause significant inch or even weight loss.</li>
            <li>after 3 times on my stomach area - I have not noticed any significant change.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to try one more set of 4 wraps.</li>
            <li>, you get much better guarantees if you order through the company first.</li>
            <li>It will also be useful come summertime and on vacation at the beach!</li>
            <li>everyone said great for three days I couldn&#x27;t find anything on the long term which is because they don&#x27;t work, yes</li>
            <li>I did not exercise at all in those 3 days, but my diet was clean.</li>
            <li>If there is some kind of sercret to make this work i&#x27;d love to hear it as i still have 2 left</li>
            <li>I will just stick to clean eating and exercise</li>
            <li>i feel that if i wanted to, i could recreate the &amp;#34;results&amp;#34; through a simple cleansing that would be much more effective than this.</li>
            <li>I work out and eat clean.</li>
            <li>I also feel more &amp;#34;up beat&amp;#34; and positive.</li>
            <li>Your better off doing ILipo or Smart lipo save you money.</li>
            <li>I figure if one more pack doesn&#x27;t do anything at all, it&#x27;s a pure scam</li>
            <li>If you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself!</li>
            <li>If you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself!</li>
            <li>and wow amazing.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve lost pounds because of it, but just the shrinkage and firming of my arms and dissapearing handlebars are good enough for me!</li>
            <li>well its true</li>
            <li>well its true</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try to update after the full 72hrs.</li>
            <li>Do you really think that by wrapping your body in something that you will magically lose inches?</li>
            <li>A full treatment is four.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I feel that as much gel as they put on these wraps there should be a lot more of them in the box.</li>
            <li>I love the wraps they really work  like anything</li>
            <li>good product, though I&#x27;d like smaller for the arms.</li>
            <li>I know the ItWorks distributors go on and on about how much these wraps work, but I&#x27;m so glad I googled searched for a way to sample these wraps before being bilked by ItWorks for hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have with the wrap is that you have to drink plenty of water but water is good for you anyway.</li>
            <li>but after reading reviews by so many people who had to luck at all, I really feel it is the exception and not the rule.</li>
            <li>I have a full bottle I will probably never use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though I would definitely recommend buying through a distributor so ensure the product is good quality.</li>
            <li>But Overall A Good Product</li>
            <li>It stays put, but I put on a very fitted tank top to hold it in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/expired and not get your full effects.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s about the only thing they are good for.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not bad for no exercise or diet change.</li>
            <li>So far so good on my first wrap</li>
            <li>you are interested in trying the wraps or any other It Works products, I would be more than happy to help customize a plan to fit your exact health and wellness needs.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this product, but I was leaving for vacation and wanted a quick fix to help nudge my body into slightly better shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>BUT if you are working toward a better you and don&#x27;t mind putting in the work to get results, the subtle but continual changes from using these will help you in this process and make you feel really good about creating a better you.</li>
            <li>You get my cell phone, email, Facebook (English and Spanish) whatever it takes for me to help you on the road to better HEALTH and a BEAUTIFUL looking</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;ve tried these wraps 2 other times and been happy with the results.</li>
            <li>great product and came in sooner than expected !</li>
            <li>Even if I didn&#x27;t lose an inch, I&#x27;d still be happy with how smooth and firm my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>I found out I was pregnant the day before these arrived</li>
            <li>You can sign up as a loyal customer and get them cheaper.</li>
            <li>and I ended up getting mildly sweaty about 3 hrs after I had put it on.</li>
            <li>I signed up for their loyal customer and was charged three times for auto ship.</li>
            <li>and I thought it was just like a quick fix.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quick fix.</li>
            <li>Real review from real people, I honestly looked at review before purchasing.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a quick fix to your weight issues</li>
            <li>I did sign up for the loyal customer deal with my rep</li>
            <li>The only thing I liked was how smooth my skin felt 24 hours after the wrap.</li>
            <li>Hi there I just thought I would write a quick review for these wraps.  </li>
            <li>but it helps the motivation for quick results.</li>
            <li>but I figured if it worked then maybe I&#x27;ll become a loyal customer to get the reduced price.</li>
            <li>I am a first timer to this product, and I haven&#x27;t had enough time with it  to write a review on product.&lt;br /&gt;Though the product that I was sent from this seller, was in good , clean shape.</li>
            <li>Sounds good but as soon as the 72hrs were up the inches came right back.</li>
            <li>Have to say that I was very interested in this product, hoping that it would work.</li>
            <li>product does make skin feel smooth, I can truly say customer service is great and very helpful and promptly tries to help with all  issues, will order from company again.</li>
            <li>When you purchase from an Independent Distributor you get perks points for free product, free shipping, and better products.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product, I think if you tried it you may see the same results.</li>
            <li>Yes, I drank the recommended amount of water, wrapped it securely with saran wrap, rubbed in the extra lotion, and used the right kind of body wash.</li>
            <li>they did do was give me a couple of nice days of soft smooth skin (but my skin is relatively soft and smooth to begin with from all the water</li>
            <li>Live a healthy lifestyle to speed up the process people.</li>
            <li>lol it feels like icy hot.</li>
            <li>Going to the bathroom like you are 9 months pregnant with triplets wasn&#x27;t fun</li>
            <li>Easy and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>If you are of large stature, its best that you lose the weight first and then use these to firm up the skin.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to very bothy!!</li>
            <li>so I was pretty familiar with this</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li>I normally do not try things like this but a good friend of mine sells this product and well..I&#x27;m hooked..</li>
            <li>i was very unsatisfied with this product, it didn&#x27;t work at all, I&#x27;ve tried these wraps once before from a distributor and her wraps seem to have worked just fine, once i ordered them from here</li>
            <li>These could be old stuff that not so great distributors bought and sat on for a while and are trying to make a quick money back by selling here...</li>
            <li>is AMAZING, but please support your local It Works!</li>
            <li>It Works are a fantastic product that really do work.  </li>
            <li>things that come from our earth, do amazing things for your inside &amp; outside.</li>
            <li>After my third wrap I could finally fit into my swimsuit that I was determined to fit into this summer!  </li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m selling them and making money so much fun</li>
            <li>It was fun to plastic wrap yourself but the product did not work for me even though I followed all the instructions.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty sweet.</li>
            <li>i called the company to request my money back and make complaints, and they refused too refund me and said \\&quot;your kind of body type is not compatible with our product.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>THAT is what you are putting on your body and what is absorbed by your skin.</li>
            <li>Worth your money ...</li>
            <li>but it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>It is worth trying although ive seen reviews for some people saying it doesnt work, guess it depends on the person</li>
            <li>loved the products so much that I knew I wanted to use them all regularly.</li>
            <li>I decided to sign up to be able to distribute the products so that I could possible earn mine free.</li>
            <li>Worth the $15 a wrap?</li>
            <li>, I drank 100oz minimum of water a day, ate healthy and exercised lightly also, I did measurements daily and pictures every 72 hours.</li>
            <li>The only thing I can figure out is they are cheaper because they are expired and therefore not as effective.</li>
            <li>etc) you&#x27;d probably get more results from eating a diet with minimal sugar and carbs, eating mostly protein/veg/ and fruit.  </li>
            <li>, i used to tell people my tricks and tips that i use to stay young and healthy looking</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off the old fashioned way, eat your veggies and fruit, and limit everything else and get a lil exercise.</li>
            <li>The prices would also be more reasonable and have bonuses for you when you order under a distributor (that is straight from the source), as I am myself why I know this product so well and what it will do for your body.</li>
            <li>She had success as did all of her friends.  </li>
            <li>False advertisement at its best.</li>
            <li>these things are pretty cool if u drink the right amount if water you will see results</li>
            <li>But for a quick small stomach tightening its great.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I have spent most of my life very fit, and NOT overweight.</li>
            <li>i bought the 4 pack, it came pretty quick</li>
            <li>You must be realistic people; I&#x27;m guessing that if you have a BIG belly you might not be satisfied, because it will take you longer to see results (youtube it, there are many testimonials regarding these applicators, how it works...</li>
            <li>This is only good possibly if you are trying to fit into something for a special occassion.  </li>
            <li>If I did this every couple of days I&#x27;d look and feel pretty good, my pants would fit better, but I&#x27;d be poor.  </li>
            <li>Last night I prepped my stomach by washing and drying the area, to make sure the skin was clean</li>
            <li>My skin was smooth and more elastic with my first and second wrap.</li>
            <li>, this keeps my stomach nice and flat.  </li>
            <li>, right?)</li>
            <li>You have to get up and move and eat the right food.</li>
            <li>I did everything right</li>
            <li>You have to eat right and move every day.</li>
            <li>You can see the results right away and even in the days to come.</li>
            <li>WEIGHT TAKES EATING RIGHT AND EXERCISE.......</li>
            <li>Working out and eating right is the trick but</li>
            <li>Time it right.</li>
            <li>right like a wrap will make me lose inches..</li>
            <li>I bet these people didn&#x27;t do it the right way</li>
            <li>the price was certainly right.</li>
            <li>I noticed results right away though</li>
            <li>I drank all the water, ate right, avoided alcohol</li>
            <li>but you can feel it working right away</li>
            <li>I think this isn&#x27;t the right thing.  </li>
            <li>to mention, you can get a FULL BOX of 4 wraps for only $59 when you order on there! :)</li>
            <li>At night I took a hot shower to let my pores open up, I did not use soap or any kind of lotion on my stomach.</li>
            <li>Well I am HAPPY to say after 4 wraps I am DOWN 6 inches!!</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this as I&#x27;m sure most people are and to be honest</li>
            <li>Beware of the discount you receive by becoming a &amp;#34;member&amp;#34; when buying direct.</li>
            <li>I will keep posting results as I do more of them, as I am very interested if these results stay or begin to fade after a time of not using the wraps regularly.  </li>
            <li>I can understand if you are trying to slim down to look good for a wedding or vacation, or use it as motivation to lose weight</li>
            <li>I also said that she would most likely delete the original comment to erase the whole thread--guess what?  </li>
            <li>For those saying the product doesn&#x27;t work, you HAVE TO complete the FULL treatment plan!  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re allergic to certain plants you shouldn&#x27;t use!</li>
            <li>The applicators are old I would have been better off by buying straight from the website.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you really want to believe there CAN be a quick fix to somethings in life</li>
            <li>maybe I wouldn&#x27;t see results right away but wanted to give it a real try do it the right way...</li>
            <li>so i continue to stay young and healthy and vibrant.)</li>
            <li>I know it says to just do 45 min the first time</li>
            <li>so I left it on overnight with saran wrap and my spanx on top.</li>
            <li>I used this exactly per directions</li>
            <li>you wouldn&#x27;t be able to eat because as soon as I ate my stomach looked bigger again.</li>
            <li>my skin is so much smoother as well!</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly &amp; did not have any inch loss or change in appearance.</li>
            <li>I should have known better, but I thought based on some of the reviews it could possibly work.  </li>
            <li>some magical way to lose weight I have put on... there is no such thing.</li>
            <li>you are willing to try these out</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was foolish to believe a magic cream would actually make you lose fat.</li>
            <li>The wraps are overpriced and did absolutely nothing for me!</li>
            <li>your deserve (meaning most likely</li>
            <li>It takes the water out of your cells shrinking them and making you temporary smaller(his exact words).</li>
            <li>first time used this product I could feel it working</li>
            <li>6 to 8 hours per wrap after the first.</li>
            <li>First, I have not used this product.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way she would have known about my comment or been able to reply to my comment unless she was the same person.  </li>
            <li>So much for trying to save money on a box of four wraps!</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>I lost almost 3 inches with my first wrap.</li>
            <li>I used these just as the directions say, but left it on longer because my skin is able to handle it.</li>
            <li>If you need to &amp;#34;tighten&amp;#34; any specific area these wraps will help with that for sure.  </li>
            <li>All bodies are different so maybe you will have a better result.  </li>
            <li>everyone will see results with this - cause it really does work!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty slim</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the expected delivery date</li>
            <li>Pictures really are worth a thousand words...</li>
            <li>If you are interested in this product contact an &amp;#34;It Works&amp;#34; Distributor in your area.</li>
            <li>All the reviews and pictures of peoples success with&amp;#34; no change &amp;#34; was promising but it didnt work for me</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions EXACTLY, an even bought from a distributor.</li>
            <li>This product is nothing more than some lotion inside a big band-aid.  </li>
            <li>So i ordered two more recently because the results from just using it once had gone away.</li>
            <li>My first set of wraps</li>
            <li>When wraps are purchased through Amazon or Ebay there is no guarantee that they will work because they are more than likely expired product that someone is just trying to get rid of</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to buy the lotion if you are a first time buyer.</li>
            <li>How much longer will you wait around to see if this opportunity is worth your time?</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see results with my first wrap either.</li>
            <li>I was fooled into thinking it would make a difference, I&#x27;ve used all four wraps exactly the way they recommended</li>
            <li>Ok so I been following everything that people have told me to do .</li>
            <li>I am glad I only paid $50 for my 4pk.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>While I did not initally lose many inches, I can definitely feel a difference.</li>
            <li>I just did the first wrap and lost almost 2 inches.</li>
            <li>The first time I wore it for the 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once I get some extra money I will get more.</li>
            <li>I ordered it through amazon which I probably shouldn&#x27;t have in the first place,.</li>
            <li>i followed the instructions to the TEE.. and guess what.. i lost 3 inches of my waist with the first wrap (within 3 days)</li>
            <li>then after my second wrap i lost 2 more inches (3 days)</li>
            <li>Followed exactly what was instructed.</li>
            <li>I first purchase the it work wraps about a month in a ago</li>
            <li>I went from 40\\&quot; to now a 29\\&quot; at first</li>
            <li>So when I tried on my first wrap heres how I did it:    </li>
            <li>and omg you could definitely tell something magical happened</li>
            <li>Do first check recommendations for use online.</li>
            <li>When I first started I thought....</li>
            <li>my results were visible with the first wrap and only got better with each wrap.</li>
            <li>I am much more regular now.</li>
            <li>I took a hot shower exfoliated &amp; then wrapped myself.</li>
            <li>nothing.not So much as an inch!</li>
            <li>but as of now absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li>&amp; they also said of you don&#x27;t lose inches on the first wrap</li>
            <li>Lost  4 inches the first time.</li>
            <li>Really does help to tone and tighten up!</li>
            <li>It was fast shipping!</li>
            <li>First of all you have to drink lots of water it helps keep you hydrated and gets the toxins out of your body.</li>
            <li>The first time I wrapped I didn&#x27;t see any results, I was at a wrap party drinking wine and eating nachos...</li>
            <li>I did three more wraps and followed the protocal and lost several inches.</li>
            <li>I was hovering around 120 when I did my first wrap.  </li>
            <li>so I rubbed it in and put the tank top back on.  </li>
            <li>Once I got the first package..</li>
            <li>First wrap for 45 minutes then</li>
            <li>Did exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li>I got this product through here because I didn&#x27;t want to become a royal customer or pay retail price without trying it first.</li>
            <li>, don&#x27;t be discouraged if you are not amazed the morning after your first applicator, you will continue to get results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do your research online don&#x27;t just sit back and accept the aging process, age gracefully and keep your youthful appearance by taking care of your skin, eat healthy, exercise and keep the weight down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased and used it exactly how the instructions said, but it did not work at all.</li>
            <li>I only drink water and I eat healthy and workout to start with</li>
            <li>Not sorry.</li>
            <li>me preface that I&#x27;m a relatively healthy person prior to trying the wraps out.  </li>
            <li>There is no guarantee in the wraps you purchase otherwise and more than likely</li>
            <li>Drink water during and 72 hours after and you will see a difference ;)</li>
            <li>they should really change their slogan!</li>
            <li>This product really does work!  </li>
            <li>I lost 4 inches around my waist with the first wrap.  </li>
            <li>and well im bearly on my first day</li>
            <li>First off</li>
            <li>because I read so many mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>Everyone wants to try these!</li>
            <li>Just to let you know this product of the wraps is not entirely meant to lose the weight/pounds, it is more focused on tightening, firming and toning.</li>
            <li>Product really does WORK!</li>
            <li>Hope this helped you ;)</li>
            <li>So, yes, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve lost some inches, but it&#x27;s ALL from diarrhea and fluid</li>
            <li>Needless to say I wasn&#x27;t that impressed.</li>
            <li>I have 3 more wraps left to go.</li>
            <li>Lost 3\\&quot; in 45 minutes after first wrap.  </li>
            <li>so I was willing to try.  </li>
            <li>Seller was very responsive and accomadating!</li>
            <li>It might not work after the first wrap for some of us</li>
            <li>I did everything by the book, drank tons of water, ate healthy, slept with it on, showered before I put it on to open my pores, &amp; I kept them on for 6</li>
            <li>So upon hearing all they hype surrounding the ItWorks product, I&#x27;m thinking &amp;#34;I only have a few pounds to loose, I eat realtively healthy, and drink water 90 percent of the day anyway&amp;#34; I am a perfect candiate for this product..</li>
            <li>I became a loyal customer to get the discounts on the products, earn 10% of my spending in future product, and receive free shipping.</li>
            <li>A complete hoax!!!!</li>
            <li>I used it right before my vacation, and taking photo on my vacation, I  could really see the difference in the photo&#x27;s</li>
            <li>have been eating right and doing as much as i can to lose weight</li>
            <li>These wraps are a first to market product from It Works and should only be bought through Independent Distributors to ensure you are getting a good, reliable product.  </li>
            <li>After more research you are supposed to drink half your body weight in water and work on eating clean.  </li>
            <li>I did two of these, kept one on over night, drank plenty of water, ate clean, and developed &amp;#34;toxic bloat&amp;#34; afterwards.</li>
            <li>I need my money back please or if possible you can compensate me with another good product.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day, the only thing that really works is eating healthy and exercising.</li>
            <li>She saw no difference in the skin, tightening, firming, tone or any positive change in her measurements.</li>
            <li>am waiting your positive reply.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>Huge results were not expected just something; even a 1/2 inch..</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  </li>
            <li>First off, we all know by now there is no secret to weight loss.</li>
            <li>First time I got it straight from it</li>
            <li>You pretty much have to drink water around the clock, which I did.</li>
            <li>After my first application I did not notice much of a difference in my problem area.  </li>
            <li>It seems flimsy at first, but is actually very durable.  </li>
            <li>the company was nice just not worth the money</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I followed every instruction, including the &#x60;tips online&#x27; that you see (ie exfoliation, hot shower, leaving it on, not working out after, drinking nearly a gal of water each day, etc) to a T..... and lo and behold, I GAINED an inch?!?!?!</li>
            <li>i will definitely be getting more in the near future and the price is better than anybody else&#x27;s...</li>
            <li>Who wants to pay a real high price for something not knowing if its gonna work or not?</li>
            <li>Not completely but wow amazing.</li>
            <li>; for a night out, you can make your own wraps for less that 5 bucks by looking it up on pinterest.</li>
            <li>I left it on while I slept (8 hours or so), drank the water and followed my normal diet of eating healthy</li>
            <li>I will use them (in conjunction with my normal healthy diet and exercise) to flatten my tummy a bit before I go to the beach next month.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal customer and mine were purchased directly from It Works.</li>
            <li>Then I made sure i was dry</li>
            <li>Product is good for being smaller for a day other wise waste of money.</li>
            <li>change my diet, stop eating after a certain time</li>
            <li>This may work for someone else, but certainly it did not work for me.</li>
            <li>It was worth the $50 just to get out of it early!</li>
            <li>I now measure 37 and 33, cant wait to measure again in a few hours to see how much more i lost!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use them to loose more.</li>
            <li>hehe right in time to show off my new dress this weekend  hehe ^.^....</li>
            <li>but I definitely felt more confident when wearing tight shirts.</li>
            <li>Wish having a flat stomach was easy as wrapping up like one of dexters victims</li>
            <li>In I can Honestly say they werent dried out or old first off !</li>
            <li>so i stopped telling people and enjoy when they notice how good i look as i age and feel sorry for them)</li>
            <li>then you are missing out on wholesale pricing, free products, and free shipping, as well as customer</li>
            <li>When I was ready to use it</li>
            <li>very disapointed, did not see any results.</li>
            <li>if i dont see any results after spending all this money i will be very upset.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t notice much if any difference</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to losing inches off my stomach.</li>
            <li>I think in order to keep the inches off you have to spend a WHOLE bunch of money and use the wraps every 3 days forever, oh an</li>
            <li>I wanted so much for these to work...</li>
            <li>I do believe I should have bought it off the actual site and got t money&#x27;s worth instead of trying to get the best deal with the wrong results , I know now.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both used these wraps and they did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Really bummed this didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>again it gave me a rash and it to much money 69.00 for four  wrap you got to be kidding me.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see any difference on my thighs</li>
            <li>looked much smoother and firmer.</li>
            <li>Did absolutely NOTHING.</li>
            <li>it took about a day or so to really notice them</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I Really wanted it to work though.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t stay in place very well, even using cling wrap to keep it in place.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>none of my clothes fit any different and even after the 3-4 days, nothing.</li>
            <li>I lost absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>The product really does work.</li>
            <li>I used the whole box as advertised and got no results what so ever.</li>
            <li>All this and free shipping on your autoship after your third month.</li>
            <li>I am very obset</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>Thanks for ripping me off...</li>
            <li>but this did absolutely nothing for me except&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li>Instead, I have started to use the ItWorks body wraps and have done detoxed while on the wraps and it has helped me so so much.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>But this thing really doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>However my friends who have had children raved about how much their stretch marks faded.</li>
            <li>They absolutely work.</li>
            <li>thanks anyway.</li>
            <li>It really worked .</li>
            <li>If you really want a flatter stomach , you know what it takes.</li>
            <li>GET REAL</li>
            <li>I didnt really weigh myself before doing the</li>
            <li>and it really worked.</li>
            <li>After the 45min was up I unwrapped myself and discovered my skin was much tighter.</li>
            <li>To spend about $400.00 at the cost of $100.00 per package of four to get results, I really did not want to spend that much money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m waiting on my kit to arrive so that I can really get in to it since my friend let me borrow one of her wrap to try..</li>
            <li>works very well if you follow and keep up with the guidelines</li>
            <li>I followed all instructions, drank a lot of water and laid still the whole time.  </li>
            <li>It was a total waste of money, I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t spend any more than $30 on this.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference but after the 4th Wrap, I lost about 6 inches.</li>
            <li>and I know that they really truly don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I actually tried this once at a party for free.</li>
            <li>Thanks ..</li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d try this out after so much hype about it.</li>
            <li>After I had hit that purchase button, I started getting doubts, not so much in the product, but the fact that I was buying it from Amazon and not from a real distributor.</li>
            <li>didnt react weel to the ingredients because there&#x27;s too much junk.    </li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s because you probably dont have that much fat</li>
            <li>I believe that these may not work as well for some as much as others.</li>
            <li>well I don&#x27;t need that much water</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see that much of a change in my stomach area</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Just thought I would try them since I have heard so much about this product.</li>
            <li>This was my month of doing &amp;#34;sit ups&amp;#34;, so I expected this to help even more.</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing tor me.  </li>
            <li>and I drank so much water.</li>
            <li>folks.&lt;br /&gt;You know what really works?</li>
            <li>soo much.</li>
            <li>It did not do much for me.</li>
            <li>Straight to the points</li>
            <li>I tried for a whole month, i saw nothing.</li>
            <li>This product really works, i would have never believed it unti</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make much of a difference for me.</li>
            <li>very painful..itchy</li>
            <li>I did the whole treatment plan every 72 hours and used the cream in between.  </li>
            <li>thanks MARY Morris</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much if anything at all</li>
            <li>They work really well.</li>
            <li>You really lose nothing by trying out this product.</li>
            <li>but it really works</li>
            <li>It really does work....</li>
            <li>really does work....</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why your distributor tells you to drink so much darn water.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I did not wrap correctly or maybe I have too much that needs to disappear.</li>
            <li>They really do work.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice any change....</li>
            <li>I too really wanted this product to work.  </li>
            <li>I tried these wraps twice and kept them on once for the whole night.</li>
            <li>did absolutely nothing...</li>
            <li>Not as drastic as advertised but definitely worth trying a few more</li>
            <li>I was looking for this specific wrap since I was introduced to it last year and wanted to find it on my own and not have to depend on some messagist to do it for me...</li>
            <li>this is the key to keeping your body young and healthy as it ages and also hormones.</li>
            <li>The applicators were brown which are obviously old DISSAPOINTED!!!</li>
            <li>to maintain im drinking brazilian slimming tea, google or search in here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it for a super detox, and drank detox tea, it work, but the weight come back really fast!</li>
            <li>You can just get a package and join their loyal customer program for free and get half of the price.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m starting to get excited again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this applicator box is helping me just get my skin back to it&#x27;s original tightness.</li>
            <li>I used the other two on my arms which are so much better.</li>
            <li>, it contains BHT a substance banned in most other countries.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t stopped eating the way I normally do, and they still work!</li>
            <li>im ordering another box coz it really works for me, highly recomend it</li>
            <li>I followed the directions on it very carefully and after my first one I had already lost 1 inch on my belly!!!</li>
            <li>But trying one wrap really isn&#x27;t going to prove anything because it&#x27;s only a partial treatment, and lots of people don&#x27;t keep going if they don&#x27;t see an amazing change with one wrap, but rather assume nothing happened.</li>
            <li>I will explain the ingredients, the way the product is supposed to be applied, the way the product is designed to work, the way the product may affect the body, what to expect from the Ultimate Body Applicator after 1st application (1/4 of a FULL treatment) and what they need to do to have</li>
            <li>I personally lost a full pant size after wrapping my tummy 3 times in just 9 days.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I&#x27;m female, late twenties, 5&#x27;8\\&quot;, 160, 23% body fat with most concentrated on my \\&quot;pouch\\&quot; and love handles.</li>
            <li>Hey guys I just want to say that I tried several products from It Works and really liked them all especially since their all made from natural</li>
            <li>for research if you are interested: skin: use Vit D oil and Emu oil // hormones: use natural bio-identicalhormones from a compound pharmacy, have ALL of your hormones tested (estrogen/testoserone/progesterone) //</li>
            <li>It makes me sad to say it because I love how much friends I have love and believe in them and how they have worked for them</li>
            <li>/&gt;And if you are not following the instructions and advice of a Distributor (like how much water to drink, how often to wrap, diet, exercise, avoiding toxins) then you are more than likely not going to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as the product is concerned, today is the first day I applied the wrap to my abdomen and saran-wrapped my abdomen to keep the wrap in place.</li>
            <li>used all 4 over course of a month, wrapped properly &amp; with plastic wrap to hold it on, kept on full time, etc.  </li>
            <li>As an Itworks distributor, it is very important that consumers are receiving the proper instruction that is to accompany the use of our Ultimate Body Applicator.</li>
            <li>It does work and there is a strict policy that these products cannot be sold other than the original company site!</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re going on a hot date or want to look a little skinnier in a little dress, this is great for that one night.</li>
            <li>The inches fell off and I felt like a whole new person.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re a whole new person.</li>
            <li>Honestly the wrap did nothing &amp;#34;inches&amp;#34; wise, but for some reason this weird thing made my tiger stripe dark stretch marks become like my normal skin color!</li>
            <li>Do your research and take supplements daily, figure out what works for you or see a natural dr and get tested on all of the vitamins and supplements for accurate dosaging.  </li>
            <li>After 12 days, my mid-section looked more defined and less flabby.</li>
            <li>It less, work out and follow a healthy lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li>Used 3 wraps, and even though I didn&#x27;t take measurements, I felt less jiggley and fit into my swimsuit with confidence!</li>
            <li>belly from having three kids as well as the effects of getting older.</li>
            <li>Which made me move more and left my body in massive pain.</li>
            <li>* that only the top portion of my abdomen is left that way.)</li>
            <li>but they actually came more than a week earlier!</li>
            <li>You are constantly seeing ads on how to make your face look younger, your body look better.</li>
            <li>I used exactly as directed and left the first patch on for hours longer than the minimum time.  </li>
            <li>I also wonder how many of the reviews are written by people who actually sell the wraps and not by actual customers.</li>
            <li>I am reading so many mixed reviews on here and am guessing that it affects everyone differently.</li>
            <li>helping with stretch marks is to take a shower prior to wrapping to open your pores so that it works better.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off following diet and SIMPLE exercise plan.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before- be realistic.  </li>
            <li>ordered this product about a month ago an never received it, be careful because i honestly think this stuff is a scam, i exercise and workout daily</li>
            <li>like I was supposed to, eat decently and still did not lose these.</li>
            <li>Antioxidants: consume mass quantities of these particularly Glutathione, astaxanthin, Vit C, Vit D...</li>
            <li>being pregnant 2x in the last 2 years I couldn&#x27;t try it.</li>
            <li>I lost only an inch with the first wrap, but my second wrap I list more and my stretch marks faded to barely anything!</li>
            <li>High hopes.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend buying just ONE to see if you like it</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone undergoing weight loss surgery</li>
            <li>As for the product, I saw results after applying only the first 2 wraps &amp; was in disbelief!</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll order straight from a distributor to insure fresh batch and not waste my money!  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do anything except cause me pretty major discomfort.</li>
            <li>(I have never had one before in my life &amp; I am 50 years old!!).  </li>
            <li>but i thought it would work a little better, i even drank the water.</li>
            <li>Since the moment I got the package which was opened  till the moment when I I pened the envelop  and noticed that the stripes were much dry than the original package.</li>
            <li>To celebrate, I bought myself two new dresses and a new pair of pants!  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend buying from a distributed anyways not from this site because you will be get the real deal any these products here could be old</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need to lose much size to make the dress work, so I threw everything I had at it as far as working out, eating, water and these things went.  </li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your money on a membership to IT WORKS, because it really does NOT work.</li>
            <li>Mine was from bell_shop and so far I really trust the.</li>
            <li>Ok to use short term but not for long term use as they are a bit pricey.</li>
            <li>It took forever for it to come and when it finally did arrive the box was pretty much destroyed and faded like it had been sitting around for years.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work waste of time and money better off going to dr fisher shrink like 1 inch</li>
            <li>Glad I wasted my money.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and can&#x27;t seem to get rid of the extra baggage no matter what you try, this may be worth a shot.</li>
            <li>After using the box of 4 wraps, I definitetly noticed my mid-section looked more toned and firm.</li>
            <li>just some dimpled skin I wanted to look more firm.</li>
            <li>I ended up having to wrap a few layers of plastic wrap around my body to keep it in place, and they work better when you wear them overnight.</li>
            <li>I wasted more than 80 bucks on something that doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Overall I think I had some improvement in my skin as far as firming but for the price it wasn&#x27;t enough of an improvement to buy more.  </li>
            <li>These wraps are pretty much just compressing your fat temporarily not getting rid of it, so 2 days after your wrap you are back a square one.</li>
            <li>People need to remember that the wraps tighten and firm but its supposed to go along with healthy eating and exercise.</li>
            <li>and I had saw a nurse friend and she looked at it and told me how to deal with it and that if it didn&#x27;t get better in a few days..to see a doctor.  </li>
            <li>they are normally 25 for 1.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because because I have lost a good amount of weight and I am not happy with the way my stomach looks still</li>
            <li>I only lost a little bit but that&#x27;s better than nothing!</li>
            <li>but I was assured to get my money back or receive a new fresh replacement.</li>
            <li>Well the only reason she saw a difference in her problem area is because she started eating right and excercising.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I lost 2 inches and it came right back in 2 days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually wearing it right now</li>
            <li>but after three days it was right back.  </li>
            <li>dont&#x27;s of wrapping in order to use them properly to get the right results.</li>
            <li>But so far, I think it&#x27;s either a fantastic hoax or it only works on certain people for various reasons.</li>
            <li>but yes it came right back by the end of the 4th day.</li>
            <li>I bought this being a little skeptical on how much it would really work, but i saw a lot of before and afters that were impressive!</li>
            <li>I would recommend to wear some type of cincher or tight compression because I honestly think that helps considering I didn&#x27;t see the difference when I tried it on the back of my thighs with no compression.</li>
            <li>everyone&#x27;s results will not be the same and U must follow instructions such as drinking half your body weight in water, also no 20proof or above drinks and the best results are achieved by sleeping in the wrap and not sweating,,,, sweat clogs the pores and and U will not see the proper results</li>
            <li>The feeling is very tingly, like Icy Hot, but not as intense.  </li>
            <li>Invest in a new work-out outfit instead.</li>
            <li>it looked brand new.</li>
            <li>I am not one to break out when using a new lotion or body wash or anything like that</li>
            <li>Worked better than expected after the second wrap!!</li>
            <li>And since I spent the money I will most likely use them up, but I don&#x27;t expect any results and will be wasting my time.</li>
            <li>Those were pretty easy, the not working out was hard as it&#x27;s my job</li>
            <li>I think product was very old, the packaging looked &amp;#34;shop worn&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Sent in a very old box.</li>
            <li>I used TWO at once (despite the supposed rule of only using one your first time) at the recommendation of a consultant.  </li>
            <li>and I woke up the first morning and was 3 inches smaller.</li>
            <li>my strech marks had faded considerably!</li>
            <li>However by the end of the first night the inches were back.  </li>
            <li>These are probably better suited for someone with a small amount of stubborn belly fat.</li>
            <li>After 72 hours, I applied my second wrap, exactly the same as the first.  </li>
            <li>Worked the exact same as these wraps did.</li>
            <li>If at all possible, the first time, I will wrap the client myself</li>
            <li>had results on the first try, but for some it can take up to 4 applications, I saw results from my 1st and 2nd application.</li>
            <li>but I was the exact same.  </li>
            <li>let me first start out by saying that i did not use the ultimate body kit.</li>
            <li>but i measure the exact same after all four wraps.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how it would have worked for sooooooooooooo many others and not for me, or as the coaches and distributors online say that it works for 90-95% of people.</li>
            <li>First of all, I figured my wraps would arrive in the same type of box as advertised in the photo.</li>
            <li>I have tried one wrap so far, through a distributor, and have been blown away!</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s a pretty simple concept.  </li>
            <li>but this was not a waste!</li>
            <li>It simply didn&#x27;t work and I followed every direction exactly.</li>
            <li>And lastly, I bought the box it came exactly as packaged.</li>
            <li>but so far it worked for me!</li>
            <li>My wraps definitely worked, but they only last a couple days at MOST.</li>
            <li>So I bought the product to try it out and lost 2 inches in my first 45 minutes and 1/2 inch 72 hours later.</li>
            <li>and I did not see results at first, but the second time I drank plenty of water</li>
            <li>and Im excited to see where I will be once the box is empty!</li>
            <li>Started to use it just because my daughter was is getting married and used it for three months I lost total of 14 pounds</li>
            <li>First off, I had bought a package at $129.50 for 4 wraps..which I only ever used the 1.  </li>
            <li>I used the first one then waited 72 hours and did the second.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions to a T (hot shower, even scrubbed my skin with a skin brush before hand, left them on well over 2 hours.)  </li>
            <li>i would recommend buying fron natural way!</li>
            <li>I used the first wrap for only 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I lost one inch around my waist after the first use, but only temporarily.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried one for 45 mins, I actually gained inches after I took it off.</li>
            <li>get out and dry myself off completely.&lt;br /&gt;Measure myself and then draw the lines where I put the measuring tape (Which was freezing at this point because I took a steaming hot shower!)</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest not to engage in any sort of business with a company that cares so little about their customers and does not take responsibility for the repercussions of their products.</li>
            <li>then I tried the 2nd one 72 hours latter and decided to see if the water thing was true and...</li>
            <li>but I did not use the other wraps for fear I would have a full on break out.</li>
            <li>Received wraps quickly, shipper contacted me a few times and was very knowledgeable.  </li>
            <li>In addition, due to the natural makeup of the ingredients, these products need to be stored in cool (not refrigerated) temperature.</li>
            <li>The area is large and you can cut the wrap if you want to cover a smaller area than your abs.  </li>
            <li>The skin healing has no reason to reverse itself, but the fat cell shrinkage will slowly return, but not fully until anywhere from 3-6 months (depending on your diet) if you aren&#x27;t wrapping.&lt;br /&gt;The loyal customer program through an actual distributor not only cheaper, but you earn 10% rewards each month if you remain a customer for fourmonths or more, you get a $50 credit if you remain for 6 months, and a $150 credit if you remain for 12 months.</li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t shown drastic results like many others (I would only loose an inch at a time) it has helped me with my confidence levels a lot because I actually see results!</li>
            <li>But, that&#x27;s too hard for most</li>
            <li>I ordered this box because it was a low price, much lower than getting it directly from It</li>
            <li>and there were clearly visible results that have lasted.  </li>
            <li>, you could tell it was old</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it worked and am eager to try another.</li>
            <li>These things really work, but you can get them cheaper if you buy locally.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve finally found something that really does.</li>
            <li>Tried three wraps so far and no results.</li>
            <li>It works is not a miracle but works, I have 4 kids I am 40 years old</li>
            <li>The wraps have a temporary effect, but the only way to make a real change is to put in the sweat equity.</li>
            <li>The Lucalean wraps work for me and they are much cheaper with a money back guarantee.</li>
            <li>Afterall, she&#x27;s in her early 20s, and I&#x27;m in my mid-30s.</li>
            <li>im a slim young lady...~_~</li>
            <li>They are made with ALL NATURAL, nonGMO ingredients and have a shelf life.</li>
            <li>do a thing for me, I would not waste money on them again</li>
            <li>I would not waste the money on this ever again.</li>
            <li>, this is all natural and DOES expire.</li>
            <li>that I thought for sure I&#x27;d see at least a 1&amp;#34;-2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Looked like it was old.</li>
            <li>and you are not following the directions and advice of a distributor (how much water to drink, toxins to avoid, taking before and after pictures).  </li>
            <li>please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>But I did with my second and continued to see them from there on out, not every wrap, but very gradually.</li>
            <li>I do believe that some people&#x27;s systems are very resistant, and there isn&#x27;t rhyme or reason as to why, but I also know people who are immune to the effects of different supplements and medications</li>
            <li>Do not waste money on this.</li>
            <li>The old adage about walking 30 mins a day and watching what you&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 5&amp;#34;5 and 150 lbs, which is my chubbiest point so far</li>
            <li>My wife bought these and they did not have a expiration date on box.. looked like it was rubbed off to hide how old it was..</li>
            <li>the brown lotion on the wrap was not lotion.. it was clumps of dried up light brown looking</li>
            <li>*.. would not recommend anyone buying from this person thats trying to sell old products..</li>
            <li>also, you definitely need to put saran wrap over the wrap as it really doesn&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t have reps like the IT WORKS brand-it&#x27;s all direct sales from their website</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>wow...</li>
            <li>My stomach is so much tighter and seems to continue to tighten up five days later.</li>
            <li>They do not WORK DO NOT WASTE YOUT MONEY</li>
            <li>The wraps were either expired or old.</li>
            <li>That made me think that at the end of the three days I would definitely have lost a couple of pounds because drinking that much water curbs your appetite.  </li>
            <li>Also, you can leave it on longer than 45mins, even over night while you sleep, but another big tip is to take pictures to really see results and changes.</li>
            <li>&amp; there were so many negative comments.</li>
            <li>My baby is now 6 months old</li>
            <li>I am not concerned using the products because they are all natural and organic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is common sense that you should eat healthy and be active.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It did make my skin soft though.</li>
            <li>Anytime someone offers you the opportunity to sell a item your trying to buy</li>
            <li>girls boys do not waste your time, do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; 145 lbs and wanted to try to lose my belly fat this winter while busy with fulltime school and work.  </li>
            <li>The wraps I got directly from It</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>MSM, glucosimine, chondroitan, DIM, Alpha lipoic acid,silica, biotin, krill oil, wheat grass....</li>
            <li>Natural things...</li>
            <li>I did order them directly through an ItWorks</li>
            <li>All this did was make my skin soft where applied.</li>
            <li>Complete gimmick.</li>
            <li>and wow amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And this product is also meant for the situations of stretch marks, cellulite, or that pouch from pregnacy that just wont go away even exersicing on a regular basis because that skin has been strectch so much.</li>
            <li>I will change my rating once I complete all 4 wraps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 17, 2013&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only way you&#x27;ll see real results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not heavy at all, I just had a baby 2 weeks ago and was hoping to help my skin on my belly, it didn&#x27;t NOTHING.</li>
            <li>the last 2 years we&#x27;ve been featured in Forbes, Inc. 500 Fastest Growing Companies, Success From Home Magazine (3 entire issues) and now the Wall Street Journal because of our explosive growth.</li>
            <li>I got these and although weird to put on, I liked that they really seemed to help make my skin appear smoother.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research on them before hand and was told that while wearing them and the next few days to make sure I in took a lot of water, and I did, and still nothing.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re curious and really want to try these, this is definitely cheaper than buying them from other places but honestly there are no magic pills, powders or wraps and we all know it to be true.  </li>
            <li>I measured and looked the same as before - right after the wrap, the next day and the two days after that.  </li>
            <li>but it came right back by the next day.  </li>
            <li>It definitely shrunk me and toned me up for a couple days and then things went right back to where they were.  </li>
            <li>With my skin the way that it is they sink in so pretty much if I were to roll a black roller paint brush over my stomach</li>
            <li>i mean eating healthy, or get</li>
            <li>Have wanted to try these out, haven&#x27;t had any dramatic results, but it helps with getting some finer definition on my stomach, works best if you at least bike or walk while wearing it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not right all the pics iv seen had huge results there was a big difference but didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li>Apparently this is a common &amp;#34;theme&amp;#34;  with many of their reps.</li>
            <li>So I took my chances, and left my first wrap on the entire 8 hours.  </li>
            <li>Tried another wrap two days later and left on even longer than the first time.  </li>
            <li>I like this product , but it dosent last long without diet and exercise your stomach will go back to its original size</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this product because no matter how much excercise &amp; clean eating, I cant lose the loose skin &amp; slight budge brought on by child birth.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t see a change in the texture of my skin other than it feeling moisturized right after the wrap.  </li>
            <li>Though the product is good and this 4 pack was &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;, I could tell it was not as &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; or had as much product on it as other wraps I&#x27;ve purchased in the past from other sellers.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it burned me, or if I had some sort of allergic reaction but I highly prefer not to have a huge red mark on my stomach FOR LIFE then to lose a few inches for a week!</li>
            <li>Diet (not eating anything fried, greasy filled with excessive sugar or drinking alcohol or tons of caffeine as well), drinking at least half your weight in ounces each day, ensuring the skin as clean and free of any lotions, etc. 9</li>
            <li>And it felt like icy hot.</li>
            <li>my stomach legs and arms appeared much larger than they normally were.</li>
            <li>proves that everyone has different results for different products and You must know how to use these products properly so wrap it up and see those results</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what I expected..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like rubbing icy hot on your body.    </li>
            <li>Mix icy hot on a cloth bandage with some self-tanner and you&#x27;ve got a homemade wrap.</li>
            <li>It feels like icy hot product and she wraps me up with Saran Wrap for an hour.</li>
            <li>A true gimmick, a waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;do</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping to get back down to my original size 8/10... keeping fingers crossed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping to get back down to my original size 8/10... keeping fingers crossed.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see much of difference besides my skin feeling a little softer.</li>
            <li>I just received my new box which I am going to use on my inner thighs.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve only seen photo evidence, not in person evidence because my friends that use them live out of state.)  </li>
            <li>I really was just looking for a jump start as I started getting back into an moderate exercise routine.</li>
            <li>The wraps have really helped with the saggy skin I have left around and under my belly button area, and has had an overall smoothing effect.  </li>
            <li>I really dont like giving neg.reviews if I dont like a product I still try and find some positive in it, BUT THIS PRODUCT FOR 80$ was soooo not worth it,it didnt stick to my body,the lotion was just no good and the material was cheap cloth......</li>
            <li>Get up off your lazy butt, hit the gym or a trail, starting prepping healthy meals that will last you for atleast 2 days, I always post this in my reviews</li>
            <li>Get up off your lazy butt, hit the gym or a trail, starting prepping healthy meals that will last you for atleast 2 days, I always post this in my reviews</li>
            <li>I tried it-lost a couple of inches the first day, was the same measurements as I started on the second day and  gained an inch after using it the second day-</li>
            <li>In my personal opinion this product is a complete scam!</li>
            <li>I am not extremely overweight</li>
            <li>One thing specifically is a diuretic, which causes MAJOR dehydration.  </li>
            <li>When I called customer service several times yesterday, there was no live person only a recorded message that no one is available due to the \\&quot;high volume of</li>
            <li>From this seller, they were pretty dry, and that&#x27;s why the botanical&#x27;s didn&#x27;t infuse properly.</li>
            <li>It may work for someone else but for myself this is yet another failed attempt at weight loss without the actual exercise, eating healthy regime that is required in life to actually have success.  </li>
            <li>Of course the review was very negative and suggested Lucalean as a better option.  </li>
            <li>So as I squeak every time I walk, can barely sit down because I&#x27;ve wrapped myself up so tight in saran wrap trying to make sure I don&#x27;t lose it</li>
            <li>72 hours after each wrap you may see a slight difference, but it goes right back to normal even with enhanced diet and exercise the results do not last over 3 days.</li>
            <li>I usually buy these wraps for special events or vacations.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, the herbs used caused me to have an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>I barely passed the practice test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Im only 14 years old</li>
            <li>but when drinking that much water I expected to go alot.</li>
            <li>Took only 2 applications for satisfactory results and after 3 apps ALL the dimples on my rear are completely gone.</li>
            <li>I look like a 16 year old (from the back).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done 4 so far and have not seen any results even though I&#x27;ve followed the instructions religiously.</li>
            <li>I put on a wrap, drink water and detox juice for the entire day and the following two days I eat light meals with a lot of water (3L) and green tea (to boost the metabolism).</li>
            <li>I could have died with anaphlyactic reactions and apparently that does not warrant a refund because I \\&quot;used their product.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, I have tried all 4 of my wraps, and never really saw much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>The four wraps I received was definitely and old batch.</li>
            <li>I think I should be a complete refund for customer because they do not work properly</li>
            <li>So far I have only used one wrap</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work; apparently it&#x27;s a downline thing and shouldn&#x27;t be on Amazon at all.</li>
            <li>I have only used this product one time thus far...</li>
            <li>Barely lost anything.</li>
            <li>Looked old, package that contained wraps was open when I received it.</li>
            <li>It may not be a complete fix for extra skin</li>
            <li>The actual patches seemed to be old</li>
            <li>I will write another review once I complete the entire package.</li>
            <li>Tried it again 72 hours later &amp; left it on much longer - no further resulst.  </li>
            <li>I lost one inch in my waist and hips with my first wrap and no difference with the second, and I did drink a ton if water almost two gallons a day, I never even used the other two because I figured the hassle of sleeping in the wrap wasn&#x27;t worth not losing anything, but my skin did appear to be a little bit tighter...</li>
            <li>I thought that seemed pretty shady and a little familiar</li>
            <li>i will certainly recommend it to other people-</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t lose inches right away but by the next morning I was down.  </li>
            <li>right Britney, you just wasted your money what were you thinking?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didnt really see big results I guess, but did loose couple of inches in my waist</li>
            <li>I tried the wrap and sus lose a few inches, but, it left a huge red mark on my stomach that is still there 2 years later!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend further research to those interested in purchasing anything from this shady company.</li>
            <li>It did not do what was promised, did not loose any inches at all with all four wraps.</li>
            <li>All you other people like me trying to be skinny fast, look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>I think that the product was probably expired, thus the much cheaper price compared to other sellers.  </li>
            <li>I struggle with drinking water and due to health issues can not do any intense exercise.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference other than softer skin.</li>
            <li>Other then the price it does really work&lt;</li>
            <li>I do not see no single changes in my belly .</li>
            <li>I think this a good product for detoxing and you might see a few inches loss but its not a magic wrap, your not going to loose extra weight just by doing these wraps.</li>
            <li>so you dont go back to the same old blah</li>
            <li>representatives talked to me like I was the biggest dummy in the world, incapable of following even the simplest of instructions, and basically were saying that if the wraps didn&#x27;t work it was my own fault for doing something wrong.</li>
            <li>Of you are thin and tan and have trouble with dry belly skin, this may be great for you.  </li>
            <li>No soap or lotion on the area, hot shower or brush skin to open pores, place wrap then seal with ceran or a constriction garment, no exercise and drink half your body weight in water oz.&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Skipping ahead, I report that not only have my arms and back fat firmed, tightened, and shrank to a considerably noticeable degree after only 2 wraps</li>
            <li>And when I asked to cancel..as I certainly didn&#x27;t plan to subject myself to anymore pain..</li>
            <li>She&#x27;d kept urging me to try it, but I thought (just like I have about so many other products) that just because it worked for her didn&#x27;t mean it would for me.</li>
            <li>I took a steaming hot shower to open my pours (after reading a little into this</li>
            <li>, im about to order me other warps high recommended</li>
            <li>I was highly disappointed because I&#x27;ve seen such great reviews on it</li>
            <li>The wraps I got from here were far from dry.  </li>
            <li>absolutely nothing changed after wearing it for an hour and a half.  </li>
            <li>much cheaper (less than $28</li>
            <li>last time I bought and you can get at least 3 full body wraps from one jar)</li>
            <li>I am a sucker for a quick fix.....</li>
            <li>So I ordered two more boxes of wraps but this time I ordered from seller EYEWEAR PHARMACY and let me to u buyer beware the wrap was so dry that it look like they where outdated and the wraps did not work as well so do not buy from eyewear pharmacy</li>
            <li>, i sleep with a cami on, tight enough so it wont move around much, in the morning</li>
            <li>It took two wraps for me to really figure out how to apply the wrap tight enough.</li>
            <li>pure waste of my money.</li>
            <li>These little miracles really do work.</li>
            <li>Two days after my second wrap, my neighbor came up to me and asked me if I have some sort of shrinking disorder because I had become so thin so quickly!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been down that road countless times, and like so many other people, I don&#x27;t have money to waste like that.</li>
            <li>With reading 50/50 of good and bad reviews I decided to buy a four pack from the amazon warehouse for like 76 dollars.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> i have purchased the IT WORKS applicators from ebay and then also from amazon (i want to always try and get the best price, they always come in good condition and are perfectly fine and acceptable for use and fall within the expiration date).</li>
            <li> Good for slimming before an event.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s my biggest problem, to get a good price on the wraps, you have to sign up for a 3 month (minimum) membership, with an autoship each month.</li>
            <li> 1 star for good delivery time.</li>
            <li> Good Luck.</li>

            <li> It has work for me you just have to be consisted and follow a good diet and exercise .</li>
            <li> It smells really good.</li>
            <li> it fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> I watched testimonials of the good</li>
            <li> loved it</li>
            <li> I got these hoping to see some good results.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work good at all.</li>
            <li> (if you want good results this is a</li>
            <li> part of what we want in life should be to take good care of our health and</li>
            <li> Good health to you all.</li>
            <li> These work really good.</li>
            <li> I do know a lot of people swear it works and its good.</li>
            <li> Good luck to all.(1 inch after 1st wrap; 0.5 inch for each of the remaining wraps).</li>
            <li> Good luck to all.</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of good things about this product from reviews online, but when I tried them myself, they didn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li> It worked and I was very happy to fit into my 13 size jeans I haven&#x27;t been able to get into for 2 years!</li>
            <li> feel great and love my results.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> They are a great addition to a healthy diet for tightening up areas that store fat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I have very prominent stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I still love amazon because I have received great products.</li>
            <li> But why stood our most to me is how great it made my scar look.</li>
            <li> ; Very satisfied bought multi-pack Will use it again</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am happy and waiting for more wraps to come</li>
            <li> I honestly hoped those reviews that were good had some backing but</li>
            <li> had one of these wraps done at a salon for much more and was thrilled to find them on amazon at a great price.</li>
            <li> and I know my friends who have also bought these would buy more!</li>
            <li> Make sure to take before and after pictures!</li>
            <li> But proportion changed for sure with the pictures!</li>

            <li> There is a reason so many people are so successful with this.</li>
            <li> Should have known better!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> when I coulda used that on anything else of better value!</li>
            <li> and I did get some results which I love!  </li>
            <li> &amp;I didn&#x27;t have many to begin with!</li>
            <li> and I can feel myself shrinking more!  </li>
            <li> Well these work WAY better!</li>
            <li> I love these wraps!</li>

            <li> It really worked!!!!!  </li>
            <li> buy this product fast!!!!!</li>
            <li> these worked amazing on my stretchmarks and scars.</li>
            <li> Bought the four pack of this item after watching Youtube vidoes about how amazing this product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> after pictures they are amazing so amazing that I signed up</li>
            <li> Some people see amazing results, some people quit before they have a chance to get results.</li>
            <li> so I chose to represent this amazing brand.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any amazing results with these.</li>
            <li> Yet, the results were amazing</li>
            <li> This is AMAZING</li>
            <li> I have amazing results on this product,&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;It works&#x27;</li>
            <li> It smelled amazing, felt amazing.</li>
            <li> Do not buy it, no matter how many good reviews you may see.</li>
            <li> im glad that there ARE people who have seen results tho, good for them.</li>
            <li> That was my own foolish wishful thinking.  </li>
            <li> Nice people to deal with.</li>
            <li> Kind of a rip off of you ask me.</li>
            <li> I was honestly just hoping this would help with the pooch, not expecting it to be lipo by anymeans.....</li>
            <li> I did like the feeling of increased circulation in the areas and the smell was nice.  </li>
            <li> These wraps didn&#x27;t do a thing for me except give me the nice \\&quot;post detox bloat&#x27;\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell a difference by looking at her, though.  </li>
            <li> I was worried because it was kind of brown looking</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t honestly tell anyone to buy this.</li>
            <li> However, if you don&#x27;t use them correctly the wraps will not be effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He said &amp;#34; I wouldn&#x27;t have believe it if I hadn&#x27;t seen it with my own eyes&amp;#34</li>
            <li> if you wear nice clothes to work etc.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can develop your own schedule</li>
            <li> completely worth the money, i will be purchasing again!!!</li>
            <li> She seemed more impressed on her first use</li>
            <li> Seemed like a good idea, but maybe too good to be true.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to buy wraps, I would be more than happy to assist you in setting up a health and wellness plan to fit your needs.</li>
            <li> WOW (12 1/2&amp;#34; from a one hour wrap with 3 1/2&amp;#34; being from my belly (hehe Happy Dance, lol) .</li>
            <li> loyal customer program is great</li>
            <li> I watched the video and it seemed very easy to apply this wrap.  </li>
            <li> It did not work and all and the eucalyptus in it was very strong.</li>
            <li> The better you eat, the better the results!  </li>
            <li> You will feel better about yourself and you will feel better!</li>
            <li> but I could&#x27;ve gotten that with a sea salt scrub and lotion which is much more cost effective.  </li>
            <li> Best to use it on your day off so that you can utilize the restroom frequently and stay hydrated.  </li>
            <li> [...] for more info and to purchase these amazing wraps  [...]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy for the ones who have had success and wish I had lost inches, too.</li>
            <li> its wonderful so natural..</li>
            <li> I had heard and seen a lot of good things about the wraps but wanted to be able to test more than just one out without being committed to buying more from a consultant.</li>
            <li> Easy to follow directions and will use again if needed!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a permanent fix, but it makes me feel more confident and motivated to go work out more and continue eating better!</li>
            <li> Too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> Good product for a quick fix but not permenent.</li>
            <li> The lady who sells the Lucalean is super nice and answered all my questions when I ordered my own jar.</li>
            <li> I used all 4 and noticed a huge differance!</li>
            <li> Wish they would lower the price on these because I would buy more</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> I did drink more water.  </li>
            <li> I used these as part of some last-ditch efforts toward fitting in a bridesmaid dress when I was retaining water.  </li>
            <li> Listen people in order for these wraps to work you have to eat healthy, work out, drink plenty of water and cut out any junk food from your diet.</li>
            <li> I forgot the part about not using Dove soap &amp; lotion, I did drink the recommended amount of water &amp; resisted my love for energy drinks in those 3 days.</li>
            <li> I measures in at 34in, did more push-ups &amp; sit-ups and ran OK...</li>
            <li> this wrap encourages a healthy lifestyle as your diet &amp; water consumption must be up to par in order for it to work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clearly a must have :)</li>
            <li> Maybe it takes more than one application</li>
            <li> When I bought this I wasn&#x27;t in the business, and I personally liked the cheap price of it without having to sign up for anything like the company makes you.</li>
            <li> Many people say that they don&#x27;t lose any inches from this.</li>
            <li> I would love to have bought some more for my legs, arms, and chest, but I cannot afford that many.</li>
            <li> look much better</li>
            <li> and I love these.</li>
            <li> I love eucalyptus and didn&#x27;t mind the lotion/smell, but it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Put on a tight-fitting tank top and went to bed.  </li>
            <li> she was that confident).</li>
            <li> Neither one of us would have been able to sleep with them on.</li>
            <li> I have try many things and I was concern about this one</li>
            <li> some people think this is a magic paper that will make your fat or flab disappear in a matter of seconds.</li>
            <li> (How many times have you heard that in a movie film?</li>
            <li> (How many times have you heard that in a movie film?</li>
            <li> I am glad I did it but would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Let me just start off by saying that I LOVE the</li>
            <li> Message me for more info mariannav920@gmail.com</li>
            <li> Ok so I ordered these and had both my mom and sister try them out.</li>
            <li> Ok so they dont order from amazon ?</li>
            <li> od peoples faces hmm ok thx</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t sign up on some sort of program and spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li> You will lose more weight that way.</li>
            <li> Love it.......</li>
            <li> Nor did I keep a healthy diet.</li>
            <li> The price is definitely the best part of this.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s better to do this.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s more, is that our company is designed to provide ongoing support.</li>
            <li> : I rated this product 5 STARS because IT IS a 5 STAR product regardless of it being sold against company policies :) emeraldcoastwraps.com</li>
            <li> I LOVE the</li>
            <li> overweight and a saggy belly (but healthy).</li>
            <li> I made sure I used soap with no lotion in it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Made my stretch marks look much better (had them for 30 years).</li>
            <li> You would be better off with another product..just not this one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that some people are more toxic in their system and it takes a bit longer to see the drastic results they want.  </li>
            <li> Wanted to try it out to be sure,  </li>
            <li> Save your money, go to the gym, eat a high-protein diet and low-carb and you&#x27;ll get better results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try a couple more to see if they work or not</li>
            <li> There are more reputable companies and products out there that do not charge a membership.  </li>
            <li> Its just OKAY.</li>
            <li> There are so many drastic before and after pictures</li>
            <li> I had my period for most of it.</li>
            <li> and I used a form fitting garment instead of cellophane to see if it would work.</li>
            <li> Make sure you read reviews online of how it did and did not work for some people.</li>
            <li> i reviewd many web sites about body wraps.</li>
            <li> People love to say the results are temporary, but I&#x27;ve gone months without wrapping and the changes stick.</li>
            <li> Google them and you will find out from respectable sources like webmd.com that they are beneficial.</li>
            <li> -I don&#x27;t bid more than $56.00</li>
            <li> I have used the wraps and love them.</li>
            <li> In fact, I became more bloated.</li>
            <li> If you have more than 5 lbs to lose, exercise and choose a healthy diet, because these alone will not help you lose weight.</li>
            <li> But if you want to look more toned for an upcoming pool party or event, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> DIY body wraps and detoxing are the best way to go and show actual results</li>
            <li> I love these wraps.</li>
            <li> I had ordered just one several months ago and the items was great!</li>
            <li> Going to order some&lt;br /&gt;More :)</li>
            <li> so I said OK.</li>
            <li> but I love it</li>
            <li> These wraps are meant to aid eating better and drinking water.</li>
            <li> to help fit in a dress this is a nice addition.</li>
            <li> Sure.  </li>
            <li> But it won&#x27;t stick around for more than a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> It appears that they depend more on trapping you in a 3 month contract than on making satisfied customers.</li>
            <li> I love these wraps!worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I totally love this product.</li>
            <li> And I workout &amp; eat healthy.</li>
            <li> I am not one of these people looking for a magical  product that is going to poof</li>
            <li> like their defining gel that enhances the wrap results and diminishes the appearance of stretch marks and cellulite even more.</li>
            <li> just remember this rule \\&quot;the more</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t lost anything, in fact I feel more bloated then anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the whole program works great with the pills and the creams and everything, but for me, buying this package once in a while as part of my plan works.</li>
            <li> I work out and eat healthy too.</li>
            <li> Be sure to read the instructions to get maximum results.</li>
            <li> I would just carry a jug of water with you for the 72 ours :)</li>
            <li> and it gets rid of the flab for sure.</li>
            <li> love it@</li>
            <li> You Have The More</li>
            <li> order one wrap and was pleased with the look and fill of my stomach after one use.</li>
            <li> and I noticed smiling more after about 3 days.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think that the wraps are a magic weight loss tool.</li>
            <li> more of a trial run</li>
            <li> Also, the wrap has a self-tanner, so it&#x27;s an illusion that you&#x27;ve &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; more weight.</li>
            <li> If you do that then you will love the results.</li>
            <li> I have 3 more apllications to use.  </li>
            <li> i love these they work like magic just make sure u drink lots of water</li>
            <li> Kept them on for 45 minutes and drank more water than I do in a week.  </li>
            <li> So I have 48 more hours to go &amp;</li>
            <li> and it had a interesting cooling, tingling sensation.  </li>
            <li> I work out and eat all things healthy.  </li>
            <li> Oh and save your saran wrap for dinner :)</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> And they told me the longer you leave it on..the better.  </li>
            <li> even overnight, that it would work better.  </li>
            <li> most of the people said it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> but i sure can stop &#x27;how&#x27; i age.</li>
            <li> I got more results from just going to the gym and drinking a lot of water during the day.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m going to lower my body fat a bit more before I try one more time.</li>
            <li> Body applicator is almost like magic.</li>
            <li> for me it&#x27;s better to go through a distributer that way you can email them or text them with questions you have.</li>
            <li> I really love food.</li>
            <li> surely but I wanted to try to speed things up.)  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I drank plenty of water, ate a healthy diet, and exercised.</li>
            <li> I have one more  to use.</li>

            <li> Waist-1.5in, Belly button-1in, Love handles-1.5, Hips-3/4in,</li>
            <li> I did eat better and work out....</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> They work, if you maintain a healthy diet with them.</li>
            <li> but i fregging LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m glad i listened to her, because it worked.</li>
            <li> amazingly this product really works!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would work like most, but it really does!!!!</li>
            <li> You just need to put it on the right way and you&#x27;re good to go</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m considering becoming a consultant because I want more people to feel as good as I do right now :)</li>
            <li> I liked it and it worked amazing the first time</li>
            <li> Seemed like a great idea/concept but for the low quality customer service others have received for a product that a huge percentage have honestly reported doesn&#x27;t work, might as well save the money, find a better company, or make your own.</li>
            <li> Along with my normal diet and work out I am still slimmer and happy</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m almost to the point of saying this company has done an amazing job at marketing a product that is full of caca.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t let the practices of someone violating company policies STOP you from becoming HEALTHY and having the body of your dreams in the process.</li>
            <li> The first wrap went good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve personally seen the wraps produce amazing results!!  </li>
            <li> and I am so excited!</li>
            <li> That worked great for my 55 year old face :)</li>
            <li> Recommend wrapping saran warp around it to keep it tight and secure to get the best and most use for them!</li>
            <li> I had fabulous results with this product :)</li>
            <li> It made Lucalean sound like a much better deal--it is a lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I used the wraps every 3 days as recommended, and followed the detailed post-wrap instructions, which includes drinking LOTS of water, exercising, and eating a healthy diet.</li>
            <li> I went from a size 16/18 to fitting comfortably in a size 14.</li>
            <li> I went from a size 16/18 to fitting comfortably in a size 14.</li>
            <li> Too good to be true wins again.</li>
            <li> Good seller, fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> OMG these pictures are AMAZING right?</li>
            <li> There are amazing stories and pictures online everywhere right now showing before and after results</li>
            <li> (they hoped I&#x27;d want to sell it, as I am a busy hairstylist in a very popular Salon/Spa)  </li>
            <li> COOL!</li>
            <li> give this product 4 stars, because it as an easy way to drop some inches off your belly.</li>
            <li> Easy, etc.</li>
            <li> and i see good results gonna order two more to complete cycle.</li>
            <li> Clean your skin and dry put this baby on and feel the tingle and burn so good !!!!</li>
            <li> The skin on my abs was noticeably smoother &amp; softer, &amp; my clothes fit me more comfortably.</li>
            <li> These herbs have strong smell.  </li>
            <li> Smell is strong but</li>
            <li> I opened the packet and discovered it smelled strongly of herbs, specifically eucalyptus.</li>
            <li> , it actually smelled good and people say that it&#x27;s gooey and yucky, but honestly..</li>
            <li> I just bet if U go back and try the wraps doing it right U will see awesome results not they don&#x27;t take the place of excersize but the do show off the results,,,,</li>
            <li> After the first wrap my belly was a pinkish shade and warm for a couple hours after I took it off.</li>
            <li> When you wrap the most benefit is going to come from using a full treatment which is 4 wraps.</li>
            <li> and it did fine</li>
            <li> and I was fine with it.  </li>

            <li> I have tried this product and was able to see a difference within the first application!</li>
            <li> I woke up and didnt see a huge difference until i compared pictures i had taken the night before.</li>
            <li> I am a huge amazon shopper which is why I happened upon this, but in this case I would be scared to order this product.</li>
            <li> any huge transformation</li>
            <li> I have a huge event coming up</li>
            <li> I used three of these wraps and didn&#x27;t see any huge difference in my waist size.</li>
            <li> You cannot enjoy a #1 w/ a coke and expect your wrap to work.</li>
            <li> She gave me a free one to try out</li>
            <li> We both wore them all day, using plastic wrap to secure them.</li>
            <li> Well as for my wraps hmm this will be a total of 8 lol</li>
            <li> Let me preface by telling you about myself as I think body composition is important to how these work.</li>
            <li> Did not see any great results works for a short time.</li>
            <li> The item itself provides a great short term reduction (a day or two) of the affected area.</li>
            <li> but you can get it a lot cheaper and be assured you are getting a fresh product if you buy it through the appropriate channels</li>
            <li> Can use anywhere and help to smooth the skin and remove inches.</li>
            <li> enjoy my $100</li>
            <li> I just wish it would have lived up to the description since it wasn&#x27;t a cheap beauty find.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even get the smooth skin that people rave about.</li>
            <li> I did not think this would work but happy, I bought this for under sixty for 4 wraps at wraps.howtonow.org , these are personal results with just 1 wrap!</li>
            <li> lol my waist is smaller than my hips etc</li>
            <li> lol the next day(today)</li>
            <li> It was perfect nothing was missing</li>
            <li> but you get 40% off all orders and after 3 months you don&#x27;t have to pay for the member fee and they will automatically send it to you with free shipping.</li>
            <li> makes my skin smooth and does show definition.&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
            <li> I now feel comfortable to buy wraps from a consultant.</li>
            <li> This is a great final step to weight loss.  </li>
            <li> I won a free wrap from a distributor</li>
            <li> The ultimate body applicator package was on time and it was in great shape..</li>
            <li> I have several friends who have bought this and their results are great.</li>
            <li> I figured with all the water I drank that I would have lost 1 or 2 lbs after 3 days (since water filled my stomach &amp; curbed my appetite).</li>
            <li> and you keep yourself fit.</li>
            <li> iI know i may sound like a distributor with what i&#x27;m about to say...</li>
            <li> i cannot EMPHASIZE how important it is to drink water.....  </li>
            <li> so far its good, but</li>
            <li> So far the product is  good.  </li>
            <li> I would imagine the more fat you have to lose the better it works but who really knows.</li>
            <li> Enjoy, because this is truly an amazing product and saved my body after the birth of my child, so much</li>
            <li> shipping was great, came fast and the seller respoond to email fast..</li>
            <li> I have found the best results where skin was loose and not so great results other areas.</li>
            <li> Needed these to fit into a bridesmaid dress, fast!!!</li>
            <li> I did everything right, opened the pores, no lotions, used the gel, ate healthy and drank lots of water.</li>
            <li> 👍 :) recieved it right on time when said..</li>
            <li> Plus you get the answers and tips that you need on top of other products that work great together...</li>
            <li> I would recommend becoming  a loyal customer from their website.</li>
            <li> They really do work and you see results immediately!!!</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work!!!</li>
            <li> Its Works, really works!!!</li>
            <li> First month in I am getting a $500 commission check and $300 in bonus&#x27;s!!  </li>
            <li> but these arent very useful.</li>
            <li> the gel that is on each wrap is very strong in smell ( similar to a very strong Ben Gay).  </li>
            <li> ;) also drinking a lot of water is very important with this because it is detoxing your body.</li>
            <li> But the first time i tried it i bought from a health Fair in Atlanta and saw a very noticiable difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get them again because even though it&#x27;s high price , they bandages works amazingly .</li>
            <li> I do not smoke or drink alcohol, I eat healthy, and live a healthy life style.</li>
            <li> ..its is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> --so I flagged the review for abuse and commented that I was pretty sure it was Kaye Lucas writing the review.  </li>
            <li> I replied again to her original comment, describing what had happened and pasted her rebuttal which had been emailed to me.  </li>
            <li> And it makes ur skin fell so fresh!</li>
            <li> I was so excited.  </li>
            <li> did take a hot shower before the wrap, and I did make sure I had all lotions off my stomach.  </li>
            <li> I know everyone is unique...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall for it if you have a significant belly or mommy &amp;#34;pouch&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> so I was definitely excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed they don&#x27;t do a lot of advertising and thought people should be aware that there is a much better option.</li>
            <li> I lost at the most 1/2 inch on my first wrap.</li>
            <li> So I cannot comment if that would have caused or could cause significant inch or even weight loss.</li>
            <li> after 3 times on my stomach area - I have not noticed any significant change.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to try one more set of 4 wraps.</li>
            <li> , you get much better guarantees if you order through the company first.</li>
            <li> It will also be useful come summertime and on vacation at the beach!</li>
            <li> everyone said great for three days I couldn&#x27;t find anything on the long term which is because they don&#x27;t work, yes</li>
            <li> I did not exercise at all in those 3 days, but my diet was clean.</li>
            <li> If there is some kind of sercret to make this work i&#x27;d love to hear it as i still have 2 left</li>
            <li> I will just stick to clean eating and exercise</li>
            <li> i feel that if i wanted to, i could recreate the &amp;#34;results&amp;#34; through a simple cleansing that would be much more effective than this.</li>
            <li> I work out and eat clean.</li>
            <li> I also feel more &amp;#34;up beat&amp;#34; and positive.</li>
            <li> Your better off doing ILipo or Smart lipo save you money.</li>
            <li> I figure if one more pack doesn&#x27;t do anything at all, it&#x27;s a pure scam</li>
            <li> If you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself!</li>
            <li> If you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself!</li>
            <li> and wow amazing.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve lost pounds because of it, but just the shrinkage and firming of my arms and dissapearing handlebars are good enough for me!</li>
            <li> well its true</li>
            <li> well its true</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to update after the full 72hrs.</li>
            <li> Do you really think that by wrapping your body in something that you will magically lose inches?</li>
            <li> A full treatment is four.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I feel that as much gel as they put on these wraps there should be a lot more of them in the box.</li>
            <li> I love the wraps they really work  like anything</li>
            <li> good product, though I&#x27;d like smaller for the arms.</li>
            <li> I know the ItWorks distributors go on and on about how much these wraps work, but I&#x27;m so glad I googled searched for a way to sample these wraps before being bilked by ItWorks for hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with the wrap is that you have to drink plenty of water but water is good for you anyway.</li>
            <li> but after reading reviews by so many people who had to luck at all, I really feel it is the exception and not the rule.</li>
            <li> I have a full bottle I will probably never use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though I would definitely recommend buying through a distributor so ensure the product is good quality.</li>
            <li> But Overall A Good Product</li>
            <li> It stays put, but I put on a very fitted tank top to hold it in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /expired and not get your full effects.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about the only thing they are good for.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not bad for no exercise or diet change.</li>
            <li> So far so good on my first wrap</li>
            <li> you are interested in trying the wraps or any other It Works products, I would be more than happy to help customize a plan to fit your exact health and wellness needs.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this product, but I was leaving for vacation and wanted a quick fix to help nudge my body into slightly better shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT if you are working toward a better you and don&#x27;t mind putting in the work to get results, the subtle but continual changes from using these will help you in this process and make you feel really good about creating a better you.</li>
            <li> You get my cell phone, email, Facebook (English and Spanish) whatever it takes for me to help you on the road to better HEALTH and a BEAUTIFUL looking</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve tried these wraps 2 other times and been happy with the results.</li>
            <li> great product and came in sooner than expected !</li>
            <li> Even if I didn&#x27;t lose an inch, I&#x27;d still be happy with how smooth and firm my skin feels.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li> I found out I was pregnant the day before these arrived</li>
            <li> You can sign up as a loyal customer and get them cheaper.</li>
            <li> and I ended up getting mildly sweaty about 3 hrs after I had put it on.</li>
            <li> I signed up for their loyal customer and was charged three times for auto ship.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was just like a quick fix.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quick fix.</li>
            <li> Real review from real people, I honestly looked at review before purchasing.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a quick fix to your weight issues</li>
            <li> I did sign up for the loyal customer deal with my rep</li>
            <li> The only thing I liked was how smooth my skin felt 24 hours after the wrap.</li>
            <li> Hi there I just thought I would write a quick review for these wraps.  </li>
            <li> but it helps the motivation for quick results.</li>
            <li> but I figured if it worked then maybe I&#x27;ll become a loyal customer to get the reduced price.</li>
            <li> I am a first timer to this product, and I haven&#x27;t had enough time with it  to write a review on product.&lt;br /&gt;Though the product that I was sent from this seller, was in good , clean shape.</li>
            <li> Sounds good but as soon as the 72hrs were up the inches came right back.</li>
            <li> Have to say that I was very interested in this product, hoping that it would work.</li>
            <li> product does make skin feel smooth, I can truly say customer service is great and very helpful and promptly tries to help with all  issues, will order from company again.</li>

            <li> I am very pleased with this product, I think if you tried it you may see the same results.</li>
            <li> Yes, I drank the recommended amount of water, wrapped it securely with saran wrap, rubbed in the extra lotion, and used the right kind of body wash.</li>
            <li> they did do was give me a couple of nice days of soft smooth skin (but my skin is relatively soft and smooth to begin with from all the water</li>
            <li> Live a healthy lifestyle to speed up the process people.</li>

            <li> Going to the bathroom like you are 9 months pregnant with triplets wasn&#x27;t fun</li>
            <li> Easy and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> If you are of large stature, its best that you lose the weight first and then use these to firm up the skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to very bothy!!</li>
            <li> so I was pretty familiar with this</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I normally do not try things like this but a good friend of mine sells this product and well..I&#x27;m hooked..</li>
            <li> i was very unsatisfied with this product, it didn&#x27;t work at all, I&#x27;ve tried these wraps once before from a distributor and her wraps seem to have worked just fine, once i ordered them from here</li>
            <li> These could be old stuff that not so great distributors bought and sat on for a while and are trying to make a quick money back by selling here...</li>
            <li> is AMAZING, but please support your local It Works!</li>
            <li> It Works are a fantastic product that really do work.  </li>
            <li> things that come from our earth, do amazing things for your inside &amp; outside.</li>
            <li> After my third wrap I could finally fit into my swimsuit that I was determined to fit into this summer!  </li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m selling them and making money so much fun</li>
            <li> It was fun to plastic wrap yourself but the product did not work for me even though I followed all the instructions.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty sweet.</li>
            <li> i called the company to request my money back and make complaints, and they refused too refund me and said \\&quot;your kind of body type is not compatible with our product.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> THAT is what you are putting on your body and what is absorbed by your skin.</li>
            <li> Worth your money ...</li>
            <li> but it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> It is worth trying although ive seen reviews for some people saying it doesnt work, guess it depends on the person</li>
            <li> loved the products so much that I knew I wanted to use them all regularly.</li>
            <li> I decided to sign up to be able to distribute the products so that I could possible earn mine free.</li>
            <li> Worth the $15 a wrap?</li>
            <li> , I drank 100oz minimum of water a day, ate healthy and exercised lightly also, I did measurements daily and pictures every 72 hours.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can figure out is they are cheaper because they are expired and therefore not as effective.</li>
            <li> etc) you&#x27;d probably get more results from eating a diet with minimal sugar and carbs, eating mostly protein/veg/ and fruit.  </li>
            <li> , i used to tell people my tricks and tips that i use to stay young and healthy looking</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off the old fashioned way, eat your veggies and fruit, and limit everything else and get a lil exercise.</li>
            <li> The prices would also be more reasonable and have bonuses for you when you order under a distributor (that is straight from the source), as I am myself why I know this product so well and what it will do for your body.</li>
            <li> She had success as did all of her friends.  </li>
            <li> False advertisement at its best.</li>
            <li> these things are pretty cool if u drink the right amount if water you will see results</li>
            <li> But for a quick small stomach tightening its great.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I have spent most of my life very fit, and NOT overweight.</li>
            <li> i bought the 4 pack, it came pretty quick</li>
            <li> You must be realistic people; I&#x27;m guessing that if you have a BIG belly you might not be satisfied, because it will take you longer to see results (youtube it, there are many testimonials regarding these applicators, how it works...</li>
            <li> This is only good possibly if you are trying to fit into something for a special occassion.  </li>
            <li> If I did this every couple of days I&#x27;d look and feel pretty good, my pants would fit better, but I&#x27;d be poor.  </li>
            <li> Last night I prepped my stomach by washing and drying the area, to make sure the skin was clean</li>
            <li> My skin was smooth and more elastic with my first and second wrap.</li>
            <li> , this keeps my stomach nice and flat.  </li>
            <li> , right?)</li>
            <li> You have to get up and move and eat the right food.</li>
            <li> I did everything right</li>
            <li> You have to eat right and move every day.</li>
            <li> You can see the results right away and even in the days to come.</li>
            <li> WEIGHT TAKES EATING RIGHT AND EXERCISE.......</li>
            <li> Working out and eating right is the trick but</li>
            <li> Time it right.</li>
            <li> right like a wrap will make me lose inches..</li>
            <li> I bet these people didn&#x27;t do it the right way</li>
            <li> the price was certainly right.</li>
            <li> I noticed results right away though</li>
            <li> I drank all the water, ate right, avoided alcohol</li>
            <li> but you can feel it working right away</li>
            <li> I think this isn&#x27;t the right thing.  </li>
            <li> to mention, you can get a FULL BOX of 4 wraps for only $59 when you order on there! :)</li>
            <li> At night I took a hot shower to let my pores open up, I did not use soap or any kind of lotion on my stomach.</li>
            <li> Well I am HAPPY to say after 4 wraps I am DOWN 6 inches!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this as I&#x27;m sure most people are and to be honest</li>
            <li> Beware of the discount you receive by becoming a &amp;#34;member&amp;#34; when buying direct.</li>
            <li> I will keep posting results as I do more of them, as I am very interested if these results stay or begin to fade after a time of not using the wraps regularly.  </li>
            <li> I can understand if you are trying to slim down to look good for a wedding or vacation, or use it as motivation to lose weight</li>
            <li> I also said that she would most likely delete the original comment to erase the whole thread--guess what?  </li>
            <li> For those saying the product doesn&#x27;t work, you HAVE TO complete the FULL treatment plan!  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re allergic to certain plants you shouldn&#x27;t use!</li>
            <li> The applicators are old I would have been better off by buying straight from the website.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you really want to believe there CAN be a quick fix to somethings in life</li>
            <li> maybe I wouldn&#x27;t see results right away but wanted to give it a real try do it the right way...</li>
            <li> so i continue to stay young and healthy and vibrant.)</li>
            <li> I know it says to just do 45 min the first time</li>
            <li> so I left it on overnight with saran wrap and my spanx on top.</li>
            <li> I used this exactly per directions</li>
            <li> you wouldn&#x27;t be able to eat because as soon as I ate my stomach looked bigger again.</li>
            <li> my skin is so much smoother as well!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly &amp; did not have any inch loss or change in appearance.</li>
            <li> I should have known better, but I thought based on some of the reviews it could possibly work.  </li>
            <li> some magical way to lose weight I have put on... there is no such thing.</li>
            <li> you are willing to try these out</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was foolish to believe a magic cream would actually make you lose fat.</li>
            <li> The wraps are overpriced and did absolutely nothing for me!</li>
            <li> your deserve (meaning most likely</li>
            <li> It takes the water out of your cells shrinking them and making you temporary smaller(his exact words).</li>
            <li> first time used this product I could feel it working</li>
            <li> 6 to 8 hours per wrap after the first.</li>
            <li> First, I have not used this product.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way she would have known about my comment or been able to reply to my comment unless she was the same person.  </li>
            <li> So much for trying to save money on a box of four wraps!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> I lost almost 3 inches with my first wrap.</li>
            <li> I used these just as the directions say, but left it on longer because my skin is able to handle it.</li>
            <li> If you need to &amp;#34;tighten&amp;#34; any specific area these wraps will help with that for sure.  </li>
            <li> All bodies are different so maybe you will have a better result.  </li>
            <li> everyone will see results with this - cause it really does work!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty slim</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the expected delivery date</li>
            <li> Pictures really are worth a thousand words...</li>
            <li> If you are interested in this product contact an &amp;#34;It Works&amp;#34; Distributor in your area.</li>
            <li> All the reviews and pictures of peoples success with&amp;#34; no change &amp;#34; was promising but it didnt work for me</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions EXACTLY, an even bought from a distributor.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing more than some lotion inside a big band-aid.  </li>
            <li> So i ordered two more recently because the results from just using it once had gone away.</li>
            <li> My first set of wraps</li>
            <li> When wraps are purchased through Amazon or Ebay there is no guarantee that they will work because they are more than likely expired product that someone is just trying to get rid of</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to buy the lotion if you are a first time buyer.</li>
            <li> How much longer will you wait around to see if this opportunity is worth your time?</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see results with my first wrap either.</li>
            <li> I was fooled into thinking it would make a difference, I&#x27;ve used all four wraps exactly the way they recommended</li>
            <li> Ok so I been following everything that people have told me to do .</li>
            <li> I am glad I only paid $50 for my 4pk.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> While I did not initally lose many inches, I can definitely feel a difference.</li>
            <li> I just did the first wrap and lost almost 2 inches.</li>
            <li> The first time I wore it for the 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> Once I get some extra money I will get more.</li>
            <li> I ordered it through amazon which I probably shouldn&#x27;t have in the first place,.</li>
            <li> i followed the instructions to the TEE.. and guess what.. i lost 3 inches of my waist with the first wrap (within 3 days)</li>
            <li> then after my second wrap i lost 2 more inches (3 days)</li>
            <li> Followed exactly what was instructed.</li>
            <li> I first purchase the it work wraps about a month in a ago</li>
            <li> I went from 40\\&quot; to now a 29\\&quot; at first</li>
            <li> So when I tried on my first wrap heres how I did it:    </li>
            <li> and omg you could definitely tell something magical happened</li>
            <li> Do first check recommendations for use online.</li>
            <li> When I first started I thought....</li>
            <li> my results were visible with the first wrap and only got better with each wrap.</li>
            <li> I am much more regular now.</li>
            <li> I took a hot shower exfoliated &amp; then wrapped myself.</li>
            <li> nothing.not So much as an inch!</li>
            <li> but as of now absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li> &amp; they also said of you don&#x27;t lose inches on the first wrap</li>
            <li> Lost  4 inches the first time.</li>
            <li> Really does help to tone and tighten up!</li>
            <li> It was fast shipping!</li>
            <li> First of all you have to drink lots of water it helps keep you hydrated and gets the toxins out of your body.</li>
            <li> The first time I wrapped I didn&#x27;t see any results, I was at a wrap party drinking wine and eating nachos...</li>
            <li> I did three more wraps and followed the protocal and lost several inches.</li>
            <li> I was hovering around 120 when I did my first wrap.  </li>
            <li> so I rubbed it in and put the tank top back on.  </li>
            <li> Once I got the first package..</li>
            <li> First wrap for 45 minutes then</li>
            <li> Did exactly what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li> I got this product through here because I didn&#x27;t want to become a royal customer or pay retail price without trying it first.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t be discouraged if you are not amazed the morning after your first applicator, you will continue to get results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do your research online don&#x27;t just sit back and accept the aging process, age gracefully and keep your youthful appearance by taking care of your skin, eat healthy, exercise and keep the weight down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased and used it exactly how the instructions said, but it did not work at all.</li>
            <li> I only drink water and I eat healthy and workout to start with</li>
            <li> Not sorry.</li>
            <li> me preface that I&#x27;m a relatively healthy person prior to trying the wraps out.  </li>
            <li> There is no guarantee in the wraps you purchase otherwise and more than likely</li>
            <li> Drink water during and 72 hours after and you will see a difference ;)</li>
            <li> they should really change their slogan!</li>
            <li> This product really does work!  </li>
            <li> I lost 4 inches around my waist with the first wrap.  </li>
            <li> and well im bearly on my first day</li>
            <li> First off</li>
            <li> because I read so many mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> Everyone wants to try these!</li>
            <li> Just to let you know this product of the wraps is not entirely meant to lose the weight/pounds, it is more focused on tightening, firming and toning.</li>
            <li> Product really does WORK!</li>
            <li> Hope this helped you ;)</li>
            <li> So, yes, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve lost some inches, but it&#x27;s ALL from diarrhea and fluid</li>
            <li> Needless to say I wasn&#x27;t that impressed.</li>
            <li> I have 3 more wraps left to go.</li>
            <li> Lost 3\\&quot; in 45 minutes after first wrap.  </li>
            <li> so I was willing to try.  </li>
            <li> Seller was very responsive and accomadating!</li>
            <li> It might not work after the first wrap for some of us</li>
            <li> I did everything by the book, drank tons of water, ate healthy, slept with it on, showered before I put it on to open my pores, &amp; I kept them on for 6</li>
            <li> So upon hearing all they hype surrounding the ItWorks product, I&#x27;m thinking &amp;#34;I only have a few pounds to loose, I eat realtively healthy, and drink water 90 percent of the day anyway&amp;#34; I am a perfect candiate for this product..</li>
            <li> I became a loyal customer to get the discounts on the products, earn 10% of my spending in future product, and receive free shipping.</li>
            <li> A complete hoax!!!!</li>
            <li> I used it right before my vacation, and taking photo on my vacation, I  could really see the difference in the photo&#x27;s</li>
            <li> have been eating right and doing as much as i can to lose weight</li>
            <li> These wraps are a first to market product from It Works and should only be bought through Independent Distributors to ensure you are getting a good, reliable product.  </li>
            <li> After more research you are supposed to drink half your body weight in water and work on eating clean.  </li>
            <li> I did two of these, kept one on over night, drank plenty of water, ate clean, and developed &amp;#34;toxic bloat&amp;#34; afterwards.</li>
            <li> I need my money back please or if possible you can compensate me with another good product.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, the only thing that really works is eating healthy and exercising.</li>
            <li> She saw no difference in the skin, tightening, firming, tone or any positive change in her measurements.</li>
            <li> am waiting your positive reply.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Huge results were not expected just something; even a 1/2 inch..</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  </li>
            <li> First off, we all know by now there is no secret to weight loss.</li>
            <li> First time I got it straight from it</li>
            <li> You pretty much have to drink water around the clock, which I did.</li>
            <li> After my first application I did not notice much of a difference in my problem area.  </li>
            <li> It seems flimsy at first, but is actually very durable.  </li>
            <li> the company was nice just not worth the money</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I followed every instruction, including the &#x60;tips online&#x27; that you see (ie exfoliation, hot shower, leaving it on, not working out after, drinking nearly a gal of water each day, etc) to a T..... and lo and behold, I GAINED an inch?!?!?!</li>
            <li> i will definitely be getting more in the near future and the price is better than anybody else&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> Who wants to pay a real high price for something not knowing if its gonna work or not?</li>
            <li> Not completely but wow amazing.</li>
            <li> ; for a night out, you can make your own wraps for less that 5 bucks by looking it up on pinterest.</li>
            <li> I left it on while I slept (8 hours or so), drank the water and followed my normal diet of eating healthy</li>
            <li> I will use them (in conjunction with my normal healthy diet and exercise) to flatten my tummy a bit before I go to the beach next month.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal customer and mine were purchased directly from It Works.</li>
            <li> Then I made sure i was dry</li>
            <li> Product is good for being smaller for a day other wise waste of money.</li>
            <li> change my diet, stop eating after a certain time</li>
            <li> This may work for someone else, but certainly it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> It was worth the $50 just to get out of it early!</li>
            <li> I now measure 37 and 33, cant wait to measure again in a few hours to see how much more i lost!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use them to loose more.</li>
            <li> hehe right in time to show off my new dress this weekend  hehe ^.^....</li>
            <li> but I definitely felt more confident when wearing tight shirts.</li>
            <li> Wish having a flat stomach was easy as wrapping up like one of dexters victims</li>
            <li> In I can Honestly say they werent dried out or old first off !</li>
            <li> so i stopped telling people and enjoy when they notice how good i look as i age and feel sorry for them)</li>
            <li> then you are missing out on wholesale pricing, free products, and free shipping, as well as customer</li>
            <li> When I was ready to use it</li>
            <li> very disapointed, did not see any results.</li>
            <li> if i dont see any results after spending all this money i will be very upset.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice much if any difference</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to losing inches off my stomach.</li>
            <li> I think in order to keep the inches off you have to spend a WHOLE bunch of money and use the wraps every 3 days forever, oh an</li>
            <li> I wanted so much for these to work...</li>
            <li> I do believe I should have bought it off the actual site and got t money&#x27;s worth instead of trying to get the best deal with the wrong results , I know now.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both used these wraps and they did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Really bummed this didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> again it gave me a rash and it to much money 69.00 for four  wrap you got to be kidding me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see any difference on my thighs</li>
            <li> looked much smoother and firmer.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely NOTHING.</li>
            <li> it took about a day or so to really notice them</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> I Really wanted it to work though.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stay in place very well, even using cling wrap to keep it in place.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> none of my clothes fit any different and even after the 3-4 days, nothing.</li>
            <li> I lost absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> The product really does work.</li>
            <li> I used the whole box as advertised and got no results what so ever.</li>
            <li> All this and free shipping on your autoship after your third month.</li>
            <li> I am very obset</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Thanks for ripping me off...</li>
            <li> but this did absolutely nothing for me except&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> Instead, I have started to use the ItWorks body wraps and have done detoxed while on the wraps and it has helped me so so much.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> But this thing really doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> However my friends who have had children raved about how much their stretch marks faded.</li>
            <li> They absolutely work.</li>
            <li> thanks anyway.</li>
            <li> It really worked .</li>
            <li> If you really want a flatter stomach , you know what it takes.</li>
            <li> GET REAL</li>
            <li> I didnt really weigh myself before doing the</li>
            <li> and it really worked.</li>
            <li> After the 45min was up I unwrapped myself and discovered my skin was much tighter.</li>
            <li> To spend about $400.00 at the cost of $100.00 per package of four to get results, I really did not want to spend that much money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting on my kit to arrive so that I can really get in to it since my friend let me borrow one of her wrap to try..</li>
            <li> works very well if you follow and keep up with the guidelines</li>
            <li> I followed all instructions, drank a lot of water and laid still the whole time.  </li>
            <li> It was a total waste of money, I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t spend any more than $30 on this.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference but after the 4th Wrap, I lost about 6 inches.</li>
            <li> and I know that they really truly don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I actually tried this once at a party for free.</li>
            <li> Thanks ..</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d try this out after so much hype about it.</li>
            <li> After I had hit that purchase button, I started getting doubts, not so much in the product, but the fact that I was buying it from Amazon and not from a real distributor.</li>
            <li> didnt react weel to the ingredients because there&#x27;s too much junk.    </li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s because you probably dont have that much fat</li>
            <li> I believe that these may not work as well for some as much as others.</li>
            <li> well I don&#x27;t need that much water</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see that much of a change in my stomach area</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Just thought I would try them since I have heard so much about this product.</li>
            <li> This was my month of doing &amp;#34;sit ups&amp;#34;, so I expected this to help even more.</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing tor me.  </li>
            <li> and I drank so much water.</li>
            <li> folks.&lt;br /&gt;You know what really works?</li>
            <li> soo much.</li>
            <li> It did not do much for me.</li>
            <li> Straight to the points</li>
            <li> I tried for a whole month, i saw nothing.</li>
            <li> This product really works, i would have never believed it unti</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make much of a difference for me.</li>
            <li> very painful..itchy</li>
            <li> I did the whole treatment plan every 72 hours and used the cream in between.  </li>
            <li> thanks MARY Morris</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much if anything at all</li>
            <li> They work really well.</li>
            <li> You really lose nothing by trying out this product.</li>
            <li> but it really works</li>
            <li> It really does work....</li>
            <li> really does work....</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why your distributor tells you to drink so much darn water.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I did not wrap correctly or maybe I have too much that needs to disappear.</li>
            <li> They really do work.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice any change....</li>
            <li> I too really wanted this product to work.  </li>
            <li> I tried these wraps twice and kept them on once for the whole night.</li>
            <li> did absolutely nothing...</li>
            <li> Not as drastic as advertised but definitely worth trying a few more</li>
            <li> I was looking for this specific wrap since I was introduced to it last year and wanted to find it on my own and not have to depend on some messagist to do it for me...</li>
            <li> this is the key to keeping your body young and healthy as it ages and also hormones.</li>
            <li> The applicators were brown which are obviously old DISSAPOINTED!!!</li>
            <li> to maintain im drinking brazilian slimming tea, google or search in here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it for a super detox, and drank detox tea, it work, but the weight come back really fast!</li>
            <li> You can just get a package and join their loyal customer program for free and get half of the price.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m starting to get excited again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this applicator box is helping me just get my skin back to it&#x27;s original tightness.</li>
            <li> I used the other two on my arms which are so much better.</li>
            <li> , it contains BHT a substance banned in most other countries.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t stopped eating the way I normally do, and they still work!</li>
            <li> im ordering another box coz it really works for me, highly recomend it</li>
            <li> I followed the directions on it very carefully and after my first one I had already lost 1 inch on my belly!!!</li>
            <li> But trying one wrap really isn&#x27;t going to prove anything because it&#x27;s only a partial treatment, and lots of people don&#x27;t keep going if they don&#x27;t see an amazing change with one wrap, but rather assume nothing happened.</li>
            <li> I will explain the ingredients, the way the product is supposed to be applied, the way the product is designed to work, the way the product may affect the body, what to expect from the Ultimate Body Applicator after 1st application (1/4 of a FULL treatment) and what they need to do to have</li>
            <li> I personally lost a full pant size after wrapping my tummy 3 times in just 9 days.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I&#x27;m female, late twenties, 5&#x27;8\\&quot;, 160, 23% body fat with most concentrated on my \\&quot;pouch\\&quot; and love handles.</li>
            <li> Hey guys I just want to say that I tried several products from It Works and really liked them all especially since their all made from natural</li>
            <li> for research if you are interested: skin: use Vit D oil and Emu oil // hormones: use natural bio-identicalhormones from a compound pharmacy, have ALL of your hormones tested (estrogen/testoserone/progesterone) //</li>
            <li> It makes me sad to say it because I love how much friends I have love and believe in them and how they have worked for them</li>
            <li> /&gt;And if you are not following the instructions and advice of a Distributor (like how much water to drink, how often to wrap, diet, exercise, avoiding toxins) then you are more than likely not going to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as the product is concerned, today is the first day I applied the wrap to my abdomen and saran-wrapped my abdomen to keep the wrap in place.</li>
            <li> used all 4 over course of a month, wrapped properly &amp; with plastic wrap to hold it on, kept on full time, etc.  </li>
            <li> As an Itworks distributor, it is very important that consumers are receiving the proper instruction that is to accompany the use of our Ultimate Body Applicator.</li>
            <li> It does work and there is a strict policy that these products cannot be sold other than the original company site!</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re going on a hot date or want to look a little skinnier in a little dress, this is great for that one night.</li>
            <li> The inches fell off and I felt like a whole new person.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re a whole new person.</li>
            <li> Honestly the wrap did nothing &amp;#34;inches&amp;#34; wise, but for some reason this weird thing made my tiger stripe dark stretch marks become like my normal skin color!</li>
            <li> Do your research and take supplements daily, figure out what works for you or see a natural dr and get tested on all of the vitamins and supplements for accurate dosaging.  </li>
            <li> After 12 days, my mid-section looked more defined and less flabby.</li>
            <li> It less, work out and follow a healthy lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li> Used 3 wraps, and even though I didn&#x27;t take measurements, I felt less jiggley and fit into my swimsuit with confidence!</li>
            <li> belly from having three kids as well as the effects of getting older.</li>
            <li> Which made me move more and left my body in massive pain.</li>
            <li> * that only the top portion of my abdomen is left that way.)</li>
            <li> but they actually came more than a week earlier!</li>
            <li> You are constantly seeing ads on how to make your face look younger, your body look better.</li>
            <li> I used exactly as directed and left the first patch on for hours longer than the minimum time.  </li>
            <li> I also wonder how many of the reviews are written by people who actually sell the wraps and not by actual customers.</li>
            <li> I am reading so many mixed reviews on here and am guessing that it affects everyone differently.</li>
            <li> helping with stretch marks is to take a shower prior to wrapping to open your pores so that it works better.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off following diet and SIMPLE exercise plan.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before- be realistic.  </li>
            <li> ordered this product about a month ago an never received it, be careful because i honestly think this stuff is a scam, i exercise and workout daily</li>
            <li> like I was supposed to, eat decently and still did not lose these.</li>
            <li> Antioxidants: consume mass quantities of these particularly Glutathione, astaxanthin, Vit C, Vit D...</li>
            <li> being pregnant 2x in the last 2 years I couldn&#x27;t try it.</li>
            <li> I lost only an inch with the first wrap, but my second wrap I list more and my stretch marks faded to barely anything!</li>
            <li> High hopes.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend buying just ONE to see if you like it</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone undergoing weight loss surgery</li>
            <li> As for the product, I saw results after applying only the first 2 wraps &amp; was in disbelief!</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll order straight from a distributor to insure fresh batch and not waste my money!  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything except cause me pretty major discomfort.</li>
            <li> (I have never had one before in my life &amp; I am 50 years old!!).  </li>
            <li> but i thought it would work a little better, i even drank the water.</li>
            <li> Since the moment I got the package which was opened  till the moment when I I pened the envelop  and noticed that the stripes were much dry than the original package.</li>
            <li> To celebrate, I bought myself two new dresses and a new pair of pants!  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend buying from a distributed anyways not from this site because you will be get the real deal any these products here could be old</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need to lose much size to make the dress work, so I threw everything I had at it as far as working out, eating, water and these things went.  </li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your money on a membership to IT WORKS, because it really does NOT work.</li>
            <li> Mine was from bell_shop and so far I really trust the.</li>
            <li> Ok to use short term but not for long term use as they are a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> It took forever for it to come and when it finally did arrive the box was pretty much destroyed and faded like it had been sitting around for years.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work waste of time and money better off going to dr fisher shrink like 1 inch</li>
            <li> Glad I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and can&#x27;t seem to get rid of the extra baggage no matter what you try, this may be worth a shot.</li>
            <li> After using the box of 4 wraps, I definitetly noticed my mid-section looked more toned and firm.</li>
            <li> just some dimpled skin I wanted to look more firm.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to wrap a few layers of plastic wrap around my body to keep it in place, and they work better when you wear them overnight.</li>
            <li> I wasted more than 80 bucks on something that doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Overall I think I had some improvement in my skin as far as firming but for the price it wasn&#x27;t enough of an improvement to buy more.  </li>
            <li> These wraps are pretty much just compressing your fat temporarily not getting rid of it, so 2 days after your wrap you are back a square one.</li>
            <li> People need to remember that the wraps tighten and firm but its supposed to go along with healthy eating and exercise.</li>
            <li> and I had saw a nurse friend and she looked at it and told me how to deal with it and that if it didn&#x27;t get better in a few days..to see a doctor.  </li>
            <li> they are normally 25 for 1.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because because I have lost a good amount of weight and I am not happy with the way my stomach looks still</li>
            <li> I only lost a little bit but that&#x27;s better than nothing!</li>
            <li> but I was assured to get my money back or receive a new fresh replacement.</li>
            <li> Well the only reason she saw a difference in her problem area is because she started eating right and excercising.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I lost 2 inches and it came right back in 2 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually wearing it right now</li>
            <li> but after three days it was right back.  </li>
            <li> dont&#x27;s of wrapping in order to use them properly to get the right results.</li>
            <li> But so far, I think it&#x27;s either a fantastic hoax or it only works on certain people for various reasons.</li>
            <li> but yes it came right back by the end of the 4th day.</li>
            <li> I bought this being a little skeptical on how much it would really work, but i saw a lot of before and afters that were impressive!</li>
            <li> I would recommend to wear some type of cincher or tight compression because I honestly think that helps considering I didn&#x27;t see the difference when I tried it on the back of my thighs with no compression.</li>
            <li> everyone&#x27;s results will not be the same and U must follow instructions such as drinking half your body weight in water, also no 20proof or above drinks and the best results are achieved by sleeping in the wrap and not sweating,,,, sweat clogs the pores and and U will not see the proper results</li>
            <li> The feeling is very tingly, like Icy Hot, but not as intense.  </li>
            <li> Invest in a new work-out outfit instead.</li>
            <li> it looked brand new.</li>
            <li> I am not one to break out when using a new lotion or body wash or anything like that</li>
            <li> Worked better than expected after the second wrap!!</li>
            <li> And since I spent the money I will most likely use them up, but I don&#x27;t expect any results and will be wasting my time.</li>
            <li> Those were pretty easy, the not working out was hard as it&#x27;s my job</li>
            <li> I think product was very old, the packaging looked &amp;#34;shop worn&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Sent in a very old box.</li>
            <li> I used TWO at once (despite the supposed rule of only using one your first time) at the recommendation of a consultant.  </li>
            <li> and I woke up the first morning and was 3 inches smaller.</li>
            <li> my strech marks had faded considerably!</li>
            <li> However by the end of the first night the inches were back.  </li>
            <li> These are probably better suited for someone with a small amount of stubborn belly fat.</li>
            <li> After 72 hours, I applied my second wrap, exactly the same as the first.  </li>
            <li> Worked the exact same as these wraps did.</li>
            <li> If at all possible, the first time, I will wrap the client myself</li>
            <li> had results on the first try, but for some it can take up to 4 applications, I saw results from my 1st and 2nd application.</li>
            <li> but I was the exact same.  </li>
            <li> let me first start out by saying that i did not use the ultimate body kit.</li>
            <li> but i measure the exact same after all four wraps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how it would have worked for sooooooooooooo many others and not for me, or as the coaches and distributors online say that it works for 90-95% of people.</li>
            <li> First of all, I figured my wraps would arrive in the same type of box as advertised in the photo.</li>
            <li> I have tried one wrap so far, through a distributor, and have been blown away!</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s a pretty simple concept.  </li>
            <li> but this was not a waste!</li>
            <li> It simply didn&#x27;t work and I followed every direction exactly.</li>
            <li> And lastly, I bought the box it came exactly as packaged.</li>
            <li> but so far it worked for me!</li>
            <li> My wraps definitely worked, but they only last a couple days at MOST.</li>
            <li> So I bought the product to try it out and lost 2 inches in my first 45 minutes and 1/2 inch 72 hours later.</li>
            <li> and I did not see results at first, but the second time I drank plenty of water</li>
            <li> and Im excited to see where I will be once the box is empty!</li>
            <li> Started to use it just because my daughter was is getting married and used it for three months I lost total of 14 pounds</li>
            <li> First off, I had bought a package at $129.50 for 4 wraps..which I only ever used the 1.  </li>
            <li> I used the first one then waited 72 hours and did the second.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to a T (hot shower, even scrubbed my skin with a skin brush before hand, left them on well over 2 hours.)  </li>
            <li> i would recommend buying fron natural way!</li>
            <li> I used the first wrap for only 45 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I lost one inch around my waist after the first use, but only temporarily.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried one for 45 mins, I actually gained inches after I took it off.</li>
            <li> get out and dry myself off completely.&lt;br /&gt;Measure myself and then draw the lines where I put the measuring tape (Which was freezing at this point because I took a steaming hot shower!)</li>
            <li> I strongly suggest not to engage in any sort of business with a company that cares so little about their customers and does not take responsibility for the repercussions of their products.</li>
            <li> then I tried the 2nd one 72 hours latter and decided to see if the water thing was true and...</li>
            <li> but I did not use the other wraps for fear I would have a full on break out.</li>
            <li> Received wraps quickly, shipper contacted me a few times and was very knowledgeable.  </li>
            <li> In addition, due to the natural makeup of the ingredients, these products need to be stored in cool (not refrigerated) temperature.</li>
            <li> The area is large and you can cut the wrap if you want to cover a smaller area than your abs.  </li>
            <li> The skin healing has no reason to reverse itself, but the fat cell shrinkage will slowly return, but not fully until anywhere from 3-6 months (depending on your diet) if you aren&#x27;t wrapping.&lt;br /&gt;The loyal customer program through an actual distributor not only cheaper, but you earn 10% rewards each month if you remain a customer for fourmonths or more, you get a $50 credit if you remain for 6 months, and a $150 credit if you remain for 12 months.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t shown drastic results like many others (I would only loose an inch at a time) it has helped me with my confidence levels a lot because I actually see results!</li>
            <li> But, that&#x27;s too hard for most</li>
            <li> I ordered this box because it was a low price, much lower than getting it directly from It</li>
            <li> and there were clearly visible results that have lasted.  </li>
            <li> , you could tell it was old</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it worked and am eager to try another.</li>
            <li> These things really work, but you can get them cheaper if you buy locally.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve finally found something that really does.</li>
            <li> Tried three wraps so far and no results.</li>
            <li> It works is not a miracle but works, I have 4 kids I am 40 years old</li>
            <li> The wraps have a temporary effect, but the only way to make a real change is to put in the sweat equity.</li>
            <li> The Lucalean wraps work for me and they are much cheaper with a money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> Afterall, she&#x27;s in her early 20s, and I&#x27;m in my mid-30s.</li>
            <li> im a slim young lady...~_~</li>
            <li> They are made with ALL NATURAL, nonGMO ingredients and have a shelf life.</li>
            <li> do a thing for me, I would not waste money on them again</li>
            <li> I would not waste the money on this ever again.</li>
            <li> , this is all natural and DOES expire.</li>
            <li> that I thought for sure I&#x27;d see at least a 1&amp;#34;-2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Looked like it was old.</li>
            <li> and you are not following the directions and advice of a distributor (how much water to drink, toxins to avoid, taking before and after pictures).  </li>
            <li> please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> But I did with my second and continued to see them from there on out, not every wrap, but very gradually.</li>
            <li> I do believe that some people&#x27;s systems are very resistant, and there isn&#x27;t rhyme or reason as to why, but I also know people who are immune to the effects of different supplements and medications</li>
            <li> Do not waste money on this.</li>
            <li> The old adage about walking 30 mins a day and watching what you&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&amp;#34;5 and 150 lbs, which is my chubbiest point so far</li>
            <li> My wife bought these and they did not have a expiration date on box.. looked like it was rubbed off to hide how old it was..</li>
            <li> the brown lotion on the wrap was not lotion.. it was clumps of dried up light brown looking</li>
            <li> *.. would not recommend anyone buying from this person thats trying to sell old products..</li>
            <li> also, you definitely need to put saran wrap over the wrap as it really doesn&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t have reps like the IT WORKS brand-it&#x27;s all direct sales from their website</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> wow...</li>
            <li> My stomach is so much tighter and seems to continue to tighten up five days later.</li>
            <li> They do not WORK DO NOT WASTE YOUT MONEY</li>
            <li> The wraps were either expired or old.</li>
            <li> That made me think that at the end of the three days I would definitely have lost a couple of pounds because drinking that much water curbs your appetite.  </li>
            <li> Also, you can leave it on longer than 45mins, even over night while you sleep, but another big tip is to take pictures to really see results and changes.</li>
            <li> &amp; there were so many negative comments.</li>
            <li> My baby is now 6 months old</li>
            <li> I am not concerned using the products because they are all natural and organic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is common sense that you should eat healthy and be active.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It did make my skin soft though.</li>
            <li> Anytime someone offers you the opportunity to sell a item your trying to buy</li>
            <li> girls boys do not waste your time, do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; 145 lbs and wanted to try to lose my belly fat this winter while busy with fulltime school and work.  </li>
            <li> The wraps I got directly from It</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> MSM, glucosimine, chondroitan, DIM, Alpha lipoic acid,silica, biotin, krill oil, wheat grass....</li>
            <li> Natural things...</li>
            <li> I did order them directly through an ItWorks</li>
            <li> All this did was make my skin soft where applied.</li>
            <li> Complete gimmick.</li>
            <li> and wow amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And this product is also meant for the situations of stretch marks, cellulite, or that pouch from pregnacy that just wont go away even exersicing on a regular basis because that skin has been strectch so much.</li>
            <li> I will change my rating once I complete all 4 wraps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 17, 2013&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only way you&#x27;ll see real results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not heavy at all, I just had a baby 2 weeks ago and was hoping to help my skin on my belly, it didn&#x27;t NOTHING.</li>
            <li> the last 2 years we&#x27;ve been featured in Forbes, Inc. 500 Fastest Growing Companies, Success From Home Magazine (3 entire issues) and now the Wall Street Journal because of our explosive growth.</li>
            <li> I got these and although weird to put on, I liked that they really seemed to help make my skin appear smoother.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on them before hand and was told that while wearing them and the next few days to make sure I in took a lot of water, and I did, and still nothing.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re curious and really want to try these, this is definitely cheaper than buying them from other places but honestly there are no magic pills, powders or wraps and we all know it to be true.  </li>
            <li> I measured and looked the same as before - right after the wrap, the next day and the two days after that.  </li>
            <li> but it came right back by the next day.  </li>
            <li> It definitely shrunk me and toned me up for a couple days and then things went right back to where they were.  </li>
            <li> With my skin the way that it is they sink in so pretty much if I were to roll a black roller paint brush over my stomach</li>
            <li> i mean eating healthy, or get</li>
            <li> Have wanted to try these out, haven&#x27;t had any dramatic results, but it helps with getting some finer definition on my stomach, works best if you at least bike or walk while wearing it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not right all the pics iv seen had huge results there was a big difference but didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> Apparently this is a common &amp;#34;theme&amp;#34;  with many of their reps.</li>
            <li> So I took my chances, and left my first wrap on the entire 8 hours.  </li>
            <li> Tried another wrap two days later and left on even longer than the first time.  </li>
            <li> I like this product , but it dosent last long without diet and exercise your stomach will go back to its original size</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product because no matter how much excercise &amp; clean eating, I cant lose the loose skin &amp; slight budge brought on by child birth.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t see a change in the texture of my skin other than it feeling moisturized right after the wrap.  </li>
            <li> Though the product is good and this 4 pack was &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;, I could tell it was not as &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; or had as much product on it as other wraps I&#x27;ve purchased in the past from other sellers.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it burned me, or if I had some sort of allergic reaction but I highly prefer not to have a huge red mark on my stomach FOR LIFE then to lose a few inches for a week!</li>
            <li> Diet (not eating anything fried, greasy filled with excessive sugar or drinking alcohol or tons of caffeine as well), drinking at least half your weight in ounces each day, ensuring the skin as clean and free of any lotions, etc. 9</li>
            <li> And it felt like icy hot.</li>
            <li> my stomach legs and arms appeared much larger than they normally were.</li>
            <li> proves that everyone has different results for different products and You must know how to use these products properly so wrap it up and see those results</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I expected..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like rubbing icy hot on your body.    </li>
            <li> Mix icy hot on a cloth bandage with some self-tanner and you&#x27;ve got a homemade wrap.</li>
            <li> It feels like icy hot product and she wraps me up with Saran Wrap for an hour.</li>
            <li> A true gimmick, a waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;do</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to get back down to my original size 8/10... keeping fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to get back down to my original size 8/10... keeping fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see much of difference besides my skin feeling a little softer.</li>
            <li> I just received my new box which I am going to use on my inner thighs.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve only seen photo evidence, not in person evidence because my friends that use them live out of state.)  </li>
            <li> I really was just looking for a jump start as I started getting back into an moderate exercise routine.</li>
            <li> The wraps have really helped with the saggy skin I have left around and under my belly button area, and has had an overall smoothing effect.  </li>
            <li> I really dont like giving neg.reviews if I dont like a product I still try and find some positive in it, BUT THIS PRODUCT FOR 80$ was soooo not worth it,it didnt stick to my body,the lotion was just no good and the material was cheap cloth......</li>
            <li> Get up off your lazy butt, hit the gym or a trail, starting prepping healthy meals that will last you for atleast 2 days, I always post this in my reviews</li>
            <li> Get up off your lazy butt, hit the gym or a trail, starting prepping healthy meals that will last you for atleast 2 days, I always post this in my reviews</li>
            <li> I tried it-lost a couple of inches the first day, was the same measurements as I started on the second day and  gained an inch after using it the second day-</li>
            <li> In my personal opinion this product is a complete scam!</li>
            <li> I am not extremely overweight</li>
            <li> One thing specifically is a diuretic, which causes MAJOR dehydration.  </li>
            <li> When I called customer service several times yesterday, there was no live person only a recorded message that no one is available due to the \\&quot;high volume of</li>
            <li> From this seller, they were pretty dry, and that&#x27;s why the botanical&#x27;s didn&#x27;t infuse properly.</li>
            <li> It may work for someone else but for myself this is yet another failed attempt at weight loss without the actual exercise, eating healthy regime that is required in life to actually have success.  </li>
            <li> Of course the review was very negative and suggested Lucalean as a better option.  </li>
            <li> So as I squeak every time I walk, can barely sit down because I&#x27;ve wrapped myself up so tight in saran wrap trying to make sure I don&#x27;t lose it</li>
            <li> 72 hours after each wrap you may see a slight difference, but it goes right back to normal even with enhanced diet and exercise the results do not last over 3 days.</li>
            <li> I usually buy these wraps for special events or vacations.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, the herbs used caused me to have an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I barely passed the practice test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im only 14 years old</li>
            <li> but when drinking that much water I expected to go alot.</li>
            <li> Took only 2 applications for satisfactory results and after 3 apps ALL the dimples on my rear are completely gone.</li>
            <li> I look like a 16 year old (from the back).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done 4 so far and have not seen any results even though I&#x27;ve followed the instructions religiously.</li>
            <li> I put on a wrap, drink water and detox juice for the entire day and the following two days I eat light meals with a lot of water (3L) and green tea (to boost the metabolism).</li>
            <li> I could have died with anaphlyactic reactions and apparently that does not warrant a refund because I \\&quot;used their product.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, I have tried all 4 of my wraps, and never really saw much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> The four wraps I received was definitely and old batch.</li>
            <li> I think I should be a complete refund for customer because they do not work properly</li>
            <li> So far I have only used one wrap</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work; apparently it&#x27;s a downline thing and shouldn&#x27;t be on Amazon at all.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product one time thus far...</li>
            <li> Barely lost anything.</li>
            <li> Looked old, package that contained wraps was open when I received it.</li>
            <li> It may not be a complete fix for extra skin</li>
            <li> The actual patches seemed to be old</li>
            <li> I will write another review once I complete the entire package.</li>
            <li> Tried it again 72 hours later &amp; left it on much longer - no further resulst.  </li>
            <li> I lost one inch in my waist and hips with my first wrap and no difference with the second, and I did drink a ton if water almost two gallons a day, I never even used the other two because I figured the hassle of sleeping in the wrap wasn&#x27;t worth not losing anything, but my skin did appear to be a little bit tighter...</li>
            <li> I thought that seemed pretty shady and a little familiar</li>
            <li> i will certainly recommend it to other people-</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t lose inches right away but by the next morning I was down.  </li>
            <li> right Britney, you just wasted your money what were you thinking?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didnt really see big results I guess, but did loose couple of inches in my waist</li>
            <li> I tried the wrap and sus lose a few inches, but, it left a huge red mark on my stomach that is still there 2 years later!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend further research to those interested in purchasing anything from this shady company.</li>
            <li> It did not do what was promised, did not loose any inches at all with all four wraps.</li>
            <li> All you other people like me trying to be skinny fast, look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> I think that the product was probably expired, thus the much cheaper price compared to other sellers.  </li>
            <li> I struggle with drinking water and due to health issues can not do any intense exercise.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference other than softer skin.</li>
            <li> Other then the price it does really work&lt;</li>
            <li> I do not see no single changes in my belly .</li>
            <li> I think this a good product for detoxing and you might see a few inches loss but its not a magic wrap, your not going to loose extra weight just by doing these wraps.</li>
            <li> so you dont go back to the same old blah</li>
            <li> representatives talked to me like I was the biggest dummy in the world, incapable of following even the simplest of instructions, and basically were saying that if the wraps didn&#x27;t work it was my own fault for doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> Of you are thin and tan and have trouble with dry belly skin, this may be great for you.  </li>
            <li> No soap or lotion on the area, hot shower or brush skin to open pores, place wrap then seal with ceran or a constriction garment, no exercise and drink half your body weight in water oz.&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Skipping ahead, I report that not only have my arms and back fat firmed, tightened, and shrank to a considerably noticeable degree after only 2 wraps</li>
            <li> And when I asked to cancel..as I certainly didn&#x27;t plan to subject myself to anymore pain..</li>
            <li> She&#x27;d kept urging me to try it, but I thought (just like I have about so many other products) that just because it worked for her didn&#x27;t mean it would for me.</li>
            <li> I took a steaming hot shower to open my pours (after reading a little into this</li>
            <li> , im about to order me other warps high recommended</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed because I&#x27;ve seen such great reviews on it</li>
            <li> The wraps I got from here were far from dry.  </li>
            <li> absolutely nothing changed after wearing it for an hour and a half.  </li>
            <li> much cheaper (less than $28</li>
            <li> last time I bought and you can get at least 3 full body wraps from one jar)</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for a quick fix.....</li>
            <li> So I ordered two more boxes of wraps but this time I ordered from seller EYEWEAR PHARMACY and let me to u buyer beware the wrap was so dry that it look like they where outdated and the wraps did not work as well so do not buy from eyewear pharmacy</li>
            <li> , i sleep with a cami on, tight enough so it wont move around much, in the morning</li>
            <li> It took two wraps for me to really figure out how to apply the wrap tight enough.</li>
            <li> pure waste of my money.</li>
            <li> These little miracles really do work.</li>
            <li> Two days after my second wrap, my neighbor came up to me and asked me if I have some sort of shrinking disorder because I had become so thin so quickly!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been down that road countless times, and like so many other people, I don&#x27;t have money to waste like that.</li>
            <li> With reading 50/50 of good and bad reviews I decided to buy a four pack from the amazon warehouse for like 76 dollars.  </li>
            <li> is what i do: (before bed)&lt;br /&gt;1. take a shower dry off and skin brush my whole stomach area, enough to get the blood circulating and get the area warm</li>
            <li> Body Wraps 4 pack because after trying 1 single wrap and got no results I was told I needed to try at least the 4 pack to get full potential results...</li>
            <li> After the full treatment of wraps(4 wraps) it is hardly noticeable at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they send me one package either expired or a poor imitation.</li>
            <li> Even after the first one, you see a difference, BUT only after 72 hours of drinking AT LEAST 64 oz of WATER daily.  </li>
            <li> i know is that when i&#x27;m around other 45 year old ladies</li>
            <li> you need something to get your stomach flat or  from getting bigger; you want to use these.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> (they actually ask me how do i get my stomach so flat</li>
            <li> when i put my first wrap on and all that other junk, i lost a few inches, but the very next day, i gained all my inches back and tripled them.</li>
            <li> I know, call me a sucker, but I was supporting a coworker the second time I purchased them.</li>
            <li> If I could get a refund I certainly would because I am NOT satisfied at all with this product.</li>
            <li> And you are helping a small business owner as opposed to a large corporation.    </li>
            <li> &quot; (I must mention, I have excessive loose skin due to a significant weightloss).</li>
            <li> Im not sure if this did all the trick for me to lose weight because I also exercise for 10 days straight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure these wraps really work.  </li>
            <li> my stomich shrunk drastically, I wrapped my tummy with elastic wrap left it on for as long as I could 7 hours.</li>
            <li> Wraps sold online are often more expensive than buying from a distributor and can be old and dried out.</li>
            <li> People need to realize that, it won&#x27;t make your tummy flat in 45 mins....</li>
            <li> never has any children and wanted to have a flat stomach</li>
            <li> I am not fat at all, I&#x27;m pretty thick but in a skinny way?</li>
            <li> It Works Global, the company that created and markets the Ultimate Body Applicator, SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITS distributors from selling their products on Amazon, Ebay, Craigslist as well as other places such as these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered my first box, but due to changes in my personal life (impending move, etc), I was not able to do the program.</li>
            <li> i did notice a slight difference (used for cellulite) but it seems like u would need alot more to get a dramatic result.</li>
            <li> I have a 3 month old child and yes ..that baby roll has lost half its size after one applicator...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of messy and smells weird.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty thin overall, but my stomach is a disaster after having my second child 6 months ago.  </li>
            <li> But the loose skin was NOT noticeably firmer which was my ONLY goal  </li>
            <li> I decided that there were several several other products that would benefit me as well.</li>
            <li> It tingled a little bit, made my skin feel soft, but did nothing to take off any inches from my waistline.  </li>
            <li> this is still the same product the company sells so it doesn&#x27;t matter if you get it from Amazon or pay the ridiculous $100 to a &#x27;real&#x27;</li>
            <li> They were old products and the gel was half dry.</li>
            <li> and right away I had lost at least 2\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> After several abdominal surgeries and minimal exercise last year due to health issues, I was left being 10 lbs.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product negative stars, I absolutely would.</li>
            <li> This in no way works long term.  </li>
            <li> Not really for the big girls, unless you have the money to purchase this treatment 20 or 30 times.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money</li>
            <li> I also did not wear the wrap as long as I was told to.</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of my money.  </li>
            <li> They are a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> They could be old, dried out</li>
            <li> so I drank my normal amount of water and had my usual glass of wine with dinner.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because I&#x27;m still in the unknown about its lasting results</li>
            <li> I lost two inches and the results stayed for a long while (months).</li>
            <li> It definitely did not work as expected.</li>
            <li> It works short term and was what I expected.</li>
            <li> tell clients to leave it on a long time..</li>
            <li> was the green body works applicators which do not work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of $ $.</li>
            <li> And you have no idea how long these have been sitting in someones house.  </li>
            <li> and you will get affordable prices and deals in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;Any</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised these things haven&#x27;t killed someone from dehydration yet.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> Wraps work well as long as you continue to use them once a week.</li>
            <li> Also the package was a complete mess!</li>
            <li> I guess it just works different for other</li>
            <li> It definitely made a difference on my stomach but did not notice any difference on the other locations.</li>
            <li> and they are so much more expensive than buying them wholesale from a distributor!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the individual wraps to try in the past and I like them and can tell you they work ONLY if you are currently on a diet/excercise regime.  </li>
            <li> I really havent used the product but done exstensive research, and they come off as a very shady company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these wraps and the moisture was all dry and the wrap was too dry to apply.</li>
            <li> But I drank half my body weight in water daily for the past five days, took before and after pictures and measurements (lost 1.5 inches around my navel), kept the wrap on for 2.5 hours, and have been eating fairly normally since wrapping.</li>
            <li> Overall it was a total waste of money</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last for long not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical to try these, especially after using the first one and noticing almost no results, but after the 2nd and now third wrap, im really starting to notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> I think short term maybe for a few hours after, but I think you might get the same immediate results if you just wrap yourself with plastic wrap for a while...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t lose a single inch.  </li>
            <li> Paying up to 25.00 for just one single wrap is cray cray.  </li>
            <li> Not one single</li>
            <li> I have used three of the raps so far and see very little results.</li>
            <li> I am of average size with some extra fat on my tummy from kids.</li>
            <li> I wear a fitbit to keep track of my daily activity level, caloric intake, and water intake (on average 12-14K steps a day, 20 stair flights, plus 30 minutes of calisthenic training designed by my trainer I see once a week.  </li>
            <li> I would be extatic if I could loose about 5 pounds in my belly area.  </li>
            <li> i loose 5 1/2 inches</li>
            <li> Instead, they arrived loose, in a padded mailing envelope.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve noticed my pants were now loose</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t loose the baby pouch</li>
            <li> but you continue to loose for up to three days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just tried everything to loose this baby weight and nothing works.  </li>
            <li> Pants were a bit loose around the waist.  </li>
            <li> Did everything I was supposed to do by the book, and although my stomach isn&#x27;t big to begin with it didn&#x27;t go down at all.  </li>
            <li> was a total of 4 from a 20 down to a 14/16 and I am looking to continue the process because IT</li>
            <li> I measured in 2 places and they were 38 and 34 i only used the wrap for an hour and layed down and relaxed while it was on.</li>
            <li> With the elasticity in your skin breaking down as we age this will help tighten it back up which will cause you to lose the inches not the pounds.</li>
            <li> If you eat terribly and aren&#x27;t a healthy conscious individual, these wraps won&#x27;t work for you, or the results will not last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not a realistic concept.</li>
            <li> Actually her belly measurement increased slightly.</li>
            <li> Is have small dimples from tiny stretch marks around my belly button left over from my pregnancy and they are still visable just as always.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed I have only 2 more to go</li>
            <li> If u don&#x27;t continue it goes back in less than a week.</li>
            <li> With this 4 pack, I noticed immediately that the expiration date on the outside of the box was crossed out in black marker.  </li>
            <li> the ultimate body wraps work better than this it works wrap, did not work for me at all....very disappointed</li>
            <li> Overall, zero inches lost and lots of mess to deal with not to mention the cost.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m taking my time to report every single item here!</li>
            <li> The day before they were too tight, and now they&#x27;re too big!  </li>
            <li> but I just left it on for 2 hours and tried wearing some tight shorts to keep them in place which didn&#x27;t work too well.</li>
            <li> FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS ANNNNNND put in effort of changing your diet plans, or if you just follow the little direction 100% only, u&#x27;ll get the results</li>
            <li> but I wanted something to tone a little extra before a vegas trip.</li>
            <li> Takes a little of the water weight off your mid section.</li>
            <li> and I felt it needed a little extra help.</li>
            <li> ok ..then I got a \\&quot;bad wrap\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> They also have a money back guarantee and NO reps trying to push you into buying an expensive product that (chances are) will do absolutely nothing for you.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it worked as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> I spent $93 on this got 4 applicators used them all on my stomach</li>
            <li> I spent over $80 on a product that did nothing.</li>
            <li> I showered, applied the messy wrap to my big, overweight, stretch mark-covered tummy, and secured it with an ACE bandage.  </li>
            <li> Its not a whole lot of skin either like</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband to lose a couple inches before his pt test for the military...</li>
            <li> After 2 months I saw absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> Total waste of time and money for her.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as expected.</li>
            <li> there were absolutely no changes in my body after doing all 4 wraps.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste another second waiting to makeover your life.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> Just a few key pointers, and please be mindful that one wrap is a treat</li>
            <li> AND THE RESULTS ARE MINIMAL......</li>
            <li> These did not really work.</li>
            <li> I would purchase again, only if the expiration date was not crossed out to ensure the wraps are not expired or dried up a bit.</li>
            <li> The seller shipped it promptly but the product did not do what was expected.  </li>
            <li> I had absolutely no results &amp; followed the rules 100%</li>
            <li> The Harder</li>
            <li> However, I am only giving it 3 stars because the product box was missing the expiration date.  </li>
            <li> but as a way to lose weight and keep it off its total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It had been a few months since i used them and my belly was getting fat again, (the last applicators i used</li>
            <li> I have applied the gel only a few times, but I already like it.</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> I want to say be careful about buying off of Amazon.</li>
            <li> A couple days ago, I opened up a box of body applicators, and to my dismay, the product was all dried out - on all four individually wrapped packages!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is a big waste of money.</li>
            <li> Sadly not so much, I&#x27;m not over weight but thought it might help with cellulite.  </li>
            <li> Since using the wraps I have lost 3 inches around my thighs, 2 inches on my upper arm (good bye nasty saggy arms), and 4 inches around my belly button.</li>
            <li> and she was very upset that someone was posting false reviews.  </li>
            <li> So the next wrap I only drank 3 and didn&#x27;t lose anything :/!</li>
            <li> and I am not a large person just wanted to tighten things up a bit before a swimsuit trip, but wont do this again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve weight, but after having a nine and a half pound baby my belly was a bit out of shape and skin was stretched out too.</li>
            <li> Ladies do not waste your money, I learned hard work and exercise is the only way to go, there is no magic pill or in this case wrap.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected for the amount of money I Paid.</li>
            <li> This product was such a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try the other products.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money &amp; time!</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for other weight loss solutions, I would recommend you follow @endless creations (WITH A K instead of C) @voluptuous chicks, and @couture bod (NO SPACES) on inst a gram.</li>
            <li> I have learned that the It Works Company does not sell through Amazon and the box I received was an It Works Product, but did not work because of expiration dates or any other reasonings.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not hit the 72 hour mark or later yet so I&#x27;m not sure if it will stay off</li>
            <li> None of the other wraps I bought from a</li>
            <li> IT WORKS prohibits distributers from using Amazon and other online outlets to sell products for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried other products too.</li>
            <li> i ended up throwing the other 2 away.  </li>
            <li> I sold the other two to the co-worker for what I&#x27;d paid.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other products from</li>
            <li> I am not saying it would not work for other people</li>
            <li> It was a total waste of money!</li>
            <li> so like any ordinary person i did research and watched videos and went to websites looked up tips and how to wrap myself properly..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for the other wrap sellers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even going to bother doing the other two.</li>
            <li> hope this helps with your decision to try the wraps and their other nutrition products.</li>
            <li> Other than are restless nights sleep.</li>
            <li> but I do have some sagging skin due to pregnancy and stretchmarks.  </li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL!</li>
            <li> not work just another way for other ppl</li>
            <li> ..stomach turned rock hard..was not pretty.  </li>
            <li> These symptoms usually didn&#x27;t happen until the next day.  </li>
            <li> do, however, like a lot of the other ItWorks products (defining gel, greens, etc) just can&#x27;t recommend the wraps.  </li>
            <li> , im just waiting to use the other 3 idk what for</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> This a total waste of money!</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to other and will again.</li>
            <li> but they were a little dry.</li>
            <li> I followed all the instructions from other &amp;#34;it works&amp;#34; sites and I&#x27;m an active person, but didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> , the second one helped me get rid of an inch and a half!!</li>
            <li> I followed all the directions, but I guess my body chemistry is not compatible with the active ingredients of the wraps.</li>
            <li> I did not buy these to lose weight or get a flatter tummy (I&#x27;m 105lbs), however I did buy these with the hope that they would firm up loose skin on my stomach (post-pregnancy).</li>
            <li> Waste of money didn&#x27;t loose any weight.</li>
            <li> (but due to the fact that i come home late sometimes I purchased a carb blocker (white kidney bean extract 1000mg))</li>
            <li> working on 12 hours when I&#x27;m drinking all this water peeing like a pregnant woman again and of course running to the scale and measuring myself like a mad</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to get it apart to make smaller pieces.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first however the results spoke for themselves...</li>
            <li> Takes time and hard work, but it definitely is a BIG help.</li>
            <li> I can see the outline of the stupid paper where my stretch marks are very prominent and now where they are hardly there.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s seriously not worth it for me.</li>
            <li> all were a dark brown color.</li>
            <li> Not worth the purchase at all.</li>
            <li> This package was expensive, but not as much as having to buy it every month as part of a so called deal.</li>
            <li> For almost $100, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I also eat a 95% vegan diet and drink on average about 115oz of water a day for my weight of 153 lbs.  </li>
            <li> Now i know that the quality is way worse than the ones directly from the company.</li>
            <li> and I will stand behind my product and guarantee completely.</li>
            <li> They are NOT a weightloss wrap, so if you rate them low because you did not loose weight then that is unfair.</li>
            <li> The pictures I have seen were not very accurate for me</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t lose any inches in my waist even though I put it on for at least an hour and a half, followed instructions and such but didn&#x27;t provide any results.</li>
            <li> (yea i know that might make my words less valid) but she forced me to drink water like CONSTANTLY when i was at work</li>
            <li> Boy was that a let down.  </li>
            <li> There is no &amp;#34;quick cure&amp;#34; when it comes down to it.</li>
            <li> freind uses this and swears up and down that it works.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind this tightens and breaks down you fat in the area you apply.</li>
            <li> Thumbs down to this product.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!!</li>
            <li> My varicose veins are less visible after one month and scares are not as dark.</li>
            <li> Very thin and 2 of them were really discolored upon opening.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the other ones in the green packaging</li>
            <li> These wraps are hard to put on, and the directions are not very clear in how to do it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t, however, write the review and have notified the appropriate people that someone was using my name to post reviews (which would ne absolutely idiotic of me to do anyway)!</li>
            <li> I have a slight &amp;#34;mom&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but all other components were less than I knew I could score!</li>
            <li> But when I put on my pants... holy cow!  </li>
            <li> I disputed it with my bank, and they got me my money back, but low and behold, It Works disputed my claim, even though I had proof that I was unable to contact anyone, including my email that I did not authorize the charge to my account.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not even half an inch.</li>
            <li> I had a slight reduction in measurement immediately after use</li>
            <li> I lost maybe a half inch but probably cause I was sweating water off from wrapping my body in plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> I was told to drink half my body weight in water every day for three days for each wrap.  </li>
            <li> therefore it&#x27;s reducing in less inches..</li>
            <li> And continue to drink half of your body weight for the 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t drink what was recommended ( drinking half you body weight in water)</li>
            <li> The Less Fat</li>
            <li> but the measurements were less.</li>
            <li> Maybe a half inch or so.</li>
            <li> I got rid of about half an inch</li>
            <li> Yes I noticed a slight change</li>
            <li> as i age i need something that keeps me from getting a fat stomach (which typically creeps on us women as our hormones decline).</li>
            <li> The lotion on the wrap has a slight menthol smell and after 45 minutes, my skin had a pinkish tone.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m trying to slim down just a little.</li>
            <li> I trust your description which is not true at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Then I put saram wrap as tight as I could around it</li>
            <li> what I DO know is that this was a waste of money and if could go back to my previous day&#x27;s self and say \\&quot;NO, seriously, TRUST the bad reviews\\</li>
            <li> Dosent work waste of money and waste of time not worth it at All, I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please don&#x27;t waste your money and wish you had listened to your previous day&#x27;s self as well......</li>
            <li> Depending on how you decide to purchase them you can get them for as little as $59.00 a box.  </li>
            <li> tightened my skin a little, but no inch or weight loss.&lt;br /&gt;kind</li>
            <li> it was the stretch mark that they fade a little bit</li>
            <li> all looking fo something to give us a little help</li>
            <li> Took it off after 3 hours, noticed a little bit....kept drinking....</li>
            <li> I think this worked a little</li>
            <li> I saw a little change, but nothing drastic like some people do.</li>
            <li> If it was a little cheaper, maybe I&#x27;d try it again</li>
            <li> I weight 140 and just need to lose a little around my belly</li>
            <li> they were a little messy to put on yourself but would try again did notice the difference after a week</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL!!!</li>
            <li> BUT be advised, DO NOT order them from Amazon, ebay or any other resale sites!!</li>
            <li> Really, I deserve a one star review for being stupid enough to think it might work.</li>
            <li> This wrap is gross, filled with nasty vicks creamy texture all over the wrap which gets everywhere.</li>

            <li> I was very disappointed, it did not work for me at all, was expecting better results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> SO IF YOUR NOT TIGHTENING AND FIRMING you should not be writing a review on this product based on your naive little brain who didnt do their research before buying the product.</li>
            <li> waste of my hard earned money I did not los anything</li>
            <li> There was no expectation date on the box, so I really think they are just selling out all the bad product.</li>

            <li> Almost 3 weeks later and even tho I have done everything wrong</li>
            <li> I have NEVER been accused of being shady, however, and while I am insulted by the smear, I realize that is the price of doing business in the internet age.</li>
            <li> i have spent over $500 dollars on these products and got worse results then when i started.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of my money!</li>

            <li> There is no magic in these.</li>
            <li> as I usually do anyways.</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s over no more tightness after that&lt;</li>
            <li> This product made me ill, like literally I do not feel that there is enough health information provided about this product, but the service provider did deliver the product within the designated time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li> Well not only did she became sick since some of the ingredients suck all the essential body fluids (or at least reduce them)</li>
            <li> I left it on for an hour and a half,  on my stomach, anxious to take it off as it burns, its cold.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a little sticky and weird feeling but just dress down a little that day</li>
            <li> Had such high expectations and was totally disappointed!</li>
            <li> My skin was very firm</li>
            <li> Needless to say, after doing all this and spending $100, we were quite disappointed when we took them off only to find they did absolutely nothing for either one of us.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was charged causing me financial hard ship.</li>
            <li> Just a huge waste of money.we were very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m thin, I still had a slight cellulite-y appearance on my stomach.  </li>
            <li> Spend your hard earned money somewhere else.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s to hard to handle</li>
            <li> This product hardly worked.</li>
            <li> Hard to keep on.</li>
            <li> I was extremely hopeful that this product would work but was greatly disappointed when it fell short.  </li>
            <li> Being wrapped up tight was painful because of my medical issues.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes but didn&#x27;t see any changes :(</li>
            <li> oh well at least i know now.</li>
            <li> but I had such a disappointing experience (well, in my case, experiences).</li>
            <li> The least amount was 3 inches.</li>
            <li> How naive are you people?</li>
            <li> Their customer representative was extremely rude as well.</li>
            <li> but I was hoping for at least a bit of noticeable change.</li>
            <li> It did not get me the results that I was expecting, I was told that I had to at least purchase two to three applications.</li>
            <li> The wrap is meant to tighten the skin, which a lot of the negative reviewers are not taking into consideration.</li>
            <li> i know, it sucks.</li>
            <li> I applied the wrap to my stomach area late in the evening.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical that it would do anything, but I was curious.</li>
            <li> i\\&quot;m a sucker</li>
            <li> It just gets cold on your skin (it feels like a piece of transparent plastic with white toothpaste on it).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late twenties</li>
            <li> They had very little product on it and was no use to me!</li>
            <li> After calling and talking to customer service, I was very disappointed to learn that they do not offer a money back guarantee on their products - just out of luck, apparently.  </li>
            <li> my belly was big and nasty&#x3D;( and now is much better....</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money!!</li>
            <li> i mean NOTHING happened.  </li>
            <li> I have recommended them to a few friends!!</li>
            <li> Im not satisfied!</li>
            <li> Weird activity on their YouTube and on other websites where they verbally berate  and abuse customers who spill the truth.</li>
            <li> The other reviews also look fake.  </li>
            <li> Also its not a magic solution while you sit there and do nothing!</li>
            <li> So go ahead and waste your hard earned money and buy this crap and then come back on here and try to warn others..........</li>
            <li> I am disappointed so maybe I&#x27;ll stick with getting them directly from It</li>
            <li> The inside was dried and hard!!</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> ITS A SCAM SERIOUSLY PEOPLE DONT WAIT</li>
            <li> Save yourself the money, seriously.</li>
            <li> wrap on instead of unraveling myself from this tangled uncomfortable mess.</li>
            <li> I tried to go to sleep, but I felt really uncomfortable in my supppperrrr tight girdle</li>
            <li> So I was a little skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> A little too expensive to keep buying.</li>
            <li> The product is expensive, the process is messy, the smell is soothing.</li>
            <li> Not good at all.</li>
            <li> Weird and waste of money.</li>
            <li> Hard to use and didn&#x27;t do anything!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product at all, expensive and very little if any results.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am hugely disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> I wish I could rate a negative star!</li>
            <li> sorry, i just was not satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this twice thinking maybe I didn&#x27;t drink enough water:(</li>
            <li> and I hope anyone considering them will ignore the negative reviews and try a wrap!</li>
            <li> your stretch marks will at least disappear!</li>
            <li> I lost 0 inches and feel dumb for wasting my money on this. 0</li>
            <li> Way too expensive for not very good results.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s to tighten and firm !!!</li>
            <li> kinda expensive but works hard to keep in place even with saran wrap</li>
            <li> I am addicted to these wraps.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product just because of the hype about the product did not match with the progress I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to eat poorly and watch TV all day and maintain your results.  </li>
            <li> the rest overnight for approximately 8 hours</li>
            <li> Just not happy with the customer service I received</li>
            <li> Even then, I&#x27;m thoroughly confused why it would work on some but not others.</li>
            <li> i tired i was not expecting a miracle</li>
            <li> It makes me soooooo annoyed to see that \\&quot;it didn&#x27;t work\\</li>
            <li> I always give the benefit of the doubt, but this product gives false hope.  </li>
            <li> I think this is a dangerous product..please be very careful!!</li>
            <li> I think this one was fake, I mean there&#x27;s no effect</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> I wrote down my measurements and opened the package.&lt;br /&gt;Slapped that sucker on my stomach and saran wrapped the crap out of myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i spent $90 and was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> when i took it off i felt like a cold burning feeling and it felt weird for a little while but went away after 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Others are having dramatic results...</li>
            <li> I feel very sorry to cheat myself by ordering such bad product.</li>
            <li> My wife was talked into this product a few weeks ago, she tried it and it literally made her sick.</li>
            <li> But remember there is no magic wand that can make years of bad choices disappear in 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li> This was a waste of 100.00 dollars and i will never purchase it again.!!!!</li>

            <li> It is completely useless.  </li>
            <li> Way too expensive for what you get here.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately what I did lose was water weight because I ended up with a urinary tract infection from dehydration and had to go to the doctor for antibiotics</li>
            <li> She said she would have to be an idiot to do something like that, which apparently she is an idiot because the reply came from Sallyomalley.  </li>
            <li> was cause me to run to the bathroom at the worst times possible and made my stomach make crazy noises.  </li>
            <li> (and the loose skin wasn&#x27;t even that terrible to begin with).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money, very disappointed with purchase.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t find the smell bad or the tingling uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I wrapped my hips and stomach with plastic wrap and wore them for 2 hours while drinking water like crazy.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely unhappy with this seller,and do not want to use the product if it is not sealed from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> The worst part was that I followed the directions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; and both (yes, I was stupid enough to try it twice)</li>
            <li> This is not a criticism of this seller but my scathing review of the product and the reps I dealt with.</li>
            <li> have had a baby, and I have crazy stretch marks all over my body, a gnarly scar from my the C-section and a mothers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m weighing myself like a crazy person</li>
            <li> I want be buying another one once again disappointing.</li>
            <li> Unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> the worst thing I&#x27;ve wasted money on...</li>
            <li> this so cold &amp;#34;IT WORKS&amp;#34</li>
            <li> And they are so expensive!</li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical and kept dodging anyone selling them....</li>
            <li> and I was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> A very expensive mistake...</li>
            <li> But I was very skeptical</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about getting them through here and also about trying them</li>
            <li> I knew something was very wrong.  </li>
            <li> This is a VERY expensive product and the promise to lose serious inches off of your body after three uses is insane.</li>
            <li> My doctor said it is physically impossible to put anything on your skin to melt fat from inside your body.</li>
            <li> Horrible products that do not work and absolutely rude customer service representatives!</li>
            <li> i got really bad rib pain.</li>
            <li> &quot; I would indeed trust the bad reviews.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Maybe that batch was bad.</li>
            <li> Depends how bad you want your bulge to disappear.</li>
            <li> office not as a product with bad reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m truly frustrated</li>

            <li> I feel horribly sick the day after each wrap I used...</li>
            <li> I wanted this to work so bad, but I am disappointed and 100 dollars poorer.</li>
            <li> I have used 2 of the 4 and it sucks!!!!</li>
            <li> of disappointed, but it was just to try it out anyway.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When I was ready to use it and I opened it, you could tell it was old</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely fashion. I was really skeptical about the product but family members told me to try it. I know it says to just do 45 min the first time but I didn’t want to crush my rising hopes so I left it on overnight with saran wrap and my spanx on top. I only lost a little bit but that&#x27;s better than nothing! I was surprised that it worked and am eager to try another. It doesn’t last, or maybe I just didn’t notice that it did, but for a night and a one time use, it worked for me. Good for slimming before an event.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see results!! Thought this product was a joke to be honest!! Would not recommend this to anyone!! Buyer beware!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know where to start! Probably with my money back! This product was such a waste of money! Do not buy it, no matter how many good reviews you may see. This wrap is gross, filled with nasty vicks creamy texture all over the wrap which gets everywhere. All this does is make your skin tingly. WASTE OF MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Followed the directions, I even got the gel, didn&#x27;t see a difference whatsoever. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t give this product any stars but this review requires I give one.</li>
            <li> i bought the 4 pack for $60.00. very disapointed, did not see any results. also been using the thermofit. i have not weighed myself yet im going to wait till its been 4 weeks. i just got my fatfighters in the mail today and going to try those. if i dont see any results after spending all this money i will be very upset. next time i will try tge 21 day fix. heard awesome rhings about it and its way cheaper</li>
            <li> This is a fraudulent company.  I sent back some products and they told me they never recieved them and would not refund my money.  If you are looking to lose weight, a healthy diet and exersise is the best way.</li>
            <li> These wraps did not work at all. All they did was give me a tingly feeling and hope. Waste of money really..</li>
            <li> I liked it and it worked amazing the first time and I lost 7\\&quot;. But I got sick from drinking the 8 bottles of water I did. So the next wrap I only drank 3 and didn&#x27;t lose anything :/!</li>
            <li> I used all 4 and noticed a huge differance! Follow the directions though! Wish they would lower the price on these because I would buy more and I know my friends who have also bought these would buy more! Make sure to take before and after pictures! I measured but didn&#x27;t see any &amp;#34;inches&amp;#34; change. But proportion changed for sure with the pictures!</li>
            <li> I used this twice and saw NO results!  Waste of my money.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> We followed the directions as specified and it did nothing at all.Just a huge waste of money.we were very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product at all, expensive and very little if any results. I used this exactly per directions and I didn&#x27;t notice much if any difference and I am not a large person just wanted to tighten things up a bit before a swimsuit trip, but wont do this again don&#x27;t waste your time and money</li>
            <li> Excellent item.. works fabulous! You can deffinetly see results when you remove..its is totally worth it! Glad I tried this item!</li>
            <li> As of now, i am a believer in these wraps.  I was VERY skeptical and kept dodging anyone selling them.... until I was heading to an event and really wanting to drop a few inches.  I did everything as the site said - scrubbed with salt, applied witch hazel, wrapped and then plastic wrapped.... and after two wraps, I have lost about 7 inches total from the three areas of my tummy I measured.  I did not change my eating habits one bit.  I did drink more water.  The loss has maintained now over a couple of weeks, and including a 5 lb weight gain.  I am continuing the wraps and now doing my upper arms.  I will keep posting results as I do more of them, as I am very interested if these results stay or begin to fade after a time of not using the wraps regularly.  I am happy I&#x27;ve given them a go though!</li>
            <li> I recieved these is a great amt of time but these arent very useful. I didnt see results, dont waste your money</li>
            <li> I used these as part of some last-ditch efforts toward fitting in a bridesmaid dress when I was retaining water.  I didn&#x27;t need to lose much size to make the dress work, so I threw everything I had at it as far as working out, eating, water and these things went.  I used TWO at once (despite the supposed rule of only using one your first time) at the recommendation of a consultant.  I wrapped my hips and stomach with plastic wrap and wore them for 2 hours while drinking water like crazy.  Took them off and rubbed and rubbed and rubbed the excess lotion into my skin.  I measured and looked the same as before - right after the wrap, the next day and the two days after that.  Followed all the rules with drinking water, no alcohol, etc.  No change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know these work for some folks.  The wraps I got from here were far from dry.  I had the sensation of having a heating pad applied to the area of the wraps while I wore them, so I believe they were &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; - just didn&#x27;t have an effect on my size.</li>
            <li> The product is expensive, the process is messy, the smell is soothing. I have a slight &amp;#34;mom&amp;#34; belly from having three kids as well as the effects of getting older. I would be extatic if I could loose about 5 pounds in my belly area.  So upon hearing all they hype surrounding the ItWorks product, I&#x27;m thinking &amp;#34;I only have a few pounds to loose, I eat realtively healthy, and drink water 90 percent of the day anyway&amp;#34; I am a perfect candiate for this product.. Wrong. After following package directions, I had no measureable reduction in my belly area just smoother skin which did last several days but I could&#x27;ve gotten that with a sea salt scrub and lotion which is much more cost effective.  Overall, I am hugely disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, the Ultimate Body Applicator had me making a visit to my Doctor&#x27;s office.  Apparently, the herbs used caused me to have an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product because no matter how much excercise &amp; clean eating, I cant lose the loose skin &amp; slight budge brought on by child birth. This product is the only thin that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> These wraps are awesome - they really do work! My skin was smooth and more elastic with my first and second wrap. With my third, I lost actual inches! I was pretty skeptical at first. Can&#x27;t wait to try the other products.</li>
            <li> if i could i wouldnt even give it a star i did everything followed directions didnt see a diffrence waist of money</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to losing inches off my stomach. I had twins 7 months ago and my stomach hasn&#x27;t been the same since. I did everything your supposed to do and I woke up the first morning and was 3 inches smaller. Sounds good but as soon as the 72hrs were up the inches came right back. I think in order to keep the inches off you have to spend a WHOLE bunch of money and use the wraps every 3 days forever, oh an you wouldn&#x27;t be able to eat because as soon as I ate my stomach looked bigger again. It&#x27;s just not a realistic concept. What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Followed instructions, but it did nothing for me. Waste of $</li>
            <li> Listen people in order for these wraps to work you have to eat healthy, work out, drink plenty of water and cut out any junk food from your diet. You cannot enjoy a #1 w/ a coke and expect your wrap to work. Help the wrap, help you!!! Live a healthy lifestyle to speed up the process people.</li>
            <li> I lost inches from these wraps. Ok to use short term but not for long term use as they are a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> this is just a big fat lie  i have tried 2 applicators with no results</li>
            <li> I ordered the It Works Body Wraps 4 pack because after trying 1 single wrap and got no results I was told I needed to try at least the 4 pack to get full potential results...well let me tell you, that&#x27;s not the case.  I didn&#x27;t lose a single inch.  I drank a ton of water after each wrap, exfoliated my skin before wraps, left the wraps on even longer than the required 45 minutes in hopes it&#x27;d do something.  Now i&#x27;m being told I should buy all the accessories that go with the wraps to make it work...the cream, the greens, the pills, it&#x27;s seriously not worth it for me. It may work for someone else but for myself this is yet another failed attempt at weight loss without the actual exercise, eating healthy regime that is required in life to actually have success.  sorry folks.  not a miracle after all lol.</li>
            <li> Well i was optimistic about this, spend 85$, 4 wraps later 72 hours apart as directed along with saran wrap. didnt lose an inch. oh well at least i know now. im glad that there ARE people who have seen results tho, good for them. Wouldnt buy again for myself.</li>
            <li> So I was a little skeptical about this product. But I put it on over night and slept with it. I woke up and didnt see a huge difference until i compared pictures i had taken the night before. I lost 2.5 inches from my lower stomach! This was just from 1 applicator 1 time! I also noticed my belly button had shrunk (i had a deep, big belly button) and my strech marks had faded considerably! my skin is so much smoother as well! completely worth the money, i will be purchasing again!!!</li>
            <li> I had fabulous results with this product :)</li>
            <li> these worked amazing on my stretchmarks and scars. Seriously! It detoxed my system and made me feel great! Ive done 6 wraps and feel great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who dont lose are usually struggling with being \\&quot;backed up\\&quot; or \\&quot;irregular\\&quot; this keeps the toxins in your system on one aspect, but you are also detoxing the cells in your system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel great and love my results. Im down 6\\&quot; and my stretchmarks are almost gone!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product does not work AT ALL! Don&#x27;t watse your money. I followed the directions exactly &amp; did not have any inch loss or change in appearance. Total waste of money &amp; time!</li>
            <li> These things really work, but you can get them cheaper if you buy locally.  Depending on how you decide to purchase them you can get them for as little as $59.00 a box.  Find a distributor and don&#x27;t pay double the price online.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL!!! I tried the wrap and sus lose a few inches, but, it left a huge red mark on my stomach that is still there 2 years later! I don&#x27;t know if it burned me, or if I had some sort of allergic reaction but I highly prefer not to have a huge red mark on my stomach FOR LIFE then to lose a few inches for a week!</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon! It arrived on time and the price was great! But unfortunately the wrapps are NOT for everyone. I got a rash in the area applied so i you&#x27;re allergic to certain plants you shouldn&#x27;t use!</li>
            <li> I was concerned about my waist measurement for my upcoming PT test. I got lots of advice once I voiced concern. One being use Preparation H...so I did for my practice test. My waist was measured at 35...but all other components were less than I knew I could score! I barely passed the practice test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comes It Works! Wraps. I used one on Sunday in prep for my Tuesday PT test. I forgot the part about not using Dove soap &amp; lotion, I did drink the recommended amount of water &amp; resisted my love for energy drinks in those 3 days. I did not exercise at all in those 3 days, but my diet was clean. I measures in at 34in, did more push-ups &amp; sit-ups and ran OK...but I was not dehydrated and sore from a Preparation H overnight wrap. I will use the rest of my pack over the next couple weeks and update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If nothing else this wrap encourages a healthy lifestyle as your diet &amp; water consumption must be up to par in order for it to work. While It Works! does work...you have to put in a bit work also.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, and I just love it  and works like a charm!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Clearly a must have :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think these would work... but I&#x27;ve finally found something that really does. I took a before and after picture and my jaw dropped. The inches fell off and I felt like a whole new person. One wrap a week for a month and you&#x27;re a whole new person. I&#x27;m so thankful for these!!!</li>
            <li> Didnt really see big results I guess, but did loose couple of inches in my waist&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to a friend&lt;br /&gt;And I as well would continue using it</li>
            <li> Applied as directed and saw no difference at all.  Maybe it takes more than one application but I&#x27;m not going to spend another dime to find out.  I should have known better, but I thought based on some of the reviews it could possibly work.  That was my own foolish wishful thinking.  Save your money and buy some spanx!</li>
            <li> Seller was great. Product is great. Used on my thighs and my cellulite is GONE. Used on my tummy and helped tighten and also stretch marks are remarkably better! ! You just have to drink a lot of water. With one wrap I lost 7 inches off my hips and 4 inches off my waist</li>
            <li> Bought the four pack of this item after watching Youtube vidoes about how amazing this product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work, however for only about 12 hours.  This in no way works long term.  I used one wrap as directed.  I did not notice anything upon removing the wrap, went to bed and the next morning I did see a noticible difference in my belly and midsection.  However by the end of the first night the inches were back.  This is only good possibly if you are trying to fit into something for a special occassion.  Total waste of money.  Save your money or buy a treadmill instead.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.  I don&#x27;t think it worked as well as I expected. High hopes.  I do understand that everyone is different though.  Tried three wraps so far and no results.</li>
            <li> I felt some type of tighteness  on my skin after second wrap, but nothing else to say after the 3rd and 4th wrap. Didn work</li>
            <li> tightened my skin a little, but no inch or weight loss.&lt;br /&gt;kind of disappointed, but it was just to try it out anyway.</li>
            <li> It was probly one of the worst investments I&#x27;ve made. I had high hopes but didn&#x27;t see any changes :( waste of money</li>
            <li> I wanted so much for these to work... some magical way to lose weight I have put on... there is no such thing. Save your money. Seller was very kind and allowed me to return.</li>
            <li> Being in the &amp;#34;It Works&amp;#34; business as a distributor, personally I would not recommend buying this product. Not just from here, but from any online vendor. When I bought this I wasn&#x27;t in the business, and I personally liked the cheap price of it without having to sign up for anything like the company makes you. But you get what you pay for. Now i know that the quality is way worse than the ones directly from the company. When bought, I followed all steps, drank eight gallons of water, but still no effect. I used as directed, but the problem wasn&#x27;t me, but the packaging! From this seller, they were pretty dry, and that&#x27;s why the botanical&#x27;s didn&#x27;t infuse properly. I recommend just paying the $100 buying from a seller.&lt;br /&gt;Also if you&#x27;re looking for other weight loss solutions, I would recommend you follow @endless creations (WITH A K instead of C) @voluptuous chicks, and @couture bod (NO SPACES) on inst a gram. They will get you hooked up.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying its the company&#x27;s fault it didn&#x27;t work, but the online vendor&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see where anything is different... The product smells like sore muscle rub and heats up like muscle rub would. I did not see any results. For the price I would have hoped I would see something. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed.  This came with the packaging seal peeled back.  The box had obviously been tampered with.  I am extremely unhappy with this seller,and do not want to use the product if it is not sealed from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Many people say that they don&#x27;t lose any inches from this. I guess it just works different for other people.&lt;br /&gt;My aunt told me about this and I was very skeptical. She gave me a free one to try out and I figured I have nothing to lose. I followed the directions on it very carefully and after my first one I had already lost 1 inch on my belly!!! I decided to buy a 4 pack, and after each one I lost 0.5 inches. I was very pleased with the results. So after using 5 wraps I had lost a total of 3 inches!!! I went from 43\\&quot; to 40\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;If you are willing to try these out I would highly recommend buying just ONE to see if you like it and it works for you.&lt;br /&gt;I give this product 4 stars, because it as an easy way to drop some inches off your belly. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because they are too overpriced at $20 for one wrap. Im only 14 years old so I dont have a job or a lot of money. I would love to have bought some more for my legs, arms, and chest, but I cannot afford that many.</li>
            <li> I used this on my stomach, thighs and lower back.  It definitely made a difference on my stomach but did not notice any difference on the other locations.</li>
            <li> Seriously. Too good to be true.  It is like spreading PrepH on your area and wrapping with plastic wrap.  Doesnt work, save your money.</li>
            <li> It works is not a miracle but works, I have 4 kids I am 40 years old i been going to the gym for the last 3 years but the lower part of my stomach was like Adam Sandler in the movie click Lol&lt;br /&gt;Now look much better, im about to order me other warps high recommended</li>
            <li> I spent $93 on this got 4 applicators used them all on my stomach and it didn&#x27;t work! It&#x27;s not right all the pics iv seen had huge results there was a big difference but didn&#x27;t do anything for me. It&#x27;s a waste of money n it&#x27;s wrong.</li>
            <li> The product is working great.</li>
            <li> I love my wraps and Loyal Customers pay $59 for a box of four from an It Works distributor!  They do work!  A lot of it depends on your diet.  The better you eat, the better the results!  My name is Stacy D&#x27;Amato, I&#x27;m from North Carolina and I love these. Happy Wrapping!</li>
            <li> Terrible product does nothing of what it promised.</li>
            <li> The wraps have a temporary effect, but the only way to make a real change is to put in the sweat equity.</li>
            <li> My friend thought this worked for her so she convinced me I had to get it. Well the only reason she saw a difference in her problem area is because she started eating right and excercising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was foolish to believe a magic cream would actually make you lose fat. A very expensive mistake...</li>
            <li> I used all four in the SAME SPOT within 72 hours apart each and I&#x27;m highly disappointed no results at all but a rash from irritation. I do believe I should have bought it off the actual site and got t money&#x27;s worth instead of trying to get the best deal with the wrong results , I know now.</li>
            <li> you reduce but gave me pain and &amp;@%  in my breast so I ended in the Dr. office</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. These are probably better suited for someone with a small amount of stubborn belly fat. Not really for the big girls, unless you have the money to purchase this treatment 20 or 30 times. If you are of large stature, its best that you lose the weight first and then use these to firm up the skin.</li>
            <li> used this product along with the cream for 5 weeks with no results. don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this product</li>
            <li> I love eucalyptus and didn&#x27;t mind the lotion/smell, but it didn&#x27;t work. I used one box, a set of 4 wraps, and saw no difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never left a review in my life but I had such a disappointing experience (well, in my case, experiences). The wraps are overpriced and did absolutely nothing for me! The worst part was that I followed the directions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; and both (yes, I was stupid enough to try it twice) representatives talked to me like I was the biggest dummy in the world, incapable of following even the simplest of instructions, and basically were saying that if the wraps didn&#x27;t work it was my own fault for doing something wrong. Apparently this is a common &amp;#34;theme&amp;#34;  with many of their reps. This is not a criticism of this seller but my scathing review of the product and the reps I dealt with. The Lucalean wraps work for me and they are much cheaper with a money back guarantee. Nice people to deal with. Easy, etc. etc. Oh yea, they aren&#x27;t MLM. I don&#x27;t work for them so I hope I don&#x27;t leave that impression!!</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed. I spent over $80 on a product that did nothing. I would not recommend this to anyone...If there is some kind of sercret to make this work i&#x27;d love to hear it as i still have 2 left</li>
            <li> It DOES NOT WORK!  Do not buy from It Works! Global  They will charge you $50 to cancel for something that DOES NOT WORK.  DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> I bought a 4-pack of these wraps from ebay, skeptical, and sure they were not going to make any noticeable improvements to my body.  I read everything I could find on how to use them online, and followed directions and advice as such.  You can leave these on for a minimum of 45 mins and a maximum of 8 hours.  So I took my chances, and left my first wrap on the entire 8 hours.  I showered, applied the messy wrap to my big, overweight, stretch mark-covered tummy, and secured it with an ACE bandage.  Put on a tight-fitting tank top and went to bed.  It says to drink lots of water while wearing it, unless you&#x27;re using it while sleeping.  So I woke up in the morning and removed it, then rubbed the remaining lotion into my skin.  At first I didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  But when I put on my pants... holy cow!  They were too big!  The day before they were too tight, and now they&#x27;re too big!  I measured, and realized overnight I had lost 3 inches!  By that night I had lost another inch.  The next day I had to go buy smaller pants.  After 72 hours, I applied my second wrap, exactly the same as the first.  Two days after my second wrap, my neighbor came up to me and asked me if I have some sort of shrinking disorder because I had become so thin so quickly!  After my third wrap I could finally fit into my swimsuit that I was determined to fit into this summer!  While I am currently dieting and exercising, I did not make any changes while using these wraps.  These wraps gave me the boost I needed to get to my goal.  I haven&#x27;t felt this good about myself in a loooong time!  To celebrate, I bought myself two new dresses and a new pair of pants!  My next box of wraps is going to be used on my thighs.  I have told all my friends about my results with the It Works wraps, and now I&#x27;m considering becoming a consultant because I want more people to feel as good as I do right now :)</li>
            <li> It took forever for it to come and when it finally did arrive the box was pretty much destroyed and faded like it had been sitting around for years. If I could get a refund I certainly would because I am NOT satisfied at all with this product.</li>
            <li> i use four wraps i loose 5 1/2 inches.. im ordering another box coz it really works for me, highly recomend it</li>
            <li> Love these wraps! They are a great addition to a healthy diet for tightening up areas that store fat. I lost inches with each wrap that have stayed off! Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> I usually buy these wraps for special events or vacations.  They are great for reducing water weight or bloating.  Best to use it on your day off so that you can utilize the restroom frequently and stay hydrated.  I lost a few inches.  Works best when used consistently I guess.</li>
            <li> Honestly the wrap did nothing &amp;#34;inches&amp;#34; wise, but for some reason this weird thing made my tiger stripe dark stretch marks become like my normal skin color! COOL! I tried everything, but twins tore my skin apart.... This stuff was a miracle for it!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed . I think this one was fake, I mean there&#x27;s no effect, I had one wrap before and it did fine but this one, feel like I need my money back,</li>
            <li> I have a co-worker whose sister is a distributor for the product. My co-worker used the wrap and a difference was definitely noticed. She&#x27;d kept urging me to try it, but I thought (just like I have about so many other products) that just because it worked for her didn&#x27;t mean it would for me. Afterall, she&#x27;s in her early 20s, and I&#x27;m in my mid-30s. I&#x27;d been down that road countless times, and like so many other people, I don&#x27;t have money to waste like that. After continuously seeing her losing inches, firming and tightening, and persistence that I give it a try for my problem spots, I decided what the heck..it&#x27;s only $25 and can spare that 1 time (she threw in a complementary trial size defining gel..she was that confident). If it didn&#x27;t work, I hadn&#x27;t lost anything. I divided the wrap into 3 sections, wrapping each of my flabby arms and across my back fat, aka \\&quot;handlebars\\&quot; (I must mention, I have excessive loose skin due to a significant weightloss). I followed the instructions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot;, drowning myself in water consumption before, during, and after the 1 hour I kept it on. Skipping ahead, I report that not only have my arms and back fat firmed, tightened, and shrank to a considerably noticeable degree after only 2 wraps (I hadn&#x27;t gone sleeveless since I was a child!) and using the defining gel 2xs a day between wraps, an ugly 2 year old scar on my upper arm has virtually vanished! I have become a believer and will continue to purchase th product until I reach my goal. I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve lost pounds because of it, but just the shrinkage and firming of my arms and dissapearing handlebars are good enough for me!</li>
            <li> My husband and I both used these wraps and they did absolutely nothing. We both wore them all day, using plastic wrap to secure them. Neither one of us would have been able to sleep with them on. I put them on my legs and he put one on his belly. Both of us also drank a lot off water throughout the day to help the process along. Before applying them, we also measured my legs and his belly to gauge results. Needless to say, after doing all this and spending $100, we were quite disappointed when we took them off only to find they did absolutely nothing for either one of us.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything. Complete waste of money</li>
            <li> i did notice a slight difference (used for cellulite) but it seems like u would need alot more to get a dramatic result. n im a slim young lady...~_~</li>
            <li> I did not see any results and I did 4 wraps</li>
            <li> I have try many things and I was concern about this one but I finally have reduced tje inches that I needed!</li>
            <li> The truth about this product is that it DOES actually work, like the name itself. some people think this is a magic paper that will make your fat or flab disappear in a matter of seconds. This is NOT A WEIGHT LOSS PRODUCT!! it&#x27;s to tighten and firm !!! TIGHTEN AND FIRM ! SO IF YOUR NOT TIGHTENING AND FIRMING you should not be writing a review on this product based on your naive little brain who didnt do their research before buying the product. only way your going to lose your gut is if u diet and exercise and when i say diet i mean eating healthy, or get lipo/tummy tuck. if you want results you are going to have to 1. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS ANNNNNND put in effort of changing your diet plans, or if you just follow the little direction 100% only, u&#x27;ll get the results your deserve (meaning most likely ur results will be a failure)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my regimen ( for people who are targeting tummy and obliques area )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didnt purchase the bodywrap to rely on it 100%, that&#x27;s what you cannot do, or else you will not get the maximum result you want. I put my bodywrap around the stomach area at night after a shower to open up my pores well enough and cover the wrap with plastic wrap and i leave it overnight, i sleep with a cami on, tight enough so it wont move around much, in the morning i wake up i take my wrap off and rub the rest of the product in, ( do not take a shower immediately after you take the wrap off, wait atleast two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the rest of the three days (72 hours)&lt;br /&gt;I change my diet, stop eating after a certain time (but due to the fact that i come home late sometimes I purchased a carb blocker (white kidney bean extract 1000mg)) so far its good, but thats another review.&lt;br /&gt;I also had purchased a waist trimmmer (here on amazon) for when I go running or to the gym.&lt;br /&gt;I go to the gym 4 times a week, If i&#x27;m unable to go to the gym I do a 30 minute workout at home,.&lt;br /&gt;I did my second wrap and let me tell you, I can actually see a difference! I have a before picture, but I&#x27;m posting it at the end of this month when I&#x27;m finish with the first box :D so i can motivate some lazy asses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People you cant expect to use this thing while your still eating donuts and pizza drinking soda and booze on the weekends! Your wasting your money! and Time! Get up off your lazy butt, hit the gym or a trail, starting prepping healthy meals that will last you for atleast 2 days, I always post this in my reviews YOU GOTTA WORK! If you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself! (How many times have you heard that in a movie film? lol.. well its true) will I recommend this to a friend? YES i will, and id give them the same advice i just did here.ifference! I have a before picture, but I&#x27;m posting it at the end of this month when I&#x27;m finish with the first box :D so i can motivate some lazy asses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People you cant expect to use this thing while your still eating donuts and pizza drinking soda and booze on the weekends!

            <li> I saw no results and it was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Have to say that I was very interested in this product, hoping that it would work. I have two daughters and we all wrapped our stomach, out of the three of us the wrap only worked on one, needless to say we were disapointed.  I am glad I did it but would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I tried this product, i had 4 applications. It didn&#x27;t do anything at all for me. Was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Let me just start off by saying that I LOVE the It Works! products! I believe It Works! is AMAZING, but please support your local It Works! sales people! The home parties and amazing customer service make this company what it is and you miss that when you don&#x27;t have a rep! This is why I rated this product one star! Also, it is against the It works!rules and law to sell these products on sites such as these! (They are over priced as well)</li>
            <li> I buy 2 boxes fo this stuff and let me tall u ,,,,is awesomeeeeeeeeee......my belly was big and nasty&#x3D;( and now is much better....</li>
            <li> There are directions to follow in order for the wraps to work correctly. Also you can get a 40% discount if you opt in for the 90 day challenge. The company does not allow that the wraps be sold unless through an independent distributor who can walk you through the process to get the maximum results. Message me for more info mariannav920@gmail.com</li>
            <li> Ok so I ordered these and had both my mom and sister try them out. They both left them on for about 3 hours. My sister had incredible results but my mom had none at all. I found out I was pregnant the day before these arrived so I couldn&#x27;t use it, I will update when I do but this product only gets 4 stars because it didn&#x27;t work for my mother at all.</li>
            <li> You see a difference for a few days, thats why you have to buy a 4 pack, and continue buying them, BECAUSE ITS TEMPORARY! I totally believed the hype, but you have to remember these sellers only make money if you buy it. My doctor said it is physically impossible to put anything on your skin to melt fat from inside your body. It takes the water out of your cells shrinking them and making you temporary smaller(his exact words). If you do wanna lose that &amp;#34;water weight&amp;#34; for a night out, you can make your own wraps for less that 5 bucks by looking it up on pinterest. Worked the exact same as these wraps did. Dont waste your money!!</li>
            <li> It does not work!!!!!! I tried this product on my belly and arms and I saw no results. I was told that I must not have enough fat in those areas but I&#x27;m 15 to 20 pounds over weight and those areas are flabby. I would not recommend this product to anyone. It does not work!!</li>
            <li> Ok so they dont order from amazon ? But why not ? Because I have two times now ! In I can Honestly say they werent dried out or old first off ! Who wants to pay a real high price for something not knowing if its gonna work or not? Well as for my wraps hmm this will be a total of 8 lol and Im I only weigh 104 . That being said Ive lost 106 lbs so Ive got a lower belly Im trying to tone up !! Its not a whole lot of skin either like you would think!  So let me tell you this hasnt worked!  Big waste in very upset about all the talk in pics that it does. Fakes besides no pics od peoples faces hmm ok thx</li>
            <li> I have used all 4 as instructed and I didn&#x27;t lose any inches. Really bummed this didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I ordered mine from a distributor I wrapped two times lost a total of four inches I took my before-and-after pictures they are amazing so amazing that I signed up and now I&#x27;m selling them and making money so much fun and they work great!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  Won&#x27;t be buying anymore.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t sign up on some sort of program and spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Do not buy it . I am 114 pounds and I have small belly I would like to remove .  I used this product three times . I do not see no single changes in my belly . Even the measurement is same .</li>
            <li> Wish I could leave 0 stars.&lt;br /&gt;First off this product IS NOT for weight loss. It is for post weight loss to tighten loos skin. So don&#x27;t buy this thinking it&#x27;s going to do magic.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the wraps are TINY and you are only provide with 4 limiting you to &amp;#34;wrap&amp;#34; one section of your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my biggest problem, to get a good price on the wraps, you have to sign up for a 3 month (minimum) membership, with an autoship each month. I had some issues with my funds and tried a week before my autoship to reschedule the order for the following week. I called and emailed everyday for a week straight and NO ONE responded back to me. Needless to say I was charged causing me financial hard ship. I disputed it with my bank, and they got me my money back, but low and behold, It Works disputed my claim, even though I had proof that I was unable to contact anyone, including my email that I did not authorize the charge to my account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOTAL SCAM DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.&lt;br /&gt;HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.&lt;br /&gt;WRAPS AREN&#x27;T WHAT THEY MARKET THEM TO BE.</li>
            <li> It works for a quick inch lost! to maintain im drinking brazilian slimming tea, google or search in here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it for a super detox, and drank detox tea, it work, but the weight come back really fast!</li>
            <li> Way expensive and doesn&#x27;t work. Just take a $100 bill and burn it.  You will lose more weight that way.</li>
            <li> YE BE WARNED! Save your money--it&#x27;s not going to work for everyone... seemed like a gimmick from the git-go to me.</li>
            <li> I have learned that the It Works Company does not sell through Amazon and the box I received was an It Works Product, but did not work because of expiration dates or any other reasonings. I would not order from this person again. NOT reliable.</li>
            <li> In an attempt to minimize my waistline to pre-pregnancy status, I purchased this item.  This may work for someone else, but certainly it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Love it.......first time used this product I could feel it working.......can&#x27;t wait for next week to use it again...it&#x27;s a must use product</li>
            <li> I am a first timer to this product, and I haven&#x27;t had enough time with it  to write a review on product.&lt;br /&gt;Though the product that I was sent from this seller, was in good , clean shape. Once I have made my decision on the product, and if I get it again. I will definitely buy from this seller</li>
            <li> Dosent work waste of money and waste of time not worth it at All, I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> I have tried a wrap 3 times. I smoke and am on lots of medication. Which fights the wraps I am told. I didn&#x27;t drink the water like I was suppose to. Nor did I keep a healthy diet. I am an emotional eater. Almost 3 weeks later and even tho I have done everything wrong I still have lost an inch that stayed off. I also did not wear the wrap as long as I was told to. 6 to 8 hours per wrap after the first. The plastic wrap was too annoying. I did keep acne like a school kid. I am disabled and often can&#x27;t do much at all. Being wrapped up tight was painful because of my medical issues. Going to the bathroom like you are 9 months pregnant with triplets wasn&#x27;t fun but when drinking that much water I expected to go alot. Which made me move more and left my body in massive pain.</li>
            <li> 0,0&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s product doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> So far the product is  good.  I have only used one wrap.  The price is definitely the best part of this.  It beats paying $99 for the box of wraps.</li>
            <li> I had no intentions of this thing working, but I thought What the hell. I&#x27;m 21 years old.&lt;br /&gt;I have had a baby, and I have crazy stretch marks all over my body, a gnarly scar from my the C-section and a mothers apron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I took a steaming hot shower to open my pours (after reading a little into this, I&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s better to do this.) get out and dry myself off completely.&lt;br /&gt;Measure myself and then draw the lines where I put the measuring tape (Which was freezing at this point because I took a steaming hot shower!) I wrote down my measurements and opened the package.&lt;br /&gt;Slapped that sucker on my stomach and saran wrapped the crap out of myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After saran wrapping myself I began to get dressed (Squeaking every move I made)  realizing that I did not take pictures (UGH) so I take pictures with the saran wrap on instead of unraveling myself from this tangled uncomfortable mess. (Knowing my luck it would all be on the saran wrap and I would have wasted my money) So as I squeak every time I walk, can barely sit down because I&#x27;ve wrapped myself up so tight in saran wrap trying to make sure I don&#x27;t lose it; I finally find myself laying down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept this smelly gooey tingly thing on for 9 hours before I took it off. I rubbed in the goo like you&#x27;re supposed to and have to use q-tips to get it out of my bellybutton *EW*&lt;br /&gt;Now you have to remember I&#x27;m thinking OMG these pictures are AMAZING right? So I&#x27;m measuring myself every 20 minutes and every time I drink water and have to go pee I&#x27;m weighing myself like a crazy person cause I&#x27;m so \\&quot;excited.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well turns out NOTHING happen after took it off. I was the same measurements I was 9 hours before.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re working on 12 hours when I&#x27;m drinking all this water peeing like a pregnant woman again and of course running to the scale and measuring myself like a mad woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally think, \\&quot;All right Britney, you just wasted your money what were you thinking?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So of course I quit measuring myself and go about my daily duties, cleaning, school work, and taking care of my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;I hop on the scale the next morning and I&#x27;ve only lost 0.8 oz. *YAY* Close to a pound so I&#x27;m starting to get excited again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I measure myself (48 hours later) Finding out that I did lose a total of 3 inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not hit the 72 hour mark or later yet so I&#x27;m not sure if it will stay off but I can only have hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to mention that, where the stinky, tingly, gooey paper was my stretch marks are virtually gone. I can see the outline of the stupid paper where my stretch marks are very prominent and now where they are hardly there.&lt;br /&gt;This is after one use. I know people want to lose inches, but I&#x27;m going to be just happy with not having visible stretch marks. If anything try it to get rid of your stretch marks what do you have to lose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I have very prominent stretch marks. With my skin the way that it is they sink in so pretty much if I were to roll a black roller paint brush over my stomach I would have zebra print.) After using this product though, I can happily say *For Now* that only the top portion of my abdomen is left that way.)</li>
            <li> product does make skin feel smooth, I can truly say customer service is great and very helpful and promptly tries to help with all  issues, will order from company again.</li>
            <li> Not good at all. I did not see a difference. I bought two boxes and nothing. I want my money back.</li>
            <li> I think product was very old, the packaging looked &amp;#34;shop worn&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The expiration date was missing,&lt;br /&gt;I did not like it at all,</li>
            <li> It was fun to plastic wrap yourself but the product did not work for me even though I followed all the instructions.</li>
            <li> First, I have not used this product.  I was however, researching this product and read a review that was bashing the It works bands and recommending Lucalean.  It made Lucalean sound like a much better deal--it is a lot cheaper.  The author of the review said they got Lucalean from their sister and lost 19 inches with it.  Because of the review, I bought Lucalean off of Ebay. I tried it-lost a couple of inches the first day, was the same measurements as I started on the second day and  gained an inch after using it the second day-so basically, it did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to Google the owner, Kaye Lucas and came up with a review of another product, Suddenly Slender.  Of course the review was very negative and suggested Lucalean as a better option.  I thought that seemed pretty shady and a little familiar so I started looking at the It Works reviews and found a review by a \\&quot;Sallyomalley\\&quot;.  Same deal--so I flagged the review for abuse and commented that I was pretty sure it was Kaye Lucas writing the review.  Next, I received a rebuttal reply to my comment from a person claiming to be Kaye Lucas and she was very upset that someone was posting false reviews.  She said she would have to be an idiot to do something like that, which apparently she is an idiot because the reply came from Sallyomalley.  There&#x27;s no way she would have known about my comment or been able to reply to my comment unless she was the same person.  By the time I got the rebuttal she had somehow got Amazon to delete my comment and she had deleted her rebuttal.  I replied again to her original comment, describing what had happened and pasted her rebuttal which had been emailed to me.  I also said that she would most likely delete the original comment to erase the whole thread--guess what?  It&#x27;s gone!  I think this is totally wrong and I want her called out on it.  I will be requesting my 100% refund--we&#x27;ll see how that goes:)&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a copy of the rebuttal that was sent to my email:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SallyOmalley says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received this via google alert. I am Kaye Lucas and I am the owner of Lucalean. I didn&#x27;t, however, write the review and have notified the appropriate people that someone was using my name to post reviews (which would ne absolutely idiotic of me to do anyway)! I have NEVER been accused of being shady, however, and while I am insulted by the smear, I realize that is the price of doing business in the internet age. All I can say is to buy with confidence and I will stand behind my product and guarantee completely.</li>
            <li> I have lost about 2 1/2 inches!!!! I would recommend this to very bothy!! And it makes ur skin fell so fresh!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband to lose a couple inches before his pt test for the military...I had heard wonderful things about it.  Boy was that a let down.  Got these in the mail....used them just as directions said and nothing....i mean NOTHING happened.  It was a complete waste of my money.  Spend your hard earned money somewhere else.</li>

            <li> I LOVE the It Works wraps! They work wonders. BUT be advised, DO NOT order them from Amazon, ebay or any other resale sites!! They often times are expired, dried out, etc. Get them online through a legit It Works website...Www.slimdownwithashleigh.myitworks.com&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention, you can get a FULL BOX of 4 wraps for only $59 when you order on there! :)</li>
            <li> The wraps were clumpy and brown! I read so many reviews before deciding to buy it works wraps online!!!! With reading 50/50 of good and bad reviews I decided to buy a four pack from the amazon warehouse for like 76 dollars.  None of the other wraps I bought from a it works consultant looked anything like what I received from the warehouse.  So much for trying to save money on a box of four wraps!</li>
            <li> I was so excited.  Kept wrap on overnight woke up. NOTHING...... I will try again and will let u know. 1 star for good delivery time. Use plastic wrap their wrap product is useless.  Stay tuned.</li>
            <li> I use these a lot with massage technique. I get great results. Check your local spa and see if they are offered.</li>
            <li> This is the biggest scam I have ever seen in my life.  I did all of the instructions and no results.  You talk to different distributors and they will all tell you something different.  This does not work.  It does not make you lose, weight, or inches.  They will keep telling you to try different products along with it to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do not be fooled like I was.  If I could, I would give it zero stars.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have spent most of my life very fit, and NOT overweight. After several abdominal surgeries and minimal exercise last year due to health issues, I was left being 10 lbs. overweight and a saggy belly (but healthy). I thought I would be an ideal candidate for this product.  I really was just looking for a jump start as I started getting back into an moderate exercise routine. I do not smoke or drink alcohol, I eat healthy, and live a healthy life style. I don&#x27;t even drink soda! I followed the directions exactly. I took every tip: drank lots of water, added the supplements, etc. After 2 months I saw absolutely no difference. Please save your time and money! Invest in a new work-out outfit instead.</li>
            <li> I lost almost 3 inches with my first wrap. I can&#x27;t wait to do the next one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like is the smell, but I can get over that :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did take a hot shower before the wrap, and I did make sure I had all lotions off my stomach.  I made sure I used soap with no lotion in it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews I can see that several people are misunderstanding what these wraps are. They are NOT a weightloss wrap, so if you rate them low because you did not loose weight then that is unfair. They are a cosmetic wrap that is designed to tighten and firm the skin. I personally lost a full pant size after wrapping my tummy 3 times in just 9 days.</li>
            <li> Garbage dont waste money just a fad to get money. Like they say no pain no gain I wasted lots of money on craps like this.</li>
            <li> Worked great! Tried wrapping a few times. Lost inches each time. The least amount was 3 inches. Made my stretch marks look much better (had them for 30 years). My daughter had a baby last year and she lost lots too. Helped with that baby fat. We will keep using them til we get where we are where we want to be. You can sign up as a loyal customer and get them cheaper. We tried the facial too. That worked great for my 55 year old face :)</li>
            <li> I should have believe the reviews I read. I lost 2 inches and it came right back in 2 days. I will just stick to clean eating and exercise that&#x27;s how I lost my 20lbs anyway #quickfixdoesntwork :-(</li>
            <li> I used these just as the directions say, but left it on longer because my skin is able to handle it. Amazing results! Took only 2 applications for satisfactory results and after 3 apps ALL the dimples on my rear are completely gone. I look like a 16 year old (from the back).</li>
            <li> Let me preface by telling you about myself as I think body composition is important to how these work. I would imagine the more fat you have to lose the better it works but who really knows. Anyways, I&#x27;m female, late twenties, 5&#x27;8\\&quot;, 160, 23% body fat with most concentrated on my \\&quot;pouch\\&quot; and love handles. It&#x27;s just a genetic thing for me, no kids. Anyways I followed all the directions from the itworks global site. No soap or lotion on the area, hot shower or brush skin to open pores, place wrap then seal with ceran or a constriction garment, no exercise and drink half your body weight in water oz.&#x27;s. Those were pretty easy, the not working out was hard as it&#x27;s my job and I ended up getting mildly sweaty about 3 hrs after I had put it on. I wore a fajah tummy wrap to seal it in and I didn&#x27;t find the smell bad or the tingling uncomfortable. I measured before and after, I measure myself all the time so I was pretty familiar with this and right away I had lost at least 2\\&quot;! That&#x27;s pretty sweet. I&#x27;ll try to update after the full 72hrs. Drinking all the water is the hardest part but it&#x27;s getting easier!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make any difference. And it felt like icy hot. Weird and waste of money. False advertisement at its best.</li>
            <li> I will never buy this product  again it gave me a rash and it to much money 69.00 for four  wrap you got to be kidding me.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  I did not see any results.  I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about in regards to losing inches.  What a joke.</li>
            <li> My wife followed the instructions, measuring and tips sent by the seller. She saw no difference in the skin, tightening, firming, tone or any positive change in her measurements. Actually her belly measurement increased slightly. Total waste of time and money for her.</li>
            <li> I tryed these for 2 months. One a week. Did not see any great results works for a short time. after a month of not doing them inches are back. Good product for a quick fix but not permenent.</li>
            <li> They sucked... Messy and looked old!&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me, I would not waste money on them again</li>
            <li> Im on wrap two and zero results but it has inspired me to start an exercise program. Others are having dramatic results... I know everyone is unique... Trying to be patient.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I paid $ 167 for nothing. I feel very sorry to cheat myself by ordering such bad product. I need my money back please or if possible you can compensate me with another good product. I trust your description which is not true at all.&lt;br /&gt;I am waiting your positive reply.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> It did not do what was promised, did not loose any inches at all with all four wraps. Did not like smell</li>
            <li> i have bought a total of 30 wraps, the defining gel and the carb inhibitor pills. when i put my first wrap on and all that other junk, i lost a few inches, but the very next day, i gained all my inches back and tripled them. my stomach legs and arms appeared much larger than they normally were. i have spent over $500 dollars on these products and got worse results then when i started. i called the company to request my money back and make complaints, and they refused too refund me and said \\&quot;your kind of body type is not compatible with our product.\\&quot; im sorry but i would never buy this product or misinform someone on how great this product is, and its not!!!!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know it this has worked for anybody, but unfortunately for me they didn&#x27;t, and I did follow the instructions before, during and after application. It was a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> tried twice, seems like its working. Not as drastic as advertised but definitely worth trying a few more times.&lt;br /&gt;very prompt delivery too</li>
            <li> Love these wraps.work wonders!</li>
            <li> I actually had bought just one wrap before to see if I would get any results and I did, so this time I went ahead and bought the 4-pack.  If you need to &amp;#34;tighten&amp;#34; any specific area these wraps will help with that for sure.  Don&#x27;t expect to look like a super-toned fitness model after 4 wraps, but it does help to tighten your skin.</li>
            <li> i hate this wraps.  i got really bad rib pain. my rib felt like they were about to brake. DONT TRY THIS. is been 5 months and i still  the pain</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell the best.  These herbs have strong smell.  I would have tried anything and stayed with it, but this does not work.  It is not the miracle cure that we women want.  Lost no inches, but I wasn&#x27;t allergic to it either.  That is a plus for me.  All bodies are different so maybe you will have a better result.  Good Luck.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Didnt work at all.  It was just messy.  You would be better off with another product..just not this one</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this as I&#x27;m sure most people are and to be honest it was a waste of money. Didn&#x27;t see a change at all. I even wore the wraps longer than the 45 minutes thinking it would boost the results. It did nothing. Also the package was a complete mess! When I opened the wrap the lotion that is supposed to be on one side was EVERYWHERE!!!</li>
            <li> This did nothing for me. Really feel like this was a total waste of money. I used them because a friend of mine sells them and figured why not give them a try. (Cannot bash it til you try it, right?) I would not waste the money on this ever again.</li>
            <li> everyone will see results with this - cause it really does work!  It&#x27;s just that some people are more toxic in their system and it takes a bit longer to see the drastic results they want.  A treatment is 4 wraps, which is what this is.... do the 4 wraps with before and after pictures and I guarantee you will see great results.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try it out to be sure,  but I should&#x27;ve just stuck with my gut instinct it&#x27;s another scam.  In fact a person I know who sells these wraps for It works global photo shops her pictures and put them online.  Did everything I was supposed to do by the book, and although my stomach isn&#x27;t big to begin with it didn&#x27;t go down at all.  Save your money, go to the gym, eat a high-protein diet and low-carb and you&#x27;ll get better results.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical like most to try these. I&#x27;m pretty slim but I wanted something to tone a little extra before a vegas trip. I tried on my stomach and back of my thighs. Didn&#x27;t really see any difference on my thighs but I just left it on for 2 hours and tried wearing some tight shorts to keep them in place which didn&#x27;t work too well. On my stomach I put a waist cincher I have over the wrap and wore it for 4 hours. Drank alot of water and although I didn&#x27;t measure my inches I could tell the skinner around my stomach looked much smoother and firmer. After 3 days I felt like my stomach was flatter even though it wasn&#x27;t too bad in the first place but I definitely felt more confident when wearing tight shirts. I would recommend to wear some type of cincher or tight compression because I honestly think that helps considering I didn&#x27;t see the difference when I tried it on the back of my thighs with no compression.</li>
            <li> The applicators are old I would have been better off by buying straight from the website. The applicators were brown which are obviously old DISSAPOINTED!!!</li>
            <li> Seriously..I only tried it to prove to people that this doesn&#x27;t work. This is a VERY expensive product and the promise to lose serious inches off of your body after three uses is insane. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I bought it to try , but why you increase the product 39%??????????? It&#x27;s not fear !!It was working :(</li>
            <li> I have been using it and have seen no results . I want be buying another one once again disappointing.</li>
            <li> The ultimate body applicator actually exceeded my expectations! I was worried about the quality of the wraps (being dried out) but they were in perfect condition. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the expected delivery date but they actually came more than a week earlier! As for the product, I saw results after applying only the first 2 wraps &amp; was in disbelief! In applying the wraps definitely, definitely DRINK LOTS OF WATER! Can you say headache??? @ least half of your body weight should be your water intake during &amp; after your treatments. Pictures really are worth a thousand words... I will definitely be ordering more! Thanx Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Item was delivered as promised and promptly.  The item itself provides a great short term reduction (a day or two) of the affected area.</li>
            <li> I have used three of the raps so far and see very little results. I&#x27;m going to try a couple more to see if they work or not</li>
            <li> These little miracles really do work. It takes a few days to notice anything, but I have to admit.....they work!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work waste of time and money better off going to dr fisher shrink like 1 inch the product is overrated</li>
            <li> There are more reputable companies and products out there that do not charge a membership.  Do NOT waste your money on a membership to IT WORKS, because it really does NOT work.</li>
            <li> I used four of them and never noticed a bit of difference.</li>
            <li> Its just OKAY. Even after four wraps my body still doesn&#x27;t look like  those &amp;#34;before and after&amp;#34; pictures look and I left mine on for 8 hours each time.  Kind of a rip off of you ask me. 72 hours after each wrap you may see a slight difference, but it goes right back to normal even with enhanced diet and exercise the results do not last over 3 days. I am by no means I&#x27;ve weight, but after having a nine and a half pound baby my belly was a bit out of shape and skin was stretched out too. These wraps do not correct this. Is have small dimples from tiny stretch marks around my belly button left over from my pregnancy and they are still visable just as always.</li>
            <li> If you are interested in this product contact an &amp;#34;It Works&amp;#34; Distributor in your area. As the name says...It works great but you can get it a lot cheaper and be assured you are getting a fresh product if you buy it through the appropriate channels, this is all natural and DOES expire. I am a huge amazon shopper which is why I happened upon this, but in this case I would be scared to order this product. IT WORKS prohibits distributers from using Amazon and other online outlets to sell products for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently attended a party and 10 out of 11 guests had results on the first try, but for some it can take up to 4 applications, I saw results from my 1st and 2nd application. I lost 5 inches in my waist total.</li>
            <li> I used them just as directions said, even left them on all night and drank plenty of water like you&#x27;re suppose to do. Did absolutely NOTHING. They are a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> im 21 and considered obese. i tried a wrap and got nothing. All the reviews and pictures of peoples success with&amp;#34; no change &amp;#34; was promising but it didnt work for me</li>
            <li> I did not buy these to lose weight or get a flatter tummy (I&#x27;m 105lbs), however I did buy these with the hope that they would firm up loose skin on my stomach (post-pregnancy). I followed the directions posted on another seller&#x27;s website about drinking the water, etc. I left it on while I slept (8 hours or so), drank the water and followed my normal diet of eating healthy food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice results-- it took about a day or so to really notice them but my stomach was flatter (the post-Thanksgiving bloat was immediately gone) and it did appear that my stomach muscle felt firmer. But the loose skin was NOT noticeably firmer which was my ONLY goal  (and the loose skin wasn&#x27;t even that terrible to begin with).&lt;br /&gt; I wrapped twice and noticed the results last about a week and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy these again-- and probably won&#x27;t ever buy anything from the It Works company because &amp;#34;reputable&amp;#34; seller or not this is still the same product the company sells so it doesn&#x27;t matter if you get it from Amazon or pay the ridiculous $100 to a &#x27;real&#x27; It Works representative.&lt;br /&gt;However, because I still have two wraps left I will use them (in conjunction with my normal healthy diet and exercise) to flatten my tummy a bit before I go to the beach next month.</li>
            <li> I waited forever to receive nothing at all not even actual contact from them. If I could id give no stars.</li>
            <li> When I got then they were dried out and didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;d used them before and if the product was actually good it would have been great.</li>
            <li> A true gimmick, a waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;do not recommend to anyone to use.&lt;br /&gt;Please save your money</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as expected. After 4 wraps same results. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. It didn&#x27;t work and I wish I had never purchased.</li>
            <li> I did everything like I was supposed to and did not lose any inches at all. Unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this. I won&#x27;t try this. Why? Because it doesn&#x27;t work. Do you really think that by wrapping your body in something that you will magically lose inches? Really? How naive are you people? There is no &amp;#34;quick cure&amp;#34; when it comes down to it. You have to get up and move and eat the right food. But, that&#x27;s too hard for most and you don&#x27;t want to hear that, do you? So go ahead and waste your hard earned money and buy this crap and then come back on here and try to warn others..........who will just ignore you and waste their money too!</li>
            <li> It was well packed and come ahead of time. I&#x27;m actually wearing it right now lol it feels like icy hot.I will come back in a cpl week to say weather it worked for me or not</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used all 4 wraps as described.  Used saran wrap to hold in place and used over night.&lt;br /&gt;I saw 0 difference.I don&#x27;t think these wraps are very effective.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions EXACTLY, an even bought from a distributor. I used 5 wraps and NOTHING... maybe like 1/4 inch? haha whoo! I also tried the defining gel with no luck. I Really wanted it to work though.</li>
            <li> Yeah...I tried it.  It is completely useless.  I feel stupid for spending the money and wasting the time using it.  Very thin and 2 of them were really discolored upon opening.  Didn&#x27;t stay in place very well, even using cling wrap to keep it in place.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> My friend was selling these at work was selling these. I&#x27;ve done 4 so far and have not seen any results even though I&#x27;ve followed the instructions religiously. There are so many drastic before and after pictures that I thought for sure I&#x27;d see at least a 1&amp;#34;-2&amp;#34; difference but I was the exact same.  I would wear the wraps at night to maximise my results but it didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing more than some lotion inside a big band-aid.  I could have had the same &amp;#34;smoothing&amp;#34; results by rubbing lotion on my stomach for 4 hours.  Don&#x27;t fall for it if you have a significant belly or mommy &amp;#34;pouch&amp;#34;.  Of you are thin and tan and have trouble with dry belly skin, this may be great for you.  All you other people like me trying to be skinny fast, look elsewhere.  We have NOT found our miracle product!!</li>
            <li> I bought my IT Works wraps from consultant not amazon. But the first time i tried it i bought from a health Fair in Atlanta and saw a very noticiable difference. So i ordered two more recently because the results from just using it once had gone away. A full treatment is four.&lt;br /&gt;So ive done it twice and i see good results gonna order two more to complete cycle. This is not a weight loss system, you cant be lazy and think this will solve your fat issues while you do nothing. I used it on the back of my legs where i was seeing lots of cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;It worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Crap ! Crap ! Crap ! I wanted to support my friends business so I joined the royal club . My first set of wraps I had my period for most of it. I got no results. So I did research and a lot of sellers said don&#x27;t use them during period. Glad I wasted my money. Second box I used on my arms and nothing again. Now I&#x27;m doing my thighs and I expect NOTHING AGAIN!!! It&#x27;s crap</li>
            <li> Looked like it was old. Sent in a very old box. Overall was not happy with this product and would not order again.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not seeing the results like I want to because I stop exclusive g but I&#x27;m saving the last to to try again. But if not no more warps for me</li>
            <li> Did not do anything for me or my husband.  Used 4 wraps on me, 4 on him, and saw no difference.  Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I bought these from a friend and they suck butt. U could get the same results with prep H and serand wrap.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Although I haven&#x27;t shown drastic results like many others (I would only loose an inch at a time) it has helped me with my confidence levels a lot because I actually see results! The only downside I would say is the price, I feel that as much gel as they put on these wraps there should be a lot more of them in the box. But that&#x27;s just me. Since using the wraps I have lost 3 inches around my thighs, 2 inches on my upper arm (good bye nasty saggy arms), and 4 inches around my belly button. If you&#x27;re like me and can&#x27;t seem to get rid of the extra baggage no matter what you try, this may be worth a shot.</li>
            <li> These wraps are amazing!!!  They really do work and you see results immediately!!! I really loved these wraps!!!  I have recommended them to a few friends!!</li>
            <li> I feel this product is a scam, anyone who wraps cellophane around them selves is going to lose some water. After two applications I seen no difference and I used a form fitting garment instead of cellophane to see if it would work. No change. I did the applications one week apart. Way too expensive for what you get here.</li>
            <li> The body wraps from It Works are a fantastic product that really do work.  The problem is that the wraps you buy on Amazon are NOT from It Works.  Selling wraps on here is prohibited and should only be purchased from an Independent Distributor of It Works.  When wraps are purchased through Amazon or Ebay there is no guarantee that they will work because they are more than likely expired product that someone is just trying to get rid of and you are not following the directions and advice of a distributor (how much water to drink, toxins to avoid, taking before and after pictures).  When you purchase from an Independent Distributor you get perks points for free product, free shipping, and better products.

            <li> I didnt expect to shed 10 pounds by any means... but it is great for that outfit you would rather not wear spanz with. Takes a little of the water weight off your mid section.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to buy the lotion if you are a first time buyer. This only provides a temporary water weight lose. Great for weddings parties pool parties. Make sure you read reviews online of how it did and did not work for some people.</li>
            <li> there were absolutely no changes in my body after doing all 4 wraps. i feel that if i wanted to, i could recreate the &amp;#34;results&amp;#34; through a simple cleansing that would be much more effective than this.</li>

            <li> I got these and although weird to put on, I liked that they really seemed to help make my skin appear smoother.</li>
            <li> I love the wraps they really work  like anything everyone&#x27;s results will not be the same and U must follow instructions such as drinking half your body weight in water, also no 20proof or above drinks and the best results are achieved by sleeping in the wrap and not sweating,,,, sweat clogs the pores and and U will not see the proper results..... I just bet if U go back and try the wraps doing it right U will see awesome results not they don&#x27;t take the place of excersize but the do show off the results,,,,, I went from a 48 inch waist to a 40 inch waist using the wraps and following the instructions in a matter of only 44 days my avarage pants size lost was a total of 4 from a 20 down to a 14/16 and I am looking to continue the process because IT Works!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It Works Global is a lifestyle change reviews on YouTube FaceBook and amazon proves that everyone has different results for different products and You must know how to use these products properly so wrap it up and see those results</li>
            <li> let me first start out by saying that i did not use the ultimate body kit. i went to a spa and had a body wrap done. i reviewd many web sites about body wraps. i was expecting to see results when i left, however i did not see any. i was measured before and after and was told i lost 9 inches overall. but like i said, i didnt see it. none of my clothes fit any different and even after the 3-4 days, nothing. please do not waste your money. i spent $90 and was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I did all the wraps, followed the directions, I even kicked up my exercise. Nothing. I lost absolutely nothing. Not even half an inch. Be warned, it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I bit the bullet and gave this product a shot.  It really worked!!!!!  There is no simple key to getting slim, but there are products out there that can help you attain your goal and this is one of them.  If you are serious about getting into those jeans that used to fit, try this product, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was looking for this specific wrap since I was introduced to it last year and wanted to find it on my own and not have to depend on some messagist to do it for me...I like the results you get.</li>
            <li> The product really does work. I&#x27;ve done 2 wraps and have lost 5 inches! Would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I used the whole box as advertised and got no results what so ever. i wasn&#x27;t expecting s&#x3D;any huge transformation but i measure the exact same after all four wraps.</li>
            <li> good product, though I&#x27;d like smaller for the arms. it&#x27;s to hard to handle and it the cream was to the inside it&#x27;s hard to get it apart to make smaller pieces.</li>
            <li> Just like different people get different results with supplements or medications (I.E. my dad had to try 4 different blood pressure medications before finding one that worked for him), everyone&#x27;s body reacts differently to the botanicals in the wrap. It&#x27;s not a scam at all, and if you study the ingredients they are all proven in the naturopathic community. Some people see amazing results, some people quit before they have a chance to get results. I didn&#x27;t see results with my first wrap either. But I did with my second and continued to see them from there on out, not every wrap, but very gradually. I do believe that some people&#x27;s systems are very resistant, and there isn&#x27;t rhyme or reason as to why, but I also know people who are immune to the effects of different supplements and medications (I even have a friend who got an epidural and it did not work, how often does that happen? There wasn&#x27;t a solid explanation for it, her doctors just told her her body was immune, and she would just have to deal with the pain for her future pregnancies. Weird...). But trying one wrap really isn&#x27;t going to prove anything because it&#x27;s only a partial treatment, and lots of people don&#x27;t keep going if they don&#x27;t see an amazing change with one wrap, but rather assume nothing happened. Anyway, obviously I&#x27;m a rep, not trying to sell you but if you want to know about them, research the ingredients and make your decision based on the ingredients and what they are known for. THAT is what you are putting on your body and what is absorbed by your skin. People love to say the results are temporary, but I&#x27;ve gone months without wrapping and the changes stick. The skin healing has no reason to reverse itself, but the fat cell shrinkage will slowly return, but not fully until anywhere from 3-6 months (depending on your diet) if you aren&#x27;t wrapping.&lt;br /&gt;The loyal customer program through an actual distributor not only cheaper, but you earn 10% rewards each month if you remain a customer for fourmonths or more, you get a $50 credit if you remain for 6 months, and a $150 credit if you remain for 12 months. All this and free shipping on your autoship after your third month. It makes sense to join the wholesale program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked up every botanical ingredient and a list is at my website [...] Google them and you will find out from respectable sources like webmd.com that they are beneficial.</li>
            <li> I dit not recive this inten I am very obset I make a claim and I dont have any answer</li>
            <li> this is a great product. had one of these wraps done at a salon for much more and was thrilled to find them on amazon at a great price. Product works as indicated.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Waste of a LOT of money, rather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me preface that by saying that although it did nothing for ME, I personally know of one person who personally also knows someone who it HAS worked for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, with that being said: I am by no means &#x60;fat&#x27; or &#x60;obese&#x27; - I am about 15lbs over weight and have a \\&quot;mommy flap\\&quot; that just WONT go away for the LIFE of me. I was honestly just hoping this would help with the pooch, not expecting it to be lipo by anymeans.....&lt;br /&gt;I followed every instruction, including the &#x60;tips online&#x27; that you see (ie exfoliation, hot shower, leaving it on, not working out after, drinking nearly a gal of water each day, etc) to a T..... and lo and behold, I GAINED an inch?!?!?! HOW that is possible I have no idea, but what I DO know is that this was a waste of money and if could go back to my previous day&#x27;s self and say \\&quot;NO, seriously, TRUST the bad reviews\\&quot; I would indeed trust the bad reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t waste your money and wish you had listened to your previous day&#x27;s self as well......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how it would have worked for sooooooooooooo many others and not for me, or as the coaches and distributors online say that it works for 90-95% of people. I doubt that.</li>
            <li> I did everything right and it still didn&#x27;t work.  Good thing I bought this from here and not the actual sight.</li>
            <li> DONT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!! I did everything it said to do n still did not work for me. I drank 64oz  of water a day n still nothing. This was a waste of 100.00 dollars and i will never purchase it again.!!!!</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work!!! I wrapped my arms and legs over the course of two months (4 times for each area)and lost nothing, except $400!!! I did everything right, opened the pores, no lotions, used the gel, ate healthy and drank lots of water. I&#x27;m happy for the ones who have had success and wish I had lost inches, too.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery but they were a little dry.</li>
            <li> I wish I could rate a negative star! Horrible products that do not work and absolutely rude customer service representatives! Worst thing I&#x27;ve ever signed up for!!!! It was worth the $50 just to get out of it early!</li>
            <li> Do not waste money on this. It does nothing like it states. I was fooled into thinking it would make a difference, I&#x27;ve used all four wraps exactly the way they recommended and I saw no difference in tightening of the skin, eliminating cellulite or any difference on stretch marks.</li>
            <li> i was very unsatisfied with this product, it didn&#x27;t work at all, I&#x27;ve tried these wraps once before from a distributor and her wraps seem to have worked just fine, once i ordered them from here i tried all 4 wraps and not one worked</li>
            <li> First off, we all know by now there is no secret to weight loss. You have to eat right and move every day. That being said, after we lose weight and everything turns flabby and saggy, this product works miracles.  I have found the best results where skin was loose and not so great results other areas. In all cases, my cellulite and stretch marks have diminished greatly.  It also has helped tighten and lift chest and neck area but beware if you do not want to have a smaller chest, then do not wrap it...lol.&lt;br /&gt;I have found the best deals on ebay-I don&#x27;t bid more than $56.00 and if I am patient, someone will bite. Paying up to 25.00 for just one single wrap is cray cray.  Again, this is NOT for weight loss people-stop expecting it will negate you stuffing your face with french fries. It is however a wonderful method to tone, tighten and erase both stretch marks and cellulite.</li>
            <li> WRAPS DID NOT WORK FOR ME!!!!!!!! Im not satisfied! Don&#x27;t waist  your money on this!!!!!! Thanks for ripping me off...</li>
            <li> It has work for me you just have to be consisted and follow a good diet and exercise . I will recommend this product</li>
            <li> It works! You can see the results right away and even in the days to come. Provide motivation. I have used the wraps and love them. Can use anywhere and help to smooth the skin and remove inches.</li>
            <li> I did not have one millimeter of change in any of the four applications. The only thing thinner is my wallet.</li>
            <li> I orderd 12 wraps and seen just 2 inches lost. Im done im not ordering this again.  I drank plenty of water and thats the results I got.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know who is writing the glowing reviews but this did absolutely nothing for me except&lt;br /&gt;for making my bank account smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend.  The old adage about walking 30 mins a day and watching what you&lt;br /&gt;eat is probably the best advice.</li>
            <li> I did not get any results. In fact, I became more bloated. I signed up for their loyal customer and was charged three times for auto ship. I have tried other products too. Waste of money. Their customer representative was extremely rude as well.</li>
            <li> Ok so I been following everything that people have told me to do . I even stop eating junk food and stop drinking soda and juice all I drink is water and eat salads . And I have not even lost 1/2 an inch on my stomach which this is the area I am focused on. I am so disappointed I have only 2 more to go and I am starting to feel like it is not working. I will write another review once I am done with all the wraps.</li>
            <li> It does work.  Follow dorections and you&#x27;ll get results. I lost only an inch with the first wrap, but my second wrap I list more and my stretch marks faded to barely anything!</li>
            <li> Was not a \\&quot;box\\&quot;of wraps just wraps in a bag didnt notice and difference after using all four of them</li>
            <li> I used it right before my vacation, and taking photo on my vacation, I  could really see the difference in the photo&#x27;s</li>
            <li> After using the box of 4 wraps, I definitetly noticed my mid-section looked more toned and firm. I used the wraps every 3 days as recommended, and followed the detailed post-wrap instructions, which includes drinking LOTS of water, exercising, and eating a healthy diet. After 12 days, my mid-section looked more defined and less flabby. I was looking to tone, not necessarily lose weight or inches. I am not overweight, nor do I have massive &amp;#34;rolls,&amp;#34; just some dimpled skin I wanted to look more firm. This is def not a weight loss solution. If you have more than 5 lbs to lose, exercise and choose a healthy diet, because these alone will not help you lose weight. But if you want to look more toned for an upcoming pool party or event, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Waste of money didn&#x27;t loose any weight.</li>
            <li> As an Itworks distributor, it is very important that consumers are receiving the proper instruction that is to accompany the use of our Ultimate Body Applicator.

Enjoy, because this is truly an amazing product and saved my body after the birth of my child, so much so I chose to represent this amazing brand.</li>
            <li> As a former woman struggling with her weight, I have tried all sorts of body wraps at spas, etc for countless hours and for around $125 per session. Instead, I have started to use the ItWorks body wraps and have done detoxed while on the wraps and it has helped me so so much. I put on a wrap, drink water and detox juice for the entire day and the following two days I eat light meals with a lot of water (3L) and green tea (to boost the metabolism). I also get plenty of rest and sleep while on the body wraps and have worked out with the body wrap on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy from skinny4ever.myitworks.com/shop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results have been so amazing! DIY body wraps and detoxing are the best way to go and show actual results</li>
            <li> Not sure I see a difference but they feel great! I would buy again!</li>
            <li> I just had a baby 4 months ago and I was looking for a way to lose some of my baby fat. It doesn&#x27;t work but it helped lighten my tummy.</li>
            <li> I actually didnt try it. freind uses this and swears up and down that it works.I was happy to order it for her.Easy and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me. I didn&#x27;t lose any inches in my waist even though I put it on for at least an hour and a half, followed instructions and such but didn&#x27;t provide any results. Not even toning at the area. I&#x27;m not huge or anything. I&#x27;m 5&amp;#34;5 and 150 lbs, which is my chubbiest point so far that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m trying to slim down just a little. But this thing really doesn&#x27;t work for me. Waste of time and efforts.</li>
            <li> i ordered the 4-pack. all were a dark brown color. i could see it through the package. i sent them back. gross.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on the wraps from these sellers.  They could be old, dried out and they are so much more expensive than buying them wholesale from a distributor!  I&#x27;ve personally seen the wraps produce amazing results!!  If you want to see some honest unedited and awesome results, swing by my blog at totallyworks.wordpress.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can email me any questions at london.itworks@gmail.com</li>
            <li> My wife bought these and they did not have a expiration date on box.. looked like it was rubbed off to hide how old it was.. my wife opened one of the wraps and go figures the brown lotion on the wrap was not lotion.. it was clumps of dried up light brown looking baby s***.. would not recommend anyone buying from this person thats trying to sell old products.. lesson learned.. enjoy my $100+  u ripped my wife off..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry,  but this product did not work at all!! I don&#x27;t see how its nationwide, so I&#x27;m starting to think the photos are Photoshopped!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to have this work for me.  I used it as directed - waiting 72 hours between applications, using stretch bandages to hold it in place, and even worked up to wearing it overnight.  Overall I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement.  I did like the feeling of increased circulation in the areas and the smell was nice.  I just wish it would have lived up to the description since it wasn&#x27;t a cheap beauty find.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any amazing results with these. However my friends who have had children raved about how much their stretch marks faded. It smells really good.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product negative stars, I absolutely would. I bought this product from a friend&#x27;s recommendation and after using it, I can say that it does not work and I did not notice any change whatsoever. I did follow the directions of showering beforehand to open up the pores, take my measurements, use saran wrap over the wrap, etc and drink lots of water. I took measurements and pictures for 3 days and I saw no change. What was the biggest problem was that I had a severe allergic reaction to the wrap and ended up in the hospital. Upon having my doctor send ITWORKS a letter stating that their product put me in the hospital, the company will not refund me my money because I used their product and they only accept refunds for products that are unused and unopened. They do not care at all that their product put me in the hospital. I strongly suggest not to engage in any sort of business with a company that cares so little about their customers and does not take responsibility for the repercussions of their products. I could have died with anaphlyactic reactions and apparently that does not warrant a refund because I \\&quot;used their product.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I know the ItWorks distributors go on and on about how much these wraps work, but I&#x27;m so glad I googled searched for a way to sample these wraps before being bilked by ItWorks for hundreds of dollars. These wraps didn&#x27;t do a thing for me except give me the nice \\&quot;post detox bloat&#x27;\\&quot;. Didn&#x27;t even get the smooth skin that people rave about. Waste of money and beware how they measure at those wrap parties. A complete hoax!!!! After pics that got any results were not from wraps alone. Don&#x27;t be scammed!!!!</li>
            <li> I love these wraps. They absolutely work. The only problem I have with the wrap is that you have to drink plenty of water but water is good for you anyway.</li>
            <li> I like this product , but it dosent last long without diet and exercise your stomach will go back to its original size</li>
            <li> i figured i would try this Ultimate Body Applicator.  You are constantly seeing ads on how to make your face look younger, your body look better. i figured i would try this.  I watched the video and it seemed very easy to apply this wrap.  I am only writing this review so that others will know what to expect.  the gel that is on each wrap is very strong in smell ( similar to a very strong Ben Gay).  I left it on for an hour and a half,  on my stomach, anxious to take it off as it burns, its cold.  you do need to drink a lot of water as you do sort of feel dehydrated - which they said it does not dehydrate you.  The girl in the video shows us how she puts it on and then runs out to pick her daughter up from school.  i would never leave the house with this on.  absolutely nothing changed after wearing it for an hour and a half.  i put another one on 72 hours later as they said you could.  nothing changed again. i ended up throwing the other 2 away.  sorry, i just was not satisfied.  maybe it has worked for others, but it did nothing for me. also, you definitely need to put saran wrap over the wrap as it really doesn&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li> First of all, I figured my wraps would arrive in the same type of box as advertised in the photo. Instead, they arrived loose, in a padded mailing envelope. Granted, the box itself is just a fancy &amp;#34;vessel&amp;#34; to help promote and glorify the contents within, and I&#x27;m not necessarily upset about *not* having the box...just saying, ship what you advertise.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I have tried all 4 of my wraps, and never really saw much of a difference.  I know it is not a weight loss system, so I was not expecting to shed any pounds...but I was hoping for at least a bit of noticeable change. I followed all the directions, but I guess my body chemistry is not compatible with the active ingredients of the wraps. I am glad I only paid $50 for my 4pk.&lt;br /&gt;Not the worst thing I&#x27;ve wasted money on...thanks anyway.</li>
            <li> Itworks... DIDNT WORK FOR ME!!! Just a waste of money! Should have known better!</li>
            <li> it does not work and is a waste of money! I used as directed and NO RESULTS! do not buy</li>
            <li> The four wraps I received was definitely and old batch. They had very little product on it and was no use to me! I didn&#x27;t return because I had opened them and extremely disappointed! I had ordered just one several months ago and the items was great! It really worked . Next time I&#x27;ll order straight from a distributor to insure fresh batch and not waste my money!  I still love amazon because I have received great products.</li>
            <li> I heard about these things from a co-worker.  Local reps were selling them for twice the price so I decided to order from Amazon.  There are amazing stories and pictures online everywhere right now showing before and after results so I was definitely excited to try it.  I used exactly as directed and left the first patch on for hours longer than the minimum time.  I had a slight reduction in measurement immediately after use but it came right back by the next day.  Tried another wrap two days later and left on even longer than the first time.  Same basic results.  Overall, zero inches lost and lots of mess to deal with not to mention the cost.  I sold the other two to the co-worker for what I&#x27;d paid.  She seemed more impressed on her first use but she slept in the wrap.  I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell a difference by looking at her, though.  If you&#x27;re curious and really want to try these, this is definitely cheaper than buying them from other places but honestly there are no magic pills, powders or wraps and we all know it to be true.  If you really want a flatter stomach , you know what it takes.</li>
            <li> Got them based on feedback I got from someone who went to a party. They didn&#x27;t do anything but make a weird smell. Save your money!</li>
            <li> Love it! Going to order some&lt;br /&gt;More :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate leaving a bad review for anyone but I almost felt obligated to do this. I used to think there are some people this product will work for but after reading reviews by so many people who had to luck at all, I really feel it is the exception and not the rule. I also wonder how many of the reviews are written by people who actually sell the wraps and not by actual customers. And they are so expensive! I decided to take a chance, though....and you guessed it. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. I did everything as directed and tried 3 times before giving up. I would have never tried a body wrap again but a friend of mine had a jar of Lucalean given to her and begged me to do a wrap with her. I didn&#x27;t want to totally discourage her so I said OK. All I will say it WOW (12 1/2&amp;#34; from a one hour wrap with 3 1/2&amp;#34; being from my belly (hehe Happy Dance, lol) . Do yourself a favor and check out this brand....much cheaper (less than $28 last time I bought and you can get at least 3 full body wraps from one jar). They also have a money back guarantee and NO reps trying to push you into buying an expensive product that (chances are) will do absolutely nothing for you. The lady who sells the Lucalean is super nice and answered all my questions when I ordered my own jar. Again, I have nothing to gain by sharing this info....they don&#x27;t have reps like the IT WORKS brand-it&#x27;s all direct sales from their website and I do know there are several spas that carry it. I&#x27;ve noticed they don&#x27;t do a lot of advertising and thought people should be aware that there is a much better option. Just my 2 cents. Hope it helps. Oh, and the website is Lucaco-not Lucalean, but you can find it by searching Lucalean on Google.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it...there is NO quick fix!  I&#x27;ve used the wrap several times as a friend is an affiliate for It Works and swears by it.  My skin does feel softer afterwards but, helllllooo, I just wrapped myself with lotion for 45 minutes!  My skin feels softer after doing the same thing with Castor Oil.  I feel horribly sick the day after each wrap I used...they say it&#x27;s the detox...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other products from It Works...the body firming lotion is way to sticky.  My clothes would literally stick to my skin until I showered.  I have a full bottle I will probably never use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have the Greens.  I don&#x27;t feel any different when I use those but since it&#x27;s a supplement it may or may not be beneficial.  I take Source of Life multivitamin/mineral/supplement and feel great using those...so why switch?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all..it&#x27;s a &#x27;no&#x27; for It Works company.</li>
            <li> I saw no changes... at all. I followed through the directions and drank plenty of water like it says to.. I guess it just isnt for everyone?</li>
            <li> GET REAL THIS IS ONLY TEMPORARY AND THE RESULTS ARE MINIMAL......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOOSE WEIGHT TAKES EATING RIGHT AND EXERCISE.......BOTTOM LINE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU HAVE MONEY TO WASTE THAN THIS IS FOR YOU..........</li>
            <li> I did everything I was suppose to drink water stay away from &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; food ect and I didn&#x27;t see any results!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for me</li>
            <li> very unhappy with this product I think I should be a complete refund for customer because they do not work properly</li>
            <li> Im a guy and needed to lose weight. I didnt really weigh myself before doing the it works wraps, but I&#x27;ve noticed my pants were now loose and I need to use belts now. Im not sure if this did all the trick for me to lose weight because I also exercise for 10 days straight and I also had a juice diet. But I believe it still helped. I suggest going on a diet and exercise while having this.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I get the product. First time I got it straight from it works and it really worked. This experience was different. Since the moment I got the package which was opened  till the moment when I I pened the envelop  and noticed that the stripes were much dry than the original package. They had no lotion on Them. I&#x27;m sure they send me one package either expired or a poor imitation. I&#x27;ll get them again because even though it&#x27;s high price , they bandages works amazingly .</li>
            <li> They work great lost inches and love handles!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because because I have lost a good amount of weight and I am not happy with the way my stomach looks still and I felt it needed a little extra help. This product helped tighten and tone after just four applications. It took two wraps for me to really figure out how to apply the wrap tight enough. I ended up having to wrap a few layers of plastic wrap around my body to keep it in place, and they work better when you wear them overnight. Allowing the lotion in the cloth to be on longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend them if you need that extra bit of help in the stomach area.</li>
            <li> This works !!! After exercising ...wow wow wow... Clean your skin and dry put this baby on and feel the tingle and burn so good !!!! I have a 3 month old child and yes ..that baby roll has lost half its size after one applicator...its wonderful so natural.. buy this product fast!!!!! It works !!!! Worth your money ... Smell is strong but fat melting is worth it and smooths the skin !!!! Yes I will continue to buy !!!</li>
            <li> This product hardly worked. I lost maybe a half inch but probably cause I was sweating water off from wrapping my body in plastic wrap. I wish I could get my money back. I&#x27;ve tried this twice thinking maybe I didn&#x27;t drink enough water:(</li>
            <li> My body wrap just came in yesterday. I was a little skeptical at first however the results spoke for themselves...Last night I prepped my stomach by washing and drying the area, to make sure the skin was clean so the wrap would stick well. I opened the packet and discovered it smelled strongly of herbs, specifically eucalyptus. I pasted the wrap to my stomach and wrapped saran wrap around to keep it in place. I left it on for 45min as directed. During that time I experience a cooling, tingly sensation all over my stomach, almost to the point where it felt like it was burning me. It wasn&#x27;t too bad though....After the 45min was up I unwrapped myself and discovered my skin was much tighter. I drank a bunch of water to help the fat and water to release from my stomach area. I didn&#x27;t see slimming results till the next morning though. Yet, the results were amazing</li>
            <li> I opened up the wraps and it was not what it says it is. I&#x27;ve been using these wraps and the moisture was all dry and the wrap was too dry to apply. It didn&#x27;t work . And I WANT a refund. I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone. Save your money.....</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t work.... A waste of money and time. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> These did not really work. I used three of them and saw no difference. I recommend not wasteing all the money on them.</li>
            <li> I have tried one wrap so far, through a distributor, and have been blown away! I was very skeptical at first, so wanted to try one before I commited. I figured I have spent $20 on worse things before, if it did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, there truly is a quick fix! I can definitely see and feel a difference. My stomach is so much tighter and seems to continue to tighten up five days later. I am waiting on my next order of defining gel and then a month of wraps to continue to product and results. I am reading so many mixed reviews on here and am guessing that it affects everyone differently. But I drank half my body weight in water daily for the past five days, took before and after pictures and measurements (lost 1.5 inches around my navel), kept the wrap on for 2.5 hours, and have been eating fairly normally since wrapping. While I did not initally lose many inches, I can definitely feel a difference. I have already passed on the word to my close friends, which I would not do if I did not believe in the product. If you have an extra $25, consider trying it out. Though I would definitely recommend buying through a distributor so ensure the product is good quality.</li>
            <li> Your better off doing ILipo or Smart lipo save you money. It works for one day that&#x27;s it. Not a permanent solution.</li>
            <li> It did not get me the results that I was expecting, I was told that I had to at least purchase two to three applications. To spend about $400.00 at the cost of $100.00 per package of four to get results, I really did not want to spend that much money.</li>
            <li> I normally do not try things like this but a good friend of mine sells this product and well..I&#x27;m hooked..So far I have only used one wrap but I love it, I have also taken the greens and the fat blocker with mine and this morning I could tell a difference, and still can, even after lunch and lots of water. I&#x27;m waiting on my kit to arrive so that I can really get in to it since my friend let me borrow one of her wrap to try..</li>
            <li> works very well if you follow and keep up with the guidelines</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how but I lost 4 inches .  Doesn&#x27;t last but it does work. I didn&#x27;t lose inches right away but by the next morning I was down.  If u don&#x27;t continue it goes back in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I wasted more than 80 bucks on something that doesn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;m truly frustrated and I wish I could have my money back.  People don&#x27;t waste your money on this product it doesn&#x27;t work.  After 4 wraps and eating healthier I&#x27;m still the same.  It&#x27;s a bogus product.  I&#x27;m not even that fat, I just have a few pounds to shed off so this product should of worked if it has supposely worked on obese people.  Never again!!</li>
            <li> I am a loyal customer and mine were purchased directly from It Works. If you eat terribly and aren&#x27;t a healthy conscious individual, these wraps won&#x27;t work for you, or the results will not last. These wraps are meant to aid eating better and drinking water. I lost 6 inches around my belly with my second wrap after wearing it overnight. It also reduced my stretch marks. DO NOT expect to lose pounds from wearing this wrap. The wrap is meant to tighten the skin, which a lot of the negative reviewers are not taking into consideration. I am obsessed with the It Works line and I hope anyone considering them will ignore the negative reviews and try a wrap!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work; apparently it&#x27;s a downline thing and shouldn&#x27;t be on Amazon at all. Utterly ineffective. I smelled like Vick&#x27;s Vaporub when these wraps were on.</li>
            <li> They do not WORK DO NOT WASTE YOUT MONEY ITS A SCAM SERIOUSLY PEOPLE DONT WAIT YOU&#x27;RE MONEY I DID A TOTAL OF 16 WRAPS N SEE NO DIFFERENCE AND IM ONLY 129 LBS</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking that it probably wouldn&#x27;t work but it was worth a try.  I followed all instructions, drank a lot of water and laid still the whole time.  It tingled a little bit, made my skin feel soft, but did nothing to take off any inches from my waistline.  It was a total waste of money, I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t spend any more than $30 on this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the individual wraps to try in the past and I like them and can tell you they work ONLY if you are currently on a diet/excercise regime.  If not, expect the inches to come back.  I think that&#x27;s a pretty simple concept.  With this 4 pack, I noticed immediately that the expiration date on the outside of the box was crossed out in black marker.  They crossed it out twice, so I could not see when the product expired.  Though the product is good and this 4 pack was &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;, I could tell it was not as &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; or had as much product on it as other wraps I&#x27;ve purchased in the past from other sellers.  I think that the product was probably expired, thus the much cheaper price compared to other sellers.  I would purchase again, only if the expiration date was not crossed out to ensure the wraps are not expired or dried up a bit.</li>
            <li> So I was totally a sceptic.  I have a huge event coming up so I thought I would try it. I just did the first wrap and lost almost 2 inches. No this is not a permanent fix nor do I expect it at all. But for a quick small stomach tightening its great.  Working out and eating right is the trick but to help fit in a dress this is a nice addition.</li>
            <li> I think these wraps were past the expiration date. I&#x27;ve seen these before. The inside was dried and hard!!</li>
            <li> It definitely shrunk me and toned me up for a couple days and then things went right back to where they were.  If I did this every couple of days I&#x27;d look and feel pretty good, my pants would fit better, but I&#x27;d be poor.  If you are looking for something to get you through a weekend, this is your deal.  Wedding? Do it.  Reunion?  Yep.  Weekend get away? Sure.  Give it a try.  But it won&#x27;t stick around for more than a couple of days.  Time it right.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected for the amount of money I Paid. Not really impressed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work!  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I was asked by a friend to help her by using the products so that she would have some testimonials. I ordered my first box, but due to changes in my personal life (impending move, etc), I was not able to do the program. When I tried to cancel my second order from It Wraps the cancellation did not go through and they wanted to charge me the $50 membership fee. It appears that they depend more on trapping you in a 3 month contract than on making satisfied customers.</li>
            <li> I bought 8 applications 8 wraps total within 2 months my stomich shrunk drastically, I wrapped my tummy with elastic wrap left it on for as long as I could 7 hours. Followed up 3 days later. If I wouldn&#x27;t have done this, I would still be where I was. It literally shrunk the fat. Not completely but wow amazing. After my 1st pregnancy I worked out for 4 months everyday, went from 185 to 145, continued to workout.. couldn&#x27;t loose the baby pouch, i wanted to go back to my pre pregnancy weight which was 130. To this day i am 120, my stomich is still wrinkley. The wrap did all that it could. I love these wraps!worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Temporarily works, for about a day then once you do things like eat or drink anything especially drink its like you never used it. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> i bought the 4 pack, it came pretty quick which was a plus, but for the product itself, I did not see any results and I followed the instructions...the ultimate body wraps work better than this it works wrap, did not work for me at all....very disappointed</li>
            <li> These wraps are hard to put on, and the directions are not very clear in how to do it.  I suppose the next time I should to go an actual person selling these for help or wrap with someone else before hand to learn how to do it correctly. I have used the entire four wraps without noticing a difference.</li>
            <li> The wraps were either expired or old. They were brown. I used them anyway since i had paid for them already. I got sooo sick! I couldnt get outa bed. Body aches for days. Maybe that batch was bad. But im scared to try them again</li>
            <li> The Ultimate Body Applicator. disappointed in the size of te wraps. Had to use two to do the area I did.</li>
            <li> I am usually the Guinea pig for my friends and waste all my money but this was not a waste! I received 4. The first time I wore it for the 45 minutes. I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference but after the 4th Wrap, I lost about 6 inches. That&#x27;s not bad for no exercise or diet change. Once I get some extra money I will get more. I just wish they were bigger to wrap around back and stomach.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is the one who used these. They did not work for him. He did not lose one inch and he used all 4 of them according to directions. I use to give body wraps and I know that they really truly don&#x27;t work. But he wanted to give it a try, needless to say he was full of disappointment.</li>
            <li> I bought these four wraps in hopes to get rid of some of this baby fat but it didn&#x27;t not do anything for me. I am the same not one inch taken off.</li>
            <li> I did not think this would work but happy, I bought this for under sixty for 4 wraps at wraps.howtonow.org , these are personal results with just 1 wrap!</li>
            <li> Hard to keep on. When following the instructions, I saw No results. Seemed like a good idea, but maybe too good to be true. Would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I actually tried this once at a party for free. But I was very skeptical and I thought it was just like a quick fix. But the my surprise, it actually work. I  left it on overnight. I put it on my lower ab which was 47.5 at the time. When I took it off the next morning and measured, I was 47. Its only .5 in but you continue to loose for up to three days. I drank lots of water, and after 3 days, I measured again and I was 45.5 So I lost two in. in just one application. I totally love this product. But then again, everyone has different results. I would say, if you have the money try it! (:</li>
            <li> I love It Works Products!!! [...]</li>
            <li> I bought this over 2 months ago and I did it with my mom. It worked and I was very happy to fit into my 13 size jeans I haven&#x27;t been able to get into for 2 years! I was very skeptical about getting them through here and also about trying them but they came on time and worked! I will be purchasing more!!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  I am not saying it would not work for other people but I haven&#x27;t seen results.</li>
            <li> I did not see any improvement at all. I am extremely disappointed with this product. Not worth the purchase at all.</li>
            <li> I know people who sell these so I tried one out.  I was told to drink half my body weight in water every day for three days for each wrap.  That made me think that at the end of the three days I would definitely have lost a couple of pounds because drinking that much water curbs your appetite.  I was also told to not drink any alcohol for three days.  Considering both of those are weight loss tactics in themselves I wanted to see what just the wrap would do if I kept everything else the same. so I drank my normal amount of water and had my usual glass of wine with dinner. I measured at all if the milestones and there was no change.  I also didn&#x27;t see a change in the texture of my skin other than it feeling moisturized right after the wrap.  That is why I gave one star.</li>
            <li> Awesome!! 👍 :) recieved it right on time when said.. Product was exactly what I expected.. Lower prices than others \\&quot;BIG CHECK PLUS\\&quot;!! 👌loved it.. Thanks ..</li>
            <li> In my personal opinion this product is a complete scam! I heard people say how it works. Of course their selling it! I took measurements &amp; before pictures. I am a size 3. And I workout &amp; eat healthy. I am not one of these people looking for a magical  product that is going to poof get me results. While I eat what I want. And not work out. I just wanted to tone &amp; tighten my tummy for the summer. I bought the fat blocker pills &amp; the defining gel and wraps. Followed the instructions. 1st wrap no results used the defining gel in between wraps. Did the 2nd wrap. Still no results. This product is a scam. And not a cheap one!</li>
            <li> Hey guys I just want to say that I tried several products from It Works and really liked them all especially since their all made from natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;A key way to use the wrap that I learned which led to me losing 40lbs, tightening and toning my skin, and helping with stretch marks is to take a shower prior to wrapping to open your pores so that it works better. Also, you can leave it on longer than 45mins, even over night while you sleep, but another big tip is to take pictures to really see results and changes. Of course you need to drink water to cleanse your body because the wrap detoxify your fat cells and you need water to flush the toxins out of your system. Stay away from alot of sodium while you do it also because sodium causes your body to absorb the water and not flush the toxins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it cheaper and easier to just order it from a website. Plus you get the answers and tips that you need on top of other products that work great together...like their defining gel that enhances the wrap results and diminishes the appearance of stretch marks and cellulite even more. The fat fighter is awesome too. You can just get a package and join their loyal customer program for free and get half of the price. Hope this helps others like it helped me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get my stuff from&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;myhealthybody.myitworks.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The loyal customer program is great but you have to start your order and join at checkout to get all the savings and the savings are great</li>
            <li> I ordered it through amazon which I probably shouldn&#x27;t have in the first place,. I did everything I was supposed to do &amp; saw no results whatsoever! There was no expectation date on the box, so I really think they are just selling out all the bad product. It was a total waste of money!</li>
            <li> It simply didn&#x27;t work and I followed every direction exactly. The seller shipped it promptly but the product did not do what was expected.  Huge results were not expected just something; even a 1/2 inch..</li>
            <li> Dosent work. Lots of my money wasted. Product is terrible :( didn&#x27;t do anything for me I had absolutely no results &amp; followed the rules 100%</li>
            <li> What a joke, it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I always give the benefit of the doubt, but this product gives false hope.  Don&#x27;t even waste your money.</li>
            <li> I bought into the hype with this product and I did lose two inches but after three days it was right back.  After more research you are supposed to drink half your body weight in water and work on eating clean.  HELLO!!!  That is a diet and if you eat like that you will lose weight regardless if you use the wrap.  It also did nothing for my stretch marks from my pregnancy.  Overall it was a total waste of money and I can&#x27;t believe I fell into the trap!!</li>
            <li> i was very skeptical when i first thought about purchasing the wraps.. i thought in my head yeah right like a wrap will make me lose inches.. so like any ordinary person i did research and watched videos and went to websites looked up tips and how to wrap myself properly.. so after i did all the research my mind could handle i decided to purchase the wraps.. i thought jeeze that&#x27;s alot of money for something that might not work.. but i ordered it anyways and recieved my package 3 days later.. i followed the instructions to the TEE.. and guess what.. i lost 3 inches of my waist with the first wrap (within 3 days) then after my second wrap i lost 2 more inches (3 days) i was totally stokkkked and I&#x27;ve kept those inches off too!! I&#x27;m saving my last 2 wraps for when we go on vacation in April!! just remember this rule \\&quot;the more you drink the more you shrink\\&quot; i will be re-ordering soon!!!</li>
            <li> Waste of money. I bought this cause my friend raved about the inches she lost with this product. I haven&#x27;t lost anything, in fact I feel more bloated then anything. Followed exactly what was instructed. Wish there was a money back guarantee. I feel depressed knowing I wasted $80 on this when I coulda used that on anything else of better value!</li>
            <li> I first purchase the it work wraps about a month in a ago I went from 40\\&quot; to now a 29\\&quot; at first I was shock to see a big of a change with just one wrap but by the time I had used all 4 wraps I literally has lost 10\\&quot; in just a week. So I ordered two more boxes of wraps but this time I ordered from seller EYEWEAR PHARMACY and let me to u buyer beware the wrap was so dry that it look like they where outdated and the wraps did not work as well so do not buy from eyewear pharmacy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently doing T25 and I just felt like getting even faster results on my tummy so I thought I&#x27;d try this out after so much hype about it. After I had hit that purchase button, I started getting doubts, not so much in the product, but the fact that I was buying it from Amazon and not from a real distributor. I even cancelled my order, because I was scared of losing $$ &amp; there were so many negative comments. The I said you know what? I bet these people didn&#x27;t do it the right way so I started researching and found this:    [...]  You have to follow ALL the rules!!!    I am not fat at all, I&#x27;m pretty thick but in a skinny way? lol my waist is smaller than my hips etc but my stomach definitely needs to be toned and flattened though and for some reason it has tendencies to be bloated all the time! i know, it sucks. So when I tried on my first wrap heres how I did it:    At night I took a hot shower to let my pores open up, I did not use soap or any kind of lotion on my stomach. Then I made sure i was dry and I put the wrap evenly on my stomach it fit perfectly. Then I put saram wrap as tight as I could around it and theeeeen I put on a girdle/shapewear. I tried to go to sleep, but I felt really uncomfortable in my supppperrrr tight girdle so after about 4 hours I took it off and just wore the saram wrap thing for another 4 hours.    I was worried because it was kind of brown looking so I didn&#x27;t know if it meant that it was expired? But when I put it on it felt all tingly and warm and good! like thermo therapy. Anywys when i took it off the next day I was like no way... NO WAY my stomach was not bloated anymore!!! I put the before &amp; after picture side by side and omg you could definitely tell something magical happened lol the next day(today) I was even thinner! I even lost 1lb too.  So far so good on my first wrap.. I hope the results will last especially since im working out hardcore. I just can&#x27;t wait to see my results after the 4th one! I will come back and giveanother review, once I&#x27;m done.    I gave it 4 stars because I&#x27;m still in the unknown about its lasting results and I heard that the wrap was supposed to be green? It didnt smell expired, it actually smelled good and people say that it&#x27;s gooey and yucky, but honestly.. its not at all! It&#x27;s like rubbing icy hot on your body.    If you didn&#x27;t see results it&#x27;s probably because you&#x27;re toooo fat (i&#x27;m sorry, no offense) and you&#x27;re body didnt react weel to the ingredients because there&#x27;s too much junk.    If you did get results but it&#x27;s not as drastic as the before and after pictures you see online then it&#x27;s because you probably dont have that much fat therefore it&#x27;s reducing in less inches.. if that makes sense? Just keep going until you&#x27;ve done all 4 wraps.    And lastly, I bought the box it came exactly as packaged. It was perfect nothing was missing it looked brand new. If you notice.. when you buy one wrap vs 2 vs 4 they&#x27;re  all sold by different people. Mine was from bell_shop and so far I really trust the. I can&#x27;t speak for the other wrap sellers.</li>
            <li> I have used 2 of these and have not seen a change yet but I will keep trying! Cannot wait to see the results.</li>
            <li> I had seen this product through the official site and through the people selling it... but you HAVE TO sign up for a minimum commitment that costs A LOT of money. This package was expensive, but not as much as having to buy it every month as part of a so called deal. I&#x27;m sure the whole program works great with the pills and the creams and everything, but for me, buying this package once in a while as part of my plan works. I work out and eat healthy too. My baby is now 6 months old and I&#x27;m back to my pre-baby weight... this applicator box is helping me just get my skin back to it&#x27;s original tightness. It&#x27;s not a miracle. Takes time and hard work, but it definitely is a BIG help.</li>
            <li> they were a little messy to put on yourself but would try again did notice the difference after a week</li>
            <li> They were old products and the gel was half dry.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. Definitely waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great product and packaging</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. It&#x27;s a quick fix. You need to reorder to continue results.</li>
            <li> I bought this being a little skeptical on how much it would really work, but i saw a lot of before and afters that were impressive! I measured in 2 places and they were 38 and 34 i only used the wrap for an hour and layed down and relaxed while it was on. when i took it off i felt like a cold burning feeling and it felt weird for a little while but went away after 10-15 minutes. I then measured myself about 12 hours later the next morning and i dropped an inch! I now measure 37 and 33, cant wait to measure again in a few hours to see how much more i lost! It is worth trying although ive seen reviews for some people saying it doesnt work, guess it depends on the person but so far it worked for me!</li>
            <li> I am addicted to these wraps. I believe that these may not work as well for some as much as others. But, while doing this wrap you should drink lots of water, about 48oz. And continue to drink half of your body weight for the 2-3 days. You are helping detox your body. Also, for best results, use the defining gel twice a day. I use these wraps on my stomach, thighs, and arms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try and see the efect of that</li>
            <li> Hey gals, this thing works! Do first check recommendations for use online. Drink your water. Do as they say. Do it 3 times and you&#x27;ll see!</li>
            <li> OMG!!!! This is AMAZING I didn&#x27;t think it would work like most, but it really does!!!! Keep in mind this tightens and breaks down you fat in the area you apply. Be sure to read the instructions to get maximum results. I can&#x27;t stress that enough!!!!! When I first started I thought.... well I don&#x27;t need that much water so... I didn&#x27;t drink what was recommended ( drinking half you body weight in water) Didn&#x27;t really see that much of a change in my stomach area..... then I tried the 2nd one 72 hours latter and decided to see if the water thing was true and... IT WAS!!! You have to drink a lot of water I would just carry a jug of water with you for the 72 ours :) What I realized that the water helps push all of the toxins out that the wrap is helping get rid of. I would recommend becoming  a loyal customer from their website. Its $51 for a membership but you get 40% off all orders and after 3 months you don&#x27;t have to pay for the member fee and they will automatically send it to you with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work but some friends tried it so I gave it a shot! Worked better than expected after the second wrap!!</li>
            <li> I must say I was totally amazed with this product. my results were visible with the first wrap and only got better with each wrap. I have had three kids and it gets rid of the flab for sure. love it@</li>
            <li> I used them 3x at $25.00 each!!! They did not work at all for me! You pretty much have to drink water around the clock, which I did. But each time I still got sick and so dehydrated!!! Total waste of money!!</li>
            <li> I did two of these, kept one on over night, drank plenty of water, ate clean, and developed &amp;#34;toxic bloat&amp;#34; afterwards. Didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m not even going to bother doing the other two. Wish having a flat stomach was easy as wrapping up like one of dexters victims haha.</li>
            <li> Did not work. Used three wraps and had them all on over night ....and not an itch taken off...trash...save your money</li>
            <li> For those saying the product doesn&#x27;t work, you HAVE TO complete the FULL treatment plan!  FOUR WRAPS!  Even after the first one, you see a difference, BUT only after 72 hours of drinking AT LEAST 64 oz of WATER daily.  You can&#x27;t just do ONE wrap, eat like crap, drink no water and expect results.</li>
            <li> waste of my hard earned money I did not los anything no inches no weight  will never order this product again also too small</li>
            <li> This product did not work foe me at all. I was highly disappointed because I&#x27;ve seen such great reviews on it and it worked for my Bestie.</li>
            <li> Just thought I would try them since I have heard so much about this product. Didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This Product Came On Time . This Does Help But Nothing Thats Life Changing . The Fat You Have The More It Works The Less Fat The Harder It Will Be To Lose . But Overall A Good Product</li>
            <li> This worked for me although it didn&#x27;t work for my sister. I lost two inches and the results stayed for a long while (months). Bootcamp couldn&#x27;t achieve in 2 months what this did in 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> I order the Ultimate Body Applicators to assist in toning and firming skin while losing weight. I had gastric bypass and I have been in fear of my skin getting flabby. My goal  is to prevent skin removal surgery. I wouldn&#x27;t mind if I lost an inch or too from the toning and firming of skin. I struggle with drinking water and due to health issues can not do any intense exercise.&lt;br /&gt;I order one wrap and was pleased with the look and fill of my stomach after one use. I decided that there were several several other products that would benefit me as well. They have an anti-stress vitamin call Confianza. I have had anxiety and depression for some time. I also ordered the Defining Gel to rub on stretch marks and varicose veins in my legs since I heard it can help with that. Since I had gastric bypass I eat tiny portions and tend to not get all my veggie serving in each day. I ordered the Green supplements packs that give you 8 servings of veggies per day which I add to my lite OJ each morning. I was very impressed with each product. The Confianza mellowed me out and I didn&#x27;t have to take any panic attack rescue pills and I noticed smiling more after about 3 days. I also feel more &amp;#34;up beat&amp;#34; and positive. The Greens gave me a perk in energy (no shakes) and changed my digestive system. I am much more regular now. My varicose veins are less visible after one month and scares are not as dark. Still working on the stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;Back to the wraps. I used 2 on my stomach and took before and after pics. I couldn&#x27;t believe the visible results. I used the other two on my arms which are so much better. I will where strapless and spaghetti straps now. I just received my new box which I am going to use on my inner thighs. I rub the Defining Gel on every day and wish I could just bathe in it!!&lt;br /&gt;I loved the products so much that I knew I wanted to use them all regularly. I became a loyal customer to get the discounts on the products, earn 10% of my spending in future product, and receive free shipping. I just had to agree to purchase something for 3 months. That was a no-brainer for me. I decided to sign up to be able to distribute the products so that I could possible earn mine free. I not only use the products myself but my daughter is for her stretch marks. Both my kids were on Miralax for constipation but now they just have a serving of greens.I am not concerned using the products because they are all natural and organic.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think that the wraps are a magic weight loss tool. It works has weight loss supplements to help with that. I do believe that can change your skin and pull out toxins that fill up in our fat cells. It is common sense that you should eat healthy and be active.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps with your decision to try the wraps and their other nutrition products. You can go online and check it all out&lt;br /&gt;Sabaharris.myitworks.com.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product one time thus far...more of a trial run and i have to say that its a bit stinky....but tolerable.</li>
            <li> My wraps definitely worked, but they only last a couple days at MOST. I noticed it &amp;#34;shrunk&amp;#34; the area (my torso area), but did not remove cellulite. Also, the wrap has a self-tanner, so it&#x27;s an illusion that you&#x27;ve &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; more weight. Look up how to apply self-tanners to make you look skinnier - this almost does the same thing. Mix icy hot on a cloth bandage with some self-tanner and you&#x27;ve got a homemade wrap. I rated this 3 stars because it does work, just temporarily. So if you&#x27;re going on a hot date or want to look a little skinnier in a little dress, this is great for that one night. And do it the day of, my body looked the best the days I did it. Worth the $15 a wrap? Ehhh, maybe. Depends how bad you want your bulge to disappear.</li>
            <li> They work well, but you have to follow the diet and not eat foods that bloat. If you do that then you will love the results.</li>
            <li> worked just like it was supposed to- i will certainly recommend it to other people- the price was certainly right.</li>
            <li> Does not work.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!  I measured myself before and after the wrap and I was actually bigger after the application</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like they say it does.</li>
            <li> Bought these because the reviews were so great. It did not work for me at all... I guess its because everyone has a different body. It did make my skin soft though.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product through a friend that tried it out at a party. She said she had lost 4 inches in one try. So I bought the product to try it out and lost 2 inches in my first 45 minutes and 1/2 inch 72 hours later. Couldn&#x27;t see much visual difference but the measurements were less. I think this a good product for detoxing and you might see a few inches loss but its not a magic wrap, your not going to loose extra weight just by doing these wraps. I did buy this product again with a combination of diet and exercise along with the detoxification of the product I have lost 9 pound. I say try it for yourself and see. But remember there is no magic wand that can make years of bad choices disappear in 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> I kept trying to figure out if I should purchase this because of all the reviews and feedback.  I finally gave in used it and I did not see results at first, but the second time I drank plenty of water and I did get some results which I love!  Its cheaper to find a person who sells it in your area because I paid 80.00 on Amazon and got it for 50.00 from a seller.</li>
            <li> I watched testimonials of the good The Ultimate Body Applicator can do.  Therefore, with anticipation I waited for mine.  I did not expect unrealistic results, but did expect to see some difference.  After my first application I did not notice much of a difference in my problem area.  I will not say the product does not work.  I have 3 more apllications to use.  However, I will say that it has not met my expectations as of yet.</li>
            <li> I lost one inch in my waist and hips with my first wrap and no difference with the second, and I did drink a ton if water almost two gallons a day, I never even used the other two because I figured the hassle of sleeping in the wrap wasn&#x27;t worth not losing anything, but my skin did appear to be a little bit tighter...</li>
            <li> I used three of these wraps and didn&#x27;t see any huge difference in my waist size. Maybe a half inch or so. Everyone is different though so I can&#x27;t say it won&#x27;t work for you, it did work on a friend of mine but I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> Just bs and junk did not do anything&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this product it is just a wast of time and money preparation h would of done more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;google&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;it prepartion h wrap\\&quot;</li>
            <li> makes my skin smooth and does show definition.&lt;br /&gt;was reluctnt however if used consistantly it will work&lt;br /&gt;will by again</li>
            <li> This was an absolute waste of my money. This was my month of doing &amp;#34;sit ups&amp;#34;, so I expected this to help even more. I lost 1/2 in. total! Never again.</li>
            <li> i love these they work like magic just make sure u drink lots of water i cant wait to order my next box</li>
            <li> Horrible should have know there no wonder cream for stomach belly fat healthy eating and exercise.</li>
            <li> These do not work.  I have tried three of them.  Kept them on for 45 minutes and drank more water than I do in a week.  I have not lost any inches and neither has my boss who has tried it.</li>
            <li> I ordered my product about a week ago and I am on my second wrap. The first wrap went good. I got rid of about half an inch, the second one helped me get rid of an inch and a half!! Im still working on it and Im excited to see where I will be once the box is empty! I am def buying more!!</li>
            <li> I did 3 lose inches with this product.  However, I am only giving it 3 stars because the product box was missing the expiration date.  It makes you wonder if the date was rubbed off because it could have been expired.</li>
            <li> product was shipped out &amp; received on time . I followed the directions . I took a hot shower exfoliated &amp; then wrapped myself. I even slept in it because of the reviews I read &amp; the results  they say they had.I drank 120Oz.of water. Well when I woke up this morning n nothing.not So much as an inch! So I have 48 more hours to go &amp; I will re-post but as of now absolutely nothing! Other than are restless nights sleep.Oooohhh...&amp; they also said of you don&#x27;t lose inches on the first wrap your stretch marks will at least disappear! I guess mine are stubborn cause they puare still there &amp;I didn&#x27;t have many to begin with! Hmmmmmm....</li>
            <li> I probably wasted my money.  I didn&#x27;t mind the smell and it had a interesting cooling, tingling sensation.  Overall I think I had some improvement in my skin as far as firming but for the price it wasn&#x27;t enough of an improvement to buy more.  Too expensive for effect.  I am not extremely overweight but I do have some sagging skin due to pregnancy and stretchmarks.  I wanted to give this product a chance and didn&#x27;t hate it but it is too pricey.</li>
            <li> I work out and eat all things healthy.  This did absolutely nothing tor me.  I couldn&#x27;t honestly tell anyone to buy this.</li>
            <li> This things is a bunch of crap! No result at all. I followed all of the instructions. I honestly hoped those reviews that were good had some backing but nope not for this product.</li>
            <li> Product is good for being smaller for a day other wise waste of money. Results for all slimming wraps are temporary. I can understand if you are trying to slim down to look good for a wedding or vacation, or use it as motivation to lose weight but as a way to lose weight and keep it off its total waste of money. These wraps are pretty much just compressing your fat temporarily not getting rid of it, so 2 days after your wrap you are back a square one.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work.  I purchase 4 wraps and tried then as the instruction given and it was a waste of my money. I didn&#x27;t lose any inches off my waits or my stomach.  People who lost inches that I knew,  had cut back on the food intake at the time they were using the wrap and that would explain why you could lost inches or even any pounds. Don&#x27;t waist your money, like I did.</li>
            <li> The title explains it ALL. I have purchased from Amazon, then TWICE from a coworker (total of 12 wraps). I know, call me a sucker, but I was supporting a coworker the second time I purchased them. I fell for the trolling comments on how you should buy them from a REAL distributor, these could be fake, they DO WORK! and bla blah...NO results from either box. And yes, they were identical applicators. Save yourself the money, seriously. Anytime someone offers you the opportunity to sell a item your trying to buy should let you know its all about making the almighty dollar, not an almighty miracle product. You&#x27;re better off following diet and SIMPLE exercise plan.Oh and save your saran wrap for dinner :)</li>
            <li> This did not work for me and I drank so much water. I was looking for an expiration date on it because maybe it was expired, I don&#x27;t know but it just did not work.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product just because of the hype about the product did not match with the progress I&#x27;ve seen. I felt like I wasted money and I can obviously not get it back. I did not lose inches but I guess everybody results are different!</li>
            <li> I try this cause saw a lot of before and after picture of a lot of people. I didn&#x27;t saw any loss of inches at all the only thing i saw change it was the stretch mark that they fade a little bit but that was it. I was very disappointed</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL! Wraps sold online are often more expensive than buying from a distributor and can be old and dried out. They only have a year shelf life. Plus you need to get the do&#x27;s and dont&#x27;s of wrapping in order to use them properly to get the right results. I just had a girl who didn&#x27;t follow the instructions and basically wasted $59 on her box of wraps. And yes she paid $59 for a box of four wraps.</li>
            <li> I really dont like giving neg.reviews if I dont like a product I still try and find some positive in it, BUT THIS PRODUCT FOR 80$ was soooo not worth it,it didnt stick to my body,the lotion was just no good and the material was cheap cloth......this was unexceptable, and amazon needs to reconsider having this on there market!</li>
            <li> Started to use it just because my daughter was is getting married and used it for three months I lost total of 14 pounds I&#x27;m going to keep using it  the pack of four loved it it works</li>
            <li> I am a mother of 2 kids i am 22 years old.&lt;br /&gt;I have been eating right and doing as much as i can to lose weight&lt;br /&gt;But this so cold &amp;#34;IT WORKS&amp;#34; did not work at all for me.&lt;br /&gt;I used all 4 wraps in 2 months and nothing!&lt;br /&gt;If you ask me i say do not get this it dose not work just another way for other ppl&lt;br /&gt;to make money.&lt;br /&gt;$100 for something that dose not work.&lt;br /&gt;get a gym mambership that &amp;#34;WORKS&amp;#34; LOL</li>
            <li> My wife was talked into this product a few weeks ago, she tried it and it literally made her sick. Not that she needs the crap anyway but she has a friend and tried it as a favor. Well not only did she became sick since some of the ingredients suck all the essential body fluids (or at least reduce them) it also is way overprized for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;And if it works, would the sales woman not be on the thinner side? All I could see where some oversized, pushy folks.&lt;br /&gt;You know what really works? It less, work out and follow a healthy lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from those Crap Wraps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, seems like another pyramid sales practice</li>
            <li> I have amazing results on this product,&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;It works&#x27; thank u soo much. I love it I&#x27;m  Lost  4 inches the first time.</li>
            <li> I got these hoping to see some good results. The only thing I noticed is that it lightened up my stretch marks. I bought the 4 pack, used them once a week and was kinda bummed that it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;tighten&amp;#34; my tummy flab at all.</li>
            <li> It did not do much for me. I did not see a difference. I will not be Purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all very disappointed. I did a lot of research and saw videos I did not see ANY results</li>
            <li> I bought these to test them out...I had heard and seen a lot of good things about the wraps but wanted to be able to test more than just one out without being committed to buying more from a consultant. After the first wrap my belly was a pinkish shade and warm for a couple hours after I took it off. I noticed results right away though, I could see that my belly was tighter and flatter. But why stood our most to me is how great it made my scar look. I have a medium sized scar on my belly button as a result from a accident while working on a car...needless to say it was rather noticeable being a dark purple grey tone. After the full treatment of wraps(4 wraps) it is hardly noticeable at all! I now feel comfortable to buy wraps from a consultant.</li>
            <li> Really does help to tone and tighten up! I saw results by the second wrap, as soon as I removed it!</li>
            <li> It definitely did not work as expected. I lost no inches and my cellulite is the same as before the wraps. Too good to be true wins again. Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Way too expensive for not very good results. Maybe if it was cheaper. Doesn&#x27;t work good at all. Barely lost anything.</li>
            <li> My friend sent me a link regarding this product and tried it i saw some results where my tummy did look smaller. A little too expensive to keep buying. It was fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I lost several inches using the body wraps. However, if you don&#x27;t use them correctly the wraps will not be effective. First of all you have to drink lots of water it helps keep you hydrated and gets the toxins out of your body. Secondly, before applying the wrap, I use witch hazel in the area where I am applying the wrap. Witch hazel opens up the pores and allows for the product to get into your system. When you wrap the most benefit is going to come from using a full treatment which is 4 wraps. The first time I wrapped I didn&#x27;t see any results, I was at a wrap party drinking wine and eating nachos... so there you go. I did three more wraps and followed the protocal and lost several inches. People need to remember that the wraps tighten and firm but its supposed to go along with healthy eating and exercise. The reason I give the product 4 stars and not 5 is because I wished the results lasted longer. I am not a distributor but I thought it was a great product.</li>
            <li> Real review from real people, I honestly looked at review before purchasing. I signed up (stupidily) and now cant get my money back. Straight to the points girls boys do not waste your time, do not waste your money. I tried for a whole month, i saw nothing. I measure myself follow all step and still nothing. I excerise and drink plently of water, watch ehat i eat and still nothing. Please listen and do not buy.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of time and money. I would not recommend this to anyone unless I dislike them. Go to the gym instead.</li>
            <li> This product really works, i would have never believed it unti i tried it for myself..love it. if you need a few inches off try it youll be amazed..</li>
            <li> I was extremely hopeful that this product would work but was greatly disappointed when it fell short.  I took my chances after seeing picture after picture on Instagram and got motivated to give it a try.  I followed instructions to the T! Even took advice from others who claim to have lost well over 5 inches from their waist in a matter of a couple of sessions.  Ladies do not waste your money, I learned hard work and exercise is the only way to go, there is no magic pill or in this case wrap.  Thumbs down to this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product looked and smelled old I used only one.  I threw them out and ordered from It Works website.</li>
            <li> Didnt work for me. I said ev on the manual drink a lot of water bla bla and no improvments.</li>
            <li> I have tried this and it works for me.  I am very pleased with this product, I think if you tried it you may see the same results.</li>
            <li> For the price that I paid. It works short term and was what I expected. I would definitely order them again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make much of a difference for me. Yes I noticed a slight change but it didn&#x27;t last for long not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this product, but I was leaving for vacation and wanted a quick fix to help nudge my body into slightly better shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before- be realistic.  Don&#x27;t expect to eat poorly and watch TV all day and maintain your results.  I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3\\&quot; and had lost 10 pounds with eating properly and exercising daily.  I was hovering around 120 when I did my first wrap.  The area is large and you can cut the wrap if you want to cover a smaller area than your abs.  It seems flimsy at first, but is actually very durable.  It stays put, but I put on a very fitted tank top to hold it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During- The feeling is very tingly, like Icy Hot, but not as intense.  I have sensitive skin and I was fine with it.  It&#x27;s kind of soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After- I took off the wrap and noticed an immediate difference.  Although I&#x27;m thin, I still had a slight cellulite-y appearance on my stomach.  It was gone.  My skin was very firm and I even lost a line on my lower abs that always drove me inside...It&#x27;s just a crease from having fat there. There was still cream left on my skin so I rubbed it in and put the tank top back on.  I&#x27;ve already lost an inch in the past 7 hours and I can feel myself shrinking more!  I always drink a lot of water and will continue to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall- This is a great final step to weight loss.  Even if I didn&#x27;t lose an inch, I&#x27;d still be happy with how smooth and firm my skin feels.  I would highly recommend this to anyone undergoing weight loss surgery so the skin can start firming up now.  I will write a follow-up review after 72 hours..</li>
            <li> ordered this product about a month ago an never received it, be careful because i honestly think this stuff is a scam, i exercise and workout daily and i wanted to see what all the hype was about. look, results should never be instant but if you would like to save some money and just be patient i have a solution for a tighter tummy, diet and exercise</li>
            <li> I only gave it one star- because it wouldn&#x27;t except my comment with none - I have relatives and friends that sell this product..and had encouraged me to try it (they hoped I&#x27;d want to sell it, as I am a busy hairstylist in a very popular Salon/Spa)  And they told me the longer you leave it on..the better.  Well at the \\&quot;wrap party\\&quot; I went to..I had it applied to my chin/neck area..With no results...nothing.  But, others kept saying how great it was..so I  thought I&#x27;d give it another try...and signed up for a 3 month package plan. (Stupid me)  Once I got the first package..I applied the wrap to my stomach area late in the evening.  Fell asleep with it on..but wasn&#x27;t concerned..as I had heard a few of them..tell clients to leave it on a long time..even overnight, that it would work better.  Woke in the morning..removed it..the entire outline of the wrap was quite red.  Showered and started my day..drank the water as told to, through out the day.  Well by day 2 I knew something was very wrong.  Lets just say I ended up with cellulitis... very painful..itchy..stomach turned rock hard..was not pretty.  When I told the sales person about it....that maybe I had a allergic reaction..she disagreed..because I didn&#x27;t break out on my neck...ok ..then I got a \\&quot;bad wrap\\&quot;.  She would not conseed..  And when I asked to cancel..as I certainly didn&#x27;t plan to subject myself to anymore pain..they charged me a fee to cancel. Are you kidding???  First off, I had bought a package at $129.50 for 4 wraps..which I only ever used the 1.  And then I had to pay a fee to cancel future orders (they had my charge card number)  But because I didn&#x27;t go to a DR and get a \\&quot;note\\&quot; that&#x27;s the way is was. I took pictures..and I had saw a nurse friend and she looked at it and told me how to deal with it and that if it didn&#x27;t get better in a few days..to see a doctor.  It took a week to go away..but it did finally.  I think this is a dangerous product..please be very careful!!</li>
            <li> What a scam total crap!!</li>
            <li> I bought this item from an actual distributor that came to my house. I was skeptical that it would do anything, but I was curious. I lost at the most 1/2 inch on my first wrap. Then a year later (last week) I won a free wrap from a distributor so I thought I would try it again. I did not lose anything. I am of average size with some extra fat on my tummy from kids. I drank tons of water like I was supposed to, eat decently and still did not lose these. There is no magic in these. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Good seller, fast delivery.  I did the whole treatment plan every 72 hours and used the cream in between.  I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference other than softer skin.</li>
            <li> Looked old, package that contained wraps was open when I received it. Waste of money, very disappointed with purchase. Will not buy again</li>
            <li> Rip off and waste of money and time. I was extremely disappointed when I saw no results from this product.</li>
            <li> After seeing all the before and afters on the distributors site, I decided to give it a try. I followed instructions to a t. I drank about 90 ounces of water. I did all four wraps, 72 hours apart.&lt;br /&gt;I did not lose one inch!&lt;br /&gt;I asked my distributor and she said they don&#x27;t guarantee results and it isn&#x27;t for weight lose, just to firm and tighten.&lt;br /&gt;Well, if you skin is firmer and tighter-you will lose inches.&lt;br /&gt;This product is a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it contains BHT a substance banned in most other countries.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product and was able to see a difference within the first application! Easy to follow directions and will use again if needed!</li>
            <li> Used the product to help me lose weight/inches before my granddaughters wedding Lost 1 1/2in around my midsection and stomach area. My husband helped me measure a d wrap with plastic He said &amp;#34; I wouldn&#x27;t have believe it if I hadn&#x27;t seen it with my own eyes&amp;#34; Very satisfied bought multi-pack Will use it again thanks MARY Morris</li>
            <li> I did the entire treatment in the same spot. First wrap for 45 minutes then the rest overnight for approximately 8 hours, I drank 100oz minimum of water a day, ate healthy and exercised lightly also, I did measurements daily and pictures every 72 hours. Nothing changed. I wanted this to work so bad, but I am disappointed and 100 dollars poorer.</li>
            <li> I am 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; 145 lbs and wanted to try to lose my belly fat this winter while busy with fulltime school and work.  All this did for me was cause me to run to the bathroom at the worst times possible and made my stomach make crazy noises.  These symptoms usually didn&#x27;t happen until the next day.  Smoothie cleanses and a workout routine have been the best for me over this.</li>
            <li> Did exactly what I needed it to do. Took an inch off my waist in a short amount of time. Did not stay off permanently, but I already knew that before I used this product.</li>
            <li> The pictures I have seen were not very accurate for me anyway and my stomach is not that big at all but there was no difference.</li>
            <li> I got this product through here because I didn&#x27;t want to become a royal customer or pay retail price without trying it first. I followed all the instructions from other &amp;#34;it works&amp;#34; sites and I&#x27;m an active person, but didn&#x27;t see any results. So yes it does not work for everyone.</li>
            <li> It works somewhat these things are pretty cool if u drink the right amount if water you will see results</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve tried these wraps 2 other times and been happy with the results. I ordered this box because it was a low price, much lower than getting it directly from It Works! Nothing happened each time I tried all 4 wraps. Yes, I drank the recommended amount of water, wrapped it securely with saran wrap, rubbed in the extra lotion, and used the right kind of body wash. Measured after 72 hours and still nothing lost. The only thing I can figure out is they are cheaper because they are expired and therefore not as effective. The wraps I got directly from It Works! had an expiration date, but on these wraps from Amazon, the expiration date was left blank. I am disappointed so maybe I&#x27;ll stick with getting them directly from It Works! next time, when I have enough money!</li>
            <li> Used on a regular basis, this product will help you control the shape of your body and your mind!  You will feel better about yourself and you will feel better!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if i would ever buy this again. I didn&#x27;t really see much of difference besides my skin feeling a little softer.</li>
            <li> This product temporarily tightens the skins, making you feel like it&#x27;s working.  Feeling went away after a couple of days.  Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> i\\&quot;m a sucker and I had read the reviews and most of the people said it didn&#x27;t work.  But I thought maybe it will.  So I tried it and nothing happened but some tingling on the skin.  oh well.  I&#x27;ve just tried everything to loose this baby weight and nothing works.  Not even this.</li>
            <li> Lol, don&#x27;t even was your time. This does nothing to you. It just gets cold on your skin (it feels like a piece of transparent plastic with white toothpaste on it). They promise results, but now that I think about it, where&#x27;s the logic??</li>
            <li> This product ACTUALLY works! You can&#x27;t beat this price they are normally 25 for 1. I didn&#x27;t use it they way they told you too.. I used the first one then waited 72 hours and did the second. I waited one week for the third and one week again for the 4th. I saw a total of 7.5 inches gone! I had a c-section two years ago and was still holding a lot of excess skin, this worked great!  Recommend wrapping saran warp around it to keep it tight and secure to get the best and most use for them!</li>
            <li> Alright so i am a 45yr female (perimenopausal)and as i age i need something that keeps me from getting a fat stomach (which typically creeps on us women as our hormones decline). I have been using  \\&quot;It works\\&quot; body applicators for over a year now. I have tried the other ones in the green packaging i think they are called Body Works applicators. Well these work WAY better! i have purchased the IT WORKS applicators from ebay and then also from amazon (i want to always try and get the best price, they always come in good condition and are perfectly fine and acceptable for use and fall within the expiration date). It had been a few months since i used them and my belly was getting fat again, (the last applicators i used and i didn&#x27;t even finish the 4 pack was the green body works applicators which do not work nearly as well. my pouch starts at my belly button and ends just above my pubic hairline (yes i had one child 20+ years ago and can never lose this fat).&lt;br /&gt;So! i did one application Sunday night 3/9/14 and Monday afternoon 3/10/14; i noticed a difference by Tuesday (today) 3/11/14 i continued to notice a reduction in my belly fat.  I don&#x27;t measure anymore because i always get results so it wasn&#x27;t necessary for me as proof.&lt;br /&gt;Say what you will, be a skeptic you can believe it or not, but these things work. You must be realistic people; I&#x27;m guessing that if you have a BIG belly you might not be satisfied, because it will take you longer to see results (youtube it, there are many testimonials regarding these applicators, how it works...etc) you&#x27;d probably get more results from eating a diet with minimal sugar and carbs, eating mostly protein/veg/ and fruit.  If you are working with a little gut, little pooch...etc, something medium to small and you need something to get your stomach flat or  from getting bigger; you want to use these.&lt;br /&gt;Here is what i do: (before bed)&lt;br /&gt;1. take a shower dry off and skin brush my whole stomach area, enough to get the blood circulating and get the area warm&lt;br /&gt;2. apply the applicator and wrap with saran wrap (all the way around your waste, this holds it in place over night)&lt;br /&gt;3. sleep with the applicator on ALL night (if you want good results this is a must)&lt;br /&gt;4. next morning take the applicator and cling wrap off and rub in the remaining stuff on your skin (do not shower or wash it off.  I know it&#x27;s a little sticky and weird feeling but just dress down a little that day if you wear nice clothes to work etc.)&lt;br /&gt;5. drink lots of water for the next 3 days.  i drink about 90oz of water each day&lt;br /&gt;6. that&#x27;s it, don&#x27;t be discouraged if you are not amazed the morning after your first applicator, you will continue to get results.&lt;br /&gt;7. i wait 5 days then do another applicator.&lt;br /&gt;8. I touch up with these applicators every 3 months, this keeps my stomach nice and flat.  (i will do this 3 times and then wait a few months and then do it again.) You can develop your own schedule but i use them for maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All i know is that when i&#x27;m around other 45 year old ladies (AND i&#x27;m a grandmother at that) they have the big belly and i do not! (they actually ask me how do i get my stomach so flat, i used to tell people my tricks and tips that i use to stay young and healthy looking but they either don&#x27;t listen or think it&#x27;s so silly so i stopped telling people and enjoy when they notice how good i look as i age and feel sorry for them) I can&#x27;t stop the aging process but i sure can stop &#x27;how&#x27; i age. (side note: i also use bioidentical hormones on my skin, along with a host of necessary vitamins and supplements so i continue to stay young and healthy and vibrant.) Do your research online don&#x27;t just sit back and accept the aging process, age gracefully and keep your youthful appearance by taking care of your skin, eat healthy, exercise and keep the weight down.&lt;br /&gt;(items for research if you are interested: skin: use Vit D oil and Emu oil // hormones: use natural bio-identicalhormones from a compound pharmacy, have ALL of your hormones tested (estrogen/testoserone/progesterone) // overall health: MSM, glucosimine, chondroitan, DIM, Alpha lipoic acid,silica, biotin, krill oil, wheat grass....etc  /// Antioxidants: consume mass quantities of these particularly Glutathione, astaxanthin, Vit C, Vit D...etc, can&#x27;t stress this enough!! this is the key to keeping your body young and healthy as it ages and also hormones. Thyroid; get it checked...thoroughly and make adjustments where needed.  Do your research and take supplements daily, figure out what works for you or see a natural dr and get tested on all of the vitamins and supplements for accurate dosaging.  It takes effort to achieve whatever you want in life, part of what we want in life should be to take good care of our health and bodies.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a quick fix to your weight issues you&#x27;ll probably be disappointed BUT if you are working toward a better you and don&#x27;t mind putting in the work to get results, the subtle but continual changes from using these will help you in this process and make you feel really good about creating a better you. Good health to you all.</li>
            <li> Save your $$$ Did nothing! Used entire box and didn&#x27;t notice a thing.</li>
            <li> I followed the intructions and I even bought the defining gel. I used all four wraps.  Not one single difference.&lt;br /&gt;It was messy and smelled minty. I got more results from just going to the gym and drinking a lot of water during the day.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re all looking fo something to give us a little help but this, this is not it!</li>
            <li> I purchased and used it exactly how the instructions said, but it did not work at all. I only drink water and I eat healthy and workout to start with so I thought this would help me with the stubborn places that I can not get. But it didn&#x27;t. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have some extra skin and stretch marks on my stomach as well as my arms so I purchased this to see what it could do. My arm skin seemed to get tighter, but I tried three wraps on my stomach over three weeks and after 4 weeks everything looks the same as it did before.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still trying to figure out if this is a scam, and I&#x27;m going to lower my body fat a bit more before I try one more time. I figure if one more pack doesn&#x27;t do anything at all, it&#x27;s a pure scam and I&#x27;ll learn my leaks  from being part of it.</li>
            <li> Itworks! Body applicator is almost like magic. After having a son and dealing with post baby body I decided to give these a shot. It smelled amazing, felt amazing. Natural things...things that come from our earth, do amazing things for your inside &amp; outside. You won&#x27;t know until you try the things! I order mine from [...] for me it&#x27;s better to go through a distributer that way you can email them or text them with questions you have.</li>
            <li> CRAP!!!! CRAP!!!!! CRAP!!!!!! Don&#x27;t fall for it... It did NOTHING for me....! I saw NO difference what so ever....Don&#x27;t WASTE your money....</li>
            <li> It did not works as promised.  It had NO effect on my skin.  I would not recommend this to anyone else.</li>
            <li> I could not tell i did anything while using this item, i would not buy it again. sorry but just not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical to try these, especially after using the first one and noticing almost no results, but after the 2nd and now third wrap, im really starting to notice a difference.  I&#x27;m pretty thin overall, but my stomach is a disaster after having my second child 6 months ago.  The wraps have really helped with the saggy skin I have left around and under my belly button area, and has had an overall smoothing effect.  I still have 2 wraps left and hopefully will continue to see improved results.</li>
            <li> My daughter used this twice and there were clearly visible results that have lasted.  I am definitely going to try this myself.</li>
            <li> Perfect Just what i was looking for and great service.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed. Horrible product. Never again. It&#x27;s simply not forever one. Waste of money and time. Sorry. Not sorry.</li>
            <li> Im still fat.  I don&#x27;t know what went wrong. I used these and I lost no weight.  I really love food.</li>
            <li> Slightly dried up when I received it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. For almost $100, it&#x27;s not worth it. It does do some detoxing, but that is ALL.</li>
            <li> i seen NO results at all --save your money.&lt;br /&gt;tried on abs and thighs and did nothing to either area.</li>
            <li> This product works great. It may not be a complete fix for extra skin but it&#x27;s great for stretch marks.</li>
            <li> The actual patches seemed to be old but I was assured to get my money back or receive a new fresh replacement. Good Customer service!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything except cause me pretty major discomfort.</li>
            <li> I have not seen a difference</li>
            <li> I ordered the box of four wraps and decided to wrap two on each thigh over a 72 hour period. I did order them directly through an ItWorks distributor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me preface that I&#x27;m a relatively healthy person prior to trying the wraps out.  I wear a fitbit to keep track of my daily activity level, caloric intake, and water intake (on average 12-14K steps a day, 20 stair flights, plus 30 minutes of calisthenic training designed by my trainer I see once a week.  That&#x27;s my activity for five days a week.)  I also eat a 95% vegan diet and drink on average about 115oz of water a day for my weight of 153 lbs.  I thought I&#x27;d give them a try since I&#x27;m having a harder time getting the fat burned off my thighs or that pesky chub rub (it&#x27;s coming off slowly but surely but I wanted to try to speed things up.)  Sorry for all the detail, just wanted to back up my claims a lil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These wraps did not work for me and I have the lifestyle you&#x27;re supposed to have for them to work.  It makes me sad to say it because I love how much friends I have love and believe in them and how they have worked for them (I&#x27;ve only seen photo evidence, not in person evidence because my friends that use them live out of state.)  I followed the directions to a T (hot shower, even scrubbed my skin with a skin brush before hand, left them on well over 2 hours.)  I drank all the water, ate right, avoided alcohol, I exercise (but not while wrapped.)  I took measurements and photos and there has been zero change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What they did do was give me a couple of nice days of soft smooth skin (but my skin is relatively soft and smooth to begin with from all the water I drink.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do, however, like a lot of the other ItWorks products (defining gel, greens, etc) just can&#x27;t recommend the wraps.  You&#x27;re better off the old fashioned way, eat your veggies and fruit, and limit everything else and get a lil exercise.</li>
            <li> It does work and there is a strict policy that these products cannot be sold other than the original company site! So I&#x27;m taking my time to report every single item here! These could be old stuff that not so great distributors bought and sat on for a while and are trying to make a quick money back by selling here... BUYER BEWARE!!!! Buy form original sites!!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on wraps from Amazon or eBay. These wraps are a first to market product from It Works and should only be bought through Independent Distributors to ensure you are getting a good, reliable product.  There is no guarantee in the wraps you purchase otherwise and more than likely are expired wraps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not purchased through an Independent Distributor then you are missing out on wholesale pricing, free products, and free shipping, as well as customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you are not following the instructions and advice of a Distributor (like how much water to drink, how often to wrap, diet, exercise, avoiding toxins) then you are more than likely not going to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in trying the wraps or any other It Works products, I would be more than happy to help customize a plan to fit your exact health and wellness needs.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much if anything at all</li>
            <li> great product and came in sooner than expected !</li>
            <li> Its Works, really works!!! I&#x27;ve heard about this product and company for a few years, being pregnant 2x in the last 2 years I couldn&#x27;t try it. So gave it a shot, had it on for 3 hrs, drank lots of water...as I usually do anyways. Took it off after 3 hours, noticed a little bit....kept drinking....as told....noticed that it was working....after day 1 and 2, could tell a difference. After 72 hours my skin was softer, and a lot of my skin in front had thinned out. Yes it works, will it for everyone...NO. People need to realize that, it won&#x27;t make your tummy flat in 45 mins....its different for everyone. Drink water during and 72 hours after and you will see a difference ;)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work don&#x27;t waste your money&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not even a big person&lt;br /&gt;I was simply looking to see if it worked so I can get a bit toned and I think it works for like a day then it&#x27;s over no more tightness after that&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pricey and it doesn&#x27;t work they should really change their slogan!</li>
            <li> I used all 4 wraps and saw no change 😔 I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles but I was hoping for something.</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t work for me I&#x27;m not happy at all never again !!!</li>
            <li> This product really does work!  I lost 4 inches around my waist with the first wrap.  I will continue to use them to loose more.</li>
            <li> I love these wraps! They work really well. I have lost between 2-4 inches with each one. I haven&#x27;t stopped eating the way I normally do, and they still work! I have applied the gel only a few times, but I already like it. The results have lasted for months. You really lose nothing by trying out this product. LOVE IT. I did sign up for the loyal customer deal with my rep and I am so excited!</li>
            <li> I used it according to the instructions and it did not work for me. I used all 4 applicators took pictures and no change</li>
            <li> The ultimate body applicator package was on time and it was in great shape.. Now I just hopes it will work</li>
            <li> i bought the four pack only used one but it really works, i bought from this seller before i only bought 2 then those worked as well, im just waiting to use the other 3 idk what for but im gonna use them asap! shipping was great, came fast and the seller respoond to email fast.. i would recommend buying fron natural way!</li>

            <li> I feel like this was a waste of money. I saw no results that i was expecting after 3 uses. I drank plenty of water, ate a healthy diet, and exercised. No inches lost where I used the wrap. I have one more  to use. The only thing I liked was how smooth my skin felt 24 hours after the wrap.</li>
            <li> Biggest crock of poo I&#x27;ve ever heard in my life. It stinks,messy and just one big pain in the butt. Wasted way to much money on this</li>
            <li> Just another fitness gimmick. Hit the gym and watch what you  eat. Save the money and wrap yourself in cellophane.</li>
            <li> All this did was make my skin soft where applied. No inch loss. It&#x27;s kind of messy and smells weird.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of $ $. Not an ounce of results. Complete gimmick. Saw no results after 2 boxes 8 wraps</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work at all. It irritates the skin. I didn&#x27;t like it. I saw absolutely no results. I followed the instructions properly.</li>
            <li> It really does work....my wife had 2 c sections and had a flab of skin with no muscle tone and surgery was so costly then we found about the wraps.  My wife had 4 wraps and sleep over night with them and wow amazing.&lt;br /&gt;It really does work....my wife had 2 c sections and had a flab of skin with no muscle tone and surgery was so costly then we found about the wraps.  My wife had 4 wraps and sleep over night with them and wow amazing.  See results for yourself...check out wrapitwithreyes.com. i ordered from there as well as amazon and there loyalty program is better.</li>
            <li> It worked! Slimmed my waist and reduced the visibility of my stretchmarks just in time for vacation.  Used 3 wraps, and even though I didn&#x27;t take measurements, I felt less jiggley and fit into my swimsuit with confidence! Doesn&#x27;t last forever, but will deffinentally buy again.</li>
            <li> Will order more for better results. Have lost several inches around my waist. Will order more product in the future&lt;br /&gt;So I can continue to see results.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.  No results at all.  I did everything that it told me to do.  I was Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hi there I just thought I would write a quick review for these wraps.  First off I want to say be careful about buying off of Amazon. Distributors are not supposed to sell on sites like these. You are not guarenteed freshness of product. And you have no idea how long these have been sitting in someones house.  Now Saying that  I DID try these wraps!!  I was skeptical at first. because I read so many mixed reviews. But I decided to try for myself and see what happens. Well I am HAPPY to say after 4 wraps I am DOWN 6 inches!! I am soo happy. soo Happy that I decided to sell these myself! My Family and friends are NUTS for these wraps!  The results we have seen are incredible! If you follow the instructions you will see results! These wraps help detox your system! I am thrilled! Side note, If anyone is looking to make some extra cash, This business is GREAT for that! Everyone wants to try these! When you try them yourself, your friends and family see and want to try too! Why not sign up to be a distributor and make some money your self! that is what I did! First month in I am getting a $500 commission check and $300 in bonus&#x27;s!!  I love this company!  If you want more info on this, or would like to join my team and MAKE $$$MONEY$$!!  Email me!  DurkaNaturals@hotmail.ca&lt;br /&gt;oh yes and remember ONE wrap is sample and FOUR wraps is a treatment! :D I definitely recommend trying these! What have you got to lose?!&lt;br /&gt;~Olivia ~</li>
            <li> This product made me ill, like literally I do not feel that there is enough health information provided about this product, but the service provider did deliver the product within the designated time.</li>
            <li> I have several friends who have bought this and their results are great. I bought it and.....NOTHING...pure waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Just to let you know this product of the wraps is not entirely meant to lose the weight/pounds, it is more focused on tightening, firming and toning. so it is meant for improving your skin or maintaining what you already have. With the elasticity in your skin breaking down as we age this will help tighten it back up which will cause you to lose the inches not the pounds. Only exercising can help you lose the pounds. Image exercising and doing the wraps, you would be ripped! :) And this product is also meant for the situations of stretch marks, cellulite, or that pouch from pregnacy that just wont go away even exersicing on a regular basis because that skin has been strectch so much. So don&#x27;t bother hopping on that scale unless your exercising to see the pounds melt away ;) also drinking a lot of water is very important with this because it is detoxing your body. Product really does WORK! I would highly recommend buying from a distributed anyways not from this site because you will be get the real deal any these products here could be old/expired and not get your full effects. The it works company itself is not supported for this site because it is against their policy to. The prices would also be more reasonable and have bonuses for you when you order under a distributor (that is straight from the source), as I am myself why I know this product so well and what it will do for your body. Where to order these products from is tinarosadoswraps.myitworks.com and you will get affordable prices and deals in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;Any more questions about these products check this site out instead for more info. Hope this helped you ;)</li>
            <li> What your distributor won&#x27;t tell you is that this product has LOADS of crap in it.  One thing specifically is a diuretic, which causes MAJOR dehydration.  That&#x27;s why your distributor tells you to drink so much darn water.  I used the first wrap for only 45 minutes.  Then drank tons of water.  The following day I had massive diarrhea, racing heartbeat, dizziness, nausea.....all beginning signs of dehydration.  I contacted the distributor and she apologized, but had no idea what was causing it.  I told her I had researched online and there is a diuretic in the wrap.  She said there was NOT.  She said it was possibly the flu.  No way!!  You don&#x27;t get racing heartbeat from the flu.  I swear I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital.  Then she got back to me later and said, \\&quot;well, its the toxins leaving your body.\\&quot;  So, yes, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve lost some inches, but it&#x27;s ALL from diarrhea and fluid loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a reason this product has not been approved by the FDA.  I&#x27;m surprised these things haven&#x27;t killed someone from dehydration yet.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and just wrap yourself with saran wrap and cellulite cream!!!!  This product is garbage.</li>
            <li> With three wraps i have lost a total if 6 inches off my arms ! which is a miracle. I have been going to gym for months with a trainer and only lost .5 in off my arms. So thus wrap does work miracles. You just need to put it on the right way and you&#x27;re good to go</li>
            <li> Beware of the discount you receive by becoming a &amp;#34;member&amp;#34; when buying direct. My rep said I only had to buy for 1 month and it&#x27;s actually 3 purchases total. When I called customer service they wouldn&#x27;t budge even tho she misquoted me. Wraps work well as long as you continue to use them once a week. Just not happy with the customer service I received</li>
            <li> What in sam hell did I waste my money on? I knew this was a gimmick, but I let myself be suckered in anyway. Lesson learned. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS. IT DOES NOTHING.</li>
            <li> Really, I deserve a one star review for being stupid enough to think it might work. That&#x27;s the thing about medical science, if something like this was proven to work you would see it at your doctors office not as a product with bad reviews on Amazon. I used all four as directed. I work out and eat clean. No difference at all. I should have donated $100 to charity instead of just throwing it away.</li>
            <li> I really havent used the product but done exstensive research, and they come off as a very shady company. Reading and researching them all over the Internet not too impressed with how the companies policies operate, the attitudes and lack of respect the employees have for their customers. Seemed like a great idea/concept but for the low quality customer service others have received for a product that a huge percentage have honestly reported doesn&#x27;t work, might as well save the money, find a better company, or make your own. Weird activity on their YouTube and on other websites where they verbally berate  and abuse customers who spill the truth. Highly recommend further research to those interested in purchasing anything from this shady company. I&#x27;ll skipn out on this one y&#x27;all</li>
            <li> It was great I think this worked a little but you need to keep doing them to get rid of cellulite . they are expensive the wraps came sooner than the usual company that sells them the company that sells them takes about a mont and a half to bring them to you.</li>
            <li> These work really good. I understand this does not take the place of diet exercise but it helps the motivation for quick results.</li>
            <li> This a total waste of money! It does&lt;br /&gt;NOT work. Had such high expectations and was totally disappointed! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li> This product did not work as well as they advertisement. Maybe I did not wrap correctly or maybe I have too much that needs to disappear. I do know a lot of people swear it works and its good.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, it did not work for me at all, was expecting better results.&lt;br /&gt;will not be purchashing this item again.</li>
            <li> I just got off the phone from a customer service representative from It Works.  I had purchased the Ultimate Body Applicator and am a member of the Loyalty Program.  I have never gotten noticeable results from their products, but for some reason, have continued trying them.  A couple days ago, I opened up a box of body applicators, and to my dismay, the product was all dried out - on all four individually wrapped packages!  After calling and talking to customer service, I was very disappointed to learn that they do not offer a money back guarantee on their products - just out of luck, apparently.  I will be cancelling my loyalty membership.</li>
            <li> kinda expensive but works hard to keep in place even with saran wrap but you can feel it working right away</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know. I read the review before I bought this, so I decided to pay the money. Needless to say I wasn&#x27;t that impressed.</li>
            <li> I order the product from the It Works Global website, not Amazon, and received my body wraps yesterday. It took about 4 days to arrive from date of purchase. So shipping was not an issue. The 4-pack of body wraps cost me $99 but I figured if it worked then maybe I&#x27;ll become a loyal customer to get the reduced price. With that said, the package did not have an expiration date stamped on the box. When I called customer service several times yesterday, there was no live person only a recorded message that no one is available due to the \\&quot;high volume of calls\\&quot;. For these 2 issues I rate It Works one star. As far as the product is concerned, today is the first day I applied the wrap to my abdomen and saran-wrapped my abdomen to keep the wrap in place. The lotion on the wrap has a slight menthol smell and after 45 minutes, my skin had a pinkish tone. Plus I drank a lot of water during that time, and still am drinking lots of water. I will provide another review of this product after 72 hours just to give this product a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 8, 2013&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my 2nd review 72 hours after the 1st wrap application. The skin on my abs was noticeably smoother &amp; softer, &amp; my clothes fit me more comfortably. Pants were a bit loose around the waist.  I did lose an inch from my waist but there was no weight loss. I figured with all the water I drank that I would have lost 1 or 2 lbs after 3 days (since water filled my stomach &amp; curbed my appetite). I have 3 more wraps left to go. I will write another review once I complete the entire package. I did not use any It Works supplements or defining gel. So I cannot comment if that would have caused or could cause significant inch or even weight loss. One It Works wraps did work for me. Just remember, everyone&#x27;s body reacts differently to any weight loss product. I will change my rating once I complete all 4 wraps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 17, 2013&lt;br /&gt;I have used all four wraps and give the product 3 STARS. I have lost a total of 2.5 inches (1 inch after 1st wrap; 0.5 inch for each of the remaining wraps). I went from a size 16/18 to fitting comfortably in a size 14. I&#x27;m hoping to get back down to my original size 8/10... keeping fingers crossed. I may purchase the product again for legs. Good luck to all.(1 inch after 1st wrap; 0.5 inch for each of the remaining wraps). I went from a size 16/18 to fitting comfortably in a size 14. I&#x27;m hoping to get back down to my original size 8/10... keeping fingers crossed. I may purchase the product again for legs. Good luck to all.</li>
            <li> I tried it and kept my fingers crossed. At the end of the day, the only thing that really works is eating healthy and exercising.</li>
            <li> I think this isn&#x27;t the right thing.  It didn&#x27;t work for me.  The other reviews also look fake.  I dont think this is the actual product.</li>
            <li> I did research before I got it... Followed directions and lost a few inches ... Along with my normal diet and work out I am still slimmer and happy I tried it</li>
            <li> I have had tried the wrap over night and I had drunk a lot of water..It doesn&#x27;t work! waist of money!</li>
            <li> I saw a little change, but nothing drastic like some people do. Maybe i should have wrapped tighter! If it was a little cheaper, maybe I&#x27;d try it again</li>
            <li> Lies! People this stuff doesn&#x27;t work! If you&#x27;re looking to lose weight diet &amp; exercise. That&#x27;s the only way you&#x27;ll see real results. This stuff is a big waste of money. If you&#x27;re looking to lose water weight and gain it again once you eat then this is the stuff for you.</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing the 4 pack thinking maybe I wouldn&#x27;t see results right away but wanted to give it a real try do it the right way...&lt;br /&gt;It was a waste of $$$. I&#x27;m not a big girl I weight 140 and just need to lose a little around my belly and this did not help at all. I think short term maybe for a few hours after, but I think you might get the same immediate results if you just wrap yourself with plastic wrap for a while...&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s worked for some people from pictures I&#x27;ve seen but it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.. like me...</li>
            <li> arrive on time, and I would reorder soon!</li>
            <li> Received wraps quickly, shipper contacted me a few times and was very knowledgeable.  Lost 3\\&quot; in 45 minutes after first wrap.  Havent had a chance to finish the box.  Will post updates when I finish the wraps!!</li>
            <li> Its rather expensive. In the salon I can get 4 for $60.00. So once I finish this box I am going back to the salon to get it done. Other then the price it does really work&lt;br /&gt;My stretch marks on my stomach are now smoother and went from red/pink to the same color as my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to lose belly fat for the longest. I love my hips and breast but I was not happy with my mid section. I&#x27;m in my late twenties never has any children and wanted to have a flat stomach not abs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I met a lady that was selling the products and I tried it. It&#x27;s all natural. It feels like icy hot product and she wraps me up with Saran Wrap for an hour. She measured me in my mid section in three different places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is the before measurements&lt;br /&gt;Top: 33&#x27;, middle: 34&#x27;, bottom: 38&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;This is the after with one wrap&lt;br /&gt;Top: 30&#x27; middle: 32&#x27;, bottom: 36&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;So the next day I lost additional 2 inches on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it does work with drinking plenty of water and the results should last for four days and then the next wrap should start. She told me to wrap myself twice a week until you get to your desire waistline....&lt;br /&gt;I am happy and waiting for more wraps to come and I will update you.</li>
            <li> I am not one to break out when using a new lotion or body wash or anything like that but I did with these. I did one wrap, and by the next morning I looked and had  \\&quot;baby acne\\&quot; type red bumps all over the area the wrap was. They wound up going away after 4 days but I did not use the other wraps for fear I would have a full on break out.</li>
            <li> They did not work. At all</li>
            <li> Not a fan, I would advice to just stick to running. It&#x27;s expensive, and I didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> My co-worker hyped this product up so I was willing to try.  She had success as did all of her friends.  She was not a distributor so I trusted her opinion.  I have to say.....after 3 times on my stomach area - I have not noticed any significant change.  I did everything I was supposed to by the book and so far......nothing.  I&#x27;m willing to try one more set of 4 wraps. Afterwards, I will write another review.  But so far, I think it&#x27;s either a fantastic hoax or it only works on certain people for various reasons. Even then, I&#x27;m thoroughly confused why it would work on some but not others. I&#x27;m a marketing person by trade so I&#x27;m almost to the point of saying this company has done an amazing job at marketing a product that is full of caca.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I bought this. I have used 2 of the 4 and it sucks!!!! I wish I could return it!</li>
            <li> They really do work. Ok so my monthly friend can to visit and I was feeling bloated. Decided to give it a try I lost 1.5 lbs of water that I had retained.</li>
            <li> Needed these to fit into a bridesmaid dress, fast!!! They work so well &amp; I love the way they help me to look!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this from the site for $59 plus tax. It did not work and all and the eucalyptus in it was very strong. I lost 0 inches and feel dumb for wasting my money on this. 0 starz if I could.</li>
            <li> I lost one inch around my waist after the first use, but only temporarily.  Tried it again 72 hours later &amp; left it on much longer - no further resulst.  Unfortunately what I did lose was water weight because I ended up with a urinary tract infection from dehydration and had to go to the doctor for antibiotics (I have never had one before in my life &amp; I am 50 years old!!).  Will not try again &amp; would not recommend - expecially for the cost!</li>
            <li> amazingly this product really works!!! i will definitely be getting more in the near future and the price is better than anybody else&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t take before and after measurements... After two wraps, I can see the difference. Product worked well for me. I would purchase again!</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t very happy with these wraps. they weren&#x27;t what I was expecting and I didn&#x27;t see a change in anything.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Seller was very responsive and accomadating!</li>
            <li> Beware of expired products being sold</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice any change.... Spend the money on a gym membership and go to the gym 2x a week... you&#x27;ll notice a better change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure these wraps really work.  I tried the wraps but didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> It works! But don&#x27;t order from amazon, you get much better guarantees if you order through the company first. Also its not a magic solution while you sit there and do nothing! You need to follow the wrap instructions, DRINK LOTS OF WATER, and give it time. It might not work after the first wrap for some of us it takes two or three! Make sure you have a fitness plan so you dont go back to the same old blah and you keep yourself fit. This helps immensely with toning and tightening! I order from: http://www.isabelsfitnessplan.com/</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of good things about this product from reviews online, but when I tried them myself, they didn&#x27;t do a thing. The first time I tried one for 45 mins, I actually gained inches after I took it off. The second time I tried one, nothing happened at all. I did a lot of research on them before hand and was told that while wearing them and the next few days to make sure I in took a lot of water, and I did, and still nothing. When they say it&#x27;s too good to be true, it really is. Save your money! I still have two wraps left. And since I spent the money I will most likely use them up, but I don&#x27;t expect any results and will be wasting my time.</li>
            <li> If you are constaped and need to go NOW! Use a wrap. That&#x27;s about the only thing they are good for. Gareenteed to poop before the 45 mins are up.</li>
            <li> I too really wanted this product to work.  Sadly not so much, I&#x27;m not over weight but thought it might help with cellulite.  I used all four spread out and the best I can say is it was a nice cooling effect, making you think something was going on.  Sometimes you really want to believe there CAN be a quick fix to somethings in life but usually it all comes down to hard work or if enough money surgery...lol.</li>
            <li> I did everything by the book, drank tons of water, ate healthy, slept with it on, showered before I put it on to open my pores, &amp; I kept them on for 6 hours.&lt;br /&gt;It has made NO difference at all. I&#x27;m not heavy at all, I just had a baby 2 weeks ago and was hoping to help my skin on my belly, it didn&#x27;t NOTHING. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I tried these wraps twice and kept them on once for the whole night. I noticed no results at all.</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for a quick fix.....that being said this product does actually work. I used a wrap on my upper arm, waist, and butt/thigh area. I measured and took pictures before and then again 5 days later. I noticed a difference in my pictures in lumps and bumps in my arms and thighs and my waist looked smaller. My measurements changed as follows: Waist-1.5in, Belly button-1in, Love handles-1.5, Hips-3/4in, Thighs-1/4in and 3/4in. I did eat better and work out....I don&#x27;t think this is a permanent fix, but it makes me feel more confident and motivated to go work out more and continue eating better! It will also be useful come summertime and on vacation at the beach!</li>
            <li> did absolutely nothing... used all 4 over course of a month, wrapped properly &amp; with plastic wrap to hold it on, kept on full time, etc.  no results whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Hard to use and didn&#x27;t do anything!</li>
            <li> I tried all for wraps and followed the instructions and 75.00 later I still look the same.  I wish I could get my money back!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase. They work, if you maintain a healthy diet with them. I will be purchasing the wraps again.</li>
            <li> Have wanted to try these out, haven&#x27;t had any dramatic results, but it helps with getting some finer definition on my stomach, works best if you at least bike or walk while wearing it.</li>
            <li> Helped to minimize my stress marks but did not help to tighten my skin or anything else for that matter.</li>
            <li> i tired i was not expecting a miracle but i thought it would work a little better, i even drank the water. i was drinking water constantly the company was nice just not worth the money</li>
            <li> iI know i may sound like a distributor with what i&#x27;m about to say... but i fregging LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;I think one thing people DON&#x27;T get is that you are SUPPOSED TO DRINK WATER once you put the wrap on and for 3 days after that!!!  It makes me soooooo annoyed to see that \\&quot;it didn&#x27;t work\\&quot; ya know why?? probably because you DIDNT DO IT RIGHT!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My coworker is a distributor (yea i know that might make my words less valid) but she forced me to drink water like CONSTANTLY when i was at work (yes, she wrapped me at work ahhaha &#x3D;p) and she kept telling me DRINK WATER DRINK WATER and for the next 3 days as well. i&#x27;m glad i listened to her, because it worked. i cannot EMPHASIZE how important it is to drink water.....  geez people! DRINK WATER for the time u put the wrap on UNTIL THREE DAYS AFTER ughghghhhhhh!</li>
            <li> I wondered how well they worked everyone said great for three days I couldn&#x27;t find anything on the long term which is because they don&#x27;t work, yes I lost an inch over the 3 days but yes it came right back by the end of the 4th day. Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> According to measurement, took off 1/2&amp;#34;. I will continue to use again and again. I have recommended it to other and will again.</li>
