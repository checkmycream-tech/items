            <li>It does go nice over chunky glitter.</li>
            <li>Instead of chipping it kind of like peels off.</li>
            <li>Robin Moses was right, this is one of the best top coats out there.</li>
            <li>Best ingenious idea and truly dries fast like magic!</li>
            <li>This is the best topcoat I have ever used I would recommend it to everyone I wish it was sold closer to where I live</li>
            <li>My manicure has grown out at  the cuticle area and the polish is still in tact and shinny,  Thanks for this wonderful top coat.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff!</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best non UV topcoats I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>the shine is even more awesome in the sun especially.</li>
            <li>maybe one coat top coat wait 10 mins then add another?</li>
            <li>and it now has a really smooth surface and nice shine.</li>
            <li>so I will gladly use it on my toddler.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now my go to top coat</li>
            <li>Love love love this product.</li>
            <li>OK, a friend told me about this stuff</li>
            <li>Seche Top Coat</li>
            <li>because I can&#x27;t take the smell, but I just can&#x27;t bringmyself to spend another $15 on this when I get better result from products that I can pick up at Walgreens.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>This polish is okay.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think its any better than seche vite which is cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Wish I could give 5 stars because I love this line of polish.</li>
            <li>And I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been two years, and I&#x27;ve yet to find a better product.</li>
            <li>I love the product, but also I love the way this company is the way they packing it</li>
            <li>This dries faster and keeps a shine more than others I have used.</li>
            <li>I have had this top coat on my nails for going on 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I could never keep polish on for more than two days before it would chip.  </li>
            <li>Best Top Coat Nail Dry on the market.  </li>
            <li>They wearing power is pretty good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great thing too have for a busy gal.</li>
            <li>The removal was easy.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this and will make this my main top coat from this point forward!</li>
            <li>Drys quickly and leaves gell like top coating</li>
            <li>great product for sealing your nails and making the nail polish last longer.  </li>
            <li>Great shine and protection over regular nail polish.</li>
            <li>The top coat itself is worth it, as is their polish thinner.</li>
            <li>and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>my clients nails still look great a week later.</li>
            <li>my customers have a fit.</li>
            <li>Heck, even the Sephora top coat I picked up at Big Lots allows for a good four or five days.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love that one as much as I wanted to love this one.</li>
            <li>Excellent top coat super fast dry time</li>
            <li>Really fast shipping !!!</li>
            <li>I used the Dazzle Dry Top Coat as the final step in my Gel Nail System instead of the Top Coat that came with my Gel products, and it worked great!!!  </li>
            <li>Quick drying, not too noxious smelling, nails are shiny and strong after application.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>It is also self-leveling and leaves a super glossy, smooth shine.</li>
            <li>love it and fast delivery</li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s as free of as many chemicals as possible</li>
            <li>I love how fast this stuff works</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this,  </li>
            <li>They really should include thinner with each top coat purchase.</li>
            <li>But dont purchase much anymore because I never have usable top coat...</li>
            <li>Finally a fast drying top coat that does what it says.</li>
            <li>Works great with other nail products</li>
            <li>Drys quick.  </li>
            <li>Mind you that I do my own nails, so nail art takes me a bit more time; thus, the drying time for each time was at least 10 minutes, 25 at the most.</li>
            <li>Great top coat, I have only been using this product for 3 weeks, but the nails seem to last longer.</li>
            <li>I used to paint my nails at night with normal top coats and they would be &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; but then I&#x27;d go to bed and wake up with crease marks in my nails since I sleep with my hands under my pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it may end up being a new favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>I do find that it helps to put a fresh coat of their wonderful topcoat over the polish every few days, as it rejuvenates the shine and makes your manicure look like new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a professional nail tech, but do spend a significant amount of time and money on my own nail art.</li>
            <li>Pricey but absolutely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Final result is a manicure that is smooth like glass :)</li>
            <li>Love how easy it is to use dazzle dry.</li>
            <li>Of course I bought it right away.</li>
            <li>This top coat has not extended my wear time at all but the company says you will see the full benefit when using their entire system</li>
            <li>This was recommended by a huge Youtube nail DIY account that I frequently watch.</li>
            <li>First time out to bat, it lifted some color off of my nail.</li>
            <li>(though  avoid hot water for 30 minutes).</li>
            <li>This is the only top coat you&#x27;ll ever</li>
            <li>This would be the first time I&#x27;ve used this product.</li>
            <li>And this is the only top coat I will use.  </li>
            <li>So to spend even more $$ to be able to use remaining top coat is ridiculous!!</li>
            <li>dry quickly with a decent shine and no horrible smell.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about seche vite is that towards the end it gets very gloppy but it works better after you do a design.  </li>
            <li>This top coat wears about as long as seche vite does</li>
            <li>It really wears like a gel polish and amazingly drys in 5 mins...even when used over other brands of polish.  </li>
            <li>Dazzle Dry Top Coat is only another top coat which lasts no longer or resists chipping any more than other brands.  </li>
            <li>It just seems too risky to ruin all my hardwork with a top coat that won&#x27;t seal it in for very long</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it would really dry in 5 minutes</li>
            <li>This top coat applies beautifully and dries hard as a rock in just a few minutes</li>
            <li>But...issue is top coat gets sticky and thick very quickly.</li>
            <li>But, unlike the GEL Top Coat it didn&#x27;t require the Lamp, nor did it leave a sticky residue, it was dry and shiny!  </li>
            <li>Dries unbelievably fast and I&#x27;ve not had it chip ever.</li>
            <li>but this was too much &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; for the money.</li>
            <li>but it really does.</li>
            <li>stays on very well.</li>
            <li>Does it keep nails from turning yellow over light polish and the,sun?</li>
            <li>It really protects the polish and makes the nails much stronger.</li>
            <li>and I topped it off with any other top coats on hand</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t work or have anything excessive to do this would be ok for you!</li>
            <li>but I have high expectations.</li>
            <li>Dries SUPER fast, lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>I have it on my nails over some opi and its wearing nicely a little too nice as I don&#x27;t really like the color I have on at the moment and will only change polish once it has noticably chipped</li>
            <li>Top coat does not last as long as they say the product does.</li>
            <li>I can even put it straight on top of wet polish, allowing me to finish an entire manicure in 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a baby and pretty much gave up on the hope of having painted nails for the next year or so.</li>
            <li>The third time using this product with more nail art, I let the design dry even longer and still a smear and lifting of some color.</li>
            <li>It gives off a nice shine, but it seems to remove your color polish a little, which gets on the brush and back in your bottle.  </li>
            <li>i like dazzle dry top coat because it dry so fast and it makes your nails real shinny and last all week.</li>
            <li>I ruined several natural nails from too long exposure to acetone nail polish remover and too frequent buffing to remove gel polish I put on with a UV or LED light (Sensationail, Gelish).  </li>
            <li>While this top coat dries rock hard within minutes,  it does not hold up.</li>
            <li>The only difference is the cost, which is too much for what  it does/does not do.</li>
            <li>Not only does this topcoat dry quickly, but it forms a chip-resistant finish to your nails.</li>
            <li>It does dry fast, which is a plus -- but for some reason it smears nail designs.  </li>
            <li>I knew it wasn&#x27;t a fast dry like Seche Vite</li>
            <li>Your nails will really be dry and ready to go within minutes.</li>
            <li>I work an office with paper and usually wear of the tips of my polish pretty fast within a week.</li>
            <li>It also got thick in the bottle very quickly.  </li>
            <li>For a while, I considered switching brands because (as a quick-dry product) it got too thick to use, very quickly.</li>
            <li>the last time I was this disappointed in a top coat was when I tried the Julep Freedom Polymere Top Coat.</li>
            <li>Normal polish only stay&#x27;s on my nails for one day, this helped last 2 day&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Six solid minutes later my polish still wasn&#x27;t dry and it seemed to make the layers of color under it tacky even though they were already dried when I applied the top</li>
            <li>It really does dry nail polish quickly but product dries up and becomes unusable when get to the half empty mark.  </li>
            <li>You can change your polish more than once a week if you wish, or if you want a longer-lasting manicure for at least a week, Dazzle Dry will last.</li>
            <li>It is super shiny and does dry in the promised 6 minutes or less, but peels and chips in a day.</li>
            <li>but I regularly use seche vite and this is a hard product to top when used properly I always get 2 weeks use out of it but the dazzle dry chipped after 2-3 days</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold up as long as my old topcoat and that is the one downside.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly (2 min), is cruelty-free/vegan, and doesn&#x27;t have a negative impact on wear time (4 days).</li>

            <li> This was recommended by a huge Youtube nail DIY account that I frequently watch.</li>
            <li> First time out to bat, it lifted some color off of my nail.</li>
            <li> (though  avoid hot water for 30 minutes).</li>
            <li> This is the only top coat you&#x27;ll ever</li>
            <li> This would be the first time I&#x27;ve used this product.</li>
            <li> And this is the only top coat I will use.  </li>
            <li> So to spend even more $$ to be able to use remaining top coat is ridiculous!!</li>
            <li> dry quickly with a decent shine and no horrible smell.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about seche vite is that towards the end it gets very gloppy but it works better after you do a design.  </li>
            <li> This top coat wears about as long as seche vite does</li>
            <li> It really wears like a gel polish and amazingly drys in 5 mins...even when used over other brands of polish.  </li>
            <li> Dazzle Dry Top Coat is only another top coat which lasts no longer or resists chipping any more than other brands.  </li>
            <li> It just seems too risky to ruin all my hardwork with a top coat that won&#x27;t seal it in for very long</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it would really dry in 5 minutes</li>
            <li> This top coat applies beautifully and dries hard as a rock in just a few minutes</li>
            <li> But...issue is top coat gets sticky and thick very quickly.</li>
            <li> But, unlike the GEL Top Coat it didn&#x27;t require the Lamp, nor did it leave a sticky residue, it was dry and shiny!  </li>
            <li> Dries unbelievably fast and I&#x27;ve not had it chip ever.</li>
            <li> but this was too much &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; for the money.</li>
            <li> but it really does.</li>
            <li> stays on very well.</li>
            <li> Does it keep nails from turning yellow over light polish and the,sun?</li>
            <li> It really protects the polish and makes the nails much stronger.</li>
            <li> and I topped it off with any other top coats on hand</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t work or have anything excessive to do this would be ok for you!</li>
            <li> but I have high expectations.</li>
            <li> Dries SUPER fast, lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I have it on my nails over some opi and its wearing nicely a little too nice as I don&#x27;t really like the color I have on at the moment and will only change polish once it has noticably chipped</li>
            <li> Top coat does not last as long as they say the product does.</li>
            <li> I can even put it straight on top of wet polish, allowing me to finish an entire manicure in 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a baby and pretty much gave up on the hope of having painted nails for the next year or so.</li>
            <li> The third time using this product with more nail art, I let the design dry even longer and still a smear and lifting of some color.</li>
            <li> It gives off a nice shine, but it seems to remove your color polish a little, which gets on the brush and back in your bottle.  </li>
            <li> i like dazzle dry top coat because it dry so fast and it makes your nails real shinny and last all week.</li>
            <li> I ruined several natural nails from too long exposure to acetone nail polish remover and too frequent buffing to remove gel polish I put on with a UV or LED light (Sensationail, Gelish).  </li>
            <li> While this top coat dries rock hard within minutes,  it does not hold up.</li>
            <li> The only difference is the cost, which is too much for what  it does/does not do.</li>
            <li> Not only does this topcoat dry quickly, but it forms a chip-resistant finish to your nails.</li>
            <li> It does dry fast, which is a plus -- but for some reason it smears nail designs.  </li>
            <li> I knew it wasn&#x27;t a fast dry like Seche Vite</li>
            <li> Your nails will really be dry and ready to go within minutes.</li>
            <li> I work an office with paper and usually wear of the tips of my polish pretty fast within a week.</li>
            <li> It also got thick in the bottle very quickly.  </li>
            <li> For a while, I considered switching brands because (as a quick-dry product) it got too thick to use, very quickly.</li>
            <li> the last time I was this disappointed in a top coat was when I tried the Julep Freedom Polymere Top Coat.</li>
            <li> Normal polish only stay&#x27;s on my nails for one day, this helped last 2 day&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Six solid minutes later my polish still wasn&#x27;t dry and it seemed to make the layers of color under it tacky even though they were already dried when I applied the top</li>
            <li> It really does dry nail polish quickly but product dries up and becomes unusable when get to the half empty mark.  </li>
            <li> You can change your polish more than once a week if you wish, or if you want a longer-lasting manicure for at least a week, Dazzle Dry will last.</li>
            <li> It is super shiny and does dry in the promised 6 minutes or less, but peels and chips in a day.</li>
            <li> but I regularly use seche vite and this is a hard product to top when used properly I always get 2 weeks use out of it but the dazzle dry chipped after 2-3 days</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold up as long as my old topcoat and that is the one downside.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly (2 min), is cruelty-free/vegan, and doesn&#x27;t have a negative impact on wear time (4 days).</li>
            <li> Thick and super glossy when dry and without the health warnings of Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> I was off from work and did no major cleaning at all</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really does dry the nail in a very short time 3 minutes, you can touch it after about 5, NO WORRIES!</li>
            <li> the only downside it that it&#x27;s not a high gloss finish.</li>
            <li> MAJOR shrinkage the next day and chips within a few days.</li>
            <li> nails dry faster and stay without chips longer.  </li>
            <li> Insta- Dry.</li>
            <li> Dazzle dry tends to sear the design if you apply it too soon</li>
            <li> so I sat and waited for the polish to dry.</li>
            <li> Drys to the touch in 1 min and totally dry in 5 min.</li>
            <li> In 5 minutes you&#x27;re dry.</li>
            <li> but if you do think coats, think 5 minutes to dry, thicker you might want to give it 15.</li>
            <li> their leather look colors,Maybelline&#x27;s Color Show and Express Finish polishes, Revlon Color Stay, Nika K, Wet &amp; Wild, Essence Colour &amp; Go, Klean Colors and a few varieties of Sally Hansen colors and believe me when I tell you, no combination of bases or polishes worked with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Dazzle Dry is advertised as vegan/cruelty-free (hooray!).</li>
            <li> worries with Dazzle Dry!</li>
            <li> Dazzle Dry is the answer!</li>
            <li> polish began to chip less than 2 days later.</li>
            <li> I would never use gel polish again but hate the long drying times for regular polish, which also chips easily as well, especially if you type a lot on a keyboard like I do.</li>
            <li> but I was very annoyed that this stuff is no better than Seche or any Sally Hansen top coat that I have used.</li>
            <li> As far as rock hard....</li>
            <li> I am astounded at how rock hard your natural nail will be with this system.</li>
            <li> but this stuff is way better than opi topcoats and sally Hansen so its not too bad</li>
            <li> This product is a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have it on my toes now over opi pink yet lavender</li>
            <li> I was careful to blot the brush with a paper towel to not turn the remaining product pink.</li>
            <li> It stays liquid in bottle after months, ulnike sec</li>
            <li> Naturally if you put on a really thick coat it will take longer</li>
            <li> However, with Dazzle Dry&#x27;s polish thinner, a single bottle can last me a year, and I do my nails at least every other week.</li>
            <li> Seriously dry in 2 min or less.</li>
            <li> I needed to redo my nails due to chips and shrinkage galore on Saturday but couldn&#x27;t due to my work schedule.</li>
            <li> For the price, I&#x27;ve found other products I prefer.</li>
            <li> Smell is like other polish.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that the lasting &amp;#34;rock hard&amp;#34; finish would be the real deal, but am left disappointed.</li>
            <li> Its costly and not worth it.  </li>
            <li> it does not contain the harsh chemicals of other brands, and it removes in a flash.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been on me for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> about half the bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> It drys crazy fast.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money!!</li>
            <li> dries your polish to a hard finish in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Dries hard as a rock in 6 minutes.</li>
            <li> Nothing chips on my toes for at least 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff with Seche base coat, Revlon Color Stay Gel Smooth base coat, Essie&#x27;s First Base, and even Orly Bonder and none of them made a difference.</li>
            <li> Dried shiny, and glossy!!!  </li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> Yes it is expensive.</li>
            <li> sorry and sad!</li>
            <li> Kinda bad business I think.</li>
            <li> Now, the real disappointment.</li>
            <li> So horrible to use after</li>
            <li> This is the WORST product I have ever purchased.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love it and fast delivery</li>
            <li> ***Update***&lt;br /&gt;Try this over halographic polish the shine is even more awesome in the sun especially. This top coat wears about as long as seche vite does so it may end up being a new favorite of mine. We will see if it ever smears a design then its only reserved for my toes! I have it on my nails over some opi and its wearing nicely a little too nice as I don&#x27;t really like the color I have on at the moment and will only change polish once it has noticably chipped and it&#x27;s been on me for about a week and a half. I cashier 6 days a week for 12 hours a day so this is decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got 2 of em since so many people loved the product but I regularly use seche vite and this is a hard product to top when used properly I always get 2 weeks use out of it but the dazzle dry chipped after 2-3 days and I topped it off with any other top coats on hand but this stuff is way better than opi topcoats and sally Hansen so its not too bad but I have high expectations. I will give it a try again maybe one coat top coat wait 10 mins then add another? It does go nice over chunky glitter. I have it on my toes now over opi pink yet lavender and it now has a really smooth surface and nice shine. Nothing chips on my toes for at least 3 weeks. I love how it&#x27;s as free of as many chemicals as possible so I will gladly use it on my toddler. Robin Moses loves this product but uses acrylic paint to do nail art with so I can see how that combo works well and sticks good for her customers. It just seems too risky to ruin all my hardwork with a top coat that won&#x27;t seal it in for very long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nail tech and this product is amazing.  It really wears like a gel polish and amazingly drys in 5 mins...even when used over other brands of polish.  It&#x27;s now my go to top coat</li>
            <li> Excellent top coat super fast dry time the only downside it that it&#x27;s not a high gloss finish. I would order again</li>
            <li> Love love love this product. Works great with other nail products</li>
            <li> Dries unbelievably fast and I&#x27;ve not had it chip ever. Pricey but absolutely worth the purchase. It brings vibrancy to acrylic artwork too.</li>
            <li> Works great! Quick drying, not too noxious smelling, nails are shiny and strong after application. Dazzle Dry is advertised as vegan/cruelty-free (hooray!). Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Dazzle Dry Top Coat is only another top coat which lasts no longer or resists chipping any more than other brands.  Would not buy again or recommend.  The only difference is the cost, which is too much for what  it does/does not do.</li>
            <li> OK, a friend told me about this stuff and it actually works.  nails dry faster and stay without chips longer.  I&#x27;ve actually gone 11 days between polish...</li>
            <li> This product is a huge disappointment. I will begin with what it does well...dry quickly with a decent shine and no horrible smell. I love how fast this stuff works but I was very annoyed that this stuff is no better than Seche or any Sally Hansen top coat that I have used. First time out to bat, it lifted some color off of my nail. I was careful to blot the brush with a paper towel to not turn the remaining product pink. The second time I used this, it smeared some nail art. The third time using this product with more nail art, I let the design dry even longer and still a smear and lifting of some color. Mind you that I do my own nails, so nail art takes me a bit more time; thus, the drying time for each time was at least 10 minutes, 25 at the most. Now, the real disappointment. MAJOR shrinkage the next day and chips within a few days. I used this stuff with Seche base coat, Revlon Color Stay Gel Smooth base coat, Essie&#x27;s First Base, and even Orly Bonder and none of them made a difference. I used this stuff with Sephora, Orly, Essie, OPI, Julep, Zoya, Layla, ELF, Sinful Colors regular, Sinful Shine with gel tech, their leather look colors,Maybelline&#x27;s Color Show and Express Finish polishes, Revlon Color Stay, Nika K, Wet &amp; Wild, Essence Colour &amp; Go, Klean Colors and a few varieties of Sally Hansen colors and believe me when I tell you, no combination of bases or polishes worked with this stuff. The last time I used it before,  this review, was last Thursday the 12th. I needed to redo my nails due to chips and shrinkage galore on Saturday but couldn&#x27;t due to my work schedule. I am going through this bottle faster than any body&#x27;s business because I am needing to redo my nails every two to three days. I never had to do that with Seche or Sally Hansen Insta- Dry. Heck, even the Sephora top coat I picked up at Big Lots allows for a good four or five days. I have resolved myself to never buying anymore Seche Top Coat because I can&#x27;t take the smell, but I just can&#x27;t bringmyself to spend another $15 on this when I get better result from products that I can pick up at Walgreens. Sigh....the last time I was this disappointed in a top coat was when I tried the Julep Freedom Polymere Top Coat. I wanted to love that one as much as I wanted to love this one. I don&#x27;t mind spending money on a product but this was too much &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; for the money.</li>
            <li> great product for sealing your nails and making the nail polish last longer.  Drys quickly and leaves gell like top coating</li>
            <li> Great top coat, I have only been using this product for 3 weeks, but the nails seem to last longer.</li>
            <li> This is the best topcoat I have ever used I would recommend it to everyone I wish it was sold closer to where I live</li>
            <li> Dries hard as a rock in 6 minutes. (though  avoid hot water for 30 minutes). This is the only top coat you&#x27;ll ever need.&lt;br /&gt;It protects your design and seals the edges, preventing chips.  Great shine.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.  It dries in five minutes and keeps my polish looking great even when I have to miss a manicure. Great shine and protection over regular nail polish. Looks like gel polish finish.</li>
            <li> Dried shiny, and glossy!!!  I used the Dazzle Dry Top Coat as the final step in my Gel Nail System instead of the Top Coat that came with my Gel products, and it worked great!!!  But, unlike the GEL Top Coat it didn&#x27;t require the Lamp, nor did it leave a sticky residue, it was dry and shiny!  I love that!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it would really dry in 5 minutes but it really does. Keeps my nails from chipping longer as well.</li>
            <li> i like dazzle dry top coat because it dry so fast and it makes your nails real shinny and last all week.</li>
            <li> Best ingenious idea and truly dries fast like magic!</li>
            <li> dries your polish to a hard finish in just a few minutes.  I would recommend it to others.  I am very pleased with it</li>
            <li> Top coat does not last as long as they say the product does.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this,  but it falls short of my expectations. I&#x27;m not a professional nail tech, but do spend a significant amount of time and money on my own nail art. I was hoping that the lasting &amp;#34;rock hard&amp;#34; finish would be the real deal, but am left disappointed. It is super shiny and does dry in the promised 6 minutes or less, but peels and chips in a day. As far as rock hard....notsomuch</li>
            <li> Loved it when it was used on my nails at a salon but after I bought it, I found it leaves a spongy feel to nails.  It also got thick in the bottle very quickly.  It seems you would have to use it often to use it up without this happening.  For the price, I&#x27;ve found other products I prefer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is THE BOMB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really does dry the nail in a very short time 3 minutes, you can touch it after about 5, NO WORRIES! good to go.  I used to paint my nails at night with normal top coats and they would be &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; but then I&#x27;d go to bed and wake up with crease marks in my nails since I sleep with my hands under my pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No worries with Dazzle Dry!</li>
            <li> This polish is okay.  It gives off a nice shine, but it seems to remove your color polish a little, which gets on the brush and back in your bottle.  It does dry fast, which is a plus -- but for some reason it smears nail designs.  It also clouds up stones placed on the nail.</li>
            <li> I ruined several natural nails from too long exposure to acetone nail polish remover and too frequent buffing to remove gel polish I put on with a UV or LED light (Sensationail, Gelish).  The nails are finally growing out. I would never use gel polish again but hate the long drying times for regular polish, which also chips easily as well, especially if you type a lot on a keyboard like I do. Dazzle Dry is the answer! I am astounded at how rock hard your natural nail will be with this system. It protects nails and allows them to grow out longer and stronger, PLUS it does not contain the harsh chemicals of other brands, and it removes in a flash.  You can change your polish more than once a week if you wish, or if you want a longer-lasting manicure for at least a week, Dazzle Dry will last. I do find that it helps to put a fresh coat of their wonderful topcoat over the polish every few days, as it rejuvenates the shine and makes your manicure look like new. Easy to use, great system. I am SOLD and will NEVER go back to gel polish again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think its any better than seche vite which is cheaper.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about seche vite is that towards the end it gets very gloppy but it works better after you do a design.  Dazzle dry tends to sear the design if you apply it too soon and the seche vite doesn&#x27;t.  I probably will not order it again.  Its costly and not worth it.  sorry but that is the way I feel.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a huge Youtube nail DIY account that I frequently watch. Of course I bought it right away. I knew it wasn&#x27;t a fast dry like Seche Vite so I sat and waited for the polish to dry. Six solid minutes later my polish still wasn&#x27;t dry and it seemed to make the layers of color under it tacky even though they were already dried when I applied the top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish began to chip less than 2 days later. These two days were days I was off from work and did no major cleaning at all so I can&#x27;t say I was ringing register for hours and this is why it chipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick with Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> It does what it says. Drys to the touch in 1 min and totally dry in 5 min. I love it. Yes it is expensive. But you get what you pay for. The removal was easy. They wearing power is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Love how easy it is to use dazzle dry.</li>
            <li> Robin Moses was right, this is one of the best top coats out there. Dries SUPER fast, lasts a long time! I work an office with paper and usually wear of the tips of my polish pretty fast within a week. I&#x27;ve noticed if I use this stuff, that they don&#x27;t come off! I LOVE this and will make this my main top coat from this point forward!</li>
            <li> This stuff dries solid in 5minutes to a gel finish. Great for nail art designs. Stamping and nail foils. Love it!</li>
            <li> Dries your polish in 10 mins! Worth the money! They use this at the salon I go to. It&#x27;s a great thing too have for a busy gal.</li>
            <li> This topcoat is great. It dries within 1 min. stays on very well. I have acrylic nails. Never peals or chips. Smell is like other polish. It stays liquid in bottle after months, ulnike sec he vite.</li>
            <li> Not only does this topcoat dry quickly, but it forms a chip-resistant finish to your nails. In 5 minutes you&#x27;re dry.</li>
            <li> Wish I could give 5 stars because I love this line of polish. Its amazing.  Seriously dry in 2 min or less. But...issue is top coat gets sticky and thick very quickly. So horrible to use after about half the bottle is gone. I guess we r suppose to buy their thinner. This is not an inexpensive line of polish. So to spend even more $$ to be able to use remaining top coat is ridiculous!! They really should include thinner with each top coat purchase. Kinda bad business I think. And I love this stuff. But dont purchase much anymore because I never have usable top coat...sorry and sad!</li>
            <li> This is the WORST product I have ever purchased.  I painted my nails and within 2 hours they were chipping.  Within 4 hours, two of my nails had no color left.</li>
            <li> Normal polish only stay&#x27;s on my nails for one day, this helped last 2 day&#x27;s.  I was told it would help keep it on up to a week.</li>
            <li> I love this! Dries quickly (2 min), is cruelty-free/vegan, and doesn&#x27;t have a negative impact on wear time (4 days). It is also self-leveling and leaves a super glossy, smooth shine. I can even put it straight on top of wet polish, allowing me to finish an entire manicure in 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/2016: I still love this product! It&#x27;s been two years, and I&#x27;ve yet to find a better product. For a while, I considered switching brands because (as a quick-dry product) it got too thick to use, very quickly. However, with Dazzle Dry&#x27;s polish thinner, a single bottle can last me a year, and I do my nails at least every other week. The top coat itself is worth it, as is their polish thinner.</li>
            <li> I went from protecting my nails for hours after painting them to being back in business after just 15 minutes. It doesn&#x27;t hold up as long as my old topcoat and that is the one downside. I used to go almost two weeks between painting my nails. Now I get chips after a week.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but also I love the way this company is the way they packing it was UAO</li>
            <li> Best top coat I have ever used. I have been a manicurist for 26 years. This dries faster and keeps a shine more than others I have used.</li>
            <li> This top coat applies beautifully and dries hard as a rock in just a few minutes so you can get on with your life. Final result is a manicure that is smooth like glass :)</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff! Does it keep nails from turning yellow over light polish and the,sun? Is there a SPF in it?</li>
            <li> While this top coat dries rock hard within minutes,  it does not hold up. Instead of chipping it kind of like peels off. If you don&#x27;t work or have anything excessive to do this would be ok for you! I&#x27;ll stick with OPI! Holds up well.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff !! Finally a fast drying top coat that does what it says. Your nails will really be dry and ready to go within minutes. This top coat has not extended my wear time at all but the company says you will see the full benefit when using their entire system and I have not done this.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this again !!</li>
            <li> I have a baby and pretty much gave up on the hope of having painted nails for the next year or so. This changed that. It drys crazy fast. Naturally if you put on a really thick coat it will take longer but if you do think coats, think 5 minutes to dry, thicker you might want to give it 15. That is something I can squeeze into the baby&#x27;s nap time.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best non UV topcoats I have ever tried.  It provides wonderful protection and shine to your nails.</li>
            <li> I have had this top coat on my nails for going on 3 weeks.  My manicure has grown out at  the cuticle area and the polish is still in tact and shinny,  Thanks for this wonderful top coat.  It really protects the polish and makes the nails much stronger.</li>
            <li> It really does dry nail polish quickly but product dries up and becomes unusable when get to the half empty mark.  Not worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I could never keep polish on for more than two days before it would chip.  I used this with the bottom coat and my nails stay perfectly for over a week.</li>
            <li> Really fast shipping !!! Thank u! Will be purchasing again soon! This would be the first time I&#x27;ve used this product. And I&#x27;ve been waiting for it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great service. I am a nail stylist of 14 years and I always used another brand. I was told by another nail stylist about this and it is fantastic. It dries in seconds and also leaves a great shine. As well as it doesn&#x27;t chip  my clients nails still look great a week later. A must have at my station.</li>
            <li> Best Top Coat Nail Dry on the market.  I have been doing Nails for 34 years.  And this is the only top coat I will use.  If I use anything else my customers have a fit.</li>
            <li> Best topcoat I&#x27;ve ever used. Thick and super glossy when dry and without the health warnings of Seche Vite. Works well over my  Zoya polishes.</li>
            <li> Drys quick.  Helps regular polish last longer.</li>
