    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I also find that it conditions just wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I have taken to mixing it with another conditioner for best results.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is wonderful.</li>
            <li>23R was off the charts awesome!  </li>
            <li>and this is a great product to boost the ego of someone my age.</li>
            <li>Using both is great but this conditioner has the color depositing and retaining formula.</li>
            <li>I use Feria Cherry Crush, and for about 1 week, the color is awesome and the most amazing color...</li>
            <li>I wanted to give it a boost and had heard good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>price wise</li>
            <li>so I also use a good leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Nonetheless, it&#x27;s a great color boost between dye jobs :)</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Need to buy more as I am almost out!</li>
            <li>It smells great, is sulfate free and lathers like a dream.  </li>
            <li>Ah well, live and learn, lol!</li>
            <li>I keep my hair a bright copper, but even so, I was worried when I read reviews that the Madder Root color was too strong.</li>
            <li>I just condition it after I rinse out the Madder, easy peasy watch out for this ginger!</li>
            <li>Clairol Nice &#x27;n Easy 110)</li>
            <li>When i was introduced to this product years ago I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I used L&#x27;Oreal Excellence Crème Triple Protection Color Crème 6R Light Auburn to color my hair, so you know what kind of Auburn</li>
            <li>It can stain if you leave a spot of it on your shower wall, so be sure you watch out for that.    </li>
            <li>I do not use it every day, maybe 2 to 3 times a week at most.</li>
            <li>it works great, doesn&#x27;t stain, and I won&#x27;t have to color my hair nearly as often to maintain a nice auburn shade.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to use it in addition to your regular conditioner.</li>
            <li>There is a much better alternative:  </li>
            <li>I Love this product for my hair.</li>
            <li>Smells great, gently boosts the color of my hair without dying my skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li>bought this because I wanted more of a copper color to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have found this will work best if I leave in the conditioner for several minutes.  </li>
            <li>If they bottled that better than gold stuff</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try more shampoos.  </li>
            <li>Until then, I&#x27;m coloring my hair more often.  </li>
            <li>If someone has a trifck for it would love to know.</li>
            <li>If not, I&#x27;ll be back at the salon paying a lot more for corrective color!!!</li>
            <li>Its the most sadest thing to see how aweful this one is compared to their original Annatto.</li>
            <li>On some people, the dye seems to be quite strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably fine for people with a dye job.  </li>
            <li>but my shower seems to be just fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had red hair (colored) for over a decade, which always fades - this does a great job at kicking it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This conditioner works great both as a color enhancer and as a hair conditioner (some products really only enhance color but leave hair feeling just as if you hadn&#x27;t conditioned).  </li>
            <li>Great product because I have coarse/curly hair and get it chemically relaxed and therefore do not want to use chemicals to color my red hair, which has some gray</li>
            <li>I read a ton of Aveda Madder Root reviews and it seemed like it would be great especially from Aveda.  </li>
            <li>Success!  </li>
            <li>, I was originally turned off by the price, but it is worth it!</li>
            <li>- that&#x27;s precisely why I love it so much.  </li>
            <li>and they are now bright red...</li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves my hair soft and shiny, and gives it a nice color boost.  </li>
            <li>This is the only good thing I can say about it.  </li>
            <li>Most don&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>but my hair won&#x27;t be nearly as healthy looking and vibrant as when I use Tressa Watercolors shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would invest in the madder root products, both the conditioner and the shampoo, as  a means of keeping my color looking good as long as I could.</li>
            <li>It does a great job helping my hair stay vibrant and hold the red forever.</li>
            <li>Maybe I left it on too long, didn&#x27;t work it through my hair evenly, or something, but it wasn&#x27;t the greatest effect.</li>
            <li>Always test to see how your hair reacts first!</li>
            <li>I think it really works!!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know about the woman who said it doesn&#x27;t smooth or detangle very well</li>
            <li>4 stars for keeping my color fresh, but -1</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so many compliments and it looks really natural; even my dad said it looks just like my childhood hair color.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, gives nice red highlights to brown hair.  </li>
            <li>Neither happened - and it added beautiful light-to-medium red tones to my hair which look natural, and it was very conditioning.  </li>
            <li>A lot of the products I have used in the past, to keep the color bright, are no longer available.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that tangles easily, and my hair ALWAYS feels much softer &amp; is easier to comb through when I use this, as opposed to any other conditioner.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t notice anything but after a few more uses, I was able to see the difference.</li>
            <li>A MISTAKE -- sure enough</li>
            <li>I use the Madder Root most often - especially now that my hair is darker.  </li>
            <li>My first use</li>
            <li>I got lovely red tones thru my foiled hair, but</li>
            <li>My second use (with the comb) was much more even.  </li>
            <li>in an amusing wedge shape (forehead to the top back and down the sides) since I neglected to bring a comb into the shower with me.  </li>
            <li>I bought this at the store after seeing the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>This pretty much burned a hole in my wallet just to ruin my two-day-old hair color.</li>
            <li>looks great on dark red hair.</li>
            <li>I tried leaving it on for more and more time but it either had no effect at all or the results were too subtle to really make much difference.</li>
            <li>When you open the bottle up for the first time, you know it wouldn&#x27;t be a good one, just the color of the conditioner alone gives you a heads up its pink.</li>
            <li>I am really hoping it will wash out, but I have no guarantees.  </li>
            <li>This product does really seem to help keep my color in longer.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.  </li>
            <li>much prefer the Aveda products.  </li>
            <li>As a standalone conditioner, however, it doesn&#x27;t do the job of smoothing or detangling very well.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this conditioner smells.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t add much color to my auburn hair and it didn&#x27;t hydrate very well either.  </li>
            <li>I feel it works really well as both a conditioner and color depositor.</li>
            <li>The product really boosts the colour of my hair and adds shine.  </li>
            <li>Tangles really easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t believe the reviews, but maybe they&#x27;ve never experienced an excellent red shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I go to an Aveda salon and recently had my natural dark brown color lifted and replaced with a beautiful light and vibrant red.</li>
            <li>Others are right about it not having much condition properties but the way I look at it is that I want that dollop in my hand to be jam packed with natural pigment, not fillers.</li>
            <li>I have to re-dye my hair (major bummer) and then try again with a different brand and hope for better results.    </li>
            <li>I use this following the Aveda Madder Root shampoo, and while it does a good job locking in the color, it leaves my hair less than silky.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because my red hair color is extremely hard to keep fresh and bright</li>
            <li>I use my regular conditioner afterward and my hair is shiny and full of body.  </li>
            <li>It is true, do not use on blonde or lighter coloured hair as it will look like Kool-aid.  </li>
            <li>Amazon indicates that the list price is over $20, but most Aveda salons and the Aveda website indicate that it is less than this.</li>
            <li>The store associate told me the less porous the better</li>
            <li>amd leave it in for a half hoir or so for better results.</li>
            <li>I have never colored my hair before, but now that I&#x27;m 46 my formerly vibrant copper-red hair is fading.  </li>
            <li>My natural hair color is light blonde, and I colored it auburn using home color (</li>
            <li>Especially red which fades so quickly.  </li>
            <li>and my hair is staying vibrant.</li>
            <li>I use this to help my dyed red hair keep from brassing up so quickly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for someone looking to bring out more red in their hair or for someone with dyed red hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the shampoo, but skip the conditioner.</li>
            <li>just know you may have to bleach your tub a little more often &amp;</li>
            <li>My color is now completely changed, much darker and opaque looking.</li>
            <li>Then go about styling your hair normally.</li>
            <li>as someone who has been dying my hair red for years, I am well aware that red fades quickly.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner works very, very well for gently depositing major color, especially if your hair&#x27;s already chemically treated.</li>
            <li>so I was hoping that this conditioner could add some pretty red tones and would keep my color lively.  </li>
            <li>It extends my color and highlights it naturally!</li>
            <li>The red dades out quick as red is known to do.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the color is not natural looking, but rather a bright pinkish-red!  </li>
            <li>In my case it was a sort of unnatural color, and only in certain areas.</li>
            <li>I am a natural redhead.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner has really helped the life of my red hair color.</li>
            <li>Use amount proportionate for your hair thickness and length in order to get a natural look.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like it</li>
            <li>Red hair fades so fast.  </li>
            <li>This does not seem to leave my hair as soft as I would like</li>
            <li>The color enhancer 2 week refresh packet that was included in Clairol Natural Instincts</li>
            <li>It enhanced my color with the very first use and I will continue to use it as long as my hair is red.  </li>
            <li>I use that with the Tressa watercolor shampoo in Molten Bronze, and together they put just enough red in my hair to take it back to the true auburn</li>
            <li>I kept it on my hair for 5 minutes the first time before rinsing it out, and there was absolutely no change.</li>
            <li>I recently started dying my hair more red and my stylist suggested that I get this conditioner as well as the aveda madder root shampoo to help the red stay as long as possible since it&#x27;s the quickest color to fade.</li>
            <li>, the product turned my golden streaks PINK!!  </li>
            <li>It smelled really lovely, but I will try other products that cost less.</li>
            <li>My hair ranges from a dark strawberry blonde to a light copper red.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong, but I mixed it half and half with my regular conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not empty yet.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair soft and it makes a coloring last a lot longer.</li>
            <li>When used with the shampoo from this line and an extra leave in conditioner, my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Tressa Watercolors shampoo comes in several red shades and when left on for 10-15 minutes really adds a lot of color to red hair.  </li>
            <li>I have natural blonde highlights in the front, especially when I&#x27;ve been in the sun...</li>
            <li>So...it does work, and only with one washing/conditioning, but don&#x27;t use it if you want to revive your natural red hair.  </li>
            <li>I got this to help put the natural red that has faded out over time back in my hair, and I can see why some people said this stuff dyed their hands or showers.</li>
            <li>Do not use this if your hair is not very dark or very red!  </li>
            <li>I got a few drops on my white bathroom tiles and it rinsed right off; it did not stain my skin or my white bath towel.  </li>
            <li>At first I did not know if this conditioner is helping me, but Its been a few months since I got highlights, and red color hasn&#x27;t faded, and I still get compliment on my red highlights.  </li>

            <li> I am really hoping it will wash out, but I have no guarantees.  </li>
            <li> This product does really seem to help keep my color in longer.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  </li>
            <li> much prefer the Aveda products.  </li>
            <li> As a standalone conditioner, however, it doesn&#x27;t do the job of smoothing or detangling very well.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this conditioner smells.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t add much color to my auburn hair and it didn&#x27;t hydrate very well either.  </li>
            <li> I feel it works really well as both a conditioner and color depositor.</li>
            <li> The product really boosts the colour of my hair and adds shine.  </li>
            <li> Tangles really easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe the reviews, but maybe they&#x27;ve never experienced an excellent red shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I go to an Aveda salon and recently had my natural dark brown color lifted and replaced with a beautiful light and vibrant red.</li>
            <li> Others are right about it not having much condition properties but the way I look at it is that I want that dollop in my hand to be jam packed with natural pigment, not fillers.</li>
            <li> I have to re-dye my hair (major bummer) and then try again with a different brand and hope for better results.    </li>
            <li> I use this following the Aveda Madder Root shampoo, and while it does a good job locking in the color, it leaves my hair less than silky.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my red hair color is extremely hard to keep fresh and bright</li>
            <li> I use my regular conditioner afterward and my hair is shiny and full of body.  </li>
            <li> It is true, do not use on blonde or lighter coloured hair as it will look like Kool-aid.  </li>
            <li> Amazon indicates that the list price is over $20, but most Aveda salons and the Aveda website indicate that it is less than this.</li>
            <li> The store associate told me the less porous the better</li>
            <li> amd leave it in for a half hoir or so for better results.</li>
            <li> I have never colored my hair before, but now that I&#x27;m 46 my formerly vibrant copper-red hair is fading.  </li>
            <li> My natural hair color is light blonde, and I colored it auburn using home color (</li>
            <li> Especially red which fades so quickly.  </li>
            <li> and my hair is staying vibrant.</li>
            <li> I use this to help my dyed red hair keep from brassing up so quickly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for someone looking to bring out more red in their hair or for someone with dyed red hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the shampoo, but skip the conditioner.</li>
            <li> just know you may have to bleach your tub a little more often &amp;</li>
            <li> My color is now completely changed, much darker and opaque looking.</li>
            <li> Then go about styling your hair normally.</li>
            <li> as someone who has been dying my hair red for years, I am well aware that red fades quickly.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner works very, very well for gently depositing major color, especially if your hair&#x27;s already chemically treated.</li>
            <li> so I was hoping that this conditioner could add some pretty red tones and would keep my color lively.  </li>
            <li> It extends my color and highlights it naturally!</li>
            <li> The red dades out quick as red is known to do.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the color is not natural looking, but rather a bright pinkish-red!  </li>
            <li> In my case it was a sort of unnatural color, and only in certain areas.</li>
            <li> I am a natural redhead.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner has really helped the life of my red hair color.</li>
            <li> Use amount proportionate for your hair thickness and length in order to get a natural look.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like it</li>
            <li> Red hair fades so fast.  </li>
            <li> This does not seem to leave my hair as soft as I would like</li>
            <li> The color enhancer 2 week refresh packet that was included in Clairol Natural Instincts</li>
            <li> It enhanced my color with the very first use and I will continue to use it as long as my hair is red.  </li>
            <li> I use that with the Tressa watercolor shampoo in Molten Bronze, and together they put just enough red in my hair to take it back to the true auburn</li>
            <li> I kept it on my hair for 5 minutes the first time before rinsing it out, and there was absolutely no change.</li>
            <li> I recently started dying my hair more red and my stylist suggested that I get this conditioner as well as the aveda madder root shampoo to help the red stay as long as possible since it&#x27;s the quickest color to fade.</li>
            <li> , the product turned my golden streaks PINK!!  </li>
            <li> It smelled really lovely, but I will try other products that cost less.</li>
            <li> My hair ranges from a dark strawberry blonde to a light copper red.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty strong, but I mixed it half and half with my regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not empty yet.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair soft and it makes a coloring last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> When used with the shampoo from this line and an extra leave in conditioner, my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Tressa Watercolors shampoo comes in several red shades and when left on for 10-15 minutes really adds a lot of color to red hair.  </li>
            <li> I have natural blonde highlights in the front, especially when I&#x27;ve been in the sun...</li>
            <li> So...it does work, and only with one washing/conditioning, but don&#x27;t use it if you want to revive your natural red hair.  </li>
            <li> I got this to help put the natural red that has faded out over time back in my hair, and I can see why some people said this stuff dyed their hands or showers.</li>
            <li> Do not use this if your hair is not very dark or very red!  </li>
            <li> I got a few drops on my white bathroom tiles and it rinsed right off; it did not stain my skin or my white bath towel.  </li>
            <li> At first I did not know if this conditioner is helping me, but Its been a few months since I got highlights, and red color hasn&#x27;t faded, and I still get compliment on my red highlights.  </li>
            <li> This is the first conditioner I have used that ACTUALLY deposits red; that being said, it is kinda hard to get even with the front tending towards a brighter red than the rest.</li>
            <li> What I really like is that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so I usually try to squeeze out as much water as possibly before applying the conditioner after using just a regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> , this does a fabulous job on covering the gray without looking fake and makes my coarse hair silky.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair though, so the results may be different for someone with oily hair.</li>
            <li> Less frequent trips to the salon.</li>
            <li> But I was curious about this product after an Aveda salon stylist recommended it and showed me how it keeps her red hair staying red for longer.</li>
            <li> On that note my stylist said to be careful as the colour may penetrate into the grey roots if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> I guess I am ready for Halloween now, but overall, it is NOT a good look for the office or elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> I have dark hair that when I dye my hair red its basically just a tint of red, but I keep trying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aveda&#x27;s color conditioners for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Complete waste of money</li>
            <li> Otherwise if you use Aveda Madder Root, only use if you like Pink Hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Length: Long.</li>
            <li> After a week or so, cut back to every other day, and eventually, just once a week.   </li>
            <li> IT WILL DIE ANY OTHER COLOR IN YOUR HAIR RED.</li>
            <li> After using this for the past few times I have dyed my hair, my hair has not faded out as it did the first time I dyed it without using Aveda&#x27;s Madder Root shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Which may seem like a long time to wait, but i use that time to do other things like shave my legs.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that Aveda made a horrible business decision that cost them a great loss of money by getting rid of the Annatto color conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am walking around with pink highlights in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I like to use this a few times a week to keep my color up so that I can stretch the time before having to go back and get another color.</li>
            <li> I do recommend keeping a wide toothed comb in the shower to brush your hair after applying the conditioner.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m writing this in case someone tries to do what I did.</li>
            <li> dyes my scalp pink, leaves pink highlights and is streaky.</li>
            <li> I have had marginal results with other Aveda products but there are so few products on the market specifically made for red hair that I figured I&#x27;d give this conditioner a try anyway.  </li>
            <li> (The conditioner&#x27;s not greasy, so I never had a problem using other products with it.)</li>
            <li> This conditioner on the other hand smells like cleanser,</li>
            <li> The other was made by Goldwell.  </li>
            <li> My thinking was if I take this Madder Root and combine it with the Aveda Clove, that it would tone down the PINK which I noticed the reviews were complaining about.</li>
            <li> Beware - the color can be slightly orange if not rinsed well, and it will stain, so be careful with it if you have porous bathroom surfaces/towels.</li>
            <li> and I add this at least once a week to my red roots and even my stylist commented on how well my hair held the color.</li>
            <li> :  Soft thin hair strands and lots of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair hangs all the way down my back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The down side of this product is that it can leave color splotches in your hair.  </li>
            <li> Not a good one for red hair.</li>
            <li> : After you shower, leave a little of the conditioner on your hair and comb it through evenly.</li>
            <li> Repeat this every day for a week, always using just a little bit of the Madder Root.</li>
            <li> it just makes the color very flat and not a good shade.</li>
            <li> Two Notes: It does make the shower floor look a little messy --</li>
            <li> I had been using this conditioner without incident until a few weeks ago, when I had some foils put in.  </li>
            <li> A few things that I found helpful</li>
            <li> AND it dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> This product evens out color if you have highlights growing out, or even a few gray strands.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking at this product but was worried from other reviews that it would turn my hair a weird color or stain my white bathroom.  </li>
            <li> AVOID unless your hair is dark!!</li>
            <li> it usually runs 17 to 20 at salons or websites.</li>
            <li> The price of Aveda products usually keeps me away.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this has not seemed to make a difference in retaining the red in my dyed hair.</li>
            <li> But i do recommend at least finger combing it through the hair to saturate the strands and leaving it on for 4 or 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I am afraid to go back to the salon and have my stylist see the destruction.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to keep the artificial color in red hair, then I recommend you try Tressa.  </li>
            <li> Comb through and leave in for at least one minute to maximize color.</li>
            <li> I mean.</li>
            <li> Really ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> They MEAN it!  </li>
            <li> So sad....</li>
            <li> Difficult to get through your hair evenly.</li>
            <li> Sad, very sad.</li>
            <li> I just hope it washes out soon. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> It just looks awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Do not use this if your hair is not very dark or very red!  My hair ranges from a dark strawberry blonde to a light copper red.  I had been using this conditioner without incident until a few weeks ago, when I had some foils put in.  OMG WHAT A MISTAKE -- sure enough, the product turned my golden streaks PINK!!  Yes...I am walking around with pink highlights in my hair.  I guess I am ready for Halloween now, but overall, it is NOT a good look for the office or elsewhere.  I am really hoping it will wash out, but I have no guarantees.  AVOID unless your hair is dark!!</li>
            <li> I am a natural redhead.  I have never colored my hair before, but now that I&#x27;m 46 my formerly vibrant copper-red hair is fading.  I wanted to give it a boost and had heard good things about this product.  Unfortunately, the color is not natural looking, but rather a bright pinkish-red!  I have natural blonde highlights in the front, especially when I&#x27;ve been in the sun...and they are now bright red...NOT the color of real red hair.  So...it does work, and only with one washing/conditioning, but don&#x27;t use it if you want to revive your natural red hair.  It&#x27;s probably fine for people with a dye job.  I just hope it washes out soon. :(</li>
            <li> as someone who has been dying my hair red for years, I am well aware that red fades quickly.  Brass doesn&#x27;t suit me.  When i was introduced to this product years ago I fell in love with it.  It keeps my red looking red.  And allows me to redye every 6 weeks instead of every 3 or 4.  I use it about once or twice a week.  I also find that it conditions just wonderful.  But i do recommend at least finger combing it through the hair to saturate the strands and leaving it on for 4 or 5 minutes.  Which may seem like a long time to wait, but i use that time to do other things like shave my legs.      price wise it usually runs 17 to 20 at salons or websites.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aveda&#x27;s color conditioners for a long time.  I use the Madder Root most often - especially now that my hair is darker.  I&#x27;ve had red hair (colored) for over a decade, which always fades - this does a great job at kicking it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about the woman who said it doesn&#x27;t smooth or detangle very well - that&#x27;s precisely why I love it so much.  I have very fine hair that tangles easily, and my hair ALWAYS feels much softer &amp; is easier to comb through when I use this, as opposed to any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair a bright copper, but even so, I was worried when I read reviews that the Madder Root color was too strong. I kept it on my hair for 5 minutes the first time before rinsing it out, and there was absolutely no change. I left it on for 15 minutes the next time, and again nothing. Finally I left it in overnight and it restored some color to my faded hair. Success!  A few things that I found helpful: After you shower, leave a little of the conditioner on your hair and comb it through evenly. Then go about styling your hair normally. (The conditioner&#x27;s not greasy, so I never had a problem using other products with it.) Repeat this every day for a week, always using just a little bit of the Madder Root. After a week or so, cut back to every other day, and eventually, just once a week.   Always test to see how your hair reacts first! On some people, the dye seems to be quite strong. I&#x27;m naturally a blonde, but for some reason, my hair doesn&#x27;t hold color well. 4 stars for keeping my color fresh, but -1 for the effort it took!</li>
            <li> This conditioner has really helped the life of my red hair color.</li>
            <li> I used this with the Madder Root Shampoo.  This pretty much burned a hole in my wallet just to ruin my two-day-old hair color. I know someone who dyes her hair using one of those redder (such as Feria) type reds and for her it works well. I ended up with kool-aid-ish red highlights from this AND it dried my hair out. Also my recent red coloring was to the purpose of blending my roots with my bleached hair, so while the formerly bleached part went really red the roots actually lost color (or seemed to by comparison). Complete waste of money and now I&#x27;m scared of trying a different one. I have to re-dye my hair (major bummer) and then try again with a different brand and hope for better results.    F.Y.I. I used L&#x27;Oreal Excellence Crème Triple Protection Color Crème 6R Light Auburn to color my hair, so you know what kind of Auburn I mean.</li>
            <li> This product evens out color if you have highlights growing out, or even a few gray strands. I use it on brunette hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works great both as a color enhancer and as a hair conditioner (some products really only enhance color but leave hair feeling just as if you hadn&#x27;t conditioned).  It can stain if you leave a spot of it on your shower wall, so be sure you watch out for that.    Amazon indicates that the list price is over $20, but most Aveda salons and the Aveda website indicate that it is less than this.</li>
            <li> Great product because I have coarse/curly hair and get it chemically relaxed and therefore do not want to use chemicals to color my red hair, which has some gray, this does a fabulous job on covering the gray without looking fake and makes my coarse hair silky. I am 65 and this is a great product to boost the ego of someone my age. Use amount proportionate for your hair thickness and length in order to get a natural look. I do not use it every day, maybe 2 to 3 times a week at most.</li>
            <li> If I could rate this product a zero I would. I go to an Aveda salon and recently had my natural dark brown color lifted and replaced with a beautiful light and vibrant red. I thought I would invest in the madder root products, both the conditioner and the shampoo, as  a means of keeping my color looking good as long as I could. I used both products once and left the conditioner on for about two minutes. My color is now completely changed, much darker and opaque looking. I am afraid to go back to the salon and have my stylist see the destruction. Not only is my hair darker but, it also browned out my red in several areas. It just looks awful. I am hoping it will wash out.. If not, I&#x27;ll be back at the salon paying a lot more for corrective color!!! I&#x27;m really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> This product does really seem to help keep my color in longer. What I really like is that a little bit goes a long way. I&#x27;ve had this bottle for months now and I&#x27;m not empty yet. I do recommend it is used with another conditioner, because it isn&#x27;t as conditioning. I have dry hair though, so the results may be different for someone with oily hair. Overall I really like it, I was originally turned off by the price, but it is worth it! Less frequent trips to the salon.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is light blonde, and I colored it auburn using home color (Clairol Nice &#x27;n Easy 110) but it started to fade a lot after only one week.  I had been looking at this product but was worried from other reviews that it would turn my hair a weird color or stain my white bathroom.  Neither happened - and it added beautiful light-to-medium red tones to my hair which look natural, and it was very conditioning.  I got a few drops on my white bathroom tiles and it rinsed right off; it did not stain my skin or my white bath towel.  I think the key steps are to comb it through as the directions suggest - I use a wide-tooth comb - and to rinse it out thoroughly.  I leave it in about 5 minutes.  I have not tried it with the Madder Root Shampoo; when I asked about it at the Aveda salon, they told me it wasn&#x27;t necessary.  I use Aveda Color Conserve shampoo.  If you are thinking about trying this product, definitely do it - it works great, doesn&#x27;t stain, and I won&#x27;t have to color my hair nearly as often to maintain a nice auburn shade.</li>
            <li> Red hair fades so fast.  A lot of the products I have used in the past, to keep the color bright, are no longer available.  This product works very well.  I do have to leave it on longer than others I have used to get the deeper effect, but it works well.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair soft and it makes a coloring last a lot longer. Especially red which fades so quickly.  I like to use this a few times a week to keep my color up so that I can stretch the time before having to go back and get another color.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Bumble and Bumble red product set, and the Aveda Madder Root product set (shampoo and conditioner) at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer the Aveda products.  This conditioner leaves my hair soft and shiny, and gives it a nice color boost.  Beware - the color can be slightly orange if not rinsed well, and it will stain, so be careful with it if you have porous bathroom surfaces/towels.</li>
            <li> They MEAN it!  My first use I got lovely red tones thru my foiled hair, but in an amusing wedge shape (forehead to the top back and down the sides) since I neglected to bring a comb into the shower with me.  My second use (with the comb) was much more even.  The conditioner is a bit orange-red toned, but I believe if it is combined with the Madder Root shampoo (I think) there is a balancing that occurs.</li>
            <li> I have ombre hair that melts from copepr red to platinum blond and I add this at least once a week to my red roots and even my stylist commented on how well my hair held the color. Two Notes: It does make the shower floor look a little messy -- just know you may have to bleach your tub a little more often &amp; IT WILL DIE ANY OTHER COLOR IN YOUR HAIR RED. So if you have highlights that are blonde it WILL turn them RED!!!! It will also die your hands temporarily (for a couple of hours max you may have a red tinge). Just know what you are getting into.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works very, very well for gently depositing major color, especially if your hair&#x27;s already chemically treated. As a standalone conditioner, however, it doesn&#x27;t do the job of smoothing or detangling very well. It&#x27;s best to use it in addition to your regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this conditioner smells.  This is the only good thing I can say about it.  It didn&#x27;t add much color to my auburn hair and it didn&#x27;t hydrate very well either.  I bought this product because my red hair color is extremely hard to keep fresh and bright so I was hoping that this conditioner could add some pretty red tones and would keep my color lively.  I tried leaving it on for more and more time but it either had no effect at all or the results were too subtle to really make much difference. I have had marginal results with other Aveda products but there are so few products on the market specifically made for red hair that I figured I&#x27;d give this conditioner a try anyway.  Save your money!  There is a much better alternative:  Tressa Watercolors shampoo comes in several red shades and when left on for 10-15 minutes really adds a lot of color to red hair.  It enhanced my color with the very first use and I will continue to use it as long as my hair is red.  It smells great, is sulfate free and lathers like a dream.  I use my regular conditioner afterward and my hair is shiny and full of body.  If you&#x27;re trying to keep the artificial color in red hair, then I recommend you try Tressa.  I will use up this Aveda conditioner because it was pricey but my hair won&#x27;t be nearly as healthy looking and vibrant as when I use Tressa Watercolors shampoo.  Ah well, live and learn, lol!</li>
            <li> I Love this product for my hair. Keeps my hair color longer! I use the Aveda shampoo along with it also!</li>
            <li> I got this to help put the natural red that has faded out over time back in my hair, and I can see why some people said this stuff dyed their hands or showers. It&#x27;s pretty strong, but I mixed it half and half with my regular conditioner. I use that with the Tressa watercolor shampoo in Molten Bronze, and together they put just enough red in my hair to take it back to the true auburn it was when I was a kid. No problems with it dying my shower or my hands if I wash them afterwards.  I&#x27;ve had so many compliments and it looks really natural; even my dad said it looks just like my childhood hair color.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair that when I dye my hair red its basically just a tint of red, but I keep trying. The red dades out quick as red is known to do. I bought this at the store after seeing the positive reviews. I feel it works really well as both a conditioner and color depositor. People have complemented my hair asking me if I just dyed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will tint your fingers and possibly your forehead but my shower seems to be just fine. The store associate told me the less porous the better so I usually try to squeeze out as much water as possibly before applying the conditioner after using just a regular shampoo. I do recommend keeping a wide toothed comb in the shower to brush your hair after applying the conditioner. Then I put it up with a hairband so it doesnt wash out. When I have the time I&#x27;ll even walk out of the shower amd leave it in for a half hoir or so for better results.</li>
            <li> I use this following the Aveda Madder Root shampoo, and while it does a good job locking in the color, it leaves my hair less than silky. Comb through and leave in for at least one minute to maximize color. I have taken to mixing it with another conditioner for best results.</li>
            <li> Not a good one for red hair. Its the most sadest thing to see how aweful this one is compared to their original Annatto. NOTHING compares. I&#x27;d say that Aveda made a horrible business decision that cost them a great loss of money by getting rid of the Annatto color conditioner. My thinking was if I take this Madder Root and combine it with the Aveda Clove, that it would tone down the PINK which I noticed the reviews were complaining about. No, it didn&#x27;t work that way, when you combine this with the Clove it just makes the color very flat and not a good shade. So I&#x27;m writing this in case someone tries to do what I did. Otherwise if you use Aveda Madder Root, only use if you like Pink Hair. When you open the bottle up for the first time, you know it wouldn&#x27;t be a good one, just the color of the conditioner alone gives you a heads up its pink. Sad, very sad. AVEDA you need to bring Annatto Back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It does give a bit of a red tint. In my case it was a sort of unnatural color, and only in certain areas. Maybe I left it on too long, didn&#x27;t work it through my hair evenly, or something, but it wasn&#x27;t the greatest effect. I will keep using it and hope for improvement.</li>
            <li> I like the way my hair looks with this product looks great on dark red hair. Others are right about it not having much condition properties but the way I look at it is that I want that dollop in my hand to be jam packed with natural pigment, not fillers. I just condition it after I rinse out the Madder, easy peasy watch out for this ginger!</li>
            <li> I bought this on recommendation from my hair stylist.  I use this once my hair starts fading in colour, which is about a week or two before my next appointment.  The product really boosts the colour of my hair and adds shine.  On that note my stylist said to be careful as the colour may penetrate into the grey roots if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> It is a stain, so go on to the Aveda website and read the recommendations from users.  Love it!  It extends my color and highlights it naturally!</li>
            <li> The price of Aveda products usually keeps me away. But I was curious about this product after an Aveda salon stylist recommended it and showed me how it keeps her red hair staying red for longer. It indeed that for me as well, but I will probably not buy this product again. It smelled really lovely, but I will try other products that cost less.</li>
            <li> At first I did not know if this conditioner is helping me, but Its been a few months since I got highlights, and red color hasn&#x27;t faded, and I still get compliment on my red highlights.  I think it really works!!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is wonderful. Smells great, gently boosts the color of my hair without dying my skin. This conditioner on the other hand smells like cleanser, dyes my scalp pink, leaves pink highlights and is streaky. I highly recommend the shampoo, but skip the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this has not seemed to make a difference in retaining the red in my dyed hair. I use Feria Cherry Crush, and for about 1 week, the color is awesome and the most amazing color...then it starts to fade to that brassy red/blondish color:( Was hoping this would help retain/put in color, but I have seen no difference in the amount of time it takes my hair to fade.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li> Very red!  It is true, do not use on blonde or lighter coloured hair as it will look like Kool-aid.  Otherwise, gives nice red highlights to brown hair.  Only downside is that it seems to wash out fast-maybe in about three days, if used once.</li>
            <li> Before I review this product, let me tell you some stats about my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color: Naturally red with blonde highlights.&lt;br /&gt;Type:  Soft thin hair strands and lots of it.&lt;br /&gt;Length: Long. My hair hangs all the way down my back.&lt;br /&gt;Styling Tools: None&lt;br /&gt;Tangles: Tangles really easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I wanted more of a copper color to my hair.  At first I didn&#x27;t notice anything but after a few more uses, I was able to see the difference. The down side of this product is that it can leave color splotches in your hair.  This is why I keep a comb in my shower.  I have found this will work best if I leave in the conditioner for several minutes.  This does not seem to leave my hair as soft as I would like so I also use a good leave in conditioner.  When used with the shampoo from this line and an extra leave in conditioner, my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to keep my red hair from fading in between colorings. I&#x27;m using this once a week and my hair is staying vibrant.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner about once a week on my naturally red hair. It enhances the color and adds a bit of brightness and depth but never makes it look unnatural or dyed.</li>
            <li> I recently started dying my hair more red and my stylist suggested that I get this conditioner as well as the aveda madder root shampoo to help the red stay as long as possible since it&#x27;s the quickest color to fade. I highly recommend it for someone looking to bring out more red in their hair or for someone with dyed red hair.</li>
            <li> I have red hair but this conditioner brings out and adds deeper tones of red in my hair. I always receive compliments when I use it.</li>
            <li> This is the first conditioner I have used that ACTUALLY deposits red; that being said, it is kinda hard to get even with the front tending towards a brighter red than the rest. Nonetheless, it&#x27;s a great color boost between dye jobs :)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I&#x27;m a connoisseur of red enhancing shampoo and conditioners.  Most don&#x27;t do much.  Stay away from John Frieda too.  My two favorites both have been discontinued.  The color enhancer 2 week refresh packet that was included in Clairol Natural Instincts 23R was off the charts awesome!  I called Clairol.  They said they no longer include because women didn&#x27;t use it and didn&#x27;t know what to do with it.  Really ridiculous.  They didnt ask me.  If they bottled that better than gold stuff I&#x27;d buy in bulk.  The other was made by Goldwell.  I read a ton of Aveda Madder Root reviews and it seemed like it would be great especially from Aveda.  It didn&#x27;t do much.  Don&#x27;t believe the reviews, but maybe they&#x27;ve never experienced an excellent red shampoo.  I&#x27;m going to try more shampoos.  Until then, I&#x27;m coloring my hair more often.  So sad....</li>
            <li> Difficult to get through your hair evenly. If someone has a trifck for it would love to know. I always look as if I have 2 differant colors going.</li>
            <li> I use this to help my dyed red hair keep from brassing up so quickly. It does a great job helping my hair stay vibrant and hold the red forever. After using this for the past few times I have dyed my hair, my hair has not faded out as it did the first time I dyed it without using Aveda&#x27;s Madder Root shampoo and conditioner. Using both is great but this conditioner has the color depositing and retaining formula. Need to buy more as I am almost out!</li>
